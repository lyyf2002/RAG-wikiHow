Do not disturb the mother or her babies.,
Continue to supply her with food and water.,
Keep the mother separated.",How to Take Care of a Hamster That is Giving Birth3," You will know the mother is in labor when you hear little squeaks coming from the cage. Be very careful to not intervene during this process. The mother will give birth in 10 to 30 minute intervals. Either way, it can happen quickly, or take several hours.


If you disturb the mother, this can cause her to stress and possibly harm one of her babies., The birthing process requires a lot of energy from the mother. Make sure the mother has a constant supply of water and is continually fed a high protein diet throughout the entire process.Make sure the water bottle and food bowl are easily accessible for you so you can re-supply them without disturbing the mother. Do not resupply during or right after the labor process. Wait a couple hours before checking and resupplying.

, The mother is fertile again 24 hours after birth. Therefore, for the safety of the mother and her babies, do not put other hamsters back in the cage. Generally, you want to minimize contact with the mother for up to two weeks. Hamster babies will be mature enough to leave their mother at three to four weeks of age.


If you keep the babies longer than four weeks, make sure to remove the babies from the mother before eight weeks of age. Remove the babies into gender specific living groups, unless you want an explosion of hamster babies.At eight weeks, the hamsters will be able to reproduce and could possibly reproduce with the mother.

Place your hamster’s cage in a good location.,
Give your hamster time to adjust to your home.,
Approach your hamster’s cage with care.,
Stand near his cage.,
Do not handle him.,
Work with your hamster when he is alert.,
Wash your hands.,
Acclimate your hamster to your hand.,
Pick up your hamster.,
Hold your hamster for short periods of time.,
Do not let your hamster fall.,
Return your hamster to his cage.",How to Make Your Hamster Trust You," Allowing your hamster to acclimate to his new environment is an important building block to gaining his trust. Finding a good location for your hamster’s cage will ease his acclimation. A warm room is ideal for your hamster,especially if it is draft free.The room should not be very busy with human activity—this may be bewildering or frightening to your hamster.Your bedroom is usually not a good place for a hamster cage, since your hamster is nocturnal and will make a lot of noise while you sleep.;
, Give your hamster at least a few days to acclimate to his new surroundings. During this time, your hamster will start familiarizing himself with where things are in his cage (food, water, sleeping area).


Do not be concerned if your hamster is washing his face or grooming himself excessively. These are not signs of nervous tension, as is commonly believed. Rather, he is scent marking and claiming his new territory.Scent marking allows your hamster to recognize places and items in his new home., Your hamster will probably see you as a huge predator at first. You do not want to confirm his perception of you by approaching his cage in a threatening manner. Instead, your approach should be slow and quiet, with no sudden movements or noises.Try talking to him in a low and soft voice when you get near to, and reach, his cage., During those first few days of acclimation, your hamster may hide in his cage when you approach it.He may still be very wary of you and his new surroundings. Over time, though, your hamster should relax enough to do normal hamster activities, such as exploring his cage, when you are nearby.Talking to him in a low and soft may help him relax and be comfortable with your presence.
You do not need to stand by his cage for long periods of time. Try standing there for a few minutes at a time to see how he reacts to you.
Once you see him going about his normal business when you are nearby, continue talking to him. The sound of your voice will continue to help him adjust.
Consider offering him treats when you are near his cage.Place them in the bottom of his cage, since he will probably not be ready to take them from your hand.

, It is very important that you not touch your hamster during his adjustment period. Acclimating to his new home will be hard enough without you trying to handle him and pick him up. Talking to him and being near his cage will be sufficient.

, Once your hamster is adjusted to his new home and your presence, you can gain his trust by handling him properly. He will be more receptive to working with you when he is fully awake and alert, which is in the evening.Do not wake your hamster up to work with him. If he is sleeping deeply, being woken up suddenly can cause him to jump into defensive mode,which could lead to you being bitten or nipped at.
If he is busy doing something else when you approach his cage, get his attention by lightly tapping on the cage, moving his water bottle, or softly talking to him., Clean hands are important to handling your hamster. If your hands smell like food, your hamster will see your hands as food and will probably try to bite them.Be sure to wash your hands with unscented soap—even a fruit-scented soap could cause your hamster to bite your hands.If you have multiple hamsters, wash your hands between handling each one. The smell of one hamster on your hands would lead the next hamster to believe he is being attacked., Your hamster will trust you when he can trust that your hands will not harm him. With your hands freshly washed, slowly place one of your hands in the bottom of his cage. Allow him to explore your hand by smelling it.Do not be surprised if your hamster runs and hides when you first place your hand in his cage. From his perspective as a prey animal, your hand reaching into his cage could resemble a large bird swooping down to scoop him up.Rest your hand in a non-threatening way, with your fingers curled. Spreading your fingers out could make your hamster think he’s being attacked.Do not pull your hand away if he starts to nibble on it. His nibbles are a way of exploring your hand. If you suddenly pull your hand back, you could frighten him and make him more wary of your hand.Try offering him treats, talking to him, or stroking his back as he becomes more comfortable with your hand.Eventually, he will take your treats from your hand., When your hamster is comfortable with your hand, slowly reach into his cage with both hands. Hold your hands like a scoop and wait for your hamster to walk into your hands. Support him with both hands as you slowly lift your hands out his cage.Have him face you when you lift him up—he will know what’s happening to him and will be less likely to jump.Your hamster may become skittish and jump off your hands when your hands are still in the cage—let him do so.If he seems agitated, calm him down by giving him a treat and/or stroking his back.Talking to him in a soothing voice could also calm him down.
Your hamster may squeal when you pick him up, signaling that he’s annoyed with being held.If he continues to squeal, gently place him back in his cage and try to pick him up at a later time.
If you are having trouble picking him up with your hands, place an empty mug in his cage and let him climb into it.When he has crawled into the mug, gently ‘pour’ him out of the mug into your hands.

, Being held by you can be stressful for your hamster. Try holding him for a minute or two initially, then slowly increase the amount of time each time you pick him up. Aim for handling him for about five minutes a day.


Hold him close to your body and stroke his back and forehead.When he is more comfortable with being held, sit or lay on the floor and let your hamster crawl and climb on you., When you pick up and hold your hamster, do not let him fall. Hamsters have poor eyesight and no depth perception,so your hamster will have no sense of how or low he is from the ground. In addition, your hamster could injure himself if he gets spooked and tries to jump out of your hands when you have him out of his cage.

, After a few minutes, or when he begins to get agitated, place your hamster back in his cage. Just as you picked him up, use slow and gentle movements to set him back in his cage.Try to set your hands on the bottom of his cage before letting him out of your hands.
Give him a treat when you place him back in his cage.

, When your hamster is confident enough to eat beside your hand, put the food in the palm of your hand. It may be some time before the hamster will eat from your hand without fear. When it does, you can stroke it gently with one finger along its back, the way the fur grows. Never stroke its head.

, When it is eating from your hand, cup the other hand over it, and lift it gently a little way of the ground for a few moments at a time.

, After a few more days, if your hamster seems happy being lifted up, you can take it right out of the cage in your cupped hands.

Allow it some time to acclimatize to its new cage and bedding. Experts recommend that you don’t try to handle a new hamster for the first 12 – 24 hours., This gets the hamster used to being touched making it is less likely to bite you. A Q-tip or the blunt eraser end of a pencil works well for this.


Softly speak to your hamster while you are doing this to soothe it and let it hear your voice.
Repeat this several times a day for a few days. When it ignores the eraser or starts gnawing it, the hamster is ready for the next step., Hamsters have very poor eyesight and use their sense of smell to interact with the world. You should wash your hands with unscented soap to remove any residual scents of food or other pets from your skin.


This is especially important if you have other pets, particularly hamsters.
Your hamster may get the “scent” of another hamster from your hand and think it is being attacked by that hamster. It may bite., This engages your hamster's interest while getting it used to the presence of your hand. A very small chunk of apple works well for this. Put your hand in the cage and let the hamster come up and sniff around it.


Let the hamster gently nibble your hands if it is not uncomfortable. This is not generally a display of aggression as hamsters like to probe and test the world around it with their teeth.Repeat with different treats each time to keep the hamster’s interest., It may climb on your hand, but do not try to cup your hands around the hamster or pick it up at this stage.


Just let your hand lie limply on the cage floor.
Outstretched fingers may be perceived as an attack by the hamster., Do this with your hands still in the cage. Keep your hands low to the ground so that if the hamster jumps out of your hand it won’t fall far.


Cup with your bottom hand and place the other hand over the top to create a ""hand cave."" , Only do so if the hamster appears suitably relaxed in your hands.


Remember that being outside the cage can be very stimulating for the hamster so choose somewhere quiet with minimal distractions.
If it seems agitated or starts biting, put it back in the cage and try again some other time.

, The more you play and pet with your hamster, the more friendly and tame it will become.


Neglected hamsters that have not been handled for an extended period of time can revert back to their fearful nature and may bite when picked up.You may have to go through the steps to get it used to being picked up again.

, Put your index fingers below its neck lightly and your thumbs on top of the hamster's body.


If you are wary of lifting the hamster out of the cage with bare hands, use a cup or a small bowl to get it out of the cage.Disposable plastic cups work well for this.

, Hamsters have relatively few defenses in the wild and they are wary of sudden changes in their environment.Even if your hamster is tame and used to being held, don’t grab it from its cage out of the blue.
Always allow it to see your hands for a couple of seconds first.

, Be aware that hamsters are nocturnal. You will generally have to wake them up to play with them during the day.


Gently move their nest and allow them a minute to wake up.Alternately, you can call softly to your hamster to wake it up.

, Hamsters recognize you by scent. A strong perfume or cologne may confuse them. Avoid strongly fruit scented soap when you wash your hands as your hamster may think your hand is food and try to bite it.

, Hamsters, because of their small size, are extremely fragile. Never ever squeeze your hamster.


Be particularly gentle in the area just below the forelegs.
Pressure to this region can prevent the hamster breathing.Supervise young children when they are playing with hamsters. Teach them to be gentle with the animal., Hamsters can make sudden leaps from your hand and a fall to the ground from a height could injure them. Make sure you are always sitting down with your hamster, so that if it escapes it will fall into your lap. Alternatively, hold it over a table., In the wild, hamsters spend most of their time burrowing deep underground.Hamsters like to feel hidden. They might enjoy being wrapped up in a towel in your lap or put in your shirt pocket while you watch TV., Even tame hamsters will bite if they are startled or frightened. They may also bite if they have the scent of food on your hand. Wash and disinfect the area around the bite and cover with bandage to stop the bleeding. If the bleeding doesn’t stop or it doesn't begin to heal within a few days, go to your doctor.Hamster bites are not generally serious and they do not transmit diseases such as rabies.
Some people can be allergic to hamster saliva, although this is relatively rare.

, Hamsters do not respond well to physical punishment. Never strike or yell at it.


If a hamster bites, the best way to stop it is by gently blowing on its face. The hamster will rear back and squint because its sense of smell is affected.Yelling or pulling your hand away quickly is likely to make the hamster more frightened and it may bite down harder."

Look for anything that needs cleaning at least once everyday, even if it's not a scheduled cleaning day. Cleaning your hamster's cage too often or too little can cause them undue stress, so make sure you are cleaning the right amount when needed.


Look for any droppings or wet areas in the bedding material. You can spot remove some areas. However, if there are a lot of them you should change the bedding.
Pick out any leftover food that your hamster may have left laying around the cage.
Change the water daily. If the bedding material has become soaked or damp near the water dispenser, you may want to change the bedding out.
If the walls of the enclosure are looking dirty or smudged, it may be time for a full cleaning.
If the cage smells you must clean it fully. Hamsters have a very sensitive sense of smell and can fall ill if the cage is unclean or the air quality is too poor.;

Take out any toys or exercise equipment.

, The last thing you need to remove from the cage will be the bedding. The bedding is where your hamster leaves its waste, resulting in what can be a strong ammonia scent which can cause respiratory problems for your hamster. Make sure to remove all of the bedding to make the most of the cleaning.You may want to seal the old bedding in a waste bag of its own to lock in any smells.

, Although it may not appear dirty, you will want to clean every toy, exercise station, food and water bowls, and any other thing that is housed in your hamster's cage.

Hamster cages may vary in their construction, however, the same general cleaning tips apply to all types of hamster cages.Use your disinfectant solution and cloth to scrub the cage clean.
Some areas may have bedding stuck to the cage wall. These may need to be scraped away or scrubbed vigorously to remove.
Soaking problem areas of the cage can help break them up and allow for easier removal.
If your cage is a wire or mesh cage, make sure to clean each bar.
Some cages are aquariums and these will require you to completely clean each surface and corner.

, Before you can put the cage back together, you will need to let the cage dry. Adding new bedding before the cage is fully dry can cause the bedding to become wet, resulting in it needing to be cleaned again faster than normal.You can towel dry the cage and items if you want to hurry the process up.
Leaving the cage in the sun can help it dry faster. Sunlight can also help to disinfect the cage, due to its UV light rays.

React properly if your dwarf hamster bites you.,
Do not stick your hand in your dwarf hamster’s cage.",How to Tame a Dwarf Hamster," Dwarf hamsters look cute and cuddly, so you may want to hold your dwarf hamster right away. However, when you bring him home, he will need some time to get used to his cage. Give him a day or so to explore his environment and learn where things are in his cage.The more comfortable he is in his cage, the easier it will be for you to tame him.


During this time, your dwarf hamster will also start learning your activities and movements around your home.;
, As your dwarf hamster is adjusting to you and his cage, spend time near his cage without interacting with him. For example, sit by his cage and watch TV or read a book.He should be comfortable with your calm and quiet presence before you start taming him.

, Once your dwarf hamster has settled in for a few days, start talking to him so he can get used to your voice. If you have a Russian dwarf hamster, talking to him will be very important, since he can’t see very well. When he knows your voice, he will be less likely to bite you when you pick him up.Even if you don’t have a Russian dwarf hamster, your hamster will appreciate hearing the sound of your voice.


When you talk to him, use a quiet and gentle voice.

, Hamsters are nocturnal animals, meaning they are active at night. Choose a time later in the day, such as after dinner, when he is most likely to be awake. If you notice he is just waking up, give him about 15 minutes to be awake before trying to hold him.If your dwarf hamster is sleeping, do not wake him up. If you do, he may be startled, think you are a threat, and try to bite you.Wait until he wakes up on his own.

, Before you handle your dwarf hamster, wash your hands to remove any food scents. If your hamster smells food on your hands, he will think your hands are food and nibble on them.Use unscented soap to wash your hands., Make a cup with your hands and slowly lower them into the cage. Speak to him as you lower your hands so he knows you are there and are not a threat.Do not make any sudden movements or loud noises as you place your hands in his cage—this could startle him.If your dwarf hamster is not readily walking onto your hands, consider putting some tasty treats in your hands to lure him to you.
If treats don’t work, try using a scoop or a large serving spoon. Hold the item on the cage floor and let him walk onto it (don’t scoop him up). After you lift him out of the cage, transfer him to your hands., When your dwarf hamster is nestled comfortably in your hands, slowly lift him up towards you. If you can, turn his body in your hands so he is facing you. Looking at you will help him feel less disoriented and scared about being lifted up.When you have him out of the cage, let him crawl on you. Exploring you will help your dwarf hamster feel more comfortable with you.Be as still as you can while he climbs and crawls on you.
Consider sitting or lying down so he can crawl on you more easily.

, Taming your dwarf hamster requires daily practice. Hold him a few times a day for 5 minutes each time.With daily practice, your dwarf hamster will become more tame and easier to handle.


Consider holding him at the same time each day. That way, he knows when to expect you.

, Your dwarf hamster may bite or nibble on your hands as you tame him. A dwarf hamster will bite if he feels threatened or scared. He may also bite if he’s bored in his cage or not feeling very well.Nibbling is a dwarf hamster’s way of testing and exploring things in its environment.Your dwarf hamster’s bite wouldn’t be enough to cause bleeding, but it could startle you.A nibble would feel lighter than a bite.

, If your dwarf hamster bites you, blow in his face. This puff of air will be unpleasant to him but won't hurt him. He’ll get the message not to bite you anymore.Even if the bite startles you, do not drop him—the fall could injure him.Putting some more toys in his cage, such as empty toilet paper or paper towel rolls, can relieve his boredom and possibly stop the biting behavior.
If extra toys or blowing in his face are not stopping the biting, take him to your vet for a checkup., Russian dwarf hamsters can be very territorial. If you have a Russian dwarf hamster, he may have a strong reaction to your hand in his cage and try to bite it, especially if he doesn't know you're nearby.Be extra careful when putting your hands in his cage.


Your hand will look huge compared to his small body size. He will see your hand as a threat to his territory."

Identify the sex of your hamster.,
Note if she has been around any male hamsters.,
Note the age of the hamster.,
Rule out illness.,
Look for a swollen belly.,
Watch for nest building.,
See if she hoards food.,
Look for signs that she’s about to go into labor.,
Take your hamster to the vet.,
Do not ever touch the mother’s belly to try to feel the babies.,
Feed the mother a nutritious diet during pregnancy.,
Leave the mother alone starting around day thirteen after mating.,
Keep other hamsters in separate cages.,
Do not handle the babies for two weeks.,
Reposition sipper tubes.,
Start placing solid food for the babies at 7-10 days.,
Take the litter to the vet immediately if you notice the mother abandoning them.",How to Know when Your Hamster Is Pregnant," It might seem obvious, but like humans, only a female hamster can become pregnant. Most people will already know the sex of their hamster, but just in case you don’t, visit How to Sex a Hamster for more information on determining whether or not your hamster is female.


Safely scruff your hamster (hold it by the loose skin just above the shoulders firmly but without pinching), and turn the animal gently over to check its sex. Males will have prominent testicles just around the tail that make their rumps bulge, whereas female will lack this and instead have much more prominent pairs of nipples on the underside.
If you’ve always simply assumed that your hamster is female because it had a typically female name when you bought it, then you should probably check.
Note that if you think your hamster is pregnant due to a swollen belly, then she’s already to a part of the pregnancy where you should refrain from touching her due to the stress handling causes in the late stages of pregnancy.;
, The average length of a pregnancy for a hamster is 15-21 days, so your hamster would need to have been housed with a male hamster within roughly the last three weeks in order to be pregnant.If she hasn’t had company in more than four weeks, then she cannot be pregnant.

, Hamsters can start breeding from as young as 6-7 weeks of age.The only way to rule out pregnancy due to sexual immaturity of the hamster is if she is even younger than six weeks.


This also means you need to be careful storing hamsters from a litter together once they approach six weeks old because they will start mating together. This includes any male hamsters with the mother.

, A swollen belly alone isn’t nearly enough to identify a pregnant hamster. A swollen belly can actually be a sign of another illness or condition affecting your hamster. Possible illnesses that may result in a pregnant appearance include:Pyometra, which is a womb infection that distends the hamster’s tummy with pus
Enlarged internal organs such as the liver or spleen, which are likely the result of cancer
Heart disease, which can lead to the accumulation of fluid in the belly
Bowel problems distending the belly with waste due to improper food digestion
You may notice other signs of sickness with several of these, including increased thirst (her drinker may empty faster than usual), decreased appetite (note if you’re filling her food bowl less often), and loss of body fat (usually over the ribs).

, This may have been your first indication that your hamster is pregnant, but in case it wasn’t, watch to see if her tummy begins to grow. If she’s eating, drinking, and exercising as normal and has had a chance to mate, then the swollen belly is a very probable sign she is pregnant.


Note that a hamster likely won’t “show” her pregnancy until the final third of the gestation (day 10+), so you may be less than a week away from her delivering the litter by the time you notice the bump.She will also have enlarged nipples around the same time her belly swells. However, enlarged nipples on a small hamster can be difficult to see, so don't worry if you can't spot them beneath the fur.Handling her during the late stage of her pregnancy will upset her, though, so don't pick her up to look at the nipples.

, A pregnant female will want to build a nest late in pregnancy, so collecting bedding material together and taking it to a secluded place in the cage can be a hint of pregnancy., The pregnant female may start to eat marginally more than usual, and also hide more food away, perhaps in the nest. Obviously, in itself this does not confirm pregnancy but it does help to build the overall picture.

, Your hamster may become even more frantic in the very late stages of her pregnancy. Signs of imminent birth include becoming restless and alternating between eating, grooming, and nest building. She may also hiss at you if you reach in.

, If all else fails, your vet will be able to help you identify whether or not your hamster is pregnant. However, your vet will also likely warn you that even being handled by a professional animal care provider can still lead to the environmental stress that may cause the mother to abandon or cannibalize the litter.


If the swollen belly lasts longer than 7-10 days without your hamster giving birth (or if she doesn’t exhibit any of the other common behavioral traits for a pregnant hamster in this time), then take her to the vet anyway since she may be presenting symptoms of an illness rather than pregnancy.

, Pregnant females are extremely sensitive to disruption, and if they feel stressed, they are highly likely to harm the babies when they are born. Having a human feel her belly is definitely stressful to a female hamster, so it puts the health of the babies at risk.

, Be extra sure that your hamster's diet is nutritionally sound to ensure the health of the babies. Feed a diet she is familiar with, as sudden changes could upset her stomach. However, an ideal diet is pelleted rat or mouse chow since she cannot selectively eat around the healthy (but less tasty) bits.


Very small quantities of milk and cheese provide calcium for the done development of the litter, and they also help the mother in lactation once the babies are born.As an additional protein source, you can feed your hamster moderate amounts of hard-boiled egg, nuts, barley, and oats.Though you must provide them in very small amounts (or risk gastrointestinal problems), pregnant hamsters can benefits from the additional vitamins and minerals found in fruits and vegetables, such as broccoli, cucumber, cauliflower, apples, grapes, bananas, and strawberries., Female hamsters like to be left completely alone at least a couple of days before giving birth. This means that by day thirteen after mating, you should not even interfere with her cage or bedding. Be as careful as possible when putting fresh food in with her as well. Failure to do this could lead to cannibalization of the newborn babies.Since you may not have any idea when the mother mated, consider that she usually starts “showing” the pregnancy around day ten after mating., In addition to a stressed mother hamster potentially cannibalizing her litter, other hamsters kept in the same cage can lead to the same result. To ensure the safety of the baby hamsters, begin housing other hamsters you have in separate cages as soon as you know for sure that the mother is pregnant.


If hamsters kept in the same cage begin fighting despite usually getting along, this is also a sign that one of them may be pregnant if it appears in association with some of the other signs.

, During the first two weeks, the mother will recognize her babies by scent. If you handle the baby hamsters, even by accident, the mother may attack them. It is safe to begin handling them after roughly two weeks.This also includes accidentally transferring your scent from other handling of the cage. Don’t try to clean the cage during this period., Remember that your water sipper is probably placed at a height for your adult hamster. Reposition it if you need to so that the litter can also reach it to drink., Though they won’t be fully weaned until around three weeks, you can start placing solid food in the cage after 7-10 days. You can use a standard pellet diet, but soak the pellets in water first to soften them for the litter., Especially if it’s the mother’s first litter, she is more likely to abandon or cannibalize the litter due to environmental stressors.If this is the case, separate the mother from the litter immediately and take them to the vet. He or she will likely suggest a local rescue or animal hospital capable of helping care for the abandoned litter.

Make the bulk of her diet carbohydrates and fats.,
Serve up protein.,
Be sure you offer a variety.,
Offer treats in addition to a healthy diet.,
Give a small piece of vegetable or fruit daily.,
Offer hard dog or cat biscuits occasionally.,
Try other treats.,
Understand natural hamster eating habits.,
Don't worry about overfeeding.,
Keep fresh water in the cage.",How to Make Your Own Organic Hamster Food," She uses these for energy and to stay warm. While this is what she will eat most of the time, don't overfeed her on just this category or she can become overweight and ill.Organic bird seed, unsalted raw sunflower seeds, dried corn, unsalted nuts, unsalted and unsweetened nut butters, cooked potatoes, and grains of all kinds are great sources of carbs and fat for her diet.;
, Your hamster requires protein from a natural source, and luckily you can find most of these options in organic, pesticide-free varieties in local stores. Hamsters need about a teaspoon of protein-rich foods two or three times a week.


You can feed your hamster organic chicken, turkey, or eggs to provide the needed protein for her diet.Cook it thoroughly but do not season it with salt or pepper. Do not serve it hot as it will burn the hamster.
You can also serve your hamster live insects such as mealworms or crickets.You may have trouble finding organic varieties in pet stores, but you can find them from online vendors in select countries.
Other great sources of protein for your hamster also happen to be good sources of carbohydrates, like beans, barley, peas, nuts, oats, or wheat., In order for your pet to get the right blend of vitamins and minerals, be sure to offer fruits and vegetables in many colors and a variety of proteins and grains.Keep track of what she eats and what she rejects. In some cases, if she rejects a particular food it is because she has enough of that particular nutrient in her diet and doesn't need it. If you find that your hamster rejects all of a particular category of food (for instance, all sources of calcium), you might need to invest in a hamster health supplement to prevent deficiencies. These are available at large pet stores or online.

, Think of treats as foods that you don't offer daily but that still play a vital role in your hamster's healthy nutrition.


Never offer any sugary or salted foods or processed human foods. These can't be digested properly by a small rodent and could be deadly.

, There are many organic produce options at your local grocery store that you can give to your pet. If you already eat an organic diet with your family, it is easy to buy a tiny bit more than you need and give a small piece to the hamster when you prepare dinner or lunch for your family every day. Throw away what she doesn't eat so that it doesn't go bad in her cage.


Fruits like apple, banana, melon, or grapes are great choices, but you should not offer them too frequently because of the high sugar content. Every few days is plenty. More frequently, try pieces of vegetables like cucumber, corn on the cob, carrot, peas, celery, broccoli, cauliflower, or beansprouts.Don't offer citrus fruits like lemons, limes, or oranges, and don't offer onions, leeks, chives, or garlic. These types of food are too acidic and can cause stomach issues for small rodents.You should also never offer raw potato, aubergine, or avocado, which are toxic to hamsters., Hamster teeth, like other rodents, grow continually and have to be filed down in order to not overgrow. Hard biscuits made for dogs or cats are perfect for hamsters to keep those teeth from getting too long.Dog and cat biscuits are both available in organic varieties online, or try your hand at making your own: Combine two cups of whole wheat flour, a cup of rolled oats, a tablespoon of dried parsley, and half a cup of powdered milk in a mixing bowl. Add a cup of unsweetened peanut butter, two large eggs, and half a cup of water, and stir to combine. Shape the dough into dog-biscuit sized logs and bake for about fifty minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit.Experiment by adding different types of seed or nut butters and other healthy additions like flax seed, millet, or different types of whole grain flour.

, Your hamster may love some of your healthy foods like whole wheat organic bread, organic unsweetened cereal, organic scrambled eggs, and organic uncooked pasta.Just remember not to serve any foods to your hamster with added salt or hot from the oven!

, In the wild, hamsters are omnivores, which means they eat both meat and vegetation regularly. They forage for food and eat a diet consisting of a variety of seeds, insects, and plants. If you want to make your own hamster food, you have to be sure that you include nutrients from all of these categories, as well as a balance of carbohydrates, fats, and other vital nutrients.


The best way to ensure that your hamster is getting all the right nutrients is to serve a diet that varies every day and includes grains, seeds, herbs, vegetables, protein, nuts, and treats. You can create a hamster mix using organic ingredients, or you can simply offer a small amount from each category of foods every day.
Be sure that your hamster's menu includes protein, carbohydrates and fats, vitamins, minerals, and water. The first four elements of a healthy diet will be discussed in more detail in the next step.

, For the most part, a hamster will not eat more than he needs to survive. Most eat about a tablespoon worth of food every day, so be sure to add a steady supply of fresh food to his cage daily.Hamsters will also instinctively eat more of what they need and leave behind some of what they don't. If your hamster always ignores particular food, offer less of it and more of what he eats., Water is a huge part of a hamster's diet, and a hamster with the healthiest organic diet will still become dehydrated and die if she doesn't have enough water. Don't neglect hydration in your pursuit of a healthy and organic diet.


Keep a hamster water bottle full of clean water in the cage. Change the water every day.Don't offer other liquids. Hamsters will get plenty of fluids from fruits and veggies, but straight juice or milk is too strong and contains far too much sugar for a hamster.

Gather your supplies.,
Put your hamster somewhere safe.,
Get rid of old materials.,
Clean the cage.,
Get in a routine.",How to Disinfect a Hamster's Cage1," Being prepared is the first step towards giving your hamster a clean cage. Make sure that you have two sponges--one for cleaning and one for disinfecting. You should use a general household disinfectant for the cleaning. Just make sure to thoroughly rinse the surfaces of the cage after cleaning.Have paper towels or clothes handy so that you can dry the cage.
Use a brush to clean the corners of the cage. A toothbrush works well for getting into small spaces.;
, You need to remove your hamster from his cage during the cleaning process. Ideally, you should have a back-up cage for him to use while you clean. Consider putting your hamster in a different room while you clean, so that the smell of disinfectant does not bother him.If you do not have a back-up cage, consider buying a different type of container for your hamster. A popular choice is a large ball made for hamsters to roll around in. Check your local pet store for these items.
Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly before handling your hamster. This will get rid of any unfamiliar scents and let him get used to your natural scent.

, Once you have safely relocated your hamster, you need to remove old materials from the main cage. Your hamster cage should have a good supply of bedding material. Popular choices are paper, pellets, or alfalfa shavings. Empty all of the soiled bedding into the trash.Empty the food and water containers, too.

, Once the cage is empty, you can thoroughly clean it. Using a clean sponge, use water and a disinfectant to clean all surfaces of the cage. Make sure to follow all directions for the cleaning product you choose. Use a small brush to get into tight corners.Wipe down the cage with a clean, damp sponge after disinfecting.
Dry all surfaces of the cage with paper towels or clean clothes.
Add new materials. After the cage is clean and dry, replace the old bedding with new bedding.
Do not use cat litter or cedar shavings, as these can be harmful to your hamster's health.

, You should get in the habit of thoroughly disinfecting your hamster's cage once a week. Make this a part of your weekly schedule. You should also do general maintenance to care for your hamster each day.Every day you should remove wet or soiled bedding from your hamster's cage.
You should also check daily to make sure that the cage is in good repair, with no holes or loose doors.

"
"
Provide fresh food and water.,
Clean the hamster ball.,
Clean other toys.,
Disinfect all materials.",How to Disinfect a Hamster's Cage2," When you are done cleaning the cage, make sure to clean the water bottle and the food dish. Use the same method you used to clean the other parts of the cage, but use soapy water instead of disinfectant. Once the containers are dry, place them back in the cage with clean water and a fresh supply of food.You can feed your hamster commercial food from your local pet store. Provide about one teaspoon of the seed mix per day.
Use a ceramic food dish instead of a plastic one. Ceramic is more resistant to chewing.
Place the food dish as far as possible from your hamster's bathroom corner. Hamsters are creatures of habit, and also very clean. They prefer their food to be separate from other activities.

, Many hamster owners purchase a clear plastic ball for their hamsters to roll around in. Hamsters enjoy being able to move around and change their viewpoint. The ball is also a great place to keep your hamster safe while you are cleaning her cage. Just make sure to keep it clean.Make cleaning the ball part of your weekly routine. Use a mild soap and water to cleanse inside and outside. Make sure to remove any feces or scraps of bedding that got inside the ball.

, Hamsters can be very active, so it's a good idea to supply them with several toys. One of the most popular options is a running wheel. Running wheels can be purchased at pet supply stores and make a great addition to your hamster's home. During your weekly cage cleaning, take a few minutes to clean the wheel.You can purchase either a plastic or metal wheel. Both can be cleaned with warm water and a mild soap.
Take the wheel out of the cage for cleaning, so that you can easily access all surfaces.

, After you have washed all toys and dishes with clean soapy water, you should use a disinfectant on the toys. It is not necessary (or advisable) to use a disinfectant on food and water dishes. For the toys and the cage, choose a disinfectant carefully.You want a product that is strong enough to kill germs, but safe for your pet. It is a good idea to ask your vet for a recommendation.
If you cannot find a suitable product, you can make your own disinfectant. Make a bleach solution of 1/2 cup bleach to 1 gallon of water.
Apply this solution to all items that your hamster uses. After disinfecting everything, rinse with water.
Thoroughly dry all toys and accessories with paper towels or clean cloths.

Give her a safe space.,
Let him exercise.,
Treat him with kindness.",How to Disinfect a Hamster's Cage3," Hamsters like room to move, so make sure the cage is large enough. Bigger is better, so get the largest cage your space allows. Make sure not to place the cage near a direct heat source or in direct sunlight. You should also keep your hamster in the house, not the garage. The ideal temperature for a hamster is between 65-75 degrees.Make sure that his cage is out of reach of other household pets who might view the hamster as prey.
Remember that hamsters are nocturnal, so you may not want to place the cage in your bedroom.

, Hamsters like to move around. If possible, equip his cage with a wheel for him to run on. If you do not have a wheel, make sure that you take your hamster out of the cage occasionally so that he can roam around. Always supervise your hamster when he is out of the cage. Do not let him scurry under furniture or out the door.

, Remember to be gentle with your hamster. Try to avoid sudden movements or loud noises when you handle him.

Make sure your hamster has a balanced diet.,
Remove uneaten treats.",How to Make Hamster Treats1," Supplementing your hamster's basic diet with treats is fine, as long at the treats you give it are good for it. These are foods that your hamster shouldn't eat on a daily basis but that are good to give it every once in awhile. Some treats that are good to give a hamster include:Sunflower seeds
Alfalfa pellets
Spinach
Lettuce
Apples
Cauliflower
Carrots;
, There are some foods that we keep in our kitchens that can be very bad for hamsters, as their digestive systems are not able to process them. Foods to keep away from your hamster include:Chocolate
Candy
Junk food
Onions
Uncooked beans
Potato
Avocado

, While it is very fun to give a hamster treats that it is excited to eat, your hamster needs to eat a variety of foods. Your hamster's main diet should be a commercial mix that is specially formulated to its dietary needs. Treats, on the other hand, should be given as a small supplement to its main diet.


Give your hamster treats sparingly. There is a reason they are called ""treats.""
Try giving your hamster just one or two treats a day to supplement its normal diet. For example, this means only a small chunk of apple and a small piece of carrot in a day. They really don't need much!, If your hamster doesn't eat all of its treat, you should take it out to the hamster's cage. Your hamster is likely to hide it, where it can become moldy and spoiled.


Hamsters like to hide their food, so an empty dish does not mean that they have eaten everything. When you clean your hamster's cage, be sure to be on the lookout for spots where they have hidden pieces of their food."

Create a dry mix for your hamster.,
Make healthy treats.,
Understand the drawbacks of homemade food.",How to Make Hamster Health Food1," Hamsters should eat a dry mix of food made from a variety of fruits, vegetables, and legumes. If you want to make homemade food for your hamster, mix a variety of dried foods together.


Hamsters, like, humans need carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. These are known as macronutrients and allow the body to function properly. A combination of nuts, seeds, and low starch vegetables are important for a hamster's physical wellbeing.Dry hamster food mixes sold at the store typically contain dried maize, peas, dried fruit, beans, barely, and alfalfa sprouts. You can find dried varieties of these foods at a local grocery store and mix them together for your own homemade hamster food. Hamsters generally need 10 to 12 grams a day of their mix, but your hamster may need more or less depending on his size.Watch for additives. One of the upsides to store-bought food is that it's specifically made for a hamster. Added ingredients in processed food made for humans can be dangerous to a hamster's health. Go for organic products when feeding your hamster, avoiding foods high in preservatives, saturated fats, salt, and sugar.You should always enhance any hamster food you're using, whether store-bought or homemade, with a variety of fresh fruits and veggies. This creates a similar diet to what your hamster would eat in the wild.;
, In addition to healthy food, you should make a variety of healthy treats for your hamster. He'll be happier and more satisfied if he gets a reward on special occasions.


You can make a fun pudding-like treat with banana, honey, raisins, and lemon juice. Mash up a single banana and add a squirt of lemon juice. Then, add a teaspoon of honey and a teaspoon of raisins. Stir together and serve to your hamster.Hamster biscuits can be made with nut spread (like almond butter), cheerios, a variety of finely chopped veggies, fresh bread, sunflower seeds, and a small amount of cheese. Spread a bit of your nut spread on the piece of bread. Stick the cereal and veggies on top. Then, press the cheese around the veggies to create a cover for the food. Place in your hamster's cage., If you want to feed your hamster a homemade diet, talk to your vet first. Most hamsters have store-bought pellets or mixes as the staple of their diet. Such food is fortified with vitamins and minerals necessary to a hamster's health. Discuss your desire to feed your hamster homemade food with your vet before you attempt to do so. You want to make sure your hamster stays healthy without store-bought food.If you have your heart set on making your own food, talk to your vet about vitamins and other supplements for your hamster. This way, you can give him homemade food while making sure he's getting all the nutrients necessary for his health.
You could compromise and give your hamster a mix of store-bought pellets and grains in addition to homemade hamster food and treats.

Wait for the right time to inspect the hamster.,
Consider working over a large bowl or box lined with a towel.,
Scruff the hamster.,
Pick up and turn over the hamster.",How to Sex a Hamster1," To determine sex, you are going to have to look at your hamster's hind end and underside. Your best bet is to wait until the hamster is alert and relaxed to examine it. Grabbing a sleeping or stressed hamster is a good way to get bitten.Try giving your hamster a treat and some attention. Hamsters don’t like being turned upside down (which is exactly what you’re going to do) so petting your hamster and making him or her feel at ease will help this process go smoothly.;
, This will give the hamster a soft place to land if it squirms away from you. It will also keep your hamster contained at the same time, making sure that it doesn't fall and then run away.

, To safely restrain the pet, approach the hamster calmly, and do not startle it. Place the palm of one hand over the hamster with your thumb and forefinger resting right above the shoulder blades. Gently grasp the loose skin just above the shoulders between your thumb and forefinger to control the head and keep the hamster from biting you.Do not pull on the skin or attempt to lift the animal by the scruff alone.Do not grip the scruff too tightly, either, as this can pull back the eyelids and causes the eyeballs to pop out of the sockets.

, Use the rest of the hand to support the animal's body. Using your free hand to support the weight of the hamster, lift the hamster and turn it over so that its body is resting in the palm of the hand you are using to scuff it. Its entire body should be supported at this point.

Gather ingredients.,
Mix all ingredients.,
Mold into the shapes you want.,
Put the treats in the microwave for 4 minutes.",How to Make Hamster Treats2," When making treats for hamsters, it's a good idea to combine their usual food with a few additional ingredients. This recipe as it is should make enough treats to feed to a hamster for several weeks, because they should be fed a limited amount of treats. A combination of these items will give your hamster a little thrill while also giving it excellent nutrition:1 teaspoon sunflower seeds
3 tablespoons hamster food, including pellets and seeds
3 table spoons wholegrain flour
3 tablespoons hot water

, Add all your dry ingredients into a small bowl and stir until well combined. Then add the hot water and mix all of this together until it forms into a sticky consistency.


The mixture should be stiff enough to mold into a loose shape. If the mixture is too watery, add in another teaspoon of wholegrain flour.

, Remember not too big, as your hamster will have difficulty munching on a treat that is too big. Depending on the size you make, this recipe should make at least a dozen treats. Put all your small treats on a microwaveable plate when you are done shaping them.


Try shaping the mix into cute little shapes, such as hearts. This will make watching your hamster eat its treats even cuter.

, At the halfway point (2 minutes), make sure you turn the treats over. This will assure that they are fully cooked on both sides.


Cooking the treats cooks the flour and makes the treat solid.
Be careful when turning the treats over and removing the plate from the microwave. It will be hot!
Alternately, you could bake the treat on a baking sheet for a few minutes at a low temperature. Keep a close eye on them while they are in the oven, as the goal is for them to solidify but not to brown.
Let cool! And then you're done!

"
"
Gather ingredients.,
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.Because you are using eggs with this recipe, it's important to cook the treats thoroughly.,
Grate veggies.,
Beat one large egg in a cup or bowl.,
Put approximately one tablespoon of veggies per cup in a mini muffin baking tray.,
Pour beaten eggs over veggies.,
Bake for 15-20 minutes.The egg treats are done when the egg is thoroughly cooked.",How to Make Hamster Treats3," The ingredients for this treat recipe can vary quite a bit. Basically, you need an egg and a combination of fruits, nuts, and vegetables that your hamster loves to eat. Combining several types of veggies will make the treat extra exciting for the hamster.


Fruits you could use include: apples, bananas, and cantaloupe.
Nuts you could use include: Chestnuts, cashews, pistachios, sunflower seeds, and walnuts.
Vegetables you could use include: broccoli, celery, corn, cucumber, and dandelion leaves.

, A well cooked treat will hold its shape and will not create a gloppy mess when the hamster tries to eat it.

, Choose 1 cup total of 2-3 veggies you have picked out for your hamster. Shred or grate them so that they become very small pieces. This will allow them to combine with the egg easily and will be easier for the hamster to eat.Use whatever type of grater you have. If you don't have a grater, take the time to chop the veggies until they are very, very small.

, You need to beat the egg until the yolk and the whites are thoroughly combined. This will give your hamster egg treat the right consistency.


You do not need to use an egg beater to beat the egg, although this does get the job done very quickly. Instead, just use a fork to whip the egg until it is combined.

, The baking cups that work the best are made for baking ""mini cupcakes,"" because they only hold about two tablespoons per muffin cup.These baking cups will make your treats small enough to be ""hamster sized.""


It is best to use a non-stick baking tray, as it's not a good idea to give your hamster a lot of oil or butter, which would be used to grease a traditional pan.

, Cover the veggies completely with the egg. However, you should leave some room at the top of the cup, as the eggs will puff up when cooked.


Feel free to give each cup of veggies and eggs a little stir so that the eggs and the veggies are thoroughly combined.

, This may be hard to gauge but can done by sticking a toothpick or skewer into the center of one of the cups. If the skewer comes out clean, then the cups are cooked.


Let cool and serve, but remember to give your hamster a limited amount of treats every day.

Collect ingredients.Peanut butter treats combine peanut butter, the hamster's regular food, seeds, and a hamster chew stick.,
Apply peanut butter to the chew sticks.This can be done simply by dipping the chews into a container of peanut butter or by using a knife to apply the peanut butter onto the chews.,
Roll the peanut butter covered sticks in seeds and regular food.Combine all the seeds and food that you are using for this project on a plate or other dish that will give you enough surface area to roll the sticks around.,
Place sticks in freezer.Place the seed and peanut butter covered chewing sticks on a plate or pan that will be ok in the freezer.,
Give one of the treats to your hamster!",How to Make Hamster Treats4," These sticks can be bought at almost any pet store.


Hamster chew sticks are made to wear down the hamster's teeth, so that they don't get overgrown. This is important for your hamster's health.
The amount of ingredients you will need varies. If you just want to make one or two hamster treats, then you will only need one or two chew sticks, a tablespoon of peanut butter, and one or two tablespoons of seed and food mixture.

, This can be a messy process, so keep that in mind before starting.

, Then place the peanut butter covered sticks into the seeds and food, making sure to cover the whole surface.


You may want to lay the sticks onto the surface of the seed mixture, then grab some mixture in your hand, and then sprinkle the mixture onto the top side of the stick, this will allow you to make sure that all surfaces are covered evenly.

, Then place the pan in the freezer until the treats are hard. This usually takes an hour or two, depending on your freezer.


Freezing the treats will make them easy to handle for your hamster. Otherwise, they would be a gooey mess!

, To make treat time more stimulating, you can tie the treat up so that it dangles in your hamster's cage. The hamster then has to do a little bit of work to get to it. This could mean the hamster has to be on its hind legs to get it or it has to climb in the cage to reach the treat.If you have made multiple peanut butter treats, keep the extras in the freezer! You want them to stay firm for the next time you want to give your hamster a treat.

Add additional fruit and vegetables.,
Add seeds and nuts.,
Consider dietary supplements.",How to Make Hamster Health Food2," A healthy store-bought mix is great for a hamster's wellbeing. However, hamster's need fresh fruits and vegetables in addition to their regular food.


Non-starchy root vegetables and leafy greens are great for your hamster. Try carrots, squash, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, lettuce, and spinach. Always wash any produce before serving it to your hamster.In terms of fruit, go for apples, pears, bananas, and berries. Provide your hamster only small servings of fruit. Never give a hamster citrus fruit, like lemons or oranges. They can be toxic to hamsters., In addition to fruits and vegetables, hamsters need the healthy fats found in seeds and nuts. Add things like sunflower seeds, cashews, almonds, and mixes of various seeds and nuts to your hamster's diet.Hamsters tend to eat nuts and seeds fast because they're drawn to fattier foods. You may be tempted to give your hamster more sunflower seeds because he seems to like them, but seeds are higher calorie in content. Stick to feeding your hamster nuts in moderation and do not feed him more simply because he finishes a serving., If you choose a high-quality hamster food, your hamster should get all the vitamins and nutrients he needs. However, many hamster owners grind up vitamins and mix them into their hamster's food. This might help your hamster have better overall health. If you're concerned about your hamster getting all his necessary nutrients, look for vitamin, mineral, and calcium supplements safe for rodents at your local pet store."

Watch for diarrhea or constipation.,
Avoid overfeeding your hamster.,
Talk to a vet about your hamster's dietary needs.",How to Make Hamster Health Food3," If you're feeding your hamster homemade food, you want to keep an eye on his droppings. Hamsters can have sensitive stomachs and certain foods may not sit well with them. If you notice your hamster is experiencing diarrhea, try altering his diet. If you've recently started feeding him a particular type of food, remove that from the mix and see if it helps.

, When using homemade food, it can be tough to judge how much is enough for your hamster. As stated, most hamsters eat about 10 to 12 grams of a dried food mix a day. Invest in a small scale for your kitchen and try to feed your hamster around that much.


If your hamster gains or loses weight on a homemade diet, talk to your vet. Your vet can give you advice on how to alter your hamster's diet to make sure he's getting enough food.

, Before starting any new feeding regimen with a hamster, talk to your vet. Hamsters need specific vitamins and nutrients to be healthy. If you're trying to make food yourself, you'll need some professional guidance. You want to make sure your hamster can live a long, full life.

Assess the size of the hamster.,
Look at the hamster's underside, near where the tail is located.,
Examine your pet's abdomen for nipples, and assess the area just under the tail.",How to Sex a Hamster2," Males are generally larger than females.If you don't have another hamster to compare with, than this may not help you determine the sex of your hamster. However, if you have other hamsters, you can compare their sizes. While this is not a definitive test, it will give you a good idea whether your hamster is male or female.


When you look at an older male hamster from above, you may notice that his back end is more pointed and hiked-up, whereas female hamsters have a rounded bottom.

, Hamsters usually reach sexual maturity by around 35 days of age, and in adult hamsters, sex differences are often fairly easy to see.Males have prominent testicles that make their rumps bulge and take on an almond shape, while females have fairly blunt rear ends. , If you see testicles, it is male. If you do not see testicles and can see prominent nipples, it is female. Females have six prominent pairs of nipples.


In dwarf hamster species, the male also has a very prominent scent gland. In the mature male, this gland usually has a noticeable yellow color and is located in the umbilical area.This area is in the middle of the abdomen about where you would expect a belly button to be.
If you cannot tell whether you have a male or female hamster, the animal may not be sexually mature yet.

"
"
Locate the two openings on the underside of the hamster.,
Assess the distance between the anus and the urogenital opening.,
Recheck the hamster at another time if you are still not sure.",How to Sex a Hamster3," These usually look like small pink circles and may appear slightly raised around the edges. The anus is just under the tail, and the urogenital opening, the location of the urinary and genital organs, is above the anus toward the center of the abdomen.

, Sex differences are more difficult to spot in very young pups, but it is possible to sex a pup by looking at the distance between its anus and its urogenital opening. In females, the openings are very close together. You may actually have trouble telling them apart so that the urogenital opening, which in this case is the vulva, and the anus almost seem to be a single opening or structure. In males, the openings are farther apart, so there is very clear separation between the anus and the urogenital opening.You may also see small swellings in the groin area if you have a male. These are the growing testicles.

, If you can only find one opening, especially if it seems rather large, you should suspect you are dealing with a female, but recheck the animal often or consult an experienced exotics veterinarian just in case you missed the second opening. This opening can be subtle in a very young male, especially if the animal you are working with is a tiny dwarf hamster.


The most common pet hamsters, Syrian hamsters, are solitary and need to be kept in individual cages, so early sexing is not very important. Dwarf hamsters, on the other hand, are kept in single-sex groups. If you have pups in a single-sex group, you need to recheck them often until sex is obvious. This will help you avoid accidental pregnancies in your group.

Research hamster cages.,
Buy a big cage, as big as possible!,
Or, use a second-hand cage.,
Decide where to put the cage.,
Buy a wheel.,
Buy a water bowl or a bottle.,
Decide whether to get a food bowl or scatter-feed.,
Choose a house for your hamster.,
Buy some toys.,
Choose a substrate.,
Choose some nesting material.,
Make sure you have enough and change it regularly.,
Keep adding new things to stimulate them.,
Handle your hamsters daily.,
Give your pet a weekly home check-up.",How to Set Up a Hamster Cage," First of all, you need to think about what kind and size of cage you need to make your hamster as happy and content as possible. The minimum amount of floor space required for hamsters is 360 sq inches. Keep that in mind, as most pet stores sell hamster cages that are far too small and costly. Bin cages are cheap and big; look up ""how to make a hamster bin cage"" and a lot of videos and articles will show up. They are easy and cheap to make, and definitely worth the time. Be sure that whichever cage you choose it is one which has a solid floor so that you can provide ample bedding material for digging and burrowing. Wire or mesh floors can also cause a painful disease called Bumblefoot.

Connecting many smaller cages that end up being 360 sq. inches doesn't count, as is done in Habitrail Ovo or Crittertrail. Hamsters run miles and miles in the wild, so they need a continuous running space, not a lot of tiny compartments connect together.
Syrian and Chinese hamsters can NOT be kept together in one cage as they are very territorial and WILL fight. They could seriously injure or kill each other.;
, There are three most popular minimums, and although it is not the law, you should get a cage that is big enough. The American minimum is on the small side. The German minimum is best, but the RSPCA minimum will do. You cannot connect multiple smaller cages to make the minimum, as hamsters need the space to run around as they would in the wild. The minimums are:


American/Hamster Hideout forum minimum - 360 sq. in
RSPCA/United Kingdom minimum - 80x50cm
German minimum - 1 sq. m
Although recommendations vary, the basic principle is the bigger the better., It's best to start with a new cage, but if you buy or use an old one, clean it with mild baby soap, and rinse throughout. To take away the smell of the of the previous occupant, you can also use a mixture of white vinegar and water but only do this occasionally. You can also get some pet-safe disinfectant spray or wipes

, You should take care when deciding where you will put the cage, as this will contribute to the overall wellbeing of your hamster. You want to avoid extremes of heat, so keep it out of direct sunlight and don’t put it next or a radiator or other heat-source. Equally, don’t put it somewhere very draughty. If you don’t want to keep it in the house you can put it in a frost-free garden shed or garage, but provide more bedding if you do this.


Hamsters are very sensitive to light and high-frequency sound. Don’t put it in a room that will have lights going on and off at night, and keep it away from things such as televisions, computer screens, sources of running water and vacuum cleaners. These generate ultrasound which can be distressing for hamsters.If you have a wire cage and want to avoid your floor getting too messy from the flying substrate, cut down a cardboard box, which the cage can comfortably sit in (with a few centimetres of clearance around the sides), so that it’s sides are not higher than 10cm, and place it in that.

, Hamsters are very active and need lots of things to exercise in their cages, getting a wheel is a good place to start. Dwarf hamsters need a 6.5 - 8 inch wheel and Chinese hamsters need an 8 inch wheel. Larger hamsters, including Syrian hamsters need a 12 inch wheel. It's very important to get a wheel that is big enough for your hamster. Flying saucers cannot replace a normal upright wheel, as it encourages an unnatural way of running. NEVER use barred or mesh wheels, as your hamster can trap a limb or get bumblefoot.


One way to tell if it is too small is to look to see if your hamster is running with an arched back, like a smiley face. If they are, then the wheel is likely too small., If you buy a bottle, buy a good one that doesn't leak too much. If you get a bowl, buy something like a small bendy log bridge to put over it so that your hamster doesn't bury it or get wood shavings in it, or you can place the bowl on a small shelf.

, Using a bowl enables you to keep a good track on how much they are eating, and can be cleaner and easier. However, using scatter feeding brings out the hamster's natural foraging skills.If you have a pair of dwarves, then scatter feeding is advisable as it can prevent fighting. If you have a Chinese hamster (note! Not dwarf hamsters. Despite what a pet shop may have told you, they're solitary like Syrians, even the males) or a Syrian hamster then it is advisable to get a food bowl so that you can check their eating habits.


If you get a bowl, buy a small one so it doesn't take up too much cage space., Most houses are suitable for dwarf hamsters and Chinese hamsters, but many are much too small for a Syrian hamster. Bendy bridges can be turned into lovely cave-style houses if you bury them under the substrate! Some hamsters make nests, but they need somewhere to hide and store food anyway.

, Hamsters are very energetic and need lots of toys. Make sure to get chews as their teeth never stop growing! Hamsters love toys that they can climb and hide-and-seek style toys. Get some tubes, too - they're no replacement for digging but hamsters love running through them! Make sure that they're big enough, though - many tubes aren't big enough for Syrian hamsters. Also check that they have ventilation, as if they are long tubes your hamster may have trouble breathing in them.

, The substrate is the disposable material you fill out the bottom of your cage with. It’s important to get a good one as it will absorb your hamster’s urine and be what they dig into. There are a number of options other than the traditional wood shavings or sawdust, and some specialist websites have reviews of different types. Stay away from substrates such as pine or cedar, as they can cause severe respiratory problems! Use 6cm, or 3in, or more of substrate, as hamsters love to dig. Carefresh is a nice bedding and so is aspen. , As well as substrate, getting some separate bedding or nesting material is important. While bedding is like the carpet, nesting material is like the blankets. Avoid material that can separate into small strands like fluffy bedding and cotton wool. This can cause serious problems for your hamster through ingestion. They could also become entangled and get a limb trapped. Their instincts would be to pull on the limb until it was dislocated, although some very desperate hamsters have been reported to chew their own limbs off and die of blood loss!

Shredded tissue paper, in this case, is the best nesting material.







, It’s good to have a nice stock of substrate and bedding at home, so you are prepared and can change it regularly. You will need to keep a close on the cage and keep it clean. It’s recommended to scoop out substrate that is wet from urine every week, called spot cleaning, which will only take a few minutes. The amount of times you clean your cage completely will depend on how large your cage is. 1000 sq. inches or larger cages can withstand a year or more without a full cage cleanout, but smaller cages may need to be cleaned once a month.

It’s a good idea to have a regular cleaning schedule, as your hamster could be distressed if the cage is cleaned too often or too seldom. Spot clean the cage to remove poo daily to prevent wet-tail.

, In addition to keeping the cage clean, it’s important to keep it refreshed with toys and things to chew on and dig in. Try giving them empty cereal or granola bar boxes with the printed outside removed to prevent exposure to inks. Hamsters like empty toilet-paper tubes, too, and will love to play in them until they chew them to shreds.

, Hamsters love attention! They each have their own personalities, but handling them regularly will help you get used to each other.But of course, you should be careful at all times. For example, don’t hold them by the legs and wheelbarrow them. It strains their little legs and can hurt them or in severe cases break their limbs.


Make sure you give them a chance to get comfortable with their new cage before handling them. Moving into a new cage is a big event for a hamster and they will be more interested in human attention once they are happy.

, It’s crucial to provide a good environment for your hamster, but you can also check on their health by listening to their breathing, and if there is wheezing call a vet. Check their paws for lacerations; check their teeth; check their skin to see if there are any signs of flaky or irritated skin. Make sure their nose is dry and their eyes clear.You may consider weighing them to see if they're gaining or losing weight, which could tip you off to problems.

Give your hamster a paper towel tube.,
Use hard cereal.",How to Make Hamster Chew Sticks," It is important that the wood you use to make the chew sticks is unpainted and untreated.Chemicals found in paint and pesticides used to treat some wood could be extremely toxic to your hamster.


Skewer sticks, that you can typically purchase in your grocery store, offer a good option since you know they are safe for human use, which means they are also safe for your hamster.
Chew sticks purchased in a pet store are typically made of balsa, so if you want something similar to what you find in the pet store, search for those.If you want to use natural wood from the outdoors, clippings of small twigs from fruit trees are safe for hamsters. However, you should be certain that the tree was not treated with chemicals or pesticides.;
, While it is safe to give your hamster fresh clippings from fruit trees, avoid using wood you find laying around on the ground outside, which could contain parasites that can harm your hamster., Certain types of wood, such as cedar and pine, can contain oils that are harmful to the hamster respiratory system. Choose wood that is oil free.Also avoid wood from the yew and oleander tree as these are poisonous for hamsters., You will need to create bunches of 3 skewers in order to make the sticks thick enough to be interesting for your hamster. With a package of 20 skewers, you can make about 13 chew sticks.

, It is important to remove the pointy ends of the skewer. Use a very sharp knife or a pair of gardening scissors to snip off the pointy ends.

, Your hamster will like the chew sticks better if they are shorter, and thus easier to grab. Cut each skewer in half using the gardening scissors.

, Eventually, you will glue the sticks together, but begin by laying 3 skewers next to each other on a piece of parchment paper or cutting board.

, It is important that the “glue” you use to hold the sticks together is safe for your hamster. A safe glue can be made by mixing together 1/2 cup white flour and 1/2 cup water until a thick paste is formed.


If you want to make your chew sticks more interesting for your hamster, add a splash of fruit juice such as apple, blueberry, cherry, peach or mango to the glue. Additionally, you can also add tiny bits of dried fruit to the paste.

, Generously coat each bunch of skewers in the glue using a paint brush.

, You will want to allow the sticks plenty of time to dry so that they do not fall apart inside your hamster’s cage.


You might also want to coat the other side of the sticks in glue. If so, wait until the first side is dry, then flip each bunch over, and repeat the process of brushing on the glue.

, In the evening, when your hamster is most active, give your hamster a few of the chew sticks.

, When you see that your hamster is no longer using the chew stick, if it has been completely worn down, or if it is damaged, give your hamster a new chew stick. Do not leave old chew sticks in your hamster’s cage as he might injure himself with the sticks.

, Does he seem to use them frequently or does he ignore them? If your hamster does not enjoy using the sticks, you should search for alternatives in order to keep your hamster healthy.


Try rubbing the sticks with a carrot. Rubbing the stick with a carrot coats the stick in a flavor that hamsters enjoy.Coat the stick with a bit of honey. Coating the stick in honey shows your hamster that the stick is something he can and should eat.However, do not use this trick often, as your hamster may refuse to use the stick unless it has honey on it. Hamsters can be susceptible to diabetes if they consume too much sugar.Shave off the outer layer of the stick. Using a small, sharp knife, wittle away the top layer of the stick. This releases a strong wood scent that may be appealing to your hamster., If your hamster does not enjoy the sticks, it is safe to give him dog biscuits as long as they do not contain garlic., This offers a good option for chewing, and hamsters also love to crawl inside the tube. Thus, this option offers more than one activity for the hamster., In a pinch, you can also give your hamster a cereal such as rolled oats to chew on."

Create a milk substitute.,
Offer hard food.,
Provide fresh food.,
Put canned dog food in a bowl.,
Provide the droppings of an adult hamster.,
Provide a clean and warm environment.",How to Make Baby Dwarf Hamster Food1," Purchase KMR, a milk substitute generally used for kittens, at your local pet store. Put the KMR in an eye dropper or syringe for feeding. Feed the hamsters around the clock, approximately three drops per serving.


Alternatively, you can use a mixture of 50% warm water and 50% evaporated milk. Heat up the water in a tea kettle and stir together with a spoon before giving it to the hamster. Test the mixture with a thermometer. It should be approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit.The feeding schedule for a baby will be very labor intensive. Start with two drops every half hour, night and day. When the pup is about 12 days old increase this to three drops every half hour. After it is two weeks old, switch to .5 milliliters every hour.
Stop this regimen after 21 days.;
, For hard food, soak pellets in water so that babies can eat them. Immerse them in water and stir them they until they appear soft. Drain them and place them in a dish in the cage. To make them extra nutritious, sprinkle powdered milk on top of the pellets.Alternatively, provide some small seeds like millet, and some wheat germ.The hamster might well refuse hard food until it is about three weeks old. When it does take hard food, begin weaning it off of milk.

, Good fresh foods include finely broccoli and apples.Apples will also help keep the hamsters hydrated., Mash up canned dog food made from either beef or chicken. Be sure that it is sufficiently mashed so that there are no large, hard chunks in it. This will provide a much needed source of protein for the hamsters.Alternatively, for protein you can mash up a hard-boiled egg.

, Baby hamsters will eat the droppings of adult hamsters. This is actually important to their health because it, provides them with the bacteria to process their foods., If a baby is over ten days old, it might be able to survive without its mother, but will need a suitable environment. Clean the cage thoroughly in case the mother was ill. You will need to make a nest by shredding some toilet paper.


Normally the baby’s mother would keep it warm with its body heat. You will need to keep the cage in a warm place. Alternatively, you can place a heading pad under the cage and set it on a low heat setting.
Normally a mother would encourage its baby to urinate and defecate. You will need to do this after each feeding. Rub the genital and anal area with a warm, damp cloth."

Look for a cage that is large enough for your hamster.,
Buy separate cages if you have more than one hamster.,
Make sure the cage can fit the necessary supplies.,
Go for a cage with glass or plastic walls.,
Make sure the wire spacing on the cage is small.,
Check that the cage has a solid base.,
Look for a cage that is more horizontal than vertical.,
Make sure there are no chewable materials in the cage.,
Put bedding at the bottom of the cage.,
Include the necessary accessories.,
Place the cage in an area that blocks out noise.",How to Select a Hamster Cage," Hamsters do well in cages where they can move around, burrow, and run on a hamster wheel. You should opt for a cage that is at least 23 inches (60 cm) in length by 18 inches (45 cm) in width and at least 12-16 inches (30-40 cm) in height.This will ensure your hamster has enough space to be comfortable in the cage.


A larger cage will also require you to clean the cage less often, as there will be less ammonia build up in the cage from your hamster’s droppings and urine. Many hamsters are also less stressed and compulsive if they are housed in a large cage.If you have a baby hamster or a young hamster that is still growing, you should still opt for an adult hamster sized cage. This will ensure your hamster is comfortable in her cage once she is full grown.;
, If you own more than one hamster, you should opt for buying separate cages for each one. Hamsters are quite solitary and will often fight each other if they are caged together.You may decide to buy containers in bulk to save money and to ensure you have enough cages for each hamster that you own.

, When you are buying a hamster cage, you should also consider if the cage can fit all the necessary supplies you need to provide for your hamster. You should be able to fit a hamster wheel, a food bowl, and small tunnels or tubes in the cage, with room to spare.If you think the cage is going to be too crowded with the necessary supplies as well as the hamster, you may need to go for a larger cage.

, There are many different types of hamster cages on the market, including cages that have glass or plastic walls. You may opt for a cage that has plastic or glass walls and a wire top to ensure there is enough ventilation in the cage for your hamster.A cage that is made completely of plastic or a cage that is made of only glass, like an aquarium cage, can end up being too suffocating for your hamster. Going for a cage with a mix of materials can ensure it is more comfortable and safe for your hamster.

, If you decide to go for a more traditional wire cage, you should make sure the space between the wire is small enough to keep your hamster in her cage. The spacing should be a ½ inch or smaller if you have a Syrian hamster to ensure your hamster does not escape. Make sure there are no gaps in the cage that are larger than ½ inch and that all the bars are evenly spaced.You should avoid getting a cage made entirely of wire if you have a dwarf hamster, as they are very good at squeezing themselves through small spaces. Instead, opt for a cage that is made of plastic or glass.If you live in a colder climate, you may opt for a plastic or glass cage instead of a wire cage. Wire cages do not provide very much ventilation in cold weather so they may not be ideal if you live in a cold home or a cold climate.

, Avoid cages that have a wire floor, as this can be uncomfortable for your hamster to walk on and could lead to injuries from falling through the spaces. The base of the cage should be made of solid plastic so it is easy to clean, with a fairly deep bottom.You can always cover up a wire bottom with a solid piece of cardboard or cardstock. But this will make it more difficult to clean the floor and you will likely need to replace the cardboard or cardstock every time you clean the cage.

, Hamsters enjoy climbing but they often have a hard time getting down from vertical spaces. You can minimize injuries from climbing by going for a cage that has more horizontal space than vertical space. Make sure there is a lot of horizontal flat space for your hamster to run around in the cage.You should also look at the design of the cage door to make sure it is large enough for you reach your hand inside and touch any part of the cage. This will make it easier for you to clean the cage.
You should test the door of the cage to ensure it is secure. Tug on the door from the outside to check that it is hard to open, as you do not want your hamster to be able to escape out the front door of the cage.

, You should look at the design of the cage and the materials in the cage to ensure there are no materials that are going to be easy to chew on for your hamster. Go for a cage that has rounded corners and no sharp or jutting ends in the cage, as these will likely be chewed by your hamster.Avoid having any cardboard in the cage as this will be chewed up by your hamster in no time. You should also avoid plastic items in the cage, as these may be chewed by your hamster as well.

, To prepare the cage for your hamster, you should put down bedding that is clean, absorbent, and nontoxic. Avoid using cedar chips or fresh pine materials, as these can be toxic. Shredded paper and processed corn cobs are ideal bedding materials. You should lay down 1-2 inches of bedding at the bottom of the cage.You should also include nesting materials in the cage, such as plain white facial tissues or paper towels cut into strips. Avoid using cotton balls, as it can be dangerous for your hamster.

, You should set up a small food bowl in the cage and a water bottle that attaches to the outside of the cage. The water bottle should have a small feeding top that your hamster can reach easily and drink from.You should include a nesting box in the cage for your hamster to burrow in. Use a wood box, as cardboard can be chewed on by your hamster.
You may add old toilet paper tubes in the cage to give your hamster something to play with as well as tunnels or tubes made of paper. Avoid plastic tubing, as your hamster is at risk of getting stuck in these and suffocating.
Put in a plastic or metal hamster wheel for your hamster to run on at night. Providing a hamster wheel can ensure your hamster stays entertained and active.

, Bear in mind that hamsters are nocturnal and will make noise at night, so your bedroom may not be the best place for the cage. Instead, you may opt to place the cage in your living room or in a side room that is far from your bedroom. Look for a spot on a table or a solid ledge that will help to buffer any noises your hamster makes at night so you can get a good night’s sleep.Make sure the cage is placed in an area that cannot be easily accessed by other pets you may have, such as a cat or a dog. If you have small children, you should find a spot for the cage that is not accessible to your children without your supervision.
You should also keep the cage out of the sun, as hamsters are nocturnal and they will sleep through the day. Place the cage in an area away from direct sunlight, but not close to a window, as this can make the cage too cold."

Increase mom’s protein intake.,
Give mom vitamins for her milk.,
Find an adoptive mother.",How to Make Baby Dwarf Hamster Food2," Hamster mothers require 60% more protein than normal to make the milk necessary to keep baby hamsters health. Feed the mother hard-boiled egg, cooked but unseasoned beef and chicken, and mealworms., Allow a nursing hamster mom to have as many sunflower seeds as it wants. Also give her broccoli, sweet apple, cantaloupe, and peas. It is important that a mother be able to pass down substantial amounts of folic acid, Vitamin A, and Vitamin E to the babies through her milk., If a hamster is less than ten days old, it will probably die without mother’s milk. For that reason, it is imperative that you find a mother to adopt the infant. The mother, however, will only adopt a baby hamster if it believes that the baby is its own. You will need to trick the mother, else it turn against the baby and kill it.


Begin by warming up the baby hamster. Take it in your hands with a small towel. Begin rubbing the baby gently with the towel.
When rubbing the baby, be sure to remove all remnants of its mother’s nest. Any outside smells will alert the new mother to the fact that the baby is not its own. Take some of the nesting material from the mother’s cage and rub it over the baby to make it smell familiar.
Convince the mother to step away from its babies. Try giving it a treat. When it is away, put the adoptive babies with the nest with mother’s natural born babies. Be sure that the mother does not see the other babies being put into its nest."
"
Feed the babies soggy pellets.,
Offer small seeds.,
Sprinkle some wheat germ.,
Lower the water source.",How to Make Baby Dwarf Hamster Food3," Commercial produced pellets provide a good, nearly comprehensive source of nutrition. However, babies will have difficulty eating hard pellets. About ten days after birth begin feeding the hamster pellets. Immerse them in water and stir them they until they appear soft. Drain them and place them in a dish in the cage.Hamster moms don’t begin weaning children off of their milk until they are ten days old. For dwarf hamsters, the process of weaning will be over within three weeks. From ten days to three weeks old, you should begin feeding the babies progressively more. By three weeks after birth, you will be providing all of the nutrients for the babies., Seeds are an ideal source of nutrition for hamsters, but babies are not prepared to eat large seeds. Place a sprig of millet in the cage for the babies and their mother. Pulling the seeds from the sprig will provide a source of entertainment., Wheat germ can be purchased at most grocery stores.Sprinkle it around the nest. Use uncooked and unrefrigerated wheat germ., Baby hamsters should have unimpeded access to water at all times. In order to do that, the water bottle must be low enough that the babies can reach it. Consider placing a water dish directly in the cage at first, because the babies can inhale too much water from a hanging bottle..


At the same time, you need to be sure that the tube does not touch the bedding where the babies sleep."
"
Create a milk mixture.,
Feed your hamster the milk mixture.,
Wean your hamsters from milk.",How to Make Baby Hamster Food1," Ideally, mothers will nurse baby hamsters for the first month of their lives. Other milks won't have the same balance of nutrients. If your baby hamster’s mother died before the hamster is weaned (usually 3-4 weeks after birth), you can act as a surrogate mother by feeding your baby hamster a milk mixture. Formulas designed for puppies or kittens also can work. These substitutes may cause diarrhea.


Combine equal parts evaporated milk and water.
Heat the mixture to 90 degrees Fahrenheit before you give it to the baby.
Use a syringe or specially designed feeding wick to feed the pup.;
, The amount of formula you give your hamster depends on its type (dwarf or Syrian) and age. Generally, you will feed the hamster more milk in the beginning of its early life. Supplement formula with small seeds (like millet), wheat germs, and safe fruits and vegetables (e.g. broccoli, cauliflower, bananas).By the end of a month, you should wean your hamsters from the mixture.Dwarf hamsters under the age of two weeks should receive two syringe drops of formula in thirty minute intervals. You need to feed the hamster through the night. Once the hamster is two weeks and older, you can give him ½ milliliter of formula once per sixty minutes.Syrian hamsters need more milk. Twelve times daily, give these pups 1 milliliter of milk until they are two weeks in age. After this point, give them two milliliters of milk eight times throughout the day.
Break vegetables and fruits into small pieces. For example, break one floret of broccoli into several smaller bite-sized amounts., When your hamsters (dwarf or Syrian) turn three weeks old, they will start to consume solids. At this point, begin to wean them from milk. Decrease the quantity of milk by half for one to two days. After this point, cease to give milk altogether.Dwarf hamsters will continue to nurse (or drink milk) until they are about 21 days old. Syrian hamsters will nurse a bit longer until they are 26-28 days old."

Purchase hamster pellets.,
Soak pellets in water.,
Feed the pellets to the hamsters.",How to Make Baby Hamster Food2," You can get hamster pellets from pet stores. They are often called lab blocks and are one inch long with a diameter of ½ inch.They contain seeds plus grains, and vitamins and minerals. Pellets ensure that your hamster receives all his necessary nutrients.Baby hamster food should have 18-20% protein and 7-9% fat content. Be sure to also include food high in carbohydrates. If you are going to buy hamster food, look at expiry dates. Realize feed typically lasts only three months before spoiling,Do not feed your pet expired hamster food. There could be hatched moth eggs within the bag., Place your hamster’s pellets in a bit of water. Wait until they are soft. They should not be so soft that they disintegrate. Rather they should have a mushy texture, which makes it easier for the hamsters to eat them., Place the pellets on the floor of the cage. Your hamsters can eat their food more easily when it is reachable. Generally speaking, baby hamsters can start eating solid foods when they turn ten days old."
"
Give them water.,
Provide salt licks.,
Introduce new foods cautiously.",How to Make Baby Hamster Food3," Although many adult hamsters get water through vegetables, it is also important to provide water--especially to babies.Place water drinking tubes low enough so the babies can reach them.Make sure water is filtered and sans chlorine.Change water every day.Never give your hamster chocolate, alcohol, or caffeine. These substances can harm your pet!, Hamsters need salt to keep water in their system. Salt generally keeps them healthy as well. In nature, they might lick rocks to receive needed sodium. To give a similar experience, buy salt licks at your pet store., When you want to feed your pet anything new, especially fruits and vegetables, speak with your vet first.Particularly, avoid treats that have a high sugar content. Vitamin and mineral supplements are also likely unnecessary but to be safe, speak with your vet first before giving your pet supplements."

Create hamster bedding with dry white paper.,
Make bedding out of dry toilet paper or tissue paper.,
Cut up a dry toilet paper roll.,
Do not use cat litter to make hamster bedding.",How to Make Your Own Hamster Bedding1," Shredded white paper is a great choice for hamster bedding.Dry white paper is ideal hamster bedding for several reasons, one of which is the color—the white would allow you to notice if your hamster has an illness, such as diarrhea, or is bleeding from an injury.In addition, the ink on white paper does not rub off as easily as newspaper ink, meaning that your hamster’s fur would not get stained with ink.Use scissors to cut the paper into thin strips. It may be helpful to cut the strips into smaller sections so that your hamster can play with it and burrow in it more easily.;
, Both toilet paper and tissue paper are comfortable bedding choices for your hamster.As with the white office paper, make strips of the toilet paper or tissue paper. Because toilet paper is so soft, it may be easier to tear it into strips with your hands.


You can also shred facial tissues with your hands to make hamster bedding., In addition to being a toy, an empty toilet paper roll can also be a source of comfortable bedding for your hamster. For larger hamsters, such as Syrian hamsters, you can cut the toilet paper roll into large strips and allow your hamster to shred it more himself.If you have a smaller hamster, like a Roborovski dwarf hamster, you may need to cut the toilet paper roll into smaller pieces that he will be able to shred more easily., Making your own bedding out of common household items can be fun. If you have a cat, you may have thought about putting cat litter in your hamster’s cage. However, cat litter is not recommended for several reasons, one of which is the litter’s rough texture that would be very uncomfortable for your hamster to walk around in.


In addition, the chemicals in cat litter to control odor can be very harmful to hamsters.
Hamsters cannot digest cat litter. If your hamster tries to eat the litter, he may end up with an intestinal impaction that could make him very sick.
If you try to use litter that clumps when it becomes wet, the clumps could become stuck in your hamster’s fur like small blocks of cement.

",How to Make Toys for Hamsters1," A toilet paper or paper towel roll is a good example of a base toy.;
, Scissors work but knives are easiest to use as long as you're old enough to use one safely.

, Plain white printer paper or newspaper is highly recommended, as the dyes in tissue, wrapping, or construction paper are toxic and can be harmful to your hamster.

Organize your supplies.,
Cut or tear the paper into small pieces.,
Fill the bowl with water.,
Tear the paper again.,
Drain the water.,
Form the paper into balls.,
Break apart the balls of paper.,
Add the bedding to your hamster’s cage.",How to Make Your Own Hamster Bedding2," Making your own hamster bedding with water is another option for saving some money on bedding. Before starting the process, gather all of your supplies in one place. Some of these supplies include a large bowl, plenty of dry paper (e.g., white paper, brown paper bags, old envelopes), an old t-shirt or colander, and a pair of gloves.You will also need some paper towels and/or a cookie sheet on which to dry the bedding.
Making bedding with water can be a very messy process, so it would be best to work in a large sink, such as your kitchen sink. Make sure that you have a drain stopper to prevent paper pieces from going down the drain.The t-shirt or colander will be necessary for draining the water when the paper is fully soaked.
Wearing a pair of gloves will keep your fingers from getting stained as the ink from the paper mixes with the water., In addition to being messy, making bedding with water can take a lot of energy. The smaller you make the pieces of paper, the less work you will have to do later in the process.Add the pieces to the bowl and place the bowl in the sink.

, Add enough water to completely cover all of the paper.The temperature of the water does not matter. However, if you want to sift the paper with your hands to make sure all of the paper is thoroughly soaked, make sure the water is not too hot., After filling the bowl with water, allow the paper to soak for about five minutes before tearing it apart with your hands.Tear the paper into smaller pieces so that the water begins to look like a watery pulp.If you are impatient, you can start tearing the paper as soon as you add the water. However, the paper will be much easier to tear if you let it soak first., There are a few ways to drain the water—pouring the water and paper pieces into a colander or old t-shirt, or keeping the paper pieces in the original bowl and pouring out only the water.This step may be a little tricky, since you will have to be extra careful not to let any paper pieces go down the drain. To make this step easier, put the drain stopper in place before you start dumping out the water.


If you are using a colander, position it over the drain stopper and pour the water and paper pieces into the colander. Pieces of paper may slip through the holes of the colander. If the stopper fills up, clean it out by putting the pieces back in the original bowl. Press down on the paper in the colander to get out any excess water.
If you prefer to use an old t-shirt, position it in the sink next to the drain (with the drain stopper in). Slowly pour the water and paper pieces onto the t-shirt. When you have finished pouring, roll up the t-shirt and wring out the excess water.Pouring out only the water from the original bowl creates less mess, but you may not be able to get all of the excess water as easily as using a colander or old t-shirt.
Rinse and drain several times to get out all of the ink. The water will run clear when there is no more ink left., To start drying out the paper, you will first need to form it into balls. Use both of your hands to do this.Make sure not to make the balls too large or too tight—this could increase the amount of time it takes the paper to dry.


You could also form the paper into clumps, rather than balls. The clumps would be a little looser and shorten the drying process.Place the balls on some paper towels or a cookie sheet to allow them to dry.It may take a few days for the balls to dry.Periodically check on them to test their dryness.
You may need to change out the paper towels if they get too damp.

, After the balls of paper have dried out for a few days, you will need to break them apart. Depending on how much bedding you have made, breaking the balls apart may be tedious and time consuming. To relieve the tedium, consider turning on your favorite TV show or watching a movie.Place the broken-apart bedding on some paper towels. The bedding may still be a little damp, so you will probably need to dry it for even longer to make sure it is completely dry before adding it to your hamster’s cage.
Spread the bedding out as thinly as possible to quicken the drying process.For odor control, you can sprinkle some baking soda on top of the bedding after you have broken it apart and are allowing it to dry., After the bedding is completely dry, you can add it to your hamster’s cage. For larger hamsters, add about three to four inches’ worth of bedding in the bottom of the cage. Smaller hamsters do not need as much bedding.It is okay if you add a lot of bedding. Remember that too much bedding is better than not enough."

, This is for the hamster to be able to run out of the container from the hole.


You can bend the container and poke a hole in the middle first before cutting out the shape of a circle.

, The size of the shapes will depend on the size of your hamster

,
Add different bridges and cross-overs to your hamster's cage.",How to Make Toys for Hamsters3," No matter what type of cage you have (glass aquarium, plastic, metal bars, even bird cages!) you can make platforms! If you are going for a cheap and inexpensive way, use cardboard. It is easy to cut and use (Just grab them at your local store and ask for a medium to large size cardboard box). Wood platforms are a little more expensive and time consuming. You must use a saw to cut the wood.

, Where would you like the platform? How high should it be?

, Cut it at the same length (If you have a glass or plastic cage) or 2 inches (5.1 cm) over the length (for wire cages).

, Now if you have a wire cage, slide it in. If you have a glass cage, duct tape it around all the sides and bottom or the platform.

,, Link together ropes and ladders, cardboard pieces, and yarn to create a hamster heaven!

Serve it up.",How to Make a Filling for Your Hamster's Treat Log," You'll need:


Your hamster's favorite food (ideally one that includes lots of the crumbly bites and pellets, and with a strong smell)
An empty hamster treat log or  a silicone ice cube tray (should be silicone so you can get the bites out)
Hot water (kettle, pan, however you heat your water) or peanut butter (chunky or smooth)

The peanut butter makes the treat extra special, but shouldn't be used too often. The water is healthier for regular use.


Any other extra seeds or little bites to add into the mix;
, Use as much as you want, depending on how much filling you want.

, Using a kettle is the easiest.

, Crush some of the crumbly brown bites as they will dissolve and create a paste.


If desired, you can skip the water and scoop some peanut butter into the bowl of food, instead, and stir. Make sure it is not too much, because it is very fatty and your hamster doesn't need much. And remember when feeding it to him, peanut butter is a treat and shouldn't be used for everyday.

, Granted, it will not look very attractive, but that's not really what your hamster cares about.

,, You do not need to be accurate.

, At this point it will be a bit too cold, and there is a chance it might snap your hamsters teeth. Just leave it out somewhere in room temperature, and it will warm up a little, without turning back into a paste.

, Just plop the log into the hamsters cage, or pop out of the ice cube tray and let your hamster enjoy.

Be careful when using toilet paper or paper towel tubes.",How to Make a Hamster Playpen," A playpen needs to be a safe place for your hamster to explore, so it shouldn't be made of materials a hamster can climb or chew. Corrugated plastic is a great option as it is not only slippery, it can easily be cut to any size you need. Another great option is a large Rubbermaid-type container with tall sides.You can attach pieces of plastic together with anything from binder clips to duct tape.
Plastic is also really easy to clean and is unlikely to stain.
If you decide to use a Rubbermaid-type container for a playpen, never put the lid on the container while your hamster is inside unless you’ve provided proper ventilation.;
, Your hamster’s playpen can either just have walls, or you can also build a bottom. If you’re able to place the playpen on a tile or wood floor, you may not need a bottom as the floor may be easy to clean. If you’re going to put the playpen on a carpet, you may want to include a bottom.A bottom is also useful as the playpen will be much easier to pick-up and move while keeping all the toys inside.
Each item inside the playpen would have to be moved separately if you build a playpen with no bottom or floor.

, Ideally your hamster’s playpen should be bigger than his cage. But, it will also need to fit somewhere in your home on the floor. Plus, you will need to store your hamster’s playpen when he isn’t using it. Take all of these things into consideration when deciding how large you want the playpen to be. In the end it doesn’t matter how big or small it is, as long as it works for you and your hamster.

, If you want to give your hamster a place to explore, but you need time to collect the proper materials to build a more permanent playpen, consider using a large box for the time being. A box that a large item was pack in would work best, such as a TV, printer, toaster oven, microwave, etc.A box won’t be able to be a permanent playpen because your hamster will likely chew through eventually.
Plus, if your hamster pees inside the box, you won’t be able to clean it up.
Consider placing a large plastic bag or garbage bag under the box to help protect your floor.

, A hamster maze can be built for use inside your hamster’s playpen, cage, or even on its own. While there are many commercially available hamster maze pieces available at the pet store, you can also build your own using empty plastic bottle (e.g. water bottles, pop bottles, juice bottles, etc.)


Make sure to completely wash and dry the bottles before using them to make a maze.
You will need to cut either the top, bottom, or edges of the plastic bottles, depending on the design of your maze. Cutting the plastic will create sharp edges that can injure your hamster. Use duct or electrical tape around the sharp edges to blunt them and make them safe.
Use the same tape to connect multiple bottles together. You can connect the bottles end-to-end, or cut a hole in the side of one bottle so a second bottle can be attached at a 90 degree angle.

, Use smaller boxes, cans, tins, and anything else you can find that your hamster can climb up and down on. This will provide your hamster with multiple levels within his playpen to explore. You can even get creative and attach these items together in such a way that you create a maze for your hamster to find his way through.Make sure your playpen has at least one place where you hamster can hide while he’s in the playpen. Having a place to hide will make your hamster feel safe if he gets nervous or scared.
A great place to look for homemade items is your recycling bin. Just make sure to thoroughly clean any items you decide to use. And make sure to blunt sharp edges with tape or padding.

, The purpose of the playpen is so that your hamster has a larger area to run around and play. While some hamsters may be happy with a big open space, adding additional items to the playpen will give your hamster some much needed enrichment. Place items such as the following inside the playpen for your hamster to play with:Toilet paper or paper towel tubes. You can attach multiple tubes together to create a long tunnel.
Old shoes. Your hamster will enjoy climbing in and out of the shoe, and using it as hiding place.
Bridges, see-saws, and swings. You can make your own, or buy hamster-specific versions at the pet store.
Wooden, mineral, or salt blocks. While your hamster may climb these blocks, the real purpose is to give your hamster something to chew on.

, Use boxes and toys from your hamster’s playpen to make a food puzzle. Combine multiple items together in such a way that your hamster has to explore them to find a treat. You can also build a maze with a food treat at the end.Make sure any food your give your hamster inside his playpen is deducted from his daily food allocation. If you give your hamster extra food and treats while he’s in his playpen, your hamster made get a little pudgy.

, Even if your hamster has a wheel in his cage, placing a free standing wheel inside his playpen will give him another view while he runs. Make sure the wheel is made from a continuous piece of material and not wires or bars. Wheels made from wires or bars can cause your hamster to get one or both of his feet stuck and could cause serious injury., Hamster balls are a great way for your hamster to explore the big world outside his cage without getting lost or stuck. Hamster balls are usually large hard plastic balls with a hatch that can open and close so you can place your hamster inside. Once the hatch is closed, the outside of the ball is smooth so it can roll in any direction. If you don’t have an area within your home that’s safe for your hamster to explore in his hamster ball, consider make a large playpen and placing the hamster ball inside.


Using a combination of a playpen and a hamster ball will limit the area your hamster can explore, thus making it safer for your hamster and more convenient for you.
Keep your hamster’s time in a hamster ball to 15 minutes or less. Once he’s finished with his hamster ball, put him back in his cage for a rest., Before you go to take your hamster out of his cage and place him in his playpen, wash and dry your hands. If you’re going to do something else while your hamster is in his playpen, make sure to wash your hands again before touching other items. When putting your hamster back into his cage, again, wash your hands before and after handling your hamster.Hamsters can have ‘accidents’ while in your hands, or climbing around their playpens, so it’s a good idea to always wash your hands before you do anything else.
Hamsters also have a really great sense of smell, but very poor eye sight. If they smell food on your hands and fingers, they may bite you thinking it is food. Washing the smell of food of your hands before touching your hamster can save you from dealing with painful bites.

, While a quick visit to the bathroom or the kitchen should be okay, you shouldn’t leave your hamster alone in his playpen unsupervised. Your hamster made need your assistance if he ever gets stuck or if he manages to escape.It would also be helpful to close any doors to the room where you’ve placed your hamster’s playpen, just in case he does manage to escape. If the doors are closed, you’ll have a much smaller space to search for your hamster.

, Even if your hamster is only going to be in his playpen for a short period of time, it’s always a good idea to include a small water bowl just in case he gets thirsty. This may be even more important if you’re giving him dry treats or kibble inside the playpen.Hamster water bottles that hang on the side of a cage may not work in a playpen. Instead, just use a small bowl of water that your hamster can easily reach.

, As long as you supervise your hamster, he should be just fine. But if he’s a Syrian hamster who is a little plump, you may want to avoid giving him any tunnelling materials like toilet paper or paper towel tubes. Unfortunately your hamster may misjudge his own size and get himself stuck inside one of these tubes!If he does get stuck, gently help him get out of the tube using just your hands. Don’t use any sharp objects to cut the cardboard while your hamster is inside.

Make sure all cables are secured high out of reach, taping them to the wall if necessary. It may also help to install plastic ""trunking"" around the cables, to slow the hamster's access.;
, Check the entire perimeter of the wall at hamster height. Spackle or block off any holes, even the smallest ones. Hamsters can keep chewing at these gaps until they're large enough to escape through.

, Lilies, Amaryllis, and most plants that emerge from a bulb can be toxic to hamsters. When in doubt about whether the plant is harmful, move the plant to another room.

, Move any fragile or heavy objects that could fall over if the hamster knocked them, or if you bumped the furniture. Gather anything laying on the ground, especially sharp objects and pieces small enough for the hamster to eat.

, If you have cats or dogs in the house, put up a barrier in the doorway so they can't slip in after you.

, Second hand smoke may harm your hamster's health.

, Put a portable animal gate or other barrier at the base of couches and beds. If the hamster does find its way into a crevice, you can usually lure it out with treats — but it saves effort to prepare in advance.

, Hamsters can chew through plastic cage bars, and sometimes can open the doors of a cheap model. A glass or plastic reptile tank with a mesh top could be a good alternative.


If you are using a cage, consider placing it inside a large plastic tub.

, Give the hamster some safe objects to play with, and some tunnels or structures to run around in and hide. You can easily make your own toys out of cardboard tubes and boxes.

, Never use cedar or pine shavings, which are toxic to many small animals. Look up reviews of other bedding products before buying, as heavy bedding intended for a larger pet could suffocate the hamster.

, Protect your escaped hamster by following the precautions above throughout your house. Keep a close eye on cats or dogs, and don't turn on the vacuum until you know he's safe in his cage.


Roll up rugs and set them aside to protect them from shredding.
Move house plants up out of reach.
When leaving the house, look around on the floor before opening the door.
Check behind the appliance before using the oven or stove. If the hamster is hiding behind it when you turn it on, the heat could kill it.

, Turn off all television and radio so you can hear the hamster. Sometimes you can hear them scurrying or even nibbling on some crumbs of food they've found.

, Keep a lightweight towel nearby so you can throw it over the hamster if you see it. You may be able to catch the hamster with your bare hands, but that can be difficult.

, A line of treats leading into the hamster cage can lure some hamsters back. Many hamsters will simply leave again after eating, but it's an easy method to try.

, A shoe box with a hole in it may entice a hamster looking for a hiding spot, especially if there are other animals in the house. Lead the hamster there with a line of treats, and put a little water dish inside. Check back daily to see if the hamster is there.


Put the shoe box in a closet or other out-of-the-way location.
Don't forget to remove the silica gel packet from the box, and from any other boxes within hamster reach.

, Choose the room where you last saw hamster poops, chew marks, or the hamster itself. Stuff gaps under the door with towels or fabric. Keep all windows closed, and cover all heat and air vents.

, Place a few treats in the center of the sealed room and leave them there overnight. If they're gone the next day, the hamster is in that room. If not, seal another room and try again.

, Place a bucket on the floor, with books positioned as stairs for your hamster to climb. Lay down a line of treats going up the ""staircase"", onto the lip of the bucket, and on the floor of the bucket. With any luck, the hamster will fall in trying to get the treats, and not be able to get out."

Get medium or large cardboard boxes.,
Flatten the box.,
Cut off the lids.,
Make four long strips.,
Cut slots in each strip.,
Put the pen together.,
Fill the pen with your hamster’s favorite toys.",How to Make a Hamster Playground1," Use either two large cardboard boxes or four medium sized boxes. Go to a nearby store, or ask your parents to take you. Try to find boxes that are as clean as possible.If you want a pen with higher sides, go with four medium boxes. Otherwise, two large boxes will be fine, especially for a small pet like hamster.;
, Once you’ve found some boxes, flatten each out if the store you got them from didn’t already. Do this by undoing the flaps that fold together to make the bottom, or if cut them if they’re taped. Once the boxes are broken down, cut a corner where two sides come together, so that the boxes lay out complexly flat.Use scissors or a craft blade, and ask an adult to help you if you’re not allowed to use sharp objects without supervision.

, After you’ve completely flattened the boxes, cut off the lid flaps that used to be the tops and bottoms. You can either discard the flaps once you’ve cut them off, or save them to use them for another project. After cutting off the flaps, you should just be left with long, cardboard rectangles.If you’re using four boxes, just flatten each and cut the flaps off of each box the same way you’d do for two big boxes.

, If you’re started with two large boxes, cut each in half length-wise, or horizontally. Use a ruler or yardstick and a pen to make a line down the center to guide you. You should be left with total of four long strips.If you started with four medium sized boxes, you can just use the rectangular strips as they are after you cut off the flaps.

, Take each long, rectangular cardboard strip and mark out a line about an inch from the end. If you lay out each strip flat, the line should go from the top to the center on two strips, and from the center to the bottom on the other two. These will fit together to form the pen’s borders.Don’t cut the slots too thick, or they won’t fit together snugly and the pen won’t be as stable.

, Find an area of your house with a hard floor surface, preferably tile so it won’t absorb any messes your pet might make. Give the floor a quick sweep and wipe it down with a wet paper towel to make sure there’s no crumbs or anything you wouldn’t want your hamster to eat. Line the strips’ slots up, and fit them together so they’re snug., Grab any toys that are removable from your pet’s cage, and place them in its pen. Use any other hamster toys you might have, such as tubes, dens, or plastic balls. Make rooms using tissue boxes by cutting out doors so the hamster can get in or out, or fold up the flaps you cut off the boxes to make little hamster teepees.

Find a large box.,
Cover the box’s bottom.,
Create multiple levels.",How to Make a Hamster Playground2," Visit a nearby grocery or department store. Tag along with mom or dad next time they go shopping. Ask someone who works at the store for the biggest box they have in the back.


If you get a box from a grocery store, make sure doesn’t have any food, grease, or dirt stains.
Department or electronics stores are great because their boxes usually don’t have any grime that sometimes come with grocery store big boxes.

, Place a soft old towel at the bottom of the box. Cover the towel with a hamster-friendly bedding or litter. These include wood shavings, shaved corn cob, coarse sand, and other materials that you can find at your local pet store that are marked hamster-safe.Make sure the litter is marked chemical free and safe for pets.
Stay away from straw, because the tough strands can hurt the hamster’s cheeks.
Also avoid fluffy bedding products like cotton wool because they can stuck in the hamster’s toes and feet.

, Use smaller boxes, like tissue boxes, to create levels for your hamster to explore. Cut off lids so the boxes don’t have tops and bottoms, then cut out little doors for the hamster to get in or out. If you use tissue boxes, make sure you get rid of all its plastic and serrated, or sharp, edges at the opening."

If you keep toys and obstacles in your hamster cage that are removable, grab them so it can play in its new playpen or box. Use a tray to put treats in your pen, too. Try putting them around the pen in various places for your hamster to find.

, Use an empty paper towel or toilet paper rolls to make tunnels for your hamster. Make sure that they’re big enough for your pet to get through. Create a bigger tunnel system by pushing the cardboard rolls into any other hamster tubes you might have, like ones made out of either a chewable material or out of plastic.

, Stock up on empty tissue boxes, cereal boxes, boxes that hold canned soda, and other household cardboard boxes. The size of these smaller boxes will depend on the size of the box or pen you used for the playground. Cut doors in them and make a little city for your hamster to explore.

, Take a trip to the hardware store, or have your parents bring you. Find a short length of flexible, plastic tubing for plumbing. Use the largest tubing you can find: one with the longest circumference, or longest around. Cut it in half length-wise so you’re left with two long slide shapes. If you or a parent is handy with wood, you can make a ladder for the slide with a small wood frame or box. Use non-toxic glue to attach 5 to 10 wooden dowels for the ladder’s rungs. You can also get an adult to drill holes through the wooden frame and use a hammer to tap the dowels through them.Use a small, solid square of wood for the slide’s top platform. Drills holes and use screws or dowels to attach it to the wooden ladder, or glue them together using non-toxic glue.Have an adult drill holes through the slide shape and the wood square, and use a screw to attach the slide to the square’s underside. Sand out a groove in the platform so the slide fits better. Make sure the pointy end of the screw doesn’t poke through the top side of the wood square.Finally, if you’d like to add some color, use food coloring and water to stain the wood parts of your hamster’s new slide."

, Take all the toys, bowls, and shelters out of the cage. Shake the bedding out into a garbage bag. Make sure to not shake the bedding out in a food area, as small animals can carry bacteria such as Salmonella.Everything in the cage can carry smells. Therefore, it's important to clean all parts of the cage, including the toys and accessories.

, Before deodorizing, clean the cage with a cleanser specifically made for hamster cages or a mild soap. You can use dishwashing soap, for instance, and hot water. Wash everything thoroughly, including the food and water bowls and the accessories.Just be sure not to clean the cage in the kitchen because of the possibility of spreading bacteria. Outside or in the bathtub works best.
Use a dedicated sponge and soap to clean the cage, even if you're using dishwashing soap.
Using a basic soap gets out most of the feces and urine, helping to deodorize the cage.

, Pick a cleaner that will help deodorize. You can use an all-in-one cleaner to clean and deodorize or clean and then use a deodorizer. For instance, cleaning products with enzymes will help the cage smell better.Simpler options include baking soda or vinegar after you've cleaned the cage with soap and water. To use baking soda, sprinkle some in the cage and wipe it clean with a wet sponge. For vinegar, wet the sponge with vinegar and use it to wipe down the cage., Once you are done, make sure you rinse the cage an accessories thoroughly. You don't want any residue left on the cage that could bother your hamster.Rinsing gets rid of any smells that may bother your hamsters. While you don't want it to smell like hamster, you also don't want it to smell like cleaner to your hamster.
Let the cage dry before putting your animals back in.

, When choosing bedding, stick to aspen if you want to use wood chips. Other types of wood can be harmful to hamsters.You can also use shredded paper with the wood shavings or bedding made from recycled paper.You also can use a couple of other plant-based beddings available at your pet store. These beddings are absorbent. Just be sure to pick one that is plant-based, not ones that are artificial.If you use shredded paper, make sure to use paper without ink. However, paper won't absorb odors as well as other plant-based beddings. Aspen is better at hiding odors than paper, but it's not as good as the more absorbent plant-based beddings. The more absorbent the bedding is, the more it tends to hide odors.To make sure your bedding is ready for your hamster, you can put it in a zip-top bag and let it sit in the freezer for 2 days. That way, any mites that might be living in it will die off., When you're done, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly. Washing your hands helps prevent the spread of bacteria."

Clean the cage once a week.,
Add a layer of baking soda.,
Always use fresh bedding.,
Try a supplement.,
Ventilate the area.",How to Deodorize a Hamster Cage2," The best way to keep a hamster cage smelling fresh is to clean it often. Aim for at least once a week to help keep odors down.If you have trouble remembering, try setting an alarm on your phone to go off when you need to clean the cage.
Try adding cage cleaning to your weekend chores, so you remember to do it each week.

, Sprinkling baking soda on the bottom of the cage can help absorb odors. Just add the baking soda before you put in the hamster's bedding.Baking soda is a good way to keep your cage smelling great, as it is readily available and very cheap.

, Whenever you clean the cage, make sure to always use fresh bedding. If you try to reuse bedding, it can contribute to the smell.You need to change out the bedding because it can build urine and feces over time, even if you have a litter box.
However, some people suggest adding a bit of used bedding back in to help the hamster re-acclimate to the cage.

, Pet stores offer supplements for small rodents. These supplements can help cut down on odors that your animals produce, which can cut down on odors overall.Generally, these products either have yucca schidigera in them, or they are amino acid based.More research needs to be done on how effective these are for hamsters, but they are generally safe., Whenever possible, get as much air flowing in the area to help clean out the smell. Try opening windows or running your air conditioner.Another option is running air purifiers to help the air smell better.You can also install better air filtration systems at the central level."
"
Train your hamster to use a litter box.,
Start by cleaning the whole cage.As you do, note where your hamster has been peeing, if possible.,
Buy or create a litter box.,
Fill the litter box.,
Put it in the bathroom corner.,
Change the litter.",How to Deodorize a Hamster Cage3," One way to keep your hamster's cage smelling fresh is to train it to use a litter box. That way, you can change out the smelly part more often.Not all hamsters can be trained. However, it is worth the effort to try if you want the room to smell better.

, That way, you can use the same spot for a litter box.To find the area where your hamster has been peeing, look for wet or soiled areas.
You might see clumped bedding in that area.

, You have a number of options for hamster litter boxes. You can buy a litter box designed specifically for hamsters, or you can make one.You find litter boxes online or at pet stores.
Alternatively, you can use boxes, as well as plastic, glass, or ceramic dishes. Boxes absorb pee and you can throw them away, but you may find that your hamster chews them up. You can cut tissue boxes shorter for this purpose. Glass, plastic, and ceramic all work well, but you may find your hamster stands on the edge and still pees outside the box., Add sand or small animal litter. You can use play sand for this purpose, but you need to sterilize it first. Litter is also an option, but it can be more expensive. It does absorb odors, though.If you use play sand, be sure to sterilize it in the oven by baking it at a low temperature for an hour or two. You can keep the sand in giant covered bucket for use.Pet stores do sell sand for chinchillas that is already sterilized, but it is more expensive. Hamsters like the feel of sand., Stick the litter box where the hamster has already been going to the bathroom. It can help to stick some soiled bedding in there that already smells like the hamster.You are trying to play on the hamster's habits. If the hamster has already chosen one place to go to the bathroom, you can use that to help train it.
Sticking soiled bedding in it helps it smell like the hamster, which encourages it to go there.

, While you can change the litter more often than you clean the cage, try not to change it every day. Your hamster likes habits, and when you change the habitat to often, it will get upset.Instead of changing the whole litter, you can also use a scoop to pull out feces and pee (if you see wet spots).As the litter gets low, replace it.

Return your hamster to his cleaned cage.",How to Create a Habitat for a Hamster," Hamsters live in individual burrows in the wild and need a cage or tank that mimics this environment as best as possible.Get an aquarium tank or a solid-bottomed wire cage to ensure that your hamster has enough space.


Make sure any tank is at least 10 gallons (37.9 L), though consider getting the largest one you can afford. Make sure the tank or cage has a wire mesh top to keep your hamster from escaping.Consider getting your habitats secondhand to save money if you have several hamsters. Check them for flaws or cracks, which may not be worth the savings.
Be aware that you should only have one hamster per habitat because they are territorial, solitary, and may be aggressive. Buy individual tanks or cages for each animal.This can also prevent unwanted reproduction.;
, Hamsters are very sensitive to temperature changes and their surroundings. Place the tank or cage inside of your home in a spot that is warm and away from other pets that may scare or harm your hamster.Make sure the area is in a spot that has a consistent temperature between 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 25 Celsius).Avoid places that get drafts, such as garages or breezeways, or are exposed to high heat from direct sunlight or heating devices. These can undermine your hamster’s health or kill it. Instead, consider putting the hamster cage in your living, dining, or entertainment room. A finished and heated basement or kitchen may also work. Remember to keep the cage away from food preparation or storage surfaces.
Be aware that hamsters are nocturnal and may keep you awake if the cage is in your bedroom.

, Your hamster’s habitat will need bedding to make her home comfortable and ready for burrowing. Line the cage with at least 2 inches of bedding and add more paper material for nests.Line the habitat with Timothy hay, aspen shavings, processed corncob or pelleted bedding. You can purchase these at many pet and home stores. Avoid pine and cedar chips, the fumes of which can harm your hamster.
Place some paper towels or tissues along with the bedding for your hamsters to make nests.

, Beyond bedding, your hamster will need toys and places in which to hide and sleep.Decorate the tank or cage to promote your hamster’s health.


Place an exercise wheel in the habitat. Hamsters love to play and the wheel will allow them to run around and get exercise.
Incorporate a small box or item such as a flowerpot where your hamster can sleep and hide. Cardboard tubing, such as a toilet paper roll, is also a great option.Include a chew toy for your hamster made out of a safe material such as unpainted wood, dog biscuit or rawhide. Like other rodents, hamsters’ teeth grow continuously and having something on which to chew can wear down their teeth and keep them healthy.Get several toys and place them in your hamster’s habitat to keep her busy and happy.

, Hamsters eat hamster mix, which contains seeds, grains, cracked corn and pellets to promote their health. Your hamster also needs a water bottle to ensure her hydration.Put the food in a small dish and refill it as necessary. You can also offer your hamster small, bite-sized amounts of fresh fruits and veggies such as spinach, lettuce, carrots, or apples. Make sure to avoid chocolate, candy, and junk food.
Attach a water bottle with a drinking tube to the side of the cage. Make sure the tube allows fresh water to flow continuously., You will need to do general spot cleaning of your hamster’s habitat on a daily basis. At least once a week, you should remove all bedding and clean the entire cage as well as the surrounding area. This promotes the health and happiness of your hamster.


Clean up feces, old food, or soiled bedding every day. You can easily do this when refilling your hamster’s food and water.
Disinfect and clean the cage at least once a week or more often if necessary. You’ll need to replace the bedding, disinfect the habitat walls, and wash the food and water dishes.

, Take your hamster out of her habitat and put her in a safe place while you do this. This can allow you to safely clean the cage without your hamster nipping you.Allow your hamster to have “outside time” in a safe space while you clean. Make sure he is in an area that is screened off or secured so that he can’t escape. You could also put him in a separate cage or your bathtub, so long as the drain is covered. Some other places you could put her are in a hamster ball, a securely covered and ventilated box, or even an empty dresser drawer.
Give your hamster food pellets to occupy him while you clean. It’s important to either place your hamster in a space that is secure or where you can watch him.

, Keeping your hamster’s food dish refilled and clean helps him stay healthy and happy. Put new food into the dish as needed and wash the dish at least once a week.Give your hamster just enough food to keep her from getting hungry.
Remove crumbs or any other material, like feces, before you refill your hamster’s food dish.
Clean the dish with hot, soapy water or in your dishwasher at least once a week. If your hamster sprayed or defecated in it, you’ll also need to remove the food and disinfect it. Allow the dish to dry completely before putting in new food to prevent bacterial growth.

, It’s vital to the health of your hamster that she have clean and fresh water every day. Pour out water at least once a day and replace it with fresh water.Remove anything floating in the water before you refill it. Clean the bottle in hot, soapy water if necessary.
Check to ensure the water is flowing properly from the tube once it is clean. You can do this by placing your finger under the bottle and pressing on it.
Wash the bottle in hot, soapy water or your dishwasher at least once a week.

, Your hamster will urinate and defecate usually on one spot of her bedding. You can remove soiled areas daily but you should replace all of the bedding at least once a week. This minimizes the risk of infection and reduces odor.


Remove any soiled areas of bedding and droppings every day. Your hamster may use the same spot to urinate and defecate so focus cleaning and removal on that spot as a part of daily cleaning.
Make sure to replace any soiled paper towels or tissues.
Clean and disinfect the habitat walls and floor at least once a week and more often if needed. You can use a disinfectant or a vinegar and water mixture. Allow the habitat to dry thoroughly before you replace any bedding, toys, or dishes. This prevents the growth of bacteria or ammonia that can harm your hamster., Just as the dishes and bedding can get soiled, so can your hamster’s toys and hiding spaces. Once a month, clean all of the toys and replace anything that is broken or could harm your hamster.


Use a mixture of vinegar and water to clean your hamster’s toys including her exercise wheel. Wipe them off and then allow them to dry completely. As the toys dry, inspect them for cracks or other flaws that could harm your hamster. Consider throwing away broken toys.
Avoid disinfecting chew toys because cleaners can harm your hamster. Instead, throw them away and replace them with new wood blocks, dog biscuits, or chew toys.
Throw away any paper toys and replace them with new ones to prevent bacteria growth.

, If your hamster lives in a wire cage, she may kick out bits of bedding or food into the area around it. Vacuum or sweep up any areas around her cage that are soiled and disinfect them if necessary.


Disinfect any areas of the floor or walls on which your hamster sprayed with a disinfectant cleaner or mixture of vinegar and water.

, Once you’ve cleaned your hamster’s home, reintroduce to him to it. Give him a treat for behaving while you cleaned.

Select the right-sized cage for your hamster.,
Select a cage that is well ventilated.,
Choose a cage that is easy to clean.,
Choose a cage that has a solid plastic floor.,
Determine which cage type would be ideal for your species of hamster.,
Select a cage that fits your budget.",How to Choose Good Cages for Hamsters1," The recommended minimum size for your hamster’s cage is at least 18 inches (width) x 13 inches (height) x 25 inches (length), which is equal to 450 square inch floor space, which is the minimum for humanely housing a hamster of any type. The 13 inch height is to allows you to fit a 10-12 inch wheel for a Syrian hamster. However, bigger is always better, since your hamster will want plenty of space to run, climb, and play.Your hamster will also want to have separate areas to go to the bathroom, sleep, and store food, which will necessitate a very spacious cage.If you will be housing more than one hamster in the same cage, the cage will need to be even bigger to give each hamster plenty of room. A good guideline to follow is the minimum floor space times the number of hamsters to be put in the cage
Some Dwarf hamsters can be housed together in pairs, but only in same-sex pairs to prevent breeding. Roborovski and Russian Campbells are the best hamsters to be housed in pairs. Keep in mind that Syrian hamsters are very territorial and should never be housed together.However, they can be housed near each other in separate cages, so long as they can't be disturbed by each others presence. So a rule of thumb should be to separate their cage by 4-6 inches.;
, A poorly ventilated cage can lead to the build-up of ammonia, which is toxic to your hamster and can lead to respiratory problems.Poorly ventilated cages can also lead to bacterial growth, which could also make your hamster sick.Wire cages tend be very well ventilated, but aquariums and plastic hamster cages are often poorly ventilated.Your hamster may start to have trouble breathing if his aquarium or plastic cage is not well ventilated. If you notice that he is not breathing properly or looks unwell in general (not eating, playing as much or has physical signs of illness), consider cleaning his cage to remove soiled bedding. You may also want to consider purchasing a wire cage, that is of adequate size.

, You will need clean your hamster’s cage once or twice a week depending on your cage, so you will want a cage that will not be too difficult to clean. Wire cages are probably the easiest type of cage to clean. Aquariums and plastic cages may need more frequent cleaning because of their poor ventilation, but this most likely won't be an issue if your cage is the minimum size or above.Plastic cages are the most difficult to clean, since they often have many different components, are multi-level, and have twists and turns that could be a challenge for you to reach.No matter which type of cage you have, it would be helpful to have a secondary, smaller cage that you can put your hamster in while you are cleaning his main cage or away travelling with your hamster. , Your hamster’s nails could get caught in a grated or wire floor, which often leads to foot injuries. Also, solid plastic floors are easier to clean than grated floors., If you have a Syrian hamster, you will likely be fine with any type of cage, as long as it is the minimum size or larger and has places for him to play, sleep, and eat. However, if you have a smaller species of hamster (i.e., Chinese, Dwarf), you will need to be more careful with the type of cage you choose. For example, you will need to pay special attention to the spacing between the wires of a wire cage (no more than 1/2 inch of spacing), since a tiny hamster could squeeze through those spaces.An aquarium or plastic cage may be better for your Chinese or dwarf hamster, since he would not be able to escape easily., The fact that your hamster’s cage is an important investment does not mean that you have to find the most expensive one that you can find. Small wire cages tend to be inexpensive, but wire cages of the minimum size or more are extremely costly. Plastic cages are also expensive, and most of the time don't even come close to the minimum cage size. Aquariums or bin cages can usually be your best bet."

Find an unwanted dollhouse.,
Clean the dollhouse.,
Check out the floor areas, both base and upstairs.,
Measure the dimensions of the dollhouse.,
Check the suitability of the house for moving around in.,
Plan how you'll block all of the exit holes.,
Build up the base slightly.,
Start attaching the barrier items to the dollhouse.,
Attach the water bottle to one side of the house.,
Put in some comfortable bedding, like straw, or tissue paper.,
Put the hamster's favorite toys and climbing apparatus into the house.,
Improve the outside of the hamster home.",How to Make a Doll House Into a Hamster Cage," Check that nobody wants it for play, heirloom keeping or for fetching a fortune on eBay because once you've changed it, it's no longer going to be that old dollhouse.
, Unless it's particularly grotty, a warm, soapy wash should be sufficient for cleaning the doll house walls, floors and other surfaces. Use a little detergent for something stronger. This is best done on a warm, sunny day to allow for good drying, or if you're able to leave it in a room which is very, very warm.


Remove all wallpaper surfaces, carpets and anything else stuck to the dollhouse. You will need to ensure that the dollhouse is clean and non-toxic.
Remove any fabric (for carpet) off the floor or curtains, etc., because it won't be clean for long, and if a bulge or seam exists, it will be chewed and stripped out.
Remove any removable pieces to help with deeper cleaning.

, If these are made of wood or paper, they will need to be waterproofed or you will end up with one stinking mess after a short time. You could use a non-toxic paint to protect these surfaces. One source suggests using G4 pond sealant to protect the wood.Another idea is to use cookie sheets/baking trays or similar to line the base of the house and any other layers, to create a barrier between the wood and the house resident. If you're into craft, tile the floor areas using a non-toxic grout.
Alternatively, use thick layers of paper such as toilet paper, changed frequently, to soak up hamster wee, moisture and mess.

, Before proceeding, you'll need all measurements for the additions you're going to make. Hopefully you'll be able to find most items around the house but you may also need to buy some, and having the measurements worked out in advance will save you money.

, You might need to widen some of the holes leading upstairs and exchange staircases for ladders, etc. Give the dollhouse a good look over with a hamster's perspective in mind. How will the hamster get up and down? Where will the hamster prefer to eat, sleep and play in this house? Choose the solutions to these questions according to the design of the dollhouse you're using.

, Dollhouses come with a lot of possible exit places, such as windows, doors and an open back or front that allows access to the house. You'll need to block these up with suitable items, such as hardwood, galvanized wire (hardware cloth), wire mesh, plastic garden ""wire"" or heavy cardstock. Choose the materials for blocking up the holes according to the sizes of the holes and the need for viewing through the house. It is advisable that the part of the house which is most open to viewing (usually the front or the back of the dollhouse), is covered in wire or wire mesh, so that you and the hamster can see through and so that plenty of air circulates through the hamster house.


You might like to consider adding a small sliding-door in a suitable location so that you can put food/water/bedding into the house as needed. You'll also need to be able to open the house to remove the hamster for play and cuddling, as well as for cleaning.
Another door alternative is to cut through the wire front and hold the door in place with paperclips or spring clips.
Take note of small exit routes. A crack or any very small opening (seam or corner) will be a tempting place to chew. If such a place is in an outer wall, or floor it will, if possible, soon be enlarged to form an escape route. Be sure to cover it well.

, Whether it's the back or the front of the dollhouse that opens out or is wall-less, you'll need to stop the hamster bedding from tipping out onto the floor or bench. Use a piece of wood across the base to create a small barrier; nail into place with a good edge overhang to prevent spillage of bedding. Do this prior to adding the wire covering.

, For the windows, nail/screw in, staple in place or glue on the wood/heavy cardstock/wire barriers. Leave the front/back part until last because you'll still need work on the inside of the hamster house.


Consider allowing your hamster to be able to see out of some of the windows by using plastic wire netting or wire rather than wood. It is not only more interesting for the hamster but it will probably look prettier too.

, Drill a hole through the wall of the dollhouse to let the watering tube go through into the inside. Check to see that it's easily accessible for the hamster. An alternative method would be cutting a hole in a cardboard tube and putting the water bottle in that.

, Untreated wood shavings work best (not pine or cedar). If you want to turn a dollhouse bed into your pet's bed, do that too; in fact, old dollhouse furniture can be upcycled into all sorts of fun hamster things.

, Arrange toys at different levels to increase the desire to run around the hamster house.


Hang some toys and chewing items. Be sure to include ladders and balancing areas to help the hamster move around and stay entertained.

, This is an optional step but you can certainly prettify the hamster home if you'd like. Use non-toxic decorating items, just in case of fumes off-gassing through the walls or in case your hamster chews through anything. Designs such as flowers, hamsters, your hamster's name, etc. are all suitable additions.

Familiarize yourself with good wire hamster cages.,
Learn about plastic hamster cages.,
Consider the pros and cons of aquariums.,
Learn about bin cages.",How to Choose Good Cages for Hamsters2," A wire cage is a popular cage type for hamsters but usually is not big enough, so when looking for wire cages often rat cages with 1/2 inch spacing can work aswell as large hamster cages.A wire cage usually has a detachable base made of solid plastic.The horizontal bars are ideal for hanging toys and chews.Big wire cages are more suitable for Syrian hamsters, since they are relatively large and would not be able to squeeze between the wires.Be aware that your hamster could gnaw on the wires,- if not given chews and toys-, which could lead to various dental problems that may need veterinary care., Plastic hamster cages are multi-level, with tunnels and other areas that your hamster can run through and play in. In addition to being visually appealing (plastic cages are very colorful), plastic cages can be good for a dwarf hamster, since his small size would allow him to easily run through the twists and turns of the tunnels.It can be fun to watch your hamster run through the cage.
A plastic cage is not ideal if you have a large hamster, since he could get stuck in the tunnels.If you have a dwarf hamster, he could easily hide in the small nooks and crannies of the cage, making him hard to find.
Most plastic cages are too small alone and can only be used as attachment cages to a cage of the minimum size.Plastic hamster cages should not have any edges that your hamster could gnaw on., Aquariums are not specifically made for hamsters, but could be an ideal housing option for your hamster. They are typically made of either solid glass or plexi-glass, which makes them very sturdy and easy to see through.To keep your hamster from escaping, the aquarium should be covered with a well-fitted mesh top.You may need to purchase this separately at your local pet store.


The minimum size aquarium that you should have for your hamster is 30-40 gallons depending on the specific aquarium. Just be sure to have the floorspace be of the minimum size or bigger. An aquarium would be ideal if you have a dwarf or Chinese hamster.Aquariums have a few disadvantages, such as being heavy and having poor ventilation.Since aquariums are not hamster-specific, you would need to buy extra items to place inside of it, such as tunnels and ladders., Bin cages are cages that you can design and make yourself. The freedom to be able to design these cages yourself is a major advantage. Bin cages are usually much cheaper to make than it is to buy a proper sized store bought cage, but bin cages may not look as visually appealing as other cage types."

, Make the pieces big, almost overlapping the size of the holes.

, After cutting the loofah chews, add both the loofah pieces and hamster treats in the tube. Make sure the treats are really inside so the hamsters have a hard time getting to the treats. As a result, they will chew the loofah pieces to get to the treats hidden within.

, After putting the contents in the toilet paper tube, fold the other end in the same way that you folded the other end.

Monitor your hamster's weight.",How to Feed Hamsters," Most of a hamster’s diet should be made up of commercial hamster food. These are usually composed either of pellets or seed mixes. They are designed to accommodate your hamster’s diverse nutritional needs.


Because hamsters are adverse to changes in their diet, when you purchase food, consider buying what your hamster was fed at the pet store. After a few weeks, slowly transition it to a different food source, should you choose to.If you are feeding your hamster a seed mix, make sure that it does not only eat the sun flower seeds. Hamsters prefer these, but they will not satisfy all of your hamster’s nutritional needs.;
, Try to give your hamster a small portion of fruit, vegetable, or protein either every day or every other day. A portion size equivalent to a couple of raisins is appropriate.Leftovers can rot, contaminating the cage.


Good vegetables to feed your hamster include: turnips, carrots, chicory, spinach, parsley, pumpkin, endive, cauliflower, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, and asparagus.
Good fruits to feed your hamster include: raisins, seedless apples, berries, pears, plums, and peaches. Seeds and pits can be poisonous, so be sure to keep these away from your hamster.Once a week you can add some additional protein to your hamster’s diet with pieces of a hardboiled egg.Be mindful that food hasn’t spoiled and remove it from the cage when it begins to go bad. Fresh food should generally be removed from the cage within a few hours of the initial feeding.

, It is important to give your hamster a hard treat approximately once a week. These help keep your hamster’s teeth in good shape and can be a source of additional nutrition or even recreation.


At a pet store you can purchase treats that hang from the top of your hamster’s cage. These forces them to work to get their food and can facilitate play.
Mineral or salt licks are a good way to provide your hamster nutrition as maintains its teeth.

, You should avoid feeding your hamster kidney beans, citrus fruits, onion, potato, rhubarb, and tomato leaves. Junk food, chocolate, alcohol, and candy are also bad for your hamster.

, Hamsters are liable to knock over a water dish, creating sanitary problems. At the pet store purchase a bottle that can hang on your hamster’s cage. Refill regularly with bottled water.


Be sure to clean the water bottle at least once a week.

, Specialists differ as to whether it is better to feed your hamster in the morning or evening. It is important, however, that hamsters eat regularly. So pick one time and stick with it.Some experts recommend night time feedings because hamsters are nocturnal and thus will be awake throughout the evening. Others, however, point out that they like to wake up sporadically throughout the day and snack. It is unclear which time is best.

, Hamsters can scratch up plastic bowls, creating crevices which foster the growth of bacteria. A small bowl is preferable to a large one, because it will leave space in the cage for your hamster to play..


Place the bowl at the opposite side of the cage from your hamster’s bathroom area. You will find that your hamster goes to the bathroom in one corner of his cage. Note where that spot is and then place the bowl as far from it as possible.
Wash the bowl with soapy water during your weekly cleaning of the cage., Supplement this as described above with treats. It can be tempting to overfeed hamsters because you will often find that their bowl will quickly empty. But, hamsters horde food, so it is probable that they actually have food, but have hidden it. , This can be a good way to bond and build positive associations with your hamster. As you offer food with one hand, use the other to pet or hold your hamster. Slowly build up to more contact., Because they have so much extra skin, it can be difficult to tell when a hamster is becoming obese. A Syrian should weight approximately one ounce per inch of length. Also, if your hamster appears slow and sluggish, it is possible you should modify its diet."

Choose good bedding.,
Spread the bedding thickly enough that your hamster can burrow in in it.,
Pick appropriate food.,
Feed your hamster every day.,
Maintain a steady diet.,
Play with your hamster.,
Give your hamster water, ideally in a plastic bottle.","How to Make Hamster Food, Water and Bedding Choices"," The best bedding is shredded toilet paper or a type of soft bedding (like Carefresh, which can be dusty, or Kaytee Clean and Cozy), or aspen bedding. All three are practically harmless.


Some types of bedding can be hazardous to your hamster. Any fluffy bedding, such as cotton, can KILL your hamster.
If you use wood shavings, avoid cedar and pine. It releases aromatic oils that can be fatal to your hamster(s). aspen is probably your best choice;
, About four inches should be enough

, Never try to make your own food, because your hamsters will miss out on some of the essential nutrients they need to survive. They like variety, so try to buy food with different food types.

19% protein, 6% fat and 8% fiber is the ideal nutrition content. If the protein is a bit low, you can supplement the food with dried mealworms. The same goes for if the food is a bit low in fiber. Supplementing the mix with high-fiber foods works well.
Harry/Hazel Hamster and Burgess Dwarf are both the best and most superior hamster food choices in America.







, Remove old or stale food regularly. Thea mounts will depend on which food you have.

, Do not change your hamsters' food or diet suddenly; take it slow. Add a little more of the new food every couple of days until all your hamster's food is the new kind. Always supplement their diet with fresh, safe vegetables, as well as other non-vegetable treats (if your hamster is a winter white or a Chinese hamster refrain from feeding fruit) such as non-citrus fruit, hard-boiled egg, etc. Keep the amounts small though! Only about a nail-sized cube of extras per day.

, Hide the food around the cage for them to find. Don't do this too much, though, as they may not be able to find it, and the food will go stale. Remove any leftover hidden food when you change the bedding. Also, have them run around on the ground freely but you must be watching them. Always keep them away from corners and wires.

,

If you use a plastic bottle, make sure that the ball is metal, not plastic. Bottles are easier to handle and keep the water cleaner. A bottle will need its water regularly changed, about thrice a week or more if the hamster is a little messier.






If you use a bowl, which is the more natural choice, choose one that is about 1 1⁄2 inch (3.8 cm) tall and fill it about halfway. A bowl will need its water regularly changed; about once a day or more if the hamster is a little messier.






Hamsters prefer bottled water, but it isn't necessary for them to survive.

Feed your dwarf hamster commercial hamster food.,
Give your hamster fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Include a good protein source in your dwarf hamster’s diet.,
Add fiber to your dwarf hamster’s diet.,
Feed your dwarf hamster hard treats once a week.,
Provide your dwarf hamster with fresh water.,
Learn which foods you should not feed your dwarf hamster.,
Select the proper food bowl for your dwarf hamster.,
Feed your dwarf hamster at the same time each day.,
Observe your dwarf hamster's eating habits.,
Do not overfeed your dwarf hamster.,
Remove any uneaten food.",How to Feed Dwarf Hamsters," Dwarf hamsters have a similar diet to other hamster varieties. A mainstay of your dwarf hamster’s diet should be commercial hamster food, which you can purchase at your local pet store. Commercial hamster food comes in pelleted form and typically consists of seeds, pellets, grains, and bits of cracked corn.Commercial hamster food has a high nutritional value, but should not be the only type of food you feed your dwarf hamster.
The pellet formulation allows your dwarf hamster to gnaw on his food,which can be good for his dental hygiene.
Choose a commercial food that has about 15 to 20% protein.If you have the time, you can also make your own hamster food.
;
, Fruits and vegetables add extra nutrition as well as variety to your hamster’s diet.Make sure to wash the fruits and vegetables thoroughly with fresh water to remove any pesticides or other chemicals.Examples of produce that you can feed your dwarf hamster are asparagus, broccoli, bananas, and blueberries.Incorporate fruits and vegetables gradually into your dwarf hamster’s diet to reduce his likelihood of developing diarrhea. Start by feeding one small piece of produce a week, then slowly move up to feeding a small piece once a day. If he develops diarrhea, stop feeding him produce and allow the diarrhea to resolve before trying again.Herbs, such as basil and coriander, are also good to feed your dwarf hamster., Protein is an important nutrient for your dwarf hamster. Fortunately, there are several great protein sources from which you can choose. For example, raw and unsalted seeds, such as sunflower, flax, and sesame, are high in protein. Lentils are another good protein source.If you are not too squeamish, you can also feed him insects (grasshoppers, earthworms, crickets), which are high in protein.Consider purchasing these from your local pet store, since the ones you capture outside may have microorganisms that could make your dwarf hamster sick.
Small amounts of dairy (plain yogurt, cottage) and meat (turkey, chicken) are also good protein sources., Natural sources of fiber, such as timothy hay and alfalfa hay, are good sources of fiber. Your dwarf hamster may not be a fan of hay, but you can give him a small amount to see if he will like it., Hard treats help your dwarf hamster keep his incisors filed down, which is good for his overall dental hygiene. You can let him gnaw on small dog biscuits, commercial hamster treats, or a small branch taken from a fruit-bearing tree.Your dwarf hamster can have soft treats, too. Examples of soft treats include whole wheat bread and scrambled eggs., Water is just as important to your dwarf hamster’s diet as food. Buy a hamster-sized water bottle with a stem and ball bearing from your local pet store. The ball regulates how much water comes out each time the hamster takes a drink.Do not give your hamster a water bowl or dish. While it might seem like a good thing to do, a water bowl or dish will actually result in a watery mess in your hamster’s cage.Watery messes can lead to mold growth that could make your hamster sick.
Fill the water bottle completely to create a vacuum inside the bottle. This will prevent water from leaking out when you refill it.Position the bottle inside the cage so that it is out of direct sunlight. Direct sunlight can cause algae to form inside the bottle. This will not make your dwarf hamster sick, but it will mean that you will need to clean his water bottle more often.The water bottle can be secured to the inside of the cage with two small clips that you can find at your local pet store, in case the clips didn’t already come with the bottle., Although there are a lot of human foods that you can feed your hamster, there are other foods that can make him sick and should be kept out of his diet. For example, there are certain fruits and vegetables that you should not feed your dwarf hamster, including tomato leaves, raw potatoes, and onions.Citrus fruits (oranges, lemons) should also be avoided because they are too acidic for him.


A watermelon’s water content is too high for him.Almonds contain cyanic acid, which can make your dwarf hamster very sick.Fruit seeds can be harmful to your dwarf hamster. If you would like to feed your dwarf hamster fruits that have seeds (apples, peaches, plums), make sure to remove the seeds first.Chocolate contains a substance called theobromine that can negatively affect your dwarf hamster’s circulatory system., The ideal food bowl for your dwarf hamster is small and ceramic. If you purchase a large bowl, you will be more likely to overfeed him. Also, large bowls take up a lot of cage space. Ceramic bowls are chew-resistant, which is a benefit over plastic bowls. Scratches due to chewing can lead to bacterial growth, so a ceramic bowl will decrease the likelihood of bacteria growing in or on the bowl.Ceramic bowls are also very sturdy, which makes them difficult to overturn, unlike plastic food bowls.Place the food bowl as far away as possible from your hamster’s designated ‘bathroom.’ Hamsters choose one spot in the cage to do all of their business. Once you have figured out where that spot is, make sure to put the food bowl on the opposite side of the cage.Clean the food bowl once a week when you clean your dwarf hamster’s cage., There is some debate as to whether hamsters should be fed in the morning of evening. A benefit to feeding them in the evening is that they will already be awake, since they are nocturnal animals. On the other hand, feeding them in the morning means that food will be there when they wake up sporadically throughout the day.Whichever time of day you choose to feed your dwarf hamster, remain consistent with feeding him at the same time.
Remember that dwarf hamsters have a very high metabolism, so they will need access to food at all times., Your dwarf hamster's diet should contain a variety of foods so that he receives all of the nutrients he needs in the correct amounts.However, your dwarf hamster may not like everything that you feed him. If you notice that he's consistently not eating a certain food, switch it out for something else.


For example, if you notice that he doesn't like one kind of fruit (e.g., apple), replace with it another fruit (e.g., banana). Keeping a variety of foods will allow you to easily switch out one food for another.
Discontinue feeding him food that makes him sick (e.g., diarrhea caused by eating watermelon)., He will only need about one tablespoon of hamster food each day, plus the occasional treat and fresh food. While a tablespoon of food might look like a lot compared to these tiny creatures, dwarf hamsters actually have very fast metabolisms and can eat the same amount as their larger cousins.Do not be tempted to fill his empty food bowl. Hamsters have cheek pouches in which they will stuff their food to save for later. They also have a tendency to store their food under their cage bedding.The fact that your dwarf hamster’s food bowl is empty does not necessarily mean that he has eaten all of his food.

, This is especially important for fruits and vegetables, since they can quickly become spoiled and moldy.Feed only the amount of fruit that your dwarf hamster can eat in a day. This may take some trial and error before you determine what that amount is.

Wash the carrot thoroughly.,
Cut it up into small parts.,
Trim down sharp edges.,
Use fresh carrots with no additives.",How to Prepare Carrots for Your Hamster1," Produce purchased in the supermarket is often sprayed with commercial pesticides before being picked and sold. It's a good idea to wash carrots thoroughly before serving them to a hamster.


Make sure your carrot is free of any bruises or damage. Cut off any bruised or damaged sections. Then, wash your own hands for about 20 seconds in warm water using soap.Hold the carrot under cool running water. Rub the carrot as you wash it to get rid of any dirt or grime.Dry the carrot with a clean paper cloth or towel.;
, As hamsters are small, you'll need to the cut the carrot before serving. Cut it into tiny pieces. If you have a food processor or a cheese shredder, consider using this device on the carrot to grind it into thin, shredded segments. This will be easier for your hamster to eat.

, After cutting the carrot, check for sharp edges. You should not give your hamster food that has sharp edges. These can puncture the insides of your hamster's mouth and, in rare cases, even cause an abscess. If you see any pointy edges on the carrot, cut them off with a knife to form a more rounded edge., Dried vegetables made for human consumption often contain additives and preservatives that might not be safe for your hamster. Only use fresh carrots that have not been processed. These are the safest and healthiest for your hamster."

Give your hamster pellet food.,
Feed your hamster a variety of foods.,
Keep the fruits and vegetables to a minimum.,
Start young.,
Place a new food item in their food dish.,
Introduce the food gradually over a period of days.,
Feed your hamster smaller portions.,
Stick with the staples.,
Cater to your pet’s preferences.,
Don’t overfeed your hamster.",How to Introduce New Foods to Your Hamster," The most common staple of a hamster’s diet should be the food pellets that you can buy at pet stores specifically intended for hamsters. These pellets contain a variety of seeds and grains that will help give your hamster most of the protein and nutrients it needs on a daily basis.You should provide approximately one tablespoon of pellet or seed mixture food to your hamster each day, supplemented with treats for variety.;
, For your hamster to achieve maximum health, it is important that you give it a diverse selection of food. In addition to the food pellets/seed mixtures, you can also feed your hamster various fruits, vegetables, dog biscuits, or a small branch from a fruit-bearing tree.Harder treats like dog biscuits and fruit branches should be offered only once a week. But they will also help wear down your hamster’s teeth, which will be good for your pet as it ages.
Don’t feed your hamster citrus fruits or onions. These food items will give your hamster an upset stomach., Giving your hamster fruits and vegetables occasionally (even small daily amounts) is a good idea to help them maintain a balanced diet.However, too many fruits and vegetables can lead to diarrhea and other physical problems, so be sure to limit the amount that you give them. Think of it as more of a treat, rather than a main part of their diet.Some good fruits/vegetables to try out with your hamster are peas, carrots, banana, broccoli, grapes, cucumber, apple, and celery., Hamsters are more likely to grow accustomed to new foods if you start introducing them to new things when they are very young (even just a few weeks old). The older you let your hamster get before trying new foods, the more likely it will be to prefer what it is used to and refuse the new items., The best way to see if your hamster will accept a new kind of food is to give them a small portion and see how they react. Give your hamster access to the new food type by placing a tiny piece of it in your hamster’s food bowl alongside its regular food. , Give your hamster the food you normally would, but add a tiny bit of a new food gradually for several days. This will allow your pet to become accustomed to the new food while still having access to the food you already know it will eat.Introducing the new food slowly will also give your hamster time to adjust to the new food and avoid any potential negative side effects like an upset stomach.

, If your hamster seems resistant to trying new foods, start feeding it several times a day in smaller portions. But don’t refill your pet’s food bowl until it has eaten most of the contents from the previous feeding., While it is important to provide a healthy, balanced diet for your hamster, don’t get too caught up in the extras. Your hamster’s diet should consist mostly of pellet/seed mixture food with smaller amounts of additional items (as discussed above)., If your hamster seems to like broccoli, but you’re always throwing away the bits of celery you offer it, then take that as a sign that your hamster doesn’t like celery. Pay attention to what is left over in the hamster’s cage when you clean it every week. If you see the same foods end up as waste repeatedly, it might be time to try a different food. , Hamsters are notorious for filling their cheeks with food and continuing to beg for more. However, hamsters won’t eat everything you give them, so be mindful. They will hoard the extra food in their bedding, which may begin to rot and become unhealthy for the hamster to be around. Only feed your hamster as much food as it needs to live comfortably."

Prepare the food bowl.,
Introduce new foods in small amounts.,
Allow your hamster to try the carrot.",How to Prepare Carrots for Your Hamster2," You should serve your hamster food and treats in a small bowl. Go for a ceramic food dish over a plastic one. Ceramic dishes are sturdier and hamsters are less likely to chew on them. Place the bowl in an area of the cage that's far away from where your hamster usually uses the bathroom., New foods, even healthy foods, should be introduced slowly. Unfamiliar substances can bother a hamster's digestion, causing constipation or diarrhea. Give your hamster only a small portion of the carrot at first, like one thin slice or shred., After placing the carrot in your hamster's bowl, allow him to eat his new food. You can try mixing the carrot in with his regular pellets or dry food to try to encourage him to taste the carrot.


Not every hamster will take to every type of vegetable. Your hamster may simply dislike carrots. If this is the case, there are a variety of other vegetables you can add to your hamster's diet.

"
"
Watch for digestive changes.,
Increase the amount of carrot if your hamster enjoys it.,
Consider introducing your hamster to other fresh veggies.",How to Prepare Carrots for Your Hamster3," You want to make sure your hamster is able to digest carrots well. If your hamster has trouble processing carrots, you'll want to remove them from his diet. Keep an eye on your hamster for a few days after introducing the new food to make sure he's able to keep it down.


Examine your hamster's rear end. If you notice any smears or stains, he may have diarrhea. A wet tail is also a sign of diarrhea in a hamster. It may also indicate a bacterial infection in the gut.If you notice an absence of droppings in your hamster's cage, he may be suffering from constipation. This can happen when being introduced to a new food.
Any digestive problems that go on for longer than a week should be evaluated by a veterinarian.

, If your hamster digests the carrot and seems to enjoy the food, add more carrot to his diet. Gradually increase the amount of carrot you feed him.


However, keep the amount of carrot relatively small overall. Your hamster needs nutrients from his pellets and other store-bought foods. Too much of a certain food he enjoys, like carrots, may discourage him from eating his pellets., Hamsters enjoy a variety of fruits and vegetables as part of a balanced diet. For veggies, you can try squash, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, romaine lettuce, and spinach. For fruits, try berries, apples, bananas, and pears.Do not feed your hamster citrus fruit like lemons or oranges. Citrus fruit can be toxic to a hamster.Wash any produce you feed your hamster thoroughly. Always introduce new foods gradually.

Monitor your hamster at all times.",How to Use a Hamster Ball," While hamster balls are extremely popular, many people are critical of hamster balls because of the potential risks they pose to our small furry hamster friends. Before buying a hamster ball, you need to learn about and consider the numerous risks these popular toys can pose to your friend.


Hamster balls can create unneeded stress and anxiety for your furry friend.
If not used right, hamster balls can present physical dangers to your small friend.
Many veterinarians and animal rights activists have criticized hamster balls.;
, Choosing your hamster ball will depend on several factors. Before you even buy the ball, there are important things you need to consider so that your little friend will enjoy his/her exercise machine. Consider:


Make sure the hamster ball is big enough for your little friend. There are a number of varieties of hamsters (most popularly, dwarf and Syrian), so make sure that whatever ball you’ll be buying will be big enough for your hamster when he or she reaches maturity.
Choose a color. Hamster balls come in a wide variety of different colors. Try to avoid dark colors, so that you’ll be able to see your hamster clearly at all times.
Make sure your hamster ball has plenty of holes in it for ventilation. While most commercially produced hamster balls do have plenty of ventilation, you should still be cognizant of this when purchasing your ball.
Avoid using “homemade” or “custom” hamster balls unless the builder/designer has a lot of experience. Homemade balls might be dangerous – they could open up unexpectedly or lack enough ventilation for your furry friend., Before you even put your little friend into the ball, you should open it up and clean it. Many times, plastic animal toys come from the factory without being properly cleaned from potentially toxic and dangerous residues and films.

, Because of the nature of the hamster ball (a translucent piece of plastic), hamster balls tend to magnify light and trap heat inside. If you allow your hamster to play in his ball outside, you might be creating an extremely dangerous situation for your friend.


Hamsters are sensitive to sunlight.
Hamsters who play in their ball in the sunlight might tend to overheat or dehydrate.
Limit your hamsters to indoors or at the very least to extremely overcast (but not freezing) days outside., Even though playing in a ball might seem like a lot of fun for your hamster, your little friend can also get worn out, tired, and dehydrated real quickly. Make sure to monitor his or her time in the ball.


Take your hamster out when he or she is tired.
Begin with no more than 15 minutes.
If your hamster seems to handle it well, after 3 or 4 times, you can gradually increase the amount of time your hamster plays in the ball. Just make sure to monitor and use your best care and judgement.
If your hamster seems lethargic after playing in the ball, and does not recover quickly, consult your veterinarian., Hamster balls are relatively confined spaces. As a result, never put more than one hamster in a ball at one time. The balls are designed for one hamster, and one hamster alone. There are numerous dangers to putting more than one animal in a ball at a time:


The hamsters could get into a fight.
One hamster might not be as fit as the other, and could be thrown around as his or her friend is moving the ball.
The hamsters could become extremely stressed or anxious because of the confined space.

, Small children often do not understand that animals are autonomous lifeforms that feel pain and are fragile. As a result, never let a small child play with a hamster while the hamster is in a ball. At the same time, never let a small child play with any animal unattended. This will help safeguard the life of the animal and the welfare of the child., Letting other animals play around a hamster is creating a dangerous situation for the hamster. As small domesticated animals, hamsters are vulnerable and fragile animals. When your hamster is in his or her ball playing, do not let other animals play in the same area.


Close off any area that your hamster is playing in.
Dogs or cats might see your hamster as a toy and try to rip its stuffing out.
Larger pets might be confused and might not understand what the hamster and his or her ball is doing.
If you do have two hamsters in two separate balls, it is okay to let them play in the same area. Just make sure to monitor them so they don’t run into each other or hurt themselves., Caring for and cleaning a hamster ball is much like caring for and cleaning a hamster’s cage. You need to clean the ball regularly as to prevent bacteria and other waste from building up and possibly harming your little furry friend.


Clean the hamster ball after every use, if possible.
Clean the hamster ball at least every couple of uses, no matter what.
Clean the hamster ball immediately if your hamster has had an accident in it., Perhaps the most challenging part of getting your hamster to use his or her ball is finding a time that they actually want to use it. You’ve got to time this properly, because if your hamster is tired or just not in the mood, they’re not going to do anything, and they’ll just sit there. Consider:


Choosing a time when your hamster is active.
Don’t choose a time directly before or directly after feeding.
Once you’ve used the ball a few times, it should be easier to figure out when your hamster wants to play in his or her ball., Hamster balls often have two designs to open them. Either way, you’ll have to twist the ball or the entrance open in order to let your hamster in. Make sure to do this gently, as you don’t want to damage your ball.


Some hamster balls are separated into two sides, and you’ll twist one side off the other to open it.
Some hamster balls have a small circular opening on one side of the sphere. You’ll have to twist the door of the ball open to let your hamster in.
If your hamster ball is designed differently, consult your instructions., Best practice is to open the ball and allow your hamster to enter on their own accord. You don’t want to throw your hamster in there and traumatize him or her for no reason. If your hamster does not want to go in, try again later.


Open the ball and direct your hamster toward the opening. You can guide him or her, but don’t throw them in against their own will.
Try putting a treat in to lure your hamster in. If your hamster goes for the treat, slowly close the ball and allow your hamster to eat the treat before anything else.
If your hamster is still reluctant, place the ball inside his or her cage to allow him or her to get used to the ball. Just make sure to watch them, as they might hurt themselves playing in a ball that is not secured., Once your hamster has boarded the ball on their own accord, twist the ball shut and make sure it clicks and is secure so your hamster cannot escape. This is extremely important, as you don’t want the ball to open while your hamster is running around.

, After you’ve loaded your furry friend into his or her ball, apply a little tape to two sides in order to provide an extra layer of protection against the ball opening. This will serve a dual purpose of keeping your hamster safe and making sure he or she does not escape into the wilds of your home.


Apply the tape smoothly to the crack that separates the two sides of the sphere (or on the entrance to the ball).
Make sure that the pieces of tape are not available inside of the sphere. You don’t want your little friend chewing on or swallowing the tape.
Make sure your ball is dry when applying tape., Once your hamster has boarded, the ball is secure, and taped, then move the ball to a flat surface where your hamster will safely be able to move around. Carpet is best for this and will limit the vibrations and other stresses to the ball and to the hamster., If they stop, do not force them to roll. It either means they are sniffing their surroundings or just tired. If they stop rolling for at least 7 minutes, it means they are probably tired and let them back in their cage. If they get stuck in a corner do not pick them up and move them because they are probably just resting. They can get out on their own., One mistake people often make with hamster balls is to let their hamster roam around freely in their ball. This could have potentially devastating and certainly dangerous results. In order to prevent your little friend from getting hurt, you need to monitor your hamster at all times when he or she is in a hamster ball. Consider:


Sitting on the floor with your hamster when he or she is in the ball.
Closing off an area, like a living room or bedroom so that your hamster won’t be able to leave your site.
Make sure that your hamster won’t be able to access any stairs or similar hazards while in his or her ball.
Never let your hamster roam around unattended – in or out of a ball."

Rinse off the popsicle sticks to remove food residue.,
Glue the popsicle sticks together using non-toxic glue.,
Place the ladder in the cage.",How to Build Hamster Toys out of Household Items1," The number of popsicle sticks that you will need will depend on how tall you want to make the ladder., The stickiness of food residue could make it difficult for your hamster to walk on the ladder.Allow the popsicle sticks to dry completely.

, It is important to use non-stick glue because your hamster may nibble on the sticks and inadvertently eat some of the glue. You would not want your hamster to get sick from eating a part of his toy.Allow the glue to dry completely.

, You can get creative with where you place the ladder in the cage.

Gather together the materials you will need to make a tunnel.,
Cut circular holes in the cardboard boxes.,
Insert the toilet paper tubes into the holes.,
Cover the tunnel with bedding.",How to Build Hamster Toys out of Household Items2," You will need several empty toilet paper tubes, bedding, some small cardboard boxes, and a cutting instrument (knife, scissors, box cutter).Make a Fun Hamster Tube Town


Instead of cardboard boxes, you could also use shoe boxes, milk cartons, or empty boxes of tea.
Because these boxes are not transparent, you will not be able to easily see your hamster once he's inside the tunnel. Even if you can't see him, trust that he's having fun in there!, These holes will be what the toiler paper tubes go through. To make sure that the holes you cut are the correct size, it may be helpful to first trace the outline of the tube onto the box.Make a Fun Hamster Tube Town


Cut the holes in different parts of the cardboard boxes to give your hamster more options when entering and exiting the tunnel.

, If the tubes do not fit easily into the holes, make the holes a little bit bigger. Forcing the tubes into the holes could distort their shape, making it difficult for your hamster to walk through them.


Use non-toxic glue to secure the tubes in the holes.

, This will create a little bit of extra work and challenge for your hamster to play in the tunnel.


Even though the tunnel will be covered with bedding, leave an open end where your hamster can gain easy access to it.

Secure the walkway to the opening of the second floor box.",How to Build Hamster Toys out of Household Items3," To make a two-story hamster house, you will need two empty tissue boxes, a pair of scissors, a ruler, non-toxic glue, several empty toilet paper tubes, and several small pieces of cloth.Square tissue boxes will work better than rectangular boxes to make the house.

, Removing the plastic will make it easier for your hamster to go through the openings., Stacking the boxes on top of each other will create the upper and lower levels of the house.Stack the boxes so that the top opening of each box is facing to the right or to the left.
The openings should not be on the same side of the house.

, Measuring this distance will allow you to know what length of tube you will need to create a walkway up to the upper level.

, You may need to place several toilet paper tubes within one another to make a long enough walkway from the lower to upper level.Use non-toxic glue to attach the tubes to each other, if necessary.
Use non-toxic glue to attach cloth to the inside of the walkway. The cloth will give your hamster extra traction so that he can easily walk up and down the tube.Do not make the incline so steep that your hamster will have trouble walking up or down the tube.

, Use non-toxic glue, rather than tape, to attach the walkway to the second floor box. Securing the walkway will ensure that it does not move when the hamster walks up or down the tube.If the opening is rounded, use scissors cut the bottom of the opening into a straight line.

The more creative you are with the directions of the tube, the more challenging the maze will be for your hamster.


If you choose to place the maze outside of your hamster's cage, closely supervise your hamster so that he does not escape or injure himself.Other household materials that you can use to create a maze include empty shoe boxes, cylindrical oatmeal boxes, and wrapping paper tubes.

, The scent of the maze will encourage them to move even faster through it to get to the treat.

You should set up a home for your hamster before buying one. You can use a wire cage as long as it has a solid bottom to protect your hamster’s feet and the mesh is small enough that your hamster can’t escape or get stuck. You can also use a 20-gallon aquarium—just make sure it has a wire mesh cover to allow ventilation.Unlike other solitary hamster species, Roborovski hamsters can live in pairs. Just remember to have a separate cage available, incase the pair does not work out. You should always separate them immediately, if they fight.If you plan to have two, try to purchase them from the same litter. You’ll have fewer potential problems if they grow up together. You should also ensure that both hamsters are the same sex to avoid them breeding and producing large litters.Be aware that even hamsters raised together from a young age can still fall out and fight. You should avoid large-scale hamster colonies to prevent the chances of this.
Never house Roborovski hamsters with other species of hamster—or other species of animal—as they will become territorial and fight.;
, Roborovski hamsters love to burrow, hide, and dig, so make sure you put plenty of bedding into the habitat. A layer of about three inches will be fine. A generous layer of four to five inches will certainly be appreciated.


Soft white cellulose fiber (Carefresh) and aspen shavings are both suitable choices for your hamster. If you choose wood shavings never use pine or cedar as they can cause a number of health problems and contain harmful oils that are toxic to hamsters.Avoid bedding that contains long fibers. Synthetic forms of bedding—such as those made of polyester fibers—are notorious for tangling around limbs and cutting off circulation.

, Small plastic trays with a hood are available. They are designed to fit in the corner of a hamster cage. You put special hamster litter inside, which helps to neutralize odors. Most hamsters will use these quite happily instead of soiling their cages. This is optional. Clean the litter pan regularly since your hamster will be put off using it if the area is too soiled., Your hamster will thrive on a steady diet of rodent chow (blocks) and a good food, such as Hazel Hamster, or Vitakraft. Pellets or just one type of food lacks variety and nutrition. Keep in mind that some hamster foods like Vitakraft lack in protein, so you should feed hamsters eggs, and food that has protein in it. You can also provide seed mixes with pellets, grains, seeds, and dried vegetables.However, do not provide seed mixes alone since your hamster can eat selectively around the tasty bits, which leads to an imbalanced diet.


A hamster should have about 1.5 teaspoons of pellets or blocks, or as feeding directions instruct.
Two to three times a week, you can also provide a bite-sized amount of fresh fruit and vegetables for your hamster. Consider carrots, lettuce, spinach, and apples.Scatter them around the cage to let your hamster forage for them.
Never feed your hamster onions, uncooked beans, chocolate, or any junk food since it can be toxic to the animal.Provide fresh water daily in an inverted bottle with a sipping tube that attaches to the cage low enough for your dwarf hamster to reach it.This will prevent your hamster from accidentally soiling his or her water supply and getting sick.

, Choose a wheel with a solid outer tread plate since wired wheels can injure your hamster’s feet. When the hamster is in the wheel make sure his back is straight and that he does not have to bend his back backwards in order to fit in under the central axle as this leads to back problems.Allow your hamster to exercise in the wheel daily, but remove it from the habitat when you aren’t supervising to prevent the chance of injury.


Toys for a Roborovski hamster include tubes, tunnels, hideouts, toilet paper rolls, wooden chews (these will keep your pet's teeth trimmed, as the teeth in hamsters do not stop growing), and bridges. Avoid anything made of soft plastic that can create a choking hazard.Never use any pet store toy that has fluff or filling of any kind.Your hamster will most likely store it in his or her mouth to use it for a nest, but the fluff is harmful to a hamster’s system and can create a choking hazard. Try using toilet paper instead as this is safe for your hamster.
Swap toys out of the habitat every few days. By rotating them, you can help maintain your hamster’s interest in the toys.

, Roborovski hamsters are naturally curious little animals, and they relish the chance to leave their enclosures to explore what lies beyond their habitats.


An exercise ball is a fantastic way to let your hamster run all over the house without having to worry about injury or escape. Just make sure to keep the ball on the ground floor of multilevel homes to avoid dangerous tumbles down stairs.
Hamster playpens are also available on the market, and these allow plenty of space to provide toys and treats. You can also use a very large storage bin as an alternative. Don't use cardboard boxes, though, because hamsters can chew holes in them and escape.
Hamsters love to explore rooms, so if you decide to allow your pet to do so, remove all dangerous items and make sure the room is inescapable. Roborovski hamsters can fit through gaps as small as their skulls. Always supervise your hamster when he or she is out of the habitat.
No matter what type of play area you use for your pet, fill it with toys, hiding places, and some tasty treats. You need playing areas to keep your hamster active and stimulated.

, Robo hamsters also love rolling around in a container full of bathing sand. Purchase chinchilla sand (not chinchilla dust, which is very harmful). Select a long dish or bowl (preferably plastic) and fill it up before allowing your hamster to roll around in it. Roborovski hamsters enjoy a sand bath, but water will stress them out, so do not try to give your hamster a water bath., If you are going to purchase two Roborovski hamsters and keep them together, you will need two of everything (water bottles, nesting boxes, hideouts, toys, etc.). This will reduce risks of fighting. You must also avoid the use of upper levels, platforms, and extra cages connected with tubes in the habitat as it will cause territorial issues and fights.

, Once a week, remove everything from the habitat and clean it using hot water. You can use a little vinegar on smelly areas, but ensure that you rinse the areas thoroughly after using it.Fill the cage with fresh bedding as you put it back together.


Don’t forget to give all of your hamster’s toys and exercise wheel a scrub as well when you clean the habitat., Once you’ve set up your hamster’s habitat, you’re ready to bring the hamster home with you. Make sure you purchase from a reputable pet store in person. Do not buy online since you want to take a good look at your hamster before purchasing. Adopting is recommended, you are giving hamsters a second chance at life.

, Robo hamsters are most active at night, so you’ll get the best look at your hamster if you visit the pet store shortly before it closes. If you go during the day, the hamster will likely be sleeping., Ideally, you want a young hamster that is only four to six weeks old. An adult hamster will be between 2-2.5” long, so pick a youngster measuring less than two inches., The hamster should be round, lively, active, and alert. The eyes should be clear, ears erect, and the fur should be dry.


Don’t buy any hamster at a pet shop if one of them has wet fur around its rump. This is a sign of a disease called wet tail, and it has probably spread to the other hamsters if you see it in one. If any fur is wet at all, avoid buying hamsters from that store., A responsible shop will keep male and female hamsters separate to prevent breeding. You don’t want to bring a hamster home and end up having her give birth to a large litter a week later. Reputable shops should also guarantee the sex of their hamsters, allowing you to purchase Robo hamsters in pairs without fear of breeding.

, You want to test the behavior toward people of the hamsters in the enclosure. They’ll likely all run away from your hand initially, but choose a hamster that peeks out and sniffs at your hand after the initial hiding. Hamsters displaying this behavior will be easier to handle and less scared of you later on.


Roborovski hamsters are naturally nervous and flighty, so you’ll need to give them some time before one will come out and investigate you.

, Once you’ve taken all of these steps into consideration, you’re ready to pick the best candidate. Purchase the Robo hamster that displays these qualities and melts your heart.

, The pet store may offer a traveling kit to help you transport your new hamster home with you. If not, be prepared to bring something from home with some bedding, a little food, and a few toys. The goal is to make the journey as stress free for the hamster as possible.


Avoid using anything made of cardboard since the hamster can chew through it and escape.

, Your new hamster will be very stressed after being handled and removed from its familiar enclosure. Go straight home without making other stops and place your new pet into the already set up habitat slowly and gently.

, You need to let your new hamster adapt to his or her new habitat and surroundings before you attempt to handle or tame the hamster. Keep in mind that some hamsters might need more time to adjust to their new home. You should have enough food, water, and toys in the habitat for the first few days, although you'll soon need to start changing food, water, and toys daily.


Cover the aquarium with a light cloth to allow your new pet to adjust to and explore its new habitat in privacy. This is the crucial recovery and adjustment period, so it will take longer if you disturb the hamster.
If there are friends, guests, and/or children in the house, make sure they know not to go near the hamster's enclosure. You'll probably want to watch your hamster explore its new home, but Roborovski hamsters are especially nervous and will hide and become very stressed, so resist the temptation for the first few days.

, During the taming process—and even after when your hamster is comfortable with you—always make sure your hamster is awake before you try to handle him or her. A sleepy hamster is disorientated and may nip if feeling grumpy or annoyed. To tame a hamster, put a treat in your hand and give it to your hamster. If it runs away, try again later. Once your hamster is comfortable after a few days of taking treats, put it in your palm this time. He/she will probably sit in your hand and eat it. When he is comfortable sitting in your hand, lift him up a few inches, and put him back down. Repeat process for the next few days, until he gets used to the feeling of lifting. Then try lifting him for longer periods of time, then higher, then out of the cage. Robo hamsters are very timid, so it might take a while to tame him. It is very difficult to tame them, so don't be surprised when taming doesn't go well. You should always wash your hands before and after reaching into the habitat or handling your hamster as well. They have poor eyesight, and smelling food on your fingers can lead to an accidental nip as well.

, After several days, you can start going about the daily maintenance of your hamster’s habitat. Speak softly to alert your Roborovski hamster of your presence. Start the daily chores—removing old food, toys, and soiled bedding and placing in new food, and a bunch of new toys. Change the water from the water bottle as well.


Doing the daily chores will get your hamster used to your hand being in the habitat. Use slow and careful movements at first.

, It’s typical for your new hamster to sniff your hand and then run away again. Don’t try to handle the hamster yet just because he or she will sniff your hand. Try offering treats as well, but have patience and allow the hamster to set the pace. Don’t try to force the behavior.Another option to help tame your hamster is to scoop him or her up in a shoebox or another small box that the hamster cannot escape. Place your hand flat in the box and allow the hamster to sniff at you that way.If the hamster can’t simply hide, he or she will be more likely to approach you.
If your hamster runs away and hides, squeaks if you try to touch it, or rolls on its back and/or bares its teeth, then the pet is only feeling stressed, and you should try again with the taming techniques later.

, Remember, all hamsters have different personalities. If your hamster is interested in you after a couple days, that’s great. If your hamster still shows no affection to you after a month of training, then your hamster may not ever develop a fondness for human interaction, and you need to respect this. You can still enjoy your hamster by watching your pet play in its playpens and/or exercise ball.

, Once your hamster no longer fears you, you can bring it into a designated play area of your house. Roborovski hamsters love playtime outside of their habitats, so you'll be pleasing your pet and keeping it stimulated by letting it run around.


Supervise your hamster if it is allowed to explore a room. Your hamster should spend at least an hour or two outside of the habitat daily whether in an exercise ball, a playpen, or running around a secure space under your supervision. Always switch the toys in the play areas just as you should in its habitat.

, If your hamster does start showing signs of comfort around you, then you can begin handling and playing with it. They generally have poor eyesight, so your hamster may accidentally jump from your hands at times. You should sit down, so the hamster doesn't fall from a dangerous height.


You should additionally always use two cupped hands when handling your hamster to prevent accidental falls.

, Your hamster will see them as a threat and become stressed, even if it is in the safety of its habitat. The stress opens the door to illness, and this is not good. Keep other household pets away from the room in which your hamster is kept.

Decide how many hamsters you're looking to keep.,
Make a decision on what you're looking for in your hamster aesthetically.,
Account for how much time you will have to play with the animals.,
Look around for any hiding places in the area and account for how well you would be able to catch your escapees.,
Decide how much money you'd be willing to invest in medical care.,
Look at the hamsters closely when buying.",How to Decide Between Syrian and Dwarf Hamsters," If you want to keep more than one hamster, Syrian hamsters are not an option unless you are keeping multiple cages as they are a territorial breed and will fight over space. Dwarf hamsters, however, can be kept in the same cage given that they are all the same sex. If you choose to keep a Dwarf hamster, keep an eye on the hamsters to make sure that they are getting along well and don't have troubles with space. Remember that bigger is better when it comes to cage size.;
, If you want a small hamster with beady eyes and limited color variety, a Dwarf hamster may suit you better than a Syrian hamster. However if you'd prefer a large hamster with a wider variety of colors and fur lengths, you may prefer Syrian hamsters. Dwarf hamsters tend to have fluffier fur whereas Syrian hamsters have fur more similar to a cat's. Given that Syrian hamsters are larger, it's important to account for more cage size and space if you choose this breed. Comfort for your pet should be the main focus point over any aesthetic preference.

, Attention is very necessary for hamsters and the amount of energy you invest in playing with them can affect their entire nature. With lots of attention, the hamster will remember you, approach you on it's own, and be excited to be held and pet by you. In general, Dwarf hamsters tend to be more timid around humans and will remember you less well if you don't play with them everyday. Plus they tend to bite if they don't remember you. Syrian hamsters, however, tend to remember their owners more and be friendlier.

, Although Dwarf hamsters are smaller and less easy to find in large rooms, Syrian hamsters are even faster and you have to keep a good eye on them when you have them out.Syrian hamsters also tend to remember what hiding spots are better as well given that their memory is better. If you aren't prepared to regularly take out your hamster and find them when they escape or run off, then a hamster isn't something you should be investing in in the first place.

, Each species has its own distinct disease that it tends to be prone to. Syrian hamsters are especially prone to a disease known as wet-tail which they tend to get when they are young due to stress. It is highly uncommon in old age. This disease tends to be highly lethal and needs to be spotted within the first 24-48 hours. It's extremely rare for the hamster to acquire the illness after the first four weeks. Dwarf hamsters, however, tend to be more prone to diabetes. This means that they will need special care in their food Occasionally the hamster will be given a small dosage of insulin, however that isn't usually administered due to the fact that mistake in dosage can result in immediate death.

, Despite the tendencies of the breed, handling the hamster themselves will tell you most about their nature. If the hamster is shaking or quick to bite, they're likely not a good choice as they will be a hassle to tame. If you're having trouble deciding between the two breeds, then choosing off of in-store personality may be the best option for you.

Know when it is a good time to run your hamster through the maze.",How to Build a Hamster Maze," There should be no other animals inside the room, as they could stress the hamster. Cover any possible hiding spots in the room in case the hamster gets out of the maze.Hamster hiding spots include boxes and under furniture.;
, Because hamsters like to chew through everything, it is important that you make your maze out of materials that are safe for hamsters. Because of this, it is best to avoid plastic. Here are two popular options:


Cardboard can be sourced from boxes, presentation boards, and even toilet paper rolls. It may not be very durable, but it will be the cheapest option. Make sure that it is thick and strong, or the hamster will chew holes into the walls and run away.Wood is sturdier than cardboard, but also more expensive. When buying wood, make sure that it is a hardwood, such as birch, oak, or walnut. Avoid resinous woods, such as like pine or cedar; they are toxic for hamsters. Also, make sure that the wood is smooth and free of any cracks or coarse grain; this would seriously injure your hamster.You can use wooden boards or blocks.

, Hot glue would be the most suitable for cardboard while wood glue would be the best for wood. Whatever glue you buy, make sure that it is non-toxic, in case the hamster chooses to chew on it. You do not want to use nails or screws, even if you are making your maze out of wood; the sharp metal can hurt your pet.

, Look for a wooden board or a sheet of wood that is about 2 feet by 2 feet (centimeters). This will be the base for your maze.


Consider covering the maze with a sheet of plastic. This will make it easier to clean things up if the hamster makes a mess. Be sure to glue or tape the edges of the plastic sheet down so that it does not slide off.

, This will keep the hamster from running away in case it manages to escape the maze. You can also put the maze into a bathtub or a hamster playpen. If you are using a bathtub, however, make sure that the drain is plugged up and that the bottom of the tub is covered with a cloth or towel., You can either come up with your own on a sheet of paper, or you can use an existing one. Two great places to find ideas for mazes are on the backs of cereal boxes and coloring mats from chain restaurants; many restaurants offer paper place mats with puzzles and mazes for children to solve. Do not worry about the height of the walls yet.


Make sure that your maze has straight lines instead of curves; this will make it easier to build.

, You can either enlarge it simply by drawing it bigger, or you can use a photocopier. Aim for something that is 2 feet by 2 feet (centimeters). You can either draw directly onto the base, or you can draw it on a sheet of paper and then glue the paper to the base.

, It will be shaped like a rectangle. The length needs to be the same as one of the straight lines in your maze. The height should be twice the height of your hamster; this will prevent the hamster from climbing out of the maze. Repeat this process for the other walls.


If you do not have enough material to make the walls so high, you can make them the same height as the hamster, but then you will need to cover the entire maze with a sheet of wire mesh so that the hamster doesn't climb out.
Consider numbering the walls. Draw a small number on the rectangle you drew, and the same number next to the matching wall in the maze. This will help you remember which wall goes where.

, If you are using cardboard, you can use a box cutter or an Xacto blade. If you are using a wooden board, then you will have to use a saw.


Try cutting a few arches into the walls to make smaller doorways for the hamster. This could make it more interesting.

, Draw a line of glue along one of the lines of your maze, and place the matching wall down. Wait until the glue hardens, or until the wall can stand up on its own, before moving onto the next. Be sure to add glue into the corners, where the walls join.

, Leave the entrance and exit open. You can always block the entrance with a piece of wood or cardboard once the hamster is inside.

, Do not keep it on a table. If the hamster somehow manages to escape, it may fall off the table and get hurt., You can leave a treat for your hamster at the end of the maze, or you can leave a treat at various points in the maze to help guide your hamster along. Not only can the treats be very rewarding for your hamster, but they can also help motivate the hamster to go through the maze. Try any of the following treats:Barley, oats, and quinoa
Flaxseed
Pumpkin seed, sesame seed, and sunflower seed
Vegetables, such as: broccoli, carrot, celery, corn, and green beans

, This will create a tunnel for the hamster to crawl through, and make it more like an obstacle course. Make sure that you poke a few small holes into the tube so that the hamster can breath.


To attach a tube to a wall, cut a hole in the wall first, then stick the tube into the hole. Secure the tube with some hot glue.

, This will make the maze easier to clean up in case the hamster soils it. The familiar flooring may also help the hamster feel more relaxed and at home.Avoid bedding that is made out of cedar or pine, as this is not safe for hamsters., You can also try using plastic bricks, but only if you know that your hamster will not chew on them. Simply arrange the bricks on your base in a maze pattern. If you want the design to be permanent, glue the blocks down using wood glue. If you do not want the maze to be permanent, do not glue them down; the hamster will not be strong enough to move the blocks aside.


Make sure that the blocks are twice as tall as your hamster. If you cannot find any blocks are that large enough, try stacking them, or covering the entire maze with a wire mesh.

, The hamster will start to remember the maze, and finished it faster each time.

, Because hamsters are nocturnal, you may not get very good or exciting results by putting the hamster into the maze during the daytime. Instead, try putting it in when its eyes appear bright and awake. This would most likely be in the evening, although you may be able to catch a few moments of playtime in the afternoon as well."

Get a suitable cage.,
Provide the cage with lots of bedding.,
Place the cage with care.",How to Care for Winter White Dwarf Hamsters1," The minimum cage size for one hamster is 360 square inches of floor space; the minimum for two is 720. It is recommended that you have cages larger than that, though. You can house two or more winter whites, as long as they are from the same litter. Make sure the cage is put where there is no direct sunlight.;
, About 3 inches (7.6 cm) of bedding or more. Do not use pine or cedar bedding for your winter white. Softwood beddings such as pine and cedar have dangerous chemicals which may cause respiratory problems for your hamster.

, Do not place the cage in front of a window. The hamster should not be under direct sunlight.

"
Exercise your hamster.,
Provide chew toys for your hamster.",How to Care for Winter White Dwarf Hamsters4," For helping them exercise, provide them with a solid wheel in their cage. Do not use wire or mesh wheels as it can cause bumble foot. Make sure the wheel is big enough so that your hamster's back isn't arching when it runs in the wheel, as that can cause back problems. If you want to bring your hamster out of the cage, provide a hamster ball or a playpen. Don't leave your hamster out for too long, because it can get stresses.

, A hamster's teeth really grow fast, especially dwarf hamsters. Provide them with chew toys such as wooden chews to help trim their teeth.

Visit the vet when needed.",How to Care for Syrian Hamsters," A good cage for a Syrian hamster is a cage with a minimum of 360 square inches of floor space. Never give your Syrian a cage any smaller than that because they will be severely cramped. Most pet store cages are too small; instead try a 20 gallon (75.7 L) long tank, a bin cage, or a DIY cage. Remember, a cage that is too small will lead your hamster to extreme boredom and severe stress. It doesn't matter if you see a cute cage at a pet store and think it must be okay because they're selling it there. The only exception to small cages is if you buy three or four and connect them together with tubes. Most cages at pet stores are too pricey anyways.


It's best to avoid ""starter cages"" or ""beginner cages""; these are much too small. Instead, purchase a cage suitable for the hamster's entire lifespan at the start, as this will save you money and bring much stress-relief in the future.
The 360 square inches (2322.58 square cm) of floor space does not include levels. Solely the ground floor must be 360 sq in. Levels do not count.;
, Remember that safe bedding is a must. Do not use sawdust, pine, or cedar (and any other wood-based) bedding because the oils from these wood types are harmful to your hamster. Avoid cotton as well. This could clog up your hamster's intestines and kill him, and it may also catch on your hamster's legs and break them as he tries to pull free. Use shredded paper, brands like Aspen, Care Fresh, Boxo , and Katyee. These are the most commonly found in pet stores. They keep odors down, are clean and cozy.


Sawdust should be made from untreated wood. When buying it at a pet store, check that the packaging says ""untreated."" Do not purchase sawdust from a wood mill or carpenter, as this wood is probably treated with chemicals that can be toxic to hamsters.
Cotton or string ""fluffy"" bedding types are extremely dangerous. These types of bedding kill thousands of pets even if the package says it's safe.The risk is that strands of bedding fiber get caught around a leg, then tighten to cut off the hamster's circulation. It will also more than likely break your hamster's fragile bones as it tries to struggle free. The leg becomes gangrenous and the hamster is too sick to withstand surgery. In some cases the hamster has to be euthanized on humane grounds.A great nesting material is toilet paper.Don't get anything with fragrances. You can shred/rip it to small pieces and place it around the cage or in the hamster house. Note that this is not a replacement for regular bedding.
Avoid cedar, redwood, and pine bedding, as they contain resin dust that can irritate your hamster's respiratory system. Aspen and Care Fresh are perfectly safe and comfortable options for hamsters.
You should also avoid any bedding materials coloured with inks or dyes as they may be harmful to your hamster's health if eaten.

, These vary from plastic houses (great for disinfecting and cleaning) to attractive wicker nests. Wicker nests are a much more natural environment for the hamster, but difficult to clean so you will need to dispose of such a house if the hamster soils inside. A hamster house is a must-have, so don't skip over it. A hamster, in the wild, lives in a ""den"" or a ""burrow"". It spends all of its day sleeping inside there, where it feels safe and protected from any threat. It also stores its food in its house. Note that some hamsters prefer to sleep beneath their wheel, but you still need a house.


Some people use hutches made for guinea pigs and rabbits for their hamsters, but these are good if you have a pregnant female that needs lots of space and won't want to climb all over her cage.

, Most pet stores offer cardboard boxes, but hamsters can chew right through them. Buy a carry-case made for Syrians. Cheap ones with lids that come right off and are easy to escape from are no good; you'll need to purchase a proper carry case from a pet shop. They will be a much more expensive option, but also the better option, as this can be re-used whenever you need and are escape-proof. Do not bring your new hamster home in its cage.


It is also useful to have a reliable carry case at home, for those times when you need to transport the hamster safely to the vet.

, Wheels and accessories, like Hideaway Huts, made for Dwarf hamsters and mice are far too small for Syrian hamsters! Allow the hamster to have plenty of room to move around in, and make sure you have an 11-12 inch wheel; Wodent Wheels are best.


When buying a wheel, visualise an adult sized Syrian hamster inside. Your pet needs to be able to run on the wheel with its back straight. If the wheel is too small, the central spoke will cause the hamster to flex in the wrong direction (its back makes a ""U""). If in doubt, buy the largest wheel that will fit in the cage, such as a rat-wheel. Also, make sure that your wheel isn't made of wire or mesh material, because this can cause bumblefoot., Your hamster needs quiet to avoid stressing it with loud, sudden sounds. Keep the cage is out of the full sun, and do not keep hamster cages in a room where food is prepared.

, The average age is about 2 years. Let your hamster sleep as it gets older, and be prepared for vet trips, as older hamsters are prone to illness. If you have young children, and an older hamster becomes sick, take care to explain to them that the hamster is very old and may not recover, rather than get their hopes up.

, Transfer the hamster from the carrier to the cage, which should be set up beforehand. Leave the hamster alone after you put it in its cage, so that it can explore its new home and become used to it.

, After about 48 hours (2 days), slowly get to know how your hamster likes to be handled. Start by sitting down and talking to the hamster, in a calm, soothing voice, to get it used to your presence. When the hamster is awake and alert (so evening is the best time), try reaching in to stroke it.


Hamsters are not aggressive by nature and do not usually attack unless provoked. However, they do have poor eyesight, so if your hand smells of food they may bite a finger assuming it's something to eat. So wash your hands first. For this reason, it is a bad idea to hand feed hamsters, since they can confuse where the smell of the food is coming from and accidentally nibble your finger.
One option is to place a treat in the cage, (on a spoon) and whilst the hamster is eating his treat, gently stroke him. Take it slowly, let the hamster become used to you.

, Have short, non-aggressive interactions with the hamster several times a day until your pet is comfortable with you. Once the hamster accepts you stroking it, try scooping it gently into the palm of your hand. This may take a long time with aggressive females, but tame, friendly males will allow you to hold them after just a few days.


The ideal time to wait before picking up your hamster and taking it out of the cage to play is two to three weeks.
To hold your hamster, slide one hand under it and cup the other round the front of its body. Ensure you are gentle.
You should never start by picking your hamster up! Try holding out treats for it. If the hamster is too shy to take it from your hands, just put the treat down and wait for the hamster to take it.

, Hamsters need to be fed a good variety food, as well as the occasional treat. Commercial brand hamster foods, such as Hazel Hamster (Harry Hamster in the UK), are ideal. Because hamsters are hoarders, give a small quantity that you can be reasonably confident the hamster will eat quickly and not try to stash away.


Make sure the nutritional values are: 17-22% protein, 4-6% fat, and 8-10% fiber.
Some experts believe most hamster mixes are a little too low in protein to be perfectly balanced for the average Syrian hamster.It is a good idea to give your hamster the odd treat of hard boiled egg or cheese, cat food, or mealworms. Small bits of cooked chicken or scrambled egg are good sources of protein and may be given daily.
If the hamster does not take any excess treats away to eat later within 24 hours time, remove any uneaten goodies., For instance, never give your hamster seeds with husks. The sharp pointed seed husks may hurt the delicate lining of the cheek pouch.Also avoid giving foods with a high moisture content (cucumber or lettuce), since these are liable to have a laxative effect on the hamster's digestive system., Make this available at all times. A sipper bottle is ideal since this doesn't get contaminated with bedding or food in the same way a bowl does. Make sure to check the water level every day, so that your hamster never gets dehydrated.


Wash the inside with a bottle brush. It may look clean, but the inside of the bottle will become coated with harmful bacteria.
Use a hamster approved water bottle.
Filtered water is best, but tap is fine - as long as you dechlorinate the water, either by using dechlorination liquid/tablets or by leaving the water out in the open over night.

, This prevents your hamster from having to chew on its cage bars and potentially damaging his or her teeth, and it prevents the teeth from becoming overgrown. To reduce the risk of teeth overgrowing, give your hamster dog biscuits, dry whole wheat macaroni, or wood from orchard trees, such as apple, pear, plum or cherry.Provide mineral/salt blocks.

, Hamster cages should be cleaned out completely every week to 2-3 weeks, depending on your hamster and needs.They should also be ""spot cleaned,"" by removing fresh foods and cleaning toilet areas, each day, depending on the size and type of cage. To clean the cage, take the top off and empty all the dirty bedding and wood shavings and old food into a dustbin. Scrape out all the other remains. Go over the cage with a pet-made disinfectant, then dry it with tissues or kitchen roll, if preferred.


Wash out bowls and water bottle at the same time as cleaning the cage. Dust and rinse all items of the cage. Dry everything and fill the cage with fresh wood shavings, bedding, food, and water. Put all the items back in the cage and clip the top back on. A clean cage makes your Syrian hamster happy and healthy.
Try giving your hamster a ""hamster toilet,"" which is a plastic litter pan with a hood that fits snugly into the corner of the cage. Use the special hamster litter which you can purchase from pet stores, and clean the toilet every other day. Hamsters generally catch on quickly as to what the hamster toilet area is for, since instinct tells them to use one corner for toileting, and the confines of the toilet help them to feel secure.

, Disinfect the cage properly and change the bedding before putting your hamster back in. While you clean the cage, you can put your pet in a hamster ball and have someone supervise it.


The hamster ball must be the right size. Most balls are only 6"" wide, so most are too small for Syrian hamsters. Get a larger 10"" ball at a minimum.
Or, put the hamster in a pen, supervised, so it cannot escape. Cleaning the cage too often can cause stress; this does not mean do not clean your cage, rather, just clean it every other week and remember spot cleaning is your best friend.

, Syrian hamsters are the most friendly and sociable of the hamster family. They should receive attention everyday, but excessive handling can actually cause stress in Syrian hamsters, which can result in bad health. Handle your hamster for 10 minutes at a time, a couple times a day, and then spend time tidying up its cage, watching it run, dig, and burrow.


Be aware your hamster will be sleepy during the day, and most likely to be active at night. So, the best time to socialize is in the evening.
Keep your hamster happy with toys. You can buy toys at the pet store or make homemade ones. Never give rubber or non-digestible toys that the hamster could chew small pieces off and swallow. These are likely to cause a bowel obstruction.

, Most hamsters are crepuscular, meaning they are most active at dawn and dusk. Wake up your hamster slowly to prevent scaring your little friend. Some hamsters can nip if they are woken up roughly. Allow your hamster at least 30 minutes to wake up, let it get something to eat and drink and go potty before taking it out of its cage.

, Rush your hamster to the veterinarian clinic if the fur under its tail is always wet, if it shows signs of a cold, if it has lumps or bumps on its body, or it has gone off its food, water and playing times completely. In addition, you should take your hamster to the vet if it has watery eyes, has runny droppings (diarrhea), its teeth have broken, or if its claws need clipping.


Vets have got special clippers for hamster claws and know exactly how to do it. It is safer and better to leave this to the experts rather than trying it by yourself at home. Hamsters can't run on their wheels very well if they have long claws, since that hurts for them!

Pick out a hamster cage.,
Make adjustments for more than one hamster.,
Buy hamster bedding.,
Think about cage placement.,
Clean the cage often.",How to Care for Dwarf Hamsters1," Dwarf hamsters are only around 4 inches long, but they like having a lot of space to run around and play. The cage should be big enough to give the hamster room to move around in addition to holding the hamster's food, water, and toys.Choose from the following housing options:


A hamster aquarium. Buy a special aquarium made for hamsters or choose one designed for fish, which will do just as well. Glass aquariums protect hamsters from cold, drafty temperatures, and they provide an excellent view of the hamster's daily activities. The aquarium should have a mesh cover on top so the hamster can't escape.A plastic hamster home. These expensive hamster cages usually have several rooms connected with plastic tubing, so the hamster can spend his days and nights running from room to room. They are hard to clean and usually way too small for hamsters. Even by connecting several critter trails (or similar cages) together your hamster will not be happy as it does not have a big running space and you can not fit a lot into these cages. Additionally, they are hard to assemble and are usually not tall enough to add big wheels or enough bedding.
A wire hamster cage. Especially when your hamster is a baby, make sure that it cannot squeeze through the wires. Hamster cages make a comfortable home for hamsters. These cages are well ventilated, but you have to be careful not to put your hamster in a drafty area. The area around wire hamster cages can get a little messy, since hamsters like to dig in their bedding and pitch it through the wire. Make sure NOT to get a wire cage with a wire bottom. It can hurt your hamster's feet. However, most wire cages sold by pet stores are way too small for hamsters., The best hamster cage is the biggest you can reasonably afford. The RSPCA recommend that the minimum size of cage for a Syrian hamster should be 75cm x 40 cm x 40 cm. (29 ½ inches x 15 ¾ inches x 15 ¾ inches).;
, If you have two hamsters, take measures to make them comfortable. Unlike their larger counterparts, dwarf hamsters can be social and some may enjoy being in small, same-sex groups.


If you put a male and female dwarf hamster together, expect babies in the future. Always provide two separate wheels (make sure these are not mesh or wire as they injure the hamster's foot, and that it is big enough so that they do not arch their backs.) , houses or nest areas (do not use cotton nesting material as it is deadly, toilet paper is a great option) , two water bottles, and have enough food for two hamsters.
Make sure you have two of each toy as well. They can get along in the same space, but will still retain basic territorial instincts., Dry bedding is essential for the health of a dwarf hamster. It keeps moisture away from the hamster's body and provides shelter and warmth. Choose bedding made of recycled paper, wood pulp, or recycled corncobs. Also make sure you provide a lot of burrowing space for your hamster to dig in. Best would be at least 15cm of bedding in at least one area.


Make sure the bedding you use does not contain pine or cedar shavings. Pine and cedar contain phenols that are toxic to hamsters, since the fumes they produce are so strong.Some hamsters are allergic to certain types of bedding. If your bedding contains pine, cedar, or another allergen, he may start wheezing and sneezing. If you see this happen, switch the bedding to recycled paper or another hypoallergenic bedding.Never ever give your hamster cotton type bedding. It is very dangerous and can kill them. Hamsters cannot digest the cotton fibres in their digestive tract causing blockages. It also presents a choking hazard to your pets.

, Set up the hamster's cage and accessories in a comfortable room. Since hamsters are nocturnal, they should be placed in a room that gets dark at night. Make sure the room is a comfortable temperature that veers toward the warm side, since your hamster can catch pneumonia if it gets too cold.Don't leave windows open in the room where the hamster lives.
If you have other pets, make sure the hamster is an area where he won't be disturbed or threatened.

, A clean cage will help keep your hamster healthy. Scoop out the dirty bedding every few days, and wash the entire cage once a week. In general, a medium spray bottle filled with 2 tbs of bleach or antibacterial dish soap and water will have the cleaning power to disinfect the cage without being too dangerous for your hamster. You can also use a white vinegar to clean the cage. Be sure to wipe down your hamster’s toys, dishes, and exercise wheel too.After cleaning, let the cage air dry for 10-15 minutes before you add 2 inches of new fresh bedding. 2 inches is the recommended amount. Remember that your dwarf hamster is a great burrower. If you don’t give your hamster something to burrow in, it won’t be as happy.While you are cleaning the cage, make sure you put your hamster somewhere safe, so he doesn't escape. Place him in a hamster playpen or a dry bathtub. Avoid placing the hamster in a cardboard box while he waits for you to clean his cage. Hamsters can chew through cardboard quickly.

The best chance of them getting along is if they were raised in the same litter, or introduced very young. If introduced as adults they're likely to fight.


Consult a vet before getting another hamster to see if it is a good idea for the health and well-being of your pet. If you decide to get another hamster, you may need to use a split cage to introduce the new hamster to the old one before putting them into the same cage.Do not get a male and female hamster or they may breed out of control. While baby hamsters may be cute at first, hamsters breed quickly and it is easy for a pet hamster population to get out of control. Most people would find it difficult to provide adequate housing, food, and care for dozens of hamsters.;
, Since Chinese dwarf hamsters are quite small, you do not need a large cage, but you can keep them in a larger cage if you prefer. Line the cage with plenty of bedding such as timothy hay, aspen shavings, shredded paper, or pelleted bedding. Place the cage or tank out of direct sunlight and away from drafts. You don’t want your hamsters to get too hot or too cold.


Do not use pine or cedar shavings because the fumes may be harmful to your hamsters.Make sure that your hamster has plenty of bedding to dig around in. Hamsters like to burrow., For example, your hamster will enjoy an exercise wheel. Hamsters need lots of exercise to be happy, and an exercise wheel is a great way to provide them with that. Make sure that the wheel does not have any openings that may cause your hamster’s tail to get caught.


Give your hamster a nice enclosed place to sleep. Hamsters like to hide and sleep in tight, dark spaces, so place a small flower pot or a box in your hamster’s cage.
Add pvc tubes to your hamster’s cage for tunneling and playing. , Hamsters like to burrow and tunnel, so cardboard tubes from toilet paper or paper towel rolls are good toys for hamsters. You can also look for special hamster toys in pets stores. You can also feed your hamster’s need to shred things by giving them paper towels and napkins now and then.Rotate toys each week so that your hamster always has different things to play with. This will help prevent your hamster from getting bored., Look for a specially formulated hamster food mix at your local pet store. Follow the package instructions for how much to give your hamster each day and serve the food in a small ceramic dish placed inside of his cage.


Limit seeds and nuts since they are high in fat and may cause your hamster to become overweight.
Supplement your hamster’s diet with alfalfa pellets and fresh fruits and vegetables such as spinach, lettuce, carrots and apples.
Give your hamster a large chunk to chew on rather than several small ones or your hamster may bury them in the bedding. Remove any uneaten food after your hamster has finished with it., Hamsters need to have access to clean fresh water at all times. Use an inverted water bottle with a drinking tube to provide your hamsters with plenty of water. Make sure that the water bottle’s tip does not touch or come too close to the bedding or the water may drain out.


Check the water bottle’s tip daily to make sure that it is working properly., Like all rodents, a hamster’s teeth never stop growing. Hamsters need to chew to keep their teeth from growing out of control, so make sure that you provide your hamster with a pesticide and chemical-free stick to chew on. You can also use a dog treat., Hamsters like to be awake at night, so the best time to spend time with your hamster is after the sun has gone down. For this reason, hamsters make great pets for night owls. Be aware that if you try to pick up your hamster during the day, it will be more likely to bite you., To help keep your hamster happy and healthy, you will need to keep his cage nice and clean. Once per week you should also perform a deep cleaning on your hamster’s cage. Remove everything from your hamster’s cage (including your hamster) and scrub the sides and bottom with warm, soapy water. Then rinse and dry the cage before putting in new bedding, your hamster’s accessories, and your hamster. In addition to a weekly deep clean, you should also do the following every day:


Remove and replace any soiled or damp bedding.
Remove and dispose of droppings.
Remove old food.
Check the corners of your hamster’s cage for hidden food. Hamsters have a tendency to stash food for later., It will take some time and patience before your hamster is ready to let you hold him. Build up his trust in you by allowing him to sniff your hand and even give you a little nibble. You can also offer your hamster a treat from your hand to build up his trust in you. Once your hamster is comfortable with you, you can try to pick him up.


To pick up your hamster, gently cup both hands around him and lift him slowly out of his cage. Do not swoop in and grab him or you will startle him and cause him to hide from you., Hamsters also need time outside of their cages to be happy. Once you have established trust with your hamster, take him out of his cage once per day for a little supervised play time outside of his cage.


Make sure to keep him in a room where you can monitor his movement. Otherwise he might hide somewhere and make it difficult for you to find him.
Make sure that there are no hazards in the area, such as electrical cords, that your hamster might gnaw on., A healthy hamster will be much happier than an unhealthy hamster. If a hamster is well cared for, it may live to be 1-2 years old. Take your hamster for regular check-ups with the veterinarian to make sure that he stays healthy and happy.


An unhealthy hamster may have a variety of symptoms, such as dull-looking eyes, matted fur, weight loss, shaking, runny nose and diarrhea. If your hamster is sick, take him to see a veterinarian right away.
Hamsters can catch the common cold from humans. If you are sick, avoid holding your hamster until you are well again so that you don’t make him sick."

The bar spacing in a wire cage should be less than one-half inch to prevent him from escaping. The wires should also be covered with a substance called PVC to prevent rusting.
Make sure the cage flooring is smooth. Your dwarf hamster could get his feet stuck in wire flooring and possibly break one of his leg bones. If you have a cage with wire flooring, cover the flooring with a smooth material, such as cardboard or laminate flooring (available at a hardware store).
Cages with colorful plastic tubes and tunnels are fun to look at, but can be very difficult to clean. In addition, your dwarf hamster could chew through the plastic.
Clean your hamster’s cage and its components once a week with hot water.His bedding should also be replaced with each cleaning.
Glass aquariums do not always circulate fresh air very well, which could lead to a high level of ammonia in the cage, which can be toxic to your hamster. Clean the aquarium regularly to prevent an ammonia buildup. Glass aquariums also lack good ventilation and may heat up rapidly if placed in direct sunlight.;
, The fact that your Russian dwarf hamster is small doesn’t mean you should put him in a small cage. In fact, the larger the cage, the better. Your dwarf hamster’s cage should be at least 60 cm (24 inches) long and 40 cm (16 inches) deep.A larger cage will not get dirty as quickly.
With a large cage to call home, your dwarf hamster won't be as likely to get bored or agitated. When your dwarf hamster is happy, he's less likely to develop compulsive behaviors, such as bar chewing, that are bad for him.
If you have more than one dwarf hamster in the same cage, a large cage will keep them from being aggressive towards each other.
If you have chosen a glass aquarium to house your dwarf hamster, it should be at least 10 gallons., Cage bedding has several benefits. It helps keep the cage clean by soaking up your hamster’s urine. Cage bedding also helps your hamster feel more at home. He'll be able to forage and burrow as much as he likes.Pine shavings would be a very comfortable bedding for your hamster.Do not use cedar bedding. Cedar oil can cause your hamster’s fuzz to fall out and his skin to crack. If his skin cracks, he can become dehydrated and very sick., Place your hamster’s cage in a comfortable room (65 to 75 °Fahrenheit/18 to 24 °Celsius) where the temperature stays constant and there are no drafts. Within the room, do not place the cage near a heat source (e.g, fireplace, window with lots of sunlight) — this could warm up the cage too much, especially if it is a glass aquarium.A room that is too cold (below 60 °Fahrenheit/15 °Celsius) could make your hamster very sluggish, possibly to the point of hibernation.
Because hamsters like to play at night, your bedroom would not be a good place for your hamster’s cage. The noise of his activity could keep you from getting a good night’s sleep.

, Russian dwarf hamsters eat like other hamsters.Hamster food comes in pelleted form or as seed mixes. Your dwarf hamster should eat either one tablespoon of pellets or one to two teaspoons of seed mix per day.Pellets are very healthy and give your dwarf hamster something to chew on. Chewing on pellets helps your hamster keep his teeth filed down.Be careful with feeding a seed mix to your dwarf hamster — he may pick out and eat only the tastiest seeds in the mix, causing him to miss out on important nutrients.Seed mixes tend to be high in fat.A good quality commercial hamster food should contain at least 15 to 20% protein.Read the ingredient label to see how much protein is in the food.

, Your dwarf hamster needs to eat more than just pellets and seed mixes. He should also eat some fresh vegetables that add variety and vitamins to his diet.Wash the vegetables thoroughly to remove pesticides.Give him fresh vegetables daily and make sure you remove the old ones so they don't molder in the cage.


Leafy greens (spinach, Romaine lettuce) are great additions to your dwarf hamster’s diet. Other vegetables to feed your dwarf hamster include broccoli, cauliflower, and cucumbers.Add vegetables to your hamster’s diet very slowly — one small piece of vegetable once or twice a week.This will prevent him from getting diarrhea.Work up to feeding one small piece of a vegetable once a day., Protein is an important component of your dwarf hamster’s balanced diet. Good protein sources include boiled chicken or turkey,hardboiled egg whites,and canned and drained tuna.Vegetarian protein sources include tofu, flaxseed, and roasted soybeans.Add extra protein to your dwarf hamster’s diet once a week.Whichever protein source you choose, feed it to your dwarf hamster in one small piece at a time.

, Whole grains (whole wheat toast, cooked rice, cooked pasta, unsweetened cereal) make great, healthy snacks for your dwarf hamster. Make sure the cooked rice or pasta is completely cooled down before feeding it to him.Crunchy toast and cereal would be good for your dwarf hamster to chew on.
As with the other foods, feed the grains in small bits to your dwarf hamster.

, Treats are another good way to add variety to what your dwarf hamster eats every day. Commercial hamster treats are available at your local pet store.Your pet store may carry “yogurt drops” for hamsters. These are very fattening, however, so your hamster should not eat them very often.

, Russian dwarf hamsters are prone to developing diabetes,so high-sugar foods, such as fruits, should be avoided.Other high-sugar foods to avoid include corn, white bread, and white rice.


Some foods—raisins, potatoes, onions, garlic, sprouts—are toxic to dwarf hamsters and should be avoided., Your Russian dwarf hamster will need constant access to fresh water. Place a water bottle with a stem and ball bearing in your hamster’s cage, and replace the water every day.Attach the bottle to a side of his cage at a height where he can easily reach the stem with his mouth.


Do not put the water in a bowl. Your hamster would eventually turn his cage into a watery mess by drinking water from a bowl., Environmental enrichment is an important way to keep your Russian dwarf hamster mentally and physically active. The more enriched his environment, the happier and healthier he will be, and the easier it will be to tame and handle him.Examples of toys include empty toilet paper and paper towel tubes.Plastic portable tubes also make great toys for your dwarf hamster. You can purchase them at your local pet store. Keep in mind, though, that he could chew through the plastic—replace the tube when he’s chewed enough to cause damage.
You can also make your own hamster toys. Examples of homemade toys include ladders, hamster houses, and obstacle courses.

, When it is time to feed your dwarf hamster, hide or sprinkle some of the food morsels deep in his bedding or within another object in his cage.This will encourage him to forage like he would in the wild.


You may notice that your dwarf hamster will stash food in different areas of his cage as a snack for later., Chewing not only keeps your dwarf hamster busy, but also keeps his teeth filed down.Your dwarf hamster would love to chew on wooden cubes. To add more fun, the cubes have holes on multiple sides that he can crawl through.Your hamster could also chew on a bendable wooden toy, which is made of rounded pieces of wood that are banded together. You can also twist this toy type into different shapes to create walls, platforms, and houses that your hamster could play on or in.
Give your dwarf hamster small, soft rawhide chews to chew on.Dwarf hamsters also like to chew on mineral blocks, which can last a long time.
You can find chewing materials at your local pet store.

, Exercise helps your dwarf hamster stay in shape and mentally alert. An exercise wheel will allow him to get plenty of exercise within his cage. Make sure the exercise wheel is solid—your dwarf hamster could get his feet stuck in wires and potentially break a leg bone.


If the exercise wheel starts to sound squeaky after a while, grease it with Vaseline where needed.An exercise ball will allow your dwarf hamster to exercise outside of his cage. Let him play in the ball for up to 30 minutes — not only will your hamster need a rest after about 30 minutes, but he may also need some fresh air.
Let your dwarf hamster run in the hamster ball in different rooms, but never near a set of stairs or open water, like a pool.Plastic flying saucers are also good for your hamster.He can run on them like he runs on an exercise wheel.

, Having clean hands will keep your dwarf hamster from biting you when you pick him up. If your hands smell like food, then he will essentially see your hand as food and bite it to try to get a taste.Wash your hands with unscented soap before handling your dwarf hamster., Creating a scoop with your hands will keep your dwarf hamster supported as you lift him up. In addition, by placing your hands underneath your dwarf hamster, he will probably walk onto them.Do not reach down into your dwarf hamster’s cage to pick him up. Your hand will remind him of a large bird of prey swooping down to snatch him up — he will be terrified by this.Use slow and gentle movements when putting your hands in his cage.
Always speak to your dwarf hamster before putting your hands in his cage. Your voice will help keep him calm as you go to pick him up.Do not chase your dwarf hamster around his cage to get him to step onto your hands. Let him come to you instead of the other way around.

, There are important differences between your dwarf hamster’s nibbling and biting when you pick him up. His nibbles are friendly and are his way of exploring your hand.Nibbles generally do not hurt.


Bites are usually not friendly. They are your dwarf hamster’s way of telling you that he is stressed, scared, or just upset that you haven’t handled him enough.
Hamster bites are usually faster than a nibble and are accompanied by a sound of distress, like a squeak. Bites can be painful.
Whether your dwarf hamster bites or nibbles, do not jerk your hand away. This could frighten him and make him wary of you. Gently blowing in his face and saying a firm ""no"" should stop the biting behavior., Russian dwarf hamsters have short memories,so your dwarf hamster may not remember that you just held him the day before. Handle him each day so that he will not become distressed or upset with not being held enough.


Dwarf hamsters enjoy being handled.Do not let your dwarf hamster fall out of your hands when you hold him.Prevent this by supporting his body and keeping him close to you when you lift him out of his cage.

Buy your hamster a water bottle.,
Buy hamster food.,
Buy chew sticks.,
Give your hamster treats.",How to Care for Dwarf Hamsters2," Many hamster cages come with food and water dishes, but if yours doesn't, you'll have to buy your own. Hamsters drink water through bottles with a metal dispenser. Fill the water bottle with fresh water as it runs out.Don't let the water sit in the bottle for too long. If your hamster is slow to drink, refill the bottle a few times a week, and clean the bottle every now and then.
Make sure the bottle doesn't leak. Your hamster can get sick if it gets wet, which is why it takes their water through a bottle instead of an open container.

, Serve your dwarf hamster food in a shallow plastic dish. This enables hamsters to access the food easily while keeping the cage clean. Hamsters like to nibble food all the time, so the food dish should be kept stocked with fresh food. Throw it out if it gets wet. Pet food stores sell a range of food for hamsters and most of it falls into the following categories:


Fortified pellets or blocks, which should be the hamster's staple diet.
Seed mixtures meant for hamsters, which may be added as a supplement. Hamsters also need to eat protein like meal worms (dried or alive), crickets etc., Dwarf hamster teeth grow long and sharp. Your hamster needs something tough to chew on to keep its teeth at a comfortable length. Buy chew sticks or another tough chew toy meant for dulling hamster's teeth., In addition to pellets and seeds, hamsters enjoy treats every once in a while. Vegetables, fruits, and other fresh foods may be added to the hamster's diet in small doses. Be sure not to give your hamster too much, since you don't want him to have an upset stomach.


Hamsters can have small bits of lettuce, carrots, apples, broccoli, and tomatoes. Your dwarf hamster will also eat oats, cooked meat, and plain yogurt.Avoid giving your hamster citrus fruits or sugar, which can make a hamster ill. Peanut butter is another food to avoid feeding your hamster, as it can choke on it."
"
Provide toys and sources of entertainment.,
Hold him correctly.,
Help your hamster stay clean.",How to Care for Dwarf Hamsters3," Your hamster will have a lot of energy and it'll like to exercise, especially at night. Provide your hamster with toys it can use with or without your help.Exercise wheels are the classic hamster toy. Make sure the wheel is stabilized at the bottom of the cage so it doesn't tip over when the hamster climbs on. Also make sure isn't a wire wheel or your hamster can hurt his feet. The wheel shouldn't be smaller than 8 inches. Otherwise your hamster will get back problems.These can also be loud, so if you are a light sleeper, put your hamster’s cage in a different room.Exercise balls are another popular choice.

They often panic in these balls and can hurt themself if they run into objects.

, In the first few days of getting a new dwarf hamster, do not attempt to pick it up. Just put your hand in its cage and let it sniff you to get used to your scent. Don't grab or otherwise roughly handle your hamster, since it has a very fragile body. Always pick a hamster up from the bottom or else it will feel threatened. Start off by sitting on the floor and holding it near the floor. If it senses an easy escape route, it’ll be less likely to bite or squirm.Hold your hamster every day. If your dwarf hamster doesn't socialize frequently, it may stop being as friendly when you want to play. Gently lift your hamster from his cage and let him scurry around your lap at least once a day., Dwarf hamsters are very clean animals and rarely need intervention from their owners to maintain good hygiene. However, once a week you can pour some small animal sand into a bowl and allow your hamster to take a sand bath, which imitates the type of substance hamsters use to keep clean in the wild.If your hamster is very dirty, get a small brush that humans use to dye their hair roots or a toothbrush. Wet it and gently stroke your hamster with it. Dab dry with a rag.
Never bathe a hamster by submerging it in water. This will cause the hamster to become very ill.

A hamster suffering from this condition will drink a lot of water and urinate more frequently than other dwarf hamsters.Be sure to consult your veterinarian if you suspect that your hamster has diabetes.

, A recently weaned or an extremely stressed out dwarf hamster may come down with a disease called “wet tail.” Your hamster experiences diarrhea — the excessive moisture from this causes its tail to become literally wet. Consult a veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and treatment.


Tyzzer’s disease causes diarrhea in young or stressed hamsters. This is a disease that needs veterinarian treatment. Certain antibiotics can cause and exacerbate this condition, so don’t treat your hamster on your own., Like dogs and cats, dwarf hamsters can suffer from parasites like tapeworms. Tapeworms are the most predominant, so be on the look out. When you clean out your hamster’s cage, be on the lookout for signs of diarrhea and little white rice-like worm segments.If you suspect that your dwarf hamster has a tapeworm, see a veterinarian.

Assesses are essentially infected pockets of puss that will appear underneath your hamster's skin and fur. If present, they will be sensitive to touch. Your hamster will resist your inspection. Contact your veterinarian about how you should proceed. In many cases, the abscess will heal on its own, but if it gets too bad, your vet will probably have to lance and treat the spot."

Design a maze with plastic tubing.",How to Accessorize a Hamster's Cage1," You should look for a heavy ceramic food dish that they can’t tip over.You can mix things up by finding a small bowl or dish that has bright colors, a neat design, or an unusual pattern. Good places to look for these include home goods stores, thrift shops, or supermarkets. Choose a smaller bowl that can contain around 5 oz. or a couple of tablespoons of pellets. Be sure to wash it out well before giving to your hamster.


Be sure to hook a water bottle onto the cage. Your hamster will need water in addition to food.;
, Buy a nylon hammock instead of a fleece or cotton one to ensure that your hamster won't chew through it. Hang the hammock in the corner of a cage. Make sure that your hamster is able to climb onto it with ease. Hammocks are actually proven to make hamsters happier, so it is a good purchase., Hamsters need a wheel for exercise. You want a wheel that has a solid, plastic bottom, not spaced rungs. Hamster feet can get stuck in the rungs! You can find wheels in many different kinds of colors these days, so shop around., Hamsters need to grind down their teeth by chewing. There are plenty of chew toys you can give your hamster to make him happy that will also make the cage look great. Walnut shells, unpainted oak or Cherrywood squares, wooden balls, and rolled oats are all great for chewing., You can buy plastic tunnels for your hamster online or at the pet store. These are sometimes known as habitrails. They snap together to create pathways between different houses, nets, or tanks. You can also create your own maze. Find many different parts, including straight pieces, curves, ramps, and nesting boxes. Snap these together, making sure that they are secure.


Many wire cages have holes where these tunnels attach. These cages are called “modular” habits.Make sure that the maze either circles back to the cage or that there is a suitable “dead end,” such as a nesting box or a separate cage.

Collect empty cardboard tubes.,
Fashion ladders out of popsicle sticks.,
Build your own hamster platform.,
Create a swing out of a tin can.,
Paint a flowerpot nest.",How to Accessorize a Hamster's Cage2," When you run out of toilet paper, save the paper rolls. You can also use paper towel tubes. Put these around the cage. Your hamster will use them as tunnels, and they may chew on them a little bit. You can have multiple tubes in a single cage.


Replace the tubes once they have been chewed through or if they become damp.

, Gather at least four popsicle sticks. Cut two in half, and sand down the rough edges.Using non-toxic glue, attach the pieces so that they form a ladder. The cut pieces are the rungs, and the uncut pieces are the siderails. Make sure that there is a short gap between the rungs. Hamsters love to climb, and giving them ladders will help them exercise while sprucing up your cage., For this, you will need a piece of corkboard, miniature wooden dowels (about 8x40 mm in size), four wooden cylinders, and wood glue/PVC glue. Glue the cylinders onto the bottom of the corkboard for legs. Wait fifteen minutes before flipping over. Glue the dowels around the edge of the corkboard to form a fence. Leave a gap so hamsters can enter.Be sure to prop a ladder against it so hamsters can climb up to it.


Let the glue dry completely for a few hours before placing it in the hamster cage.

, Clean out a tin can. Make sure that both ends are removed, and sand down the rough edges until they are smooth. There should be no jagged edges or protruding parts. String a wire or a thin chain through the can, and attach both ends to the top of the cage. The swing should hang low enough for your hamster to crawl in and out. You may leave a ladder out for your hamster.Do not use string. Your hamster may chew on the string, causing digestive problems., You want to find a pot that is small enough to fit in your cage but large enough to house your hamster.

Fill the cage with decorative toys and tunnels.,
Hang up a picture.,
Draw on tank walls with dry erase markers.",How to Accessorize a Hamster's Cage3," Before you start decorating the cage, think of a fun theme for your hamster cage. Some people decorate their cages for certain holidays. Others stick with certain colors. Think about how you want your cage to look. Some ideas are:


Space
Christmas
Seasons like Spring or Fall
Desert

, Hamster toys come in a variety of colors and shapes. Nesting boxes can be found as igloos, animals, or cottages. There are wooden bridges, tree-shaped tunnels, and miniature castles. Find toys and accessories that fit your theme, or use what you think is cute. Remember, hamsters need plenty of hiding spaces, tunnels, climbing walls, and chew toys so you can look for several different options.

, You can provide some extra scenery to the cage by printing or drawing a landscape. This should be as tall and wide as their cage. You can choose a normal woodland scene or chose something that fits your theme (stars and planets for a space theme, pine trees and snow for Christmas, etc.).


If you have a tank or aquarium cage, you can attach this with tape to the back of the tank. Place it on the outside of the tank with the picture facing into your hamster’s home. Do not put it inside the cage.
If you have a wire cage, glue it onto cardboard. Prop it up behind the cage, just far enough away from the cage so that the hamster cannot chew on it.

, If you have a bin, aquarium, or tank style of cage, you can draw designs or notes on the glass side with a dry erase marker. Only draw on the outside of the cage. You can erase it with a dry eraser or with a damp cloth.You can also place stickers on the glass so long as there is no chance they will peel off and fall into the hamster’s living area.

",How to Care for Campbell's Russian Hamsters," Campbell's Russian hamsters are best housed in glass aquariums or tanks.Be sure there is a top that allows air in so the hamsters don't asphyxiate


Make sure the aquarium is at least 3 feet (0.9 m). long (0.9 m) and has an ample amount of ""floor area."" In addition to having space to exercise and burrow, your hamster must have ample bedding, food, water, hideouts, nesting boxes, wheels, and toys.
Secure the tank with a wire mesh lid to prevent escape.
Avoid cages that are sold for normal-sized hamsters. The Campbell's Russian hamster may be able to squeeze through the bars. Additionally, cages marketed specifically for mice and Dwarf hamsters such as CritterTrail are often too small, so the aquarium is the best choice.;
, A 3-in. layer should suffice. If you wish, you can provide up to 4 or 5 in. of bedding. There are several brands of bedding available in pet stores. Shredded paper can also be used.


Do not use pine or cedar wood shavings. Wood shavings can contain harmful oils and cause a number of health problems for your hamster. The safe kind is aspen shavings which can be used without problem.

, Make sure you have:


Water bottle. Place it in a corner of the aquarium using some sort of stand.
Nesting boxes.
Food. Tip: To occupy your hamster, scatter the pellets or blocks around the habitat for your hamster to forage for instead of placing food in a regular hamster bowl.
Toys. Provide at least some of the following: wheel, tubes, tunnels, ladders, wooden chews, sticks, hideouts, toilet paper rolls. A sufficient number of toys are essential to your pet's stimulation, health, and overall happiness.
Change out the toys in the habitat frequently to keep your hamster interested. Introduce new toys and bring back old ones.

, Some Campbell's Russian hamsters can be housed in pairs if introduced to one another at a young age. For two hamsters, provide two water bottles, enough food for both hamsters, two nesting boxes, and enough toys to prevent territorial disputes.

, A plastic storage bin would work as well.


If you would like, you can let your hamster explore a room. Remove all dangerous items (such as electrical cords) and block escape paths (vents, airways, spaces under the doors).
Make sure there are no cracks or holes in the walls.
Keep toys and food in their play areas.

, They should not be bought from pet stores as you will almost always end up with a hybrid, not a Campbell's Russian hamster. Responsible breeders can provide you with a specific color or coat-type, if desired.


Avoid buying hamsters online.
If you are purchasing them from a pet store, go in the afternoon or early evening when they are most active.
Confirm with the seller that the hamsters are separated by gender. Responsible sellers will do this to ensure that female hamsters are not pregnant at purchase.
Ask your seller about the age, size, gender, and the temperaments of the hamsters. Aim for a hamster who is 4-6 weeks old (less than 3 in. long).
Healthy hamsters have a round shape and are alert and active. Dry fur, clear ears, and erect ears are other indicators of health. Be wary if any hamster has wet fur around its rump -- this indicates a disease called ""wet tail,"" which can be spread to others in a living space.
If possible, place your hand inside the tank to test the hamster's temperament. Avoid buying hamsters that bite aggressively.
Bring your hamster home as quickly as possible to minimize stress and confusion.

, Allow it to adjust and explore its new surroundings. Cover the aquarium with a light cloth, if desired. Provide the hamster with enough food and water for this period of time.

,


Remove old food and spoiled bedding.
Change the water, put in fresh food, and change out some toys.
Acclimate your hamster to your physical presence. Begin ""taming sessions"" during the evening, when the hamster is most awake. Place your hand in the habitat and allow your pet to investigate. Be patient if it bites the first few times. Once your pet is comfortable with your hand in the habitat, invite your hamster to take treats out of your hand. Slowly encourage your hamster to sit on your hand, then try slowly lifting your hand up. Each step of the taming process may take a few days or a week. Let your hamster run away and explore. Never chase it around the tank. Leave it alone if it rolls on its back and bares its teeth.

, Introduce it to the storage bin, the hamster playpen, and/or the safe room. Always supervise your hamster in any of these play areas to prevent escape or injuries.

, Avoid cleaning the hamster cage every week. This can cause stress for your hamster. Move your hamster to a safe play area first. Soak toys in warm, soapy water. Clean the habitat with warm water and soap as well. When dry, place fresh bedding, food, water, and toys into the habitat for your pet to enjoy. Return your hamster back to the habitat.

Do not give your hamster chocolate, candy, uncooked beans, onions, or any kind of junk food.
Clean and refill the water bottle every day.
Take your hamster to the veterinarian for a yearly check up.;
, Your hamster can live in a wire cage or an aquarium (10 gallon minimum) with a mesh top. Line the cage with at least 2 inches of Timothy hay, aspen shavings, or processed corn cob. The cage should also have an exercise wheel, cardboard tubes, and a piece of natural wood.Clean the cage with warm soapy water once a week and add new bedding.
Remove any soiled bedding and droppings every day.

, Going to a new a home is stressful. All of the new sights, sounds, and smells can be overwhelming. Let your hamster settle in for a few days before you begin the taming process.Talk to your hamster in a calm voice when you feed him. This will help him get used to the sound of your voice.
Talking when you provide treats (sugarless cereal,whole wheat bread,plain popcorn, cooked pasta, scrambled egg) helps your hamster associate your voice with something that is good.

, Hamsters are nocturnal animals. They sleep during the day and are active at night. If you notice that your hamster is playing, stretching, eating, or grooming, this is the best time to schedule your taming sessions.If you wake your hamster up during the day, he will be stressed and is more likely to bite you.Your taming sessions will be much more successful if you work around your hamster’s sleeping schedule.

, Take a clean piece of tissue or toilet paper and leave it in your shirt for a few hours. Then place the paper in your hamster’s cage. You can also wear a sock in your shirt or waistband and then place the sock in the cage.Hamsters have a sensitive nose and a strong sense of smell. They rely on their nose to tell them about their environment.Be consistent with the scent of the items that you place in the cage. Do not try out any new laundry detergent or perfumes during this process.

, When your hamster is awake, sit next to the cage and talk to him. If your hamster eats, drinks, and plays in front of you, he is comfortable with you. You can read a book or sing softly to your hamster during this time.

, Devote at least 10 minutes a day to taming your hamster. If you cannot tame him every day, shoot for every other day.The more time you spend with him the better.


If you take a long break or go on vacation while you are trying to tame him, he will regress.You may have to go back to some of the earlier steps instead of picking up where you left off.
Work to handle your hamster around the same time each day. This will create a routine for the two of you., Because your hamster is older, he may have never been tamed or has forgotten. It takes time to build trust and to unlearn any bad behaviors. It will take longer to tame him than it takes to tame a young hamster.The time it takes to tame your hamster will vary. It depends on the personality of the hamster and how much time you spend with him. It could take weeks or months to tame him.Most hamsters will come around if you are patient and consistent.

, You should never physically punish your hamster. Do not flick him or tap his nose. If he bites or nibbles, lightly blow in his face. You can also tell him “No!” using a serious tone .


Physical punishment only creates fear. If your hamster is afraid of you, you may never be able to tame him.

, Hamsters do not have a good sense of sight. If your hand smells like food, your hamster will think that your hand is food and will bite you. If your hand smells like another animal, your hamster may think he is in danger.Unscented soap is best. However, if you use a scented soap, use the same soap each time.

, Place a treat in the cage and leave your hand inside the cage. Your hamster may come and investigate your hand when he comes to get the treats. Do not try to pet him at this time.


Pay attention to how your hamster responds. His behavior will let you know when you can move on to the next stage.
If your hamster runs away, urinates, defecates, or flattens himself close to the floor, he is still afraid.If he is frightened, place the treat in the cage and try again when your hamster is no longer stressed.
Trying to work with your hamster when he is stressed can make him sick and will make taming him more difficult.

, Once your hamster is comfortable with your hand, leave the treat in your hand and wait for the hamster to come to your hand. Do not wiggle your fingers around or try.The hamster should not have to climb all the way onto your hand to get the treat. He should be able to reach the treat with his paw.

, When your hamster is ready, he will begin to eat out of the palm of your hand. When he does this, use your other hand to pet his body. Only use one of your fingers when petting.Do not pet him on his head. This will aggravate him.
Always allow your hamster to control the level interaction. Do not force him to come to you or eat out of your hands. He will move at his own pace.

, Place your hand in the cage and allow the hamster to walk into your hand. Once he is in the palm of your hand, place your other hand on top of the hamster to create a little cave. Make sure his head is sticking out. Hold the hamster a few inches above the ground while he is still in his cage.Avoid picking him up with your hand. Always allow him to walk into your hands when he is ready.Never approach your hamster from behind. He cannot see you, and this will scare him.
Your hamster may try to jump out of your hands at first.
Your hamster may urinate because he is nervous. Do not drop him or get upset with him. Talk to him in a calm tone and say, “It’s ok. I know you are a little nervous.” Gently place him back in his cage and try again later.

, Once you have held your hamster in his cage a few times and he seems comfortable, try to hold him outside of the cage. Pick him up using the cave method and bring the hamster to your chest. Your hamster will feel more secure next to your chest.Hold him over your lap or close to the floor in case he falls. Hamsters have delicate bonesand can suffer serious injuries due to falling.Try this in a room that does not have a lot of hiding places in case he gets away. Make sure the room is quiet with no other pets around.Remember to watch how your hamster responds. If he squeals, growls, or grinds his teeth, put him back in his cage and leave him alone., Sit with your hamster and allow him to get used to you.To set up a bathtub, plug the drain and place a blanket or towel in the tub. Put your hamster in the playpen or bathtub with you. Bring some treats and allow your hamster to explore you and the new space.


To create a playpen, sit across from another person and make a barrier with your legs. Place the hamster in the middle and allow him to move around. You can also use a kiddie pool as a playpen.

This means you need to set up a suitable cage for your hamster. You should put down some absorbent bedding to make your hamster feel comfortable. This also allows your hamster to go to the restroom in its cage. You’ll need to spot clean the bedding daily and replace the entire thing once a week or so.Be sure to also put a water bottle for your hamster to drink out of in the cage.;
, Hamsters are omnivores, which means they subsist on animal-based food as well as plant-based food. The most common thing to feed hamsters is dried hamster food pellets, but it is a good idea to supplement your hamster’s diet with small pieces of raw fruits and vegetables as a treat a couple times per week.Typically, hamsters should eat about 10 grams of dry hamster food twice each day.
For a treat, consider giving them small bits of broccoli, peaches, cauliflower, or bananas. Do not give your hamster anything citrus (like lemons or oranges) or acidic (like onions) because it could cause your hamster to get an upset stomach.
During the first few days after you get your hamster, be careful not to push yourself on it too quickly. This is especially important during feeding time. Just put the food in the cage and then leave the hamster alone to eat in peace. This will help your hamster feel safe around you.

, You need to give your hamster some time to get used to you and to feel safe and settled in its new home. Don’t try to force any contact with your hamster for the first week or so.Sometimes this process can take a bit longer. It’s important for you to be patient in the beginning.

, When you’re in the same vicinity as your hamster’s cage, try talking to your hamster in a soothing voice. You want your pet to begin to recognize your voice as this will help it learn to not fear you.You may want to come near the cage and spend a few minutes at a time (several times each day) just speaking gently to your hamster.
You can even take the cage lid off after the first few days so that your hamster can hear you better. Just be careful to make sure it doesn’t escape.

, Begin to feed your hamster with treats in between the cage bars or through an opening in the top of the cage, depending on what type of enclosure you have for your pet hamster. Associating you with treats will help your hamster get over being afraid of you.You can also rub the treat in your palm so the hamster can get to know your scent. Continue for a few days.

, Before you try to pick up your hamster for the first time, you should wash your hands thoroughly. This will remove any scent of food that may be lingering on your hands. You don’t want your hamster to accidentally bite you.You can even wear gloves when picking up your hamster in the beginning if you are afraid of being bitten.

, When your hamster is awake, slowly put your hand into the cage. Let your hamster sniff your hand. And don’t force it to do anything. If your hamster is acting scared and backing away from you, remove your hand and try again in another week or two.You can also include a couple of treats in your palm to help your hamster feel less afraid.
Don't pull away when your hamster makes sudden movements at you when you are going to pet or handle it. You are only going to scare it even if it scared you.

, Once you have spent some time easing into contact with your hamster, you should try to pick it up. Be sure to hold it firmly in your hand so it doesn’t fall and hurt itself. After a while, your hamster will go into your hand all by itself.Never grab your hamster, as your hamster will see that as a threat. Instead, cup your hands and let it walk into your hands on its own.
If your hamster makes a squeaking noise, that means it is agitated and you should put it back in its cage. Take some more time letting your hamster get to know you before you try to pick it up again.

, Your hamster may be nervous at first, but once you start to pet your hamster and talk to it, it will be calmer than before. Be sure to read your hamster’s body language – if it backs away from you or makes squeaking noises, put it back in the cage. If it seems interested in you and approaches you freely, then feel confident in continuing your course of action.You don’t want to try to force your hamster into something that will make it scared. This could be detrimental to the bond you’re trying to build with it. It may even take longer to tame the hamster in the long run if you try to rush it.

, Be sure to spend plenty of quality time with your pet. The more time you spend engaging with one another, the more confident your hamster will be interacting with you. This will lead to a tame hamster before you know it. Soon, your hamster will be very tame and friendly.You should try to hold your hamster for at least a few minutes every day. Otherwise, it will be harder for it to get used to you and it will take more effort to tame your hamster.

, Never forget about your hamster. Remember that you have a little furry friend who wants to play with you and interact. Give your hamster lots of love and affection (and don’t forget the treats!). This is the single most important part of taming a hamster.The more you play with your hamster, the more tame it will be.

, If your hamster bites you, this usually means that they are scared or anxious. Biting is a natural response to fear for hamsters. If your hamster is biting you, give it some more time before you try to hold it. Keep talking to it and letting it smell your hand occasionally, but don’t force it into your hand for a couple more weeks. Wait until your hamster doesn’t seem nervous anymore (shown by biting, shaking, squeaking) when you put your hand in the cage.Be cautious about not waking up sleeping hamsters. This can startle them and cause them to bite.
Hamsters may also bite if your hand smells like food. So be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before handling your hamster.

, Since hamsters are such small creatures, you’ll need to monitor them closely for potentially dangerous health problems. While most hamsters are generally healthy, a problem can worsen quickly in a hamster’s tiny body.The biggest health problem among hamsters is diarrhea. This condition needs quick vet attention since hamsters can perish from dehydration. The telltale sign that your hamster has diarrhea is when your hamster’s rear end looks wet and brownish in color.
Another common medical complication for hamsters is protrusion of the eyeball from the socket. This is usually caused by an eye infection or by some other kind of physical trauma. If your hamster’s eyes look like they are bulging, take it to the vet immediately.

, Hamsters can be territorial creatures, which means that they may not like to share their cage with other animals, including other hamsters. If your hamsters are fighting among themselves, you may need to separate them permanently into different cages.At the very least, make sure there are no closed off portions of the habitat where one hamster can corner another. And try to make sure there is two of everything so they don’t fight over food and water.

File your hamster's teeth.",How to Treat Hamster Dental Problems," Gently restrain your hamster by carefully holding it by her scruff behind her neck. You shouldn't apply too much tension to the skin or you could cause its eyelids to retract (and pop the eyes out of the sockets).


Set your hamster on a table or desk while you check her teeth. Holding it at a height could cause injury if she wriggles loose and falls.;
, While holding your hamster, lift your hamster's lip and see how long the teeth are. There's no specific recommended length for the teeth. But, your hamster's teeth are too long if:The incisors (the front teeth) force your hamster's mouth open
The lower incisors grow past the upper incisors
Your hamster can't open his jaws to get around something small (like a peanut)

, While still gently restraining your hamster, lift up its lip to see whether its teeth are aligned when the jaw is closed. The tips of your hamster's incisors should meet together (the same way scissor blades do). Hamster teeth have a slight curve so they should meet point to point.If the teeth aren't aligned (known as malocclusion), your hamster's teeth will wear unevenly and can cause the teeth to become overgrown.

, Although the teeth at the front of the mouth (the incisors) usually cause the most problems, your hamster's molars can develop problems too. The molars at the back of the mouth can develop sharp spurs. These spurs are long growths on the teeth that look like hooks.These are difficult to see and may require a special instrument with a light source and speculum to check them.


Spurs are painful for your hamster because they can dig into the tongue or cheek pouch. Usually, your hamster develops spurs on the molars only after having problems with the incisors.

, If your hamster has problems with his teeth, it may start acting strangely about his food. For example, your hamster may move food from the food bowl, hold it in his cheek pouches, and then bury the food in the nest.You should be monitoring if your hamster is eating the food in its dish or if it's disappearing from the bowl because he's hiding it somewhere.

, In addition to overgrown or misaligned teeth, you may notice your hamster drool saliva so that its chin is constantly wet. Your hamster's breath might smell bad. It might also lose weight if it is having trouble chewing her food and eating.Your hamster's coat might also look worse since it can't get nutrients from eating food.

, If your hamster's incisors become severely overgrown, they can grow round and puncture your hamster's lips or the roof of his mouth. To check for infection, look for any sore on your hamster's face or any pus that's discharging near the mouth.A puncture and overgrown teeth can cause a secondary bacterial infection that is very painful, so get immediate medical attention for your hamster.

, If your hamster's teeth are getting long or you suspect dental problems, take your hamster to the vet. The vet can check for other health problems and will check for dental problems. The vet will check your hamster's teeth by using a speculum and otoscope to look deep in the mouth.Since it's difficult to see into a hamster's small mouth, the vet may want to give a little anesthesia to do the examination and x-rays while your hamster sleeps.

, If your hamster's teeth are overgrown, the vet may use a dental drill to file the teeth down. The vet will also file down the molars to the correct length. Your hamster may need a sedative or anesthetic during this procedure.Some veterinarians may clip or cut the teeth, but if the clippers aren't sharp enough, the tooth may fracture lengthwise down to the root, which is painful.

, As a preventative or if you know your hamster is prone to dental problems and has had its teeth trimmed by the vet in the past, give your hamster orchard wood to gnaw on. Gnawing on untreated wood can help your hamster wear down his teeth so they don't get too long. Or, you could give him a hard dog biscuit which has the added benefit of giving your hamster calcium for strong bones and teeth.Types of wood that are safe to give your hamster include: elm, ash, maple, birch, apple, orange, pear, and peach. Avoid giving: cedar, plum, redwood, cherry, and oleander.

, Once your hamster has had a professional filing, maintain her teeth by filing her teeth every two weeks. Carefully grasp your hamster with your thumb under her chin to immobilize her head. Gently place a diamond file rasp horizontally in her mouth so the rough surface is against the tip of the incisors. Draw the file to and fro to gently rasp down the tooth.If in doubt, only remove a small amount of tooth each time you file. Or, ask the veterinarian to show you how to file your hamster's teeth.

Choose the right cage.,
Clean your cage regularly.,
Invest in quality bedding.,
Provide a wheel and toys.",How to Care for a Russian Campbell Dwarf Hamster1," First, you'll need to select a cage for your hamster. Dwarf hamsters, including Russian Campbells, are notorious for chewing and nibbling.Therefore, an aquarium style cage would be better than a cage with bars. Hamsters can chew through the bars of wire cages.An aquarium cage comes with certain special considerations. As it can collect heat easily, keep the cage out of direct sunlight. Make sure you set the cage on a stable surface, out of reach of children and other pets.Hamsters enjoy climbing. They cannot climb the walls of an aquarium cage. Therefore, pick up some ladders and other climbable objects at your local pet store. This will keep your Russian Campbell occupied in his cage.;
, Your hamster's cage needs to be cleaned on a regular basis. This prevents the spread or build-up of unwanted bacteria, which can lead to illness. Clean your hamster's cage once a week.


First, remove your hamster from the cage. Place him in a sealable box or pet carrier case with a few handfuls of clean bedding. You should also add some food and water, in case he gets hungry.Throw out all the old bedding, droppings, and any disposable toys made of materials like cardboard. Remove washable toys, water bottles, and food bowls. These can be washed in warm water and mild dish detergent. Wash these items, rinse thoroughly, and then set them aside to dry.Use a paper towel alongside mild soap or disinfectant. Wash the cage completely, getting the sides, corners, top, and bottom. Then, rinse completely. Remember, hamsters lick and chew so it's important to get any soap or disinfectant residue off. Dry the cage completely.Put down a fresh layer of bedding. Replace any disposable toys. Put washable toys, food bowls, and water bottles back in the cage. Your hamster's cage is now clean and you can put him back in safely., The bottom of a hamster cage should bel lined with appropriate bedding. Wood shavings are often used in hamster cages. However, pine or cedar chips can cause respiratory problems for dwarf hamsters. Make sure to avoid these types of bedding as well as unlabeled wood beddings.Aspen-based beddings or sand-based beddings are generally safe for hamsters. Before adding bedding to your hamster's cage, make sure it's free of mites and other insects. To do so, put the bedding in your freezer for 48 hours. This should kill any potential insects. Then, allow it to return to room temperature and add it to your hamster's cage.Never use cat litter, corn cob, newspaper, or scented bedding. These contain chemicals and other materials that could cause health problems for your hamster., Exercise is vital for your hamster's well being. Make sure you provide a wheel so your hamster can run. You should also provide toys. Dwarf hamsters need a lot of stimulation to be happy and healthy.


Pick a solid wheel without rungs as this lessens the chance of injury. For dwarf hamsters, you do not need a wheel bigger than 6.5 inches. If you're using an aquarium cage, you may not have a way to attach a wheel to your cage. Therefore, make sure you get a wheel that stands on its own.Tubes and hidey-holes are hamster toys sold at most pet stores. Due to their small size, dwarf hamsters tend to enjoy such toys as they can squeeze into them easily.Hamsters may also enjoy small plush toys for chewing and playing. Make sure you remove any small parts, like eyes and noses, as these might pose a choking risk. You should also check the materials used in any toy you give your hamster to make sure materials are hamster-safe.

You can throw in 1-4 chew sticks/toys.,
If you are looking for a more nutritious, environmentally friendly way of keeping your Hamsters teeth shaved down, you can use pesticide free fruit tree branches.,
You can use dog biscuits as a replacement, although they can come high in fat.,
If you still have trouble keeping their teeth down take a visit to your veterinarian.,
Hamsters will chew on most things that are given to them, so finding the right tools should not be too hard.",How to Keep Hamster Teeth Healthy," They generally cost 1.00-10.00 dollars, depending on what brand, quantity, and store you buy them from. Although these fun treats look fantastic and colorful to you, they may not be as great for the hamster. They are usually just slabs of wood brushed over with a non-toxic paint.;
, (Apples are the best). Cut off about a 3-4 inch section that is about 1 cm. - 1 inch thick.

, Only give these in small quantities on occasion, so they can be used to keep your pet happy and healthy,

, They will gladly trim the teeth down and give you some tips.

, The main safety issue to keep in mind is that you never give them anything that is not non-toxic.

Pick quality hamster food.,
Add fresh food.,
Avoid certain foods.",How to Care for a Russian Campbell Dwarf Hamster2," Your hamster's diet is a major component of his care. You can purchase hamster pellets or mixes at a pet store. These should be fortified with the vitamins and minerals your hamster needs to survive. On average, dwarf hamsters only need about a tablespoon of food each day.However, discuss your hamster's diet with your vet just to be safe. If your hamster is on the bigger or smaller side, he may require more or less food.

, In addition to store-bought food, you should supplement your hamster's diet with fresh food. Hamsters in general enjoy a wide variety of fresh produce, seeds, and nuts. However, there are some special considerations to take when caring for a dwarf hamster.


Be careful with fruit. In nature, dwarf hamsters come from a desert environment. Therefore, anything too watery can cause digestive problems. Do not feed your dwarf hamster too much fruit. If you want to give your hamster a treat, consider dried fruit without added sugar.Veggies and legumes are a better option than fruit when it comes to produce. You can feed your dwarf hamster spinach, asparagus, alfalfa sprouts, bean sprouts, squash, green beans, and dandelion flowers.Seeds and nuts are also great for a dwarf hamster. Pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, chestnuts, buckwheat, and sesame seeds can all be a great addition to your dwarf hamster's diet., There are certain foods you should avoid feeding to dwarf hamsters. They can cause health problems or carry other hazards.


Sticky and sharp foods should be avoided. Sticky foods can get stuck in a dwarf's cheek pouches. Sharp foods can puncture the mouth. If you feed your dwarf hamster anything that may have sharp edges, like walnuts or squash, examine the food beforehand. Remove any sharp bits.Certain foods can upset a dwarf hamster's stomach or cause illness. In general, do not feed your dwarf hamster processed food, salted seeds or nuts, garlic, onion, tomato, citrus fruit, almond, kidney beans, eggplant, watermelon, potato, or avocado."

Supervise your hamster when he's out of his cage.,
Watch for signs of illness.,
Note abnormal behavior.,
Keep track of water consumption.",How to Care for a Russian Campbell Dwarf Hamster3," Due to their size, dwarf hamsters can easily get lost in your home. They can be very difficult to find if they escape. They are also highly susceptible to injury if stepped on or attacked by another pet. Therefore, never allow your dwarf hamster out of his cage without supervision.


Many hamster owners get what is called a hamster ball. This is a sealable plastic ball you can place your hamster in. Your hamster will be able to run around your home with the ball as protection. However, you should never leave your dwarf hamster unsupervised in a hamster ball. Hamster balls can break, allowing your hamster to escape.

, A dwarf hamster will live for one to two years on average. if you want to make sure your dwarf hamster is healthy for most of his life, watch for signs of illness. Certain medical issues should be evaluated by a veterinarian.


Check your hamster's eyes and nose once a week. Hamsters are prone to colds, marked by wetness and discharge around the nose. Eye infections sometimes occur in dwarf hamsters, although they're more common in Winter Whites than Russian Campbells. It's still a good idea to occasionally check your hamster's eyes for discharge. An eye infection should be evaluated by a vet.You should also look at your hamster's bottom once in awhile. Staining, loose stools, or a wet tail can indicate diarrhea. Female hamsters may develop infections in the womb, marked by a foul odor and discharge from the area above the anus. Diarrhea and other infections require a trip to the vet.As your hamster gets older, it's not uncommon for his fur to get patchy in places. However, in a younger dwarf hamster bald spots, rashes, and scaly skin may be a sign of an allergy or a mite infestation. Take your hamster to the vet if you notice such changes.When handling your hamster, feel for any lumps and bumps. Benign cysts are common in hamsters but, in rare cases, a lump could be cancerous. New lumps should be evaluated by a vet as soon as possible., Dwarf hamsters are usually high energy. They're prone to sudden bursts of movement. They also chew, dig, and make nests frequently. Dwarf hamsters groom themselves a lot, so it's not uncommon to see a dwarf hamster licking or scratching frequently. If you notice a lack of grooming, a dip in energy, and a disinterest in chewing and digging, take your hamster to see a vet. Abnormal behavior can be the sign of a medical condition.However, there is one exception. If your dwarf hamster is on the older side, you can expect him to slow down with age. This is generally not a sign something is wrong. If your dwarf hamster is older than a year or a year and a half, it's normal for him to be less high energy., Hamsters can develop diabetes. The first sign is usually an increase in water consumption. If you suddenly notice you're filling up your hamster's water bottle more than usual, make an appointment with a vet to have your hamster checked for diabetes."

Look for signs your hamster isn't eating.,
Don't assume food that disappears has been eaten.,
Pay attention to signs that your hamster is having difficulty eating or making a mess.,

Look at the front teeth.,
Assess whether the front teeth are too long.,
Decide whether the molars need to be inspected.,
Inspect your hamster's front teeth for genetic dental problems.,
Get your hamster's molars checked by a veterinarian.,
Trim your hamster's teeth.,
Prevent dental problems.",How to Diagnose Hamster Dental Problems," Overgrown teeth make it difficult for the hamster to eat. This is because the long teeth force the jaws permanently apart, the long teeth grow into the roof of the mouth or pierce the lips, or the teeth develop sharp jagged edges that make eating painful.If your hamster's food is not disappearing like it usually does, then it may not be eating due to dental problems.;
, Since your hamster can store food in its pouch, don't take the disappearance of food from the bowl as absolute evidence it is eating. It is not unusual for hungry hamsters that are struggling to eat, to pack their pouches or else hide food in their bed.

, If the hamster is trying to eat but having a hard time, it will probably spill food all over the place. So, if your hamster is being messier than usual, you should begin to suspect that they are having an issue.

, Take a look at your hamster for signs of saliva staining around the mouth or down its chin. Long teeth can make it difficult to swallow properly. They also cause pain, which makes the hamster drool heavily.

, If you suspect your hamster isn't eating, then try to determine if it is losing weight. It can be hard to assess a hamster's weight, especially with its fluffy fur, but if you think it is losing weight, that can be a symptom of dental problems.

, Infected teeth can cause accesses to form in and around the mouth. This will cause the region to swell, which should look different from when your hamster packs its cheeks with food.


The area may smell badly as well, as infections, such as abscesses, tend to emit a foul odor.

, It is the incisors, located at the front of the mouth, which most commonly overgrow. These can be seen with the naked eye at home. To check the incisor teeth, gently grasp the hamster's scruff so that its lips are drawn back in a ""smile.""However, take care when handling the hamster not to get bitten.
Be aware, that being overly enthusiastic when holding a hamster's scruff can cause its eyes to pop out of the socket. So, if in doubt, have a vet or vet tech show you what to do.

, The tips of the hamster incisors should meet like two chisel blades coming together. The incisors are curved but you need to make sure they grind against each other. Otherwise, they are at risk of overgrowing.


Determining if the incisors are too long can be tricky, and requires some experience. As a general rule, imagine whether your hamster is able to open its incisors wide enough to nibble on a peanut. If the gap between the tips of the incisors when its mouth is fully open is not sufficient to pick up a peanut, then the teeth are too long.
Also, look for malformation. Look for teeth that are angled oddly, such as sticking out to one side. Sometimes, hamsters with really bad teeth even have teeth that are pointing straight into the roof of their mouths.

, The molar teeth are more difficult to check out and you may need a trip to the vet to get these checked. However, molar problems are usually the result of problems with the incisors, so if the incisors are fine then the risk of molar overgrowth goes down (but is not eliminated altogether).Conversely the hamster with overgrown incisors is at increased risk of molar problems. Thus, if you trim the incisors and the hamster's chin remains wet, then get a vet to check the molars.<

, In addition to having dental problems because the teeth are not worn down, it is not uncommon that hamsters have a genetic tendency for their teeth to grow not in perfect alignment. This means the teeth do not meet at exactly the right place, like the blades of scissors coming together, and they do not wear down against each other.Spotting signs that your hamster's teeth are misaligned before they cause a real problem will allow you to deal with the issue before it becomes a problem.
Hamsters have two types of teeth: molars located at the back of the mouth, and incisors at the front. The two sets are separated by a large gap, called the diastema. Thus, the incisors at the front of the mouth are easy to see, but the molars at the back sit deep within the cheeks and are difficult to see. In order to get a good look at a hamster's molars, the hamster is sedated and a special speculum used by a veterinarian.

, A vet may use the speculum from an otoscope to peer inside the hamster's mouth and check for spurs on the crowns of the molar. This can be tricky, especially if the hamster has full pouches or has recently eaten.If your hamster is especially unwilling to be looked at, but you suspect a problem, then the veterinarian may need to sedate the animal to inspect its teeth.

, Overgrown incisors can be trimmed down with nail clippers. However, it's best to have a vet or vet tech show you how to do this first. It can be tricky to hold the hamster still while clipping its teeth.Overgrown molars need to be clipped with special long handled clippers, often with the hamster sedated. This should be done in a veterinary office., Prevention is better than a cure, as it avoids the pain and discomfort of dental problems in the first place. To avoid these problems, provide your hamster with blocks of untreated wood or a dog biscuit to chew on.Giving your hamster constant access to these things can prevent tooth problems but it is not a guarantee. You still need to inspect your hamster's teeth regularly to look for problems.

Handle tangles carefully.,
Groom your hamster frequently.,
Trim your hamster’s hair if necessary.",How to Groom a Syrian Hamster1," Hamsters are tiny creatures, so a small brush is all you really need. You can look for one at pet supply stores. However, a soft bristle toothbrush or paintbrush, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in size, will also work well., The fur length of hamsters can vary. Some Syrian hamsters can have very long fur, however, making it difficult to groom them with a brush. If yours has long hair, you can use a small pet comb (such as a cat flea comb) instead., Some hamsters love being brushed, others are more reluctant to be groomed in this way. It is a good idea to have some treats available when attempting to brush your hamster, especially if it is a new pet. Offering it plenty of treats before, during, and after brushing will encourage it to form positive associations with being groomed., Gently pick up your hamster and set it in your lap. Pet it and offer it treats. Do not start brushing until it seems calm., Move the brush or comb lightly down the hamster’s belly back. Always work in the direction that your pet’s fur grows in. This will make the process more comfortable for the hamster., If you encounter knots or tangles in your hamster’s fur, do not force your way through them, or tug at them. Instead, gently brush through them a little at a time until they are cleared., Brush your hamster any time it appears to have tangles or dirt in its fur. Otherwise, groom your pet about once a week. Some hamsters, especially long haired Syrians, may need brushing twice a week. This will prevent matting., If your hamster is prone to frequent matting or tangling, or refuses to be brushed, you may need to shorten its fur. Carefully use a pair of cosmetic scissors to trim its fur to about 1 inch in length. Work cautiously so that you don’t cut the hamster. If you feel anxious about trimming the fur, see a vet or professional pet groomer for help."

Reward your hamster.",How to Trim Hamster Nails," If your hamster is not tame enough to be handled, you will need to tame him before you can even think about trimming his nails.


Be patient when working with your hamster. Remember that it will take time for him to get use to you, and to being handled. If you lose your patience, it will frighten him, prolonging the process even more.
If your hamster badly needs his nails trimmed, but is too wild to be handled, take him to your vet where they can use a sedative to take care of the nails.
Have plenty of treats ready during the taming process, too!;
, Once your hamster is tame, and doesn’t mind when you hold him in your hand, spend a few minutes each day holding him in the position you will hold him in when trimming his nails.


There is no right way to hold your hamster when trimming his nails. Find a way that is comfortable for both you and your hamster. You can try holding him upright in your hand so that his paws stick out above your fingers, or try holding him flat, so that you will be able to grasp his his paw between your fingers.
Don’t hold on to his paws when first practicing this position. Get him comfortable with it before moving on to that.
Give him a treat to reward him when he sits still in your hand.
After practicing for a few times, you might also consider wrapping him in a small towel to keep him more contained, if you think it is necessary. If he sits very still in your hand, it may not be necessary.

, Once your hamster is comfortable sitting in the nail-trimming position, spend time each day holding each of his paws between your fingers. Begin with a very gentle grasp, and when he becomes more comfortable (e.g. doesn’t try to jerk his paw out of your fingers) begin to grasp a bit more firmly. You want your grasp to be firm but gentle when you trim the nails.


Remember to reward him after each training session! Either with a treat or some time spent running around in his ball, if he has one.

, Once your hamster will allow you to grasp his paws, take time to examine them carefully. It is critical that you understand where the quick is. If you trim the quick, it will bleed and be very painful for your hamster. If you do trim the quick it is unlikely he will let you trim them again.


Most hamsters have nails that are translucent, so when you look very carefully, you will see a part that is nearly clear, but closer to where his nail meets his paw, there will be a more cloudy part; this is the quick.
The quick is the area where the blood supply to the nails ends., If you have never done it before, it is a good idea to have your vet do it the first time. This way, you can watch the procedure, and see how it is done, as well as how long the nails should be.Do not try to trim your hamster’s nails on your own if he is not tame enough to sit still while you hold him in your hand.
Ask your vet if you can watch him trim the nails, and if he can explain the process as he goes through it so that you can do it on your own.

, You will need good lighting (a small desk lamp may work well), a pair of small pet nail clippers or human nail clippers (you can also use nail scissors as well), some styptic powder to use in case you cut one of the nails too short, and treats for your hamster.Styptic powder can be found at most pet stores or online. This powder is used to stem bleeding. Hopefully, however, you won’t need to use it.
You might also consider wearing gloves if you’re worried your hamster might bite you, although this should not be the case if you have spent adequate time taming him.

, Don’t squeeze him too tight, but firmly enough that he is secure in your hand.You can also wrap the bottom half of your hamster in a towel to help keep him contained.
This will also give your hamster a feeling of security.

, With the thumb and forefinger of the hand you are using to hold the hamster, hold his paw firmly. This way, you will be able to trim the nails of that paw.

, This is why it is important that you have a bright light (or that you sit in bright sunlight). Hamsters nails are usually translucent, and with brighter light you will be able to see the quick. You should absolutely not cut this! If you do, it will be painful for your hamster and the nail will bleed.


The quick is the area where the blood supply to the nails ends., Make sure that you are trimming only the nail, and not the quick! Clip the nail. Your hamster may squirm at the point if he feels frightened. Offer him a treat, if necessary.


On some days, your hamster may be too squirmy to trim more than one or two nails. If this is the case, don’t try to force him. Simply trim the nail that is the longest, and try again tomorrow., If you were successful with the first nail, and your hamster is still calm and still in your hand, proceed to the next nail. You should only continue to trim the nails for as long as your hamster will sit still.


If he gets impatient and squirmy, either take a break for a few hours or try again tomorrow.You should also try to choose a time of day where your hamster is least active. Hamsters are nocturnal animals, so they will be less active during the day.

, Once you are finished with the nail trimming session, reward your hamster with a treat. Although nail trimming will not usually be a pleasant experience for either of you, if you consistently reward him with treats, he will learn to associate nail trimming with something good.

, If you feel that you need some help trimming your hamster’s nails, you can have someone hold him for you while you trim. However, you should ask someone who has spent time handling your hamster rather than someone who has not. If the person who will help you has never handled your hamster, let them spend some time holding and petting your hamster for a couple of weeks before trying to trim his nails.


This may be the best option if your hamster is very squirmy every single time you try to trim his nails. It will allow the person to hold the hamster to hold on more firmly because he/she will be able to use both hands, and it will allow you to hold the paw more carefully while trimming because you will also have two hands to use.

, Teach them how they should hold the hamster, and let them spend time holding your hamster in this position before attempting to trim the nails.

, Once your hamster is comfortable, you can ask your friend to hold the hamster in the correct position. Make sure you are underneath a bright light so that you will be able to see the nails easily.


This will probably work best if you and your friend face each other. This way, your hamsters paws will be pointing out, directly at you.
If you need to talk during the trimming, make sure you keeps your voices soft and relaxed. You may scare the hamster if you shout or talk very loudly.

, If he squirms, give him time to relax before attempting to trim the nails. Once he is still, very carefully place the nail between the blades, and snip it off. Repeat this for each nail.


Again, be sure that you are not cutting the quick!

, Once you have trimmed all of the nails, have your friend either hold him more loosely so he can relax, or place him back in his cage. Give your hamster some treats to let him know he did a good job.


Don’t forget to thank your helper, too!

Purchase chinchilla sand.,
Fill a bowl with chinchilla sand.,
Place the bowl in your hamster’s cage.,
Observe how your hamster uses the sand.",How to Groom a Syrian Hamster2," Making a container of chinchilla sand available to your hamster will help keep it clean and groomed. This product is readily available at pet supply stores., A bowl made of a hamster-safe material such as terra cotta is ideal. Place enough chinchilla sand in the bowl so that it is about one-half to three-quarters full. That way, your hamster will be able to easily climb in and out of the bowl., Your hamster should be able to freely access the bowl of chinchilla sand, and it is perfectly safe to leave the bowl in its cage. Setting the bowl near the hamster’s exercise wheel can encourage it to use the sand., Many hamsters will roll around in the chinchilla sand, using it as a dust bath. This will keep their fur clean and free of greasy buildup. Some hamsters may use the sand bowl as a litterbox. Otherwise, it is fine to reuse the sand as long as it is not soiled."

Most hamsters will be able to keep their own claws trimmed naturally, just by playing and behaving normally., You can help your hamster keep its claws trimmed, however, by placing objects for it to scratch inside its cage. A bowl of chinchilla sand, like one used for sand bathing, will often do the trick. You can also try putting a clay tile in your pet’s cage. When your hamster digs or scratches, its claws will be naturally trimmed., If your hamster’s claws are unusually long, or do not seem to stay trimmed naturally, you can attempt to clip them. However, make sure that your hamster is calm before you begin, and offer it plenty of treats.Hamster claws are very small, and so you may find that a magnifying glass comes in handy. Good lighting will also make it easier to see what you are doing.
You can use nail clippers to do the job.

Be patient and cautious, and clip only the very end of your hamster’s claw. If you try to clip off too much, you may hurt your hamster or cause it to bleed.
If your hamster becomes anxious or wiggles away while you are trying to clip its claws, just let it go and try again latter. Forcing the hamster to have its nails clipped will only make it frightened, and the process will become more difficult.
Trimming the longest claws first can be most effective. That way, if your hamster wiggles away, you will at least have helped some.
You should not need to clip your hamster’s claws more than once a month, and perhaps even less frequently.

, If you are really struggling to clip your hamster’s claws, or feel like it has a claw-related issue (unusual length, hangnails, infection, etc.), contact a vet. It is better to get help than to accidentally hurt your pet."

These may be for rabbits or chinchillas, but can be used for the hamster., Pick a container that is made of ceramic, but is fairly shallow. These containers should not be easily overturned. Fill the container enough to allow the entire animal space to roll in it. Allow the hamster a few minutes to roll around in the sand., Use a soft brush or clean Hold the hamster in one hand, or let a helper hold them rag. Gently dust off the hamster with the soft brush or rag.Avoid the eyes, ears, and mouth. Use quick, light strokes.

, Clean the dish out thoroughly with water, and towel dry it to make sure it’s completely dry before a later use.Use a fresh batch of dust or sand each time

, If brushing and bathing doesn’t improve your long haired hamster’s fur then you may resort to trimming. Avoid holding the hamster on its back while you do this. Keep it held in your hand or the hand of a helper. Use a small pair of scissors to trim just a little at a time from the matted fur.Trimming may even be preferable to the hamster
Feed the hamster a small piece of fruit or vegetable to keep it calm during the process.

, Get a shampoo specifically designed for hamsters or small pets from a pet store or pet aisle. Set some towels around to protect against splashing.Make sure you’re in an area you don’t mind getting wet like a sink or basin.
Wet baths are usually not a great idea for hamster’s as they can remove essential oils from the hamster’s coat.

, Use a soft grooming brush. Hold the hamster in one hand, or let a helper hold them. Pour a little of the shampoo onto the brush with some warm water. Work it into the hamster’s fur with brief light stokes.Avoid the eyes, mouth, and ears.

, Use a soft towel. You can cradle the hamster in the towel as long as the hamster has support, and feels safe. Make sure to gently pad down all of the hamster’s fur so it’s dry. Don’t be so rough you scrape the skin.If the hamster seems to be panicking or squirming then revert to the single hand-held method.

, Check for drafts. You want to make sure the hamster is not exposed to any cold air vents, wind, fans, or anything else that might make it cold while wet.

If you trim the “quick” or blood vessel then you can use some baking soda on the area to help stop the bleeding.Usually a hamster wears down their toenails through digging and climbing, but if the nails are growing so long they harm the hamster’s ability to walk or function then you can try trimming them.

, Remove the hamster to a temporary holding area like a shoebox. Completely remove all bedding from the main cage into a trash bag or similar disposable container. Thoroughly cleanse the cage with water, and dry it with towels or paper towels. Once try replace the bedding with a less entangling material.Tangles can occur with paper bedding too, but this might be a slightly better option. Consider sawdust as a bedding material.

, You can buy chew toys from a pet store. You can also improvise some gnawing elements for the hamster by putting in a small piece of untreated wood or tiny untreated branch from a hardwood tree. These all need to be pesticide free. Hamster teeth, like that of other small rodents, grow continuously. Hamsters need something to gnaw on to keep their teeth at a comfortable length.
Trees that tend have good wood for hamsters to chew include aspen, oak, apple, and cherry.

, Do short cleaning sessions especially with the brush and bathing techniques first. Increase the time you spend cleaning the hamster’s fur for each session until you can get a complete cleaning and drying session performed.Matted fur can be a problem as the coat comes in later, but you want the hamster used to the cleaning routine early

Brush your long-haired hamster.,
Buy a rubber finger-brush for your hamster.,
Cut your long-haired hamster’s fur.,
Remove toxic substances from your hamster.,
Use a damp cloth for clean your hamster.,
Avoid using anything other than water.,
Dry your hamster completely.",How to Groom a Hamster1," Long-haired hamster may get dirt or mats in their fur that can only be removed by brushing them. The best instrument to use is a clean, unused, soft-bristled toothbrush. Some hamsters may enjoy being brushed, and will sit still for you. Others may find it very annoying and try to get away.Long-haired females may not need to be groomed as often as the males, as their normally have shorter fur.Some long-haired male hamsters have a ‘skirt’ at the end of their bodies, made of fur. This fur may need to be cleaned more often than other parts of them.
You may want to get in the habit of brushing your long-haired hamster once a week.;
, If you want to try something different, and if you think your hamster would appreciate it, you can buy a small rubber brush that slip onto your finger. Some are designed for pets, some are designed for humans (as tiny massage fingers). If you find one and want to use it, it would work the same as a toothbrush. Just remember to be gentle., Some long-haired male hamsters have skirts that can be a couple of inches long. These skirts may end up dragging through your hamster’s water dish or poop and getting dirty. While your hamster should be able to clean his own skirt, it may be easier to simply cut back the fur instead.This is also helpful in the warmer months if your hamster is overheating. You can cut back the length of his skirt to keep him cool.
Be careful that you don’t accidentally cut your hamster’s tail, which will be shorter than the skirt.

, If your hamster should get himself into trouble and get some sort of toxic substances on him, you do not want him to lick it off. Hamsters clean themselves with their tongues and mouths, which means anything they clean off their fur will be ingested. Do the following instead:If possible, use scissors to cut away any fur that contains the toxic substance.
If you cannot cut off the fur (maybe, as an example, the substance is also on his skin), use a clean, unused, soft-bristled toothbrush with a very small amount of warm water. Use the toothbrush and water to clean the area until all the substance is gone.
If you use water to clean you hamster, use the smallest amount possible.

, One alternative to using a wet toothbrush to clean your hamster’s fur is to use a damp cloth. As with the toothbrush, use only the smallest amount of warm water you can. And if possible, try to only get the top layer of your hamster’s fur wet., It may seem tempting, but never use shampoo or soap on your hamster. If you need to clean him, use only warm water. And use as little water as possible so as not to remove any of the important oils on his fur.The only exception here is if your vet recommends something specific.

, Before you hamster goes back in his cage, make sure he is completely dry. Any dampness left in your hamster’s fur can cause him to get cold, which in turn can make him sick. If you’ve used water on your hamster to help clean him up, you may want to hold him until he’s try, in order to allow you body heat to warm him up."

Offer healthy snacks.,
Provide chew toys.,
Prevent your hamster from getting bacteria in his mouth.,
Restrain your hamster.,
Check for other dental problems.,
See a veterinarian.",How to Clean a Hamster's Teeth," Feed your hamster a hard food, such as a store-bought pellet food or seed mixture. There are many different varieties available at pet stores that are specially formulated to meet the nutritional needs of hamsters.Avoid feeding your hamster soft foods unless he has some kind of dental disease that makes it difficult to chew.
Don't give your hamster any food that has been ground up, as the small particles can get stuck between his teeth, causing cavities.;
, You should also supplement your hamster's diet with healthy snacks like raw fruits and vegetables. These provide nutrients, and the hard texture also helps promote good dental health.Be very cautious when purchasing store-bought treats for hamsters. Some of them contain sugar, which can cause dental problems like tooth decay.You should also not give your hamster any human foods that may contain added sugar.

Not all kinds of wood are healthy for hamsters to chew on. Avoid giving your hamster any wood that has been treated with pesticides or finishes. Some woods also splinter too much, so it's best to stick to small branches from fruit bearing trees if you don't want to use store-bought chew toys., There are a lot of bacteria in the human mouth, and it is possible to pass these bacteria on to hamsters by kissing them or sharing food with them. If you avoid doing these things, you will help keep your hamster's mouth free of bacteria that can cause issues like tooth decay., Before you attempt to inspect your hamster's teeth, it is important to make sure you have him properly restrained so that he can't escape or bite you.

, Some hamsters have problems with the alignment of their incisors (the front teeth). This is because a hamster's incisors never stop growing. The top and bottom teeth are supposed to rub against each other. This friction and the friction of chewing helps to keep a hamster's teeth from becoming overgrown.If your hamster's teeth are naturally crooked or if one of them breaks, the teeth may become too long. This is a serious condition that can cause severe pain and prevent your hamster from being able to eat.
If you do notice that your hamster's incisors seem misaligned or overgrown, see a veterinarian for advice. The condition may require regular trimming of the teeth, which should be done at the veterinarian's office with a special tool.
Pay special attention to the shape and length of the incisors. You should be able to see broken or misaligned teeth without having to restrain your hamster.

, Always bring your hamster to the vet if you have any reason to believe that he is suffering from some kind of dental problem. The vet can perform and in-depth exam and let you know exactly what you need to do to address your hamster's condition.Signs of dental problems include drooling, weight loss, bad breath, and a change in appetite. You should also be aware of the color of your hamster's teeth. While yellow is normal and healthy, dark brown or black is not.

Misaligned incisors occur when these teeth overgrow. The top incisors will not match up with the bottom incisors.Overgrown incisors can grow into the upper and/or lower jaws, which could contribute to problems with the gums.Outside of the mouth, you may notice drooling due to overgrown incisors. , Dental problems in hamsters can cause other health problems as well. For example, a hamster with dental problems may eat less and lose weight. It may also develop bad breath.A hamster with dental problems may eat less because it is not able to get food into its mouth and properly chew on it.

It is not uncommon for hamsters to die from being bathed, either by drowning or because they got sick after the bath.Some situations that might warrant a bath include:


It fell in something that was potentially dangerous or toxic such as neat disinfectant, white spirit, corrosive substances such as an acid, nail polisher remover
The coat got covered in something that would be toxic or cause a stomach upset if the animal groomed and swallowed it (non-food substances such as those mentioned, or chocolate, jam, honey)
The hamster was covered in something really sticky which could irritate the skin (chewing gum that could not be removed by spot cleaning or cutting fur) or that would cause a bowel obstruction if the hamster chewed it off the skin (blu tac, putty, wax) or a substance that would damage the skin such as urine

, If you absolutely must bathe your hamster as a last resort, get a bowl and fill it with a couple centimeters of lukewarm water., Moisten your hamster, taking care to keep the water away from her face.

Gather your supplies.,
Prepare the bath.,
Allow your hamster to roll in the bath.,
Address problems.",How to Clean a Long Haired Hamster1," Long-haired hamsters may need more cleaning than short-haired hamsters. If you notice your hamster seems dirty, a dry bath or sand bath is your best option. In the wild, hamster clean themselves using abrasive dirt or sand as water drains their fur of necessary oils. Always go for a sand bath over a water bath. Before you give your hamster a sand bath, gather your supplies.


You'll need a bowl or basin big enough for your hamster to fit and roll in comfortably. It should also be sturdy enough that it won't tip over in response to a hamster's movements. Avoid bowls made of wood or other products hamsters may chew. Make sure your hamster can climb into the bowl on his own without help.You need sand bath, which is a commercial product specifically for hamster and other small mammals. It can be purchased at a local pet store or online. It is designed to work by rubbing dirt and other grime out of your hamster's fur. Sand bath is sometimes called ""chinchilla bath."" The product should say somewhere on the label whether it's safe for use on hamsters.;
, Dump one to two inches of sand bath into your bowl. Then, place it in your hamster's cage. Keep it away from areas where the hamster defecates, as hamsters sometimes mistake sand baths for a litter box., Hamsters bathe in dirt and sand in the wild. Therefore, a sand bath requires very little work on your part beyond preparing the bath. The majority of hamsters will climb into the sand bath without prompting and proceed to roll and bathe in the sand. The abrasive nature of sand bath removes dead skin particles and absorbs excess oils from the hamster's fur. Allow your hamster to roll in his bath as long as he wants. Then, remove the sand bath and throw out what's left in the bowl., Most hamsters will instinctively climb into the sand bath without prompting. However, some hamsters may be unsure what the bath is. In this case, there are steps you can take to coax your hamster into the bath.


Give you hamster some time. It may take him a few minutes to figure out what the sand bath is, especially if he's never used it before. Keep an eye on him for the first few minutes, leaving him alone with the sand bath.If your hamster does not seem interested in the bath, try coaxing him into the sand bath with treats or toys. It's better to get the hamster to enter the bath on his own rather than picking him up and placing him in the bath. Being physically forced into the bath can be jarring for your hamster. Once in the bath, your hamster will likely figure out its purpose and begin rolling and bathing himself.
The majority of hamsters enjoy rolling in a sand bath but some hamsters may dislike the process. If this is the case with your hamster, you can try to gently brush sand into his fur using a tooth brush or comb. If you're using a comb, make sure it does not have metal bristles. A small plastic comb with wide teeth is easiest on your hamster's fur."

Avoid wet bathing unless the situation is extreme.,
Try to cut out dirty fur first.,
Spot clean the dirty area if clipping fails.,
Dry the hamster completely before returning him to his cage.",How to Clean a Long Haired Hamster2," Bathing a hamster in wet water is not recommended. Water strips hamster fur of essential oils, which can cause health problems and even death. You should only wet bathe your hamster in the event something toxic gets stuck on his fur. In this case, you want to wash the material off before the hamster begins licking himself., Do not jump immediately to wet bathing if something's stuck in your hamster's fur. The ideal course of action for your hamster's safety is to take a small pair of scissors and clip out the infected fur.


Handle your hamster with care. If a hamster is frightened during the clipping process, he may squirm which can cause accidents. Gently pet your hamster for a few minutes before picking him up.
Hold your hamster so that he remains relatively still but be gentle with him. Hamsters are small and handling them too harshly can cause injury.
Slowly clip out the infected area of fur, making sure you get all traces of toxic material safely out of a hamster's fur. Hamsters spend roughly 20% of their time grooming themselves. If toxic material is left in a hamster's fur, it's very likely he will lick or chew at it., Not all hamsters will cooperate when being clipped. If your hamster won't stop squirming, you do not want to risk injuring him. In this case, the best course of action may be wet bathing. However, you should never submerge a hamster in a bowl of water. Instead, spot clean the area.


First, take a soft-bristled tooth brush. Add a little warm water and brush around the infected area. Detangle any matted fur.Then, take a small bit of cotton wool. Add warm water and gently rub out the material from the hamster's fur. Make sure you clean out all the material before finishing.Never use shampoo on a hamster's fur unless it was specifically recommended by a veterinarian. As hamsters are not typically bathed, few pet shampoos are made with their safety in mind. Shampoo can be potentially toxic to hamsters., Long-haired hamsters rely on their fur to keep them warm. You should never return a hamster to his cage without drying him first. Take a clean, dry rag and rub the wet area of your hamster's fur until it's fully dry. This may take a few minutes. Check the area with your fingers to make sure it's dry before returning your hamster to his cage."

You should clean and disinfect your hamster's cage at least once a week.


Remove your hamster from his cage before washing. Place him in a safe enclosure where he cannot escape. Remove all his toys, food and water bowls, and exercise equipment from the cage. Throw out old bedding and any toys that cannot be washed or disinfected.Use a disinfectant spray that's safe for hamsters. Sprays for hamster cage cleaning specifically can be purchased at a pet store. You can also use water and white vinegar if you're worried about chemicals. Spray down the cage with your disinfectant and rub it clean with a rag. Spray the bars of the cage, as well as the floor. You should also disinfect the items you removed, like toys and bowls.Make sure you rinse off and remove any remaining disinfectant. Allow the cage and toys to air dry completely before returning your hamster to the cage. Add new bedding and saw dust when you finish cleaning., If you're cleaning your hamster or his cage, how you handle him is important. Hamsters can be social animals but they may be skittish especially if they don't know you well. Take care when interacting with your hamster to avoid making bath time stressful.


Always try to get a hamster to come to you first. Reach your hand into his cage and hold out your palm. Allow your hamster to sniff you first before trying to pick him up or handle him.Give your hamster treats and toys when interacting with him. This will help him develop positive associations with you.Be mindful of your hamster's responses. If your hamster seems skittish or upset, avoid handling him. Unless there's something toxic in his fur, it might be better to hold off on cleaning him until he's calm. You do not want cleaning time to be stressful for your hamster as it's important he keeps his coat clean."

Make sure both hamsters are dwarf hamsters!,
Evaluate your hamsters' age, size, and temperaments for housing them together.",How to Introduce Two Dwarf Hamsters1," It is important that you are absolutely certain that they're both dwarf hamsters because Syrian hamsters are solitary, and are likely to fight to the death.


Make sure they're the same type of dwarf hamster, because the Campbell's Russian dwarf hamster and the Winter White Russian dwarf hamster are very similar in appearance.;
, Make sure that:


They are no more than 7 weeks old; 4-6 weeks old is the best age for introducing them to each other. Any older than 7 weeks and they are fully adults, making it near impossible to introduce them to new hamsters.
Make sure the hamsters are about the same size so there isn't a larger one picking on a smaller individual.
Make sure your dwarf hamsters have not lived more than 5 to 7 days alone. After living alone for a few days without being introduced to other hamsters they will not be able to tolerate being housed with other dwarf hamsters.
If you don't want to breed the hamsters, make sure they're the same gender.

Choose your hamster.,
Ask a pet store worker if you can hold them.,
Take your hamster home.,
Let the hamster get comfortable.,
Clean the cage.,
Tame the hamster.,
Allow the hamster to exercise.,
Enjoy spending time with your hamster.",How to Introduce a New Hamster to Your Home," Get a cage, food bowl, water bottle, wheel, chew stick, food, bedding(care fresh or aspen),a hideout , and treats.;
,, Inspect each individual hamster and watch them roam their cage for about ten minutes if they are awake., If the hamster is calm, doesn't try to bite or escape you yet perfectly healthy then that's a really good hamster. If you see a hamster with a peg leg, don't be alarmed. It doesn't effect the hamster as much as you might think.

, Set up the cage and get everything together (water bowl filled, bedding in cage, wheel set up, etc. etc.) Some hamsters get shy and try to hide why others roam their cage freely. To give the hamster some privacy shut him/her in a dark room for at least an hour (a day for shy ones, unless the hamster seems comfortable already). Don't talk to the hamster very much and don't scare him/her. You can watch him/her get comfortable but not to much.

, Go for a week or two without cleaning the cage so the scent of your hamster builds up and makes the hamster more comfortable.

, When the hamster is comfortable, take the cage apart and wash everything in hot water and hamster-friendly soaps. Put fresh bedding in and fresh food and water.

, After at least two days, you should open the cage and give it food out of your hand. Do this several times and also talk to it softly and pet it a little bit. After the hamster starts walking to your hand and doesn't bite you or get afraid, start taking it out a few times. Make sure the hamster isn't scared and let it see that you're picking it up. Keep holding it and it will become more friendlier to you. Be patient. Taming takes time.

, Once your hamster is used to you, take it out of the cage and let it roam on the floor. Close the doors and watch it always. After at least ten minutes and at most thirty minutes, let it come back.

, By now your hamster should be more gentle and used to its new home. Enjoy your hamster!

Make sure that the existing cage is large enough for two dwarf hamsters.,
Put your new hamster in one ball, and the old one in another.,
Clean out the entire cage.,
Put in the new hamster's sleeping hut, the new hamster's water bottle, the new hamster's wheel, and the new hamster's bowl and toys.",How to Introduce Two Dwarf Hamsters2," There needs to be sufficient space for them to move about and to keep away from one another when preferred. Make sure the cage is larger than 360 sq inches because 360 sq inches is the minimum for 1 hamster. 

, This is just to keep them out of the way, it is not an important thing, but you do need them out of the cage for the next step.

, Rinse everything with soapy water, including the cage. Clean every single little thing that the cage has in it, and the cage itself. Also put in fresh, clean bedding. This is so that the old hamster does not know where it is.


Make sure there is absolutely no odor of any of the hamsters. Use pet safe disinfectant.

, Keep the old hamster's stuff in, but as cleaned. Ensure that all of your new hamster's stuff is in the cleaned cage already.

"
"
Try this method first.,
Start to slowly introduce them.,
Leave the male or the newest dwarf hamster in the cage for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour.

,
Once you have done this, place the other hamster or the female in the cage.",How to Introduce Two Dwarf Hamsters3," If it doesn't work, switch to the second approach following.

, After you have put all new fresh, clean bedding in, you can either put the newest dwarf hamster in the cage first or, if you are introducing a male and a female put the male in first. Do not do this any other way.


Let the first hamster sniff around for about 45 minutes. You will need the hamster to do this so that it can explore the new cage.

,, Normally they will get on as happy as can be but some hamsters are just uncooperative!

If the prior method of introducing fails and they start fighting, try plan B.

,
Repeat the delicate procedure of cleaning the cage.,
Make sure the dwarf hamsters can see smell and hear each other.,
Put both hamsters in.,
Reintroduce the hamsters.,
If this does not work the first time repeat one to two times more.",How to Introduce Two Dwarf Hamsters4,", Then add a divider. Separate the cage with wire mesh that they are not able to get through. (This works best with an aquarium).

, Ensure that they both have all the necessities; for example, food, water and toys.

, Leave them in their separate spots in the cage for a week or so. Change their water and food when needed.

, After the week is up, take the mesh divider out and let them explore around with the other hamsters.

,


Hamsters are very sociable and normally enjoy the company of others.

"
"
Place the hamsters' habitats side by side.,
Place each hamster in the other hamster's habitat or cage.,
Use a very large habitat that can house two hamsters.,
After about a week, take out the mesh divider out and let them finally see and smell each other.,
If they are housed together successfully, continue to be watchful.",How to Introduce Two Dwarf Hamsters5," Make sure they can hear, smell, and possibly see each other without being able to touch each other. Switch which side they are on daily.

, You can do this by placing one in a box and putting the second one in the first hamster's cage, and then placing the first hamster in the second hamster's cage. At first, the hamsters will be stressed as they'll think they're in enemy territory, but once getting used to the other hamster's scent, you can leave them in there for longer periods of time. Start out by a few hours each day, then increase to a whole day. Switch the first and second hamster into different habitats daily.

, It must be at least 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m) long and have lots of floor space. Make sure that it is new and that neither hamster has been in it before, so it will be neutral ground.


Have a wire mesh divider to separate it into halves, so that your hamsters can be near each other but cannot try to harm each other.
Set up each half of the habitat as you would a single habitat and place one hamster on one side of the divider and the other hamster on the other side. After a 3 to 5 days, begin to switch which side of the divider they are on. This stage may take about a week, depending on the progress of your hamsters.

, Have only nesting houses and hideouts that have more than one exit so that one hamsters cannot corner the other and start a fight. Have enough food, water, and toys for each hamster. If the hamsters start to fight, you'll have to try to continue switching them on each side of the wire mesh divider. If it fails again and again, remember that some Dwarf hamsters simply like to live without the company of other Dwarf hamsters. If the hamsters sniff each other, act cautious, and chase each other around without fighting, they may be doing well. Watch them closely, especially during the mornings and late afternoons and evenings. They may look friendly towards each other during the day but fight at night, so be watchful. If the hamsters fight and bleed, you probably shouldn't try to introduce these two hamsters to each other.

, Hamsters that have lived together for a long period of time (over a year) may suddenly begin to fight. Make sure you provide two water bottles, enough food for two hamsters, nest boxes, hideouts, two of each toy, and two exercise wheels to prevent fighting. If bullying or frequent fighting occurs, you'll need to separate them.

Train your hamster to perform simple tricks.,
Watch your hamster's body language.,
Check the eyes and ears.,
Check its body.,
Check its behavior.","How to Gain Your Hamsters Trust, Tame Them and Communicate With Them"," Making sure it's undisturbed will allow your pet to grow accustomed to its new environment before you handle it. You should resist the urge to pet or pick up your pet, as this may alarm them and break its trust. Instead, start by putting your hand in the cage and allowing it to sniff you so that it becomes familiar with your scent. If your hamster sniffs you before running away, understand that this is normal behavior. Continue doing this for two or three days.;
, Remain still and allow the hamster to come to you. Wait for a few moments to give them time to accept the treat, but be cautious, as they may nibble your fingers or bite you. After a few times of taking the food, they might eventually climb onto your palm and eat there. While they are completely focused on enjoying the treat, slowly lift them into the air and place them onto your lap. With a firm but gentle grip, carefully stroke their fur. After a moment, place them back into the cage. Performing this action will help create a trust bond.

, Place a treat slightly over their head and encourage them to stretch up for it. Every time you do this, tell them in a firm voice, ""Stand."" Your hamster may eventually stand whenever you command them to, even if there is no treat. If they obey you, make sure to reward their behavior. This method can also be applied to other tricks, such as ""paw"", only you place the food in front of them so that they have to reach out for it.

, It can be a strong indicator of your pet's health and happiness. It can tell you a lot about your hamster and what it is thinking. You can keep track of its regular habits so that if something is wrong, you can immediately tell by watching its behavior. The more you know your pet, the faster you'll be able to catch signs of deteriorating health or happiness. The following steps will help you to find out what you're trying to know.

, If they are alert or looking around, your hamster has just seen or heard something of interest. If they are laid back and half closed, your hamster is tired and you should let it sleep.

, If it is standing motionless on two legs, it hears and sees something and is standing to get a better look. If it is curled up in a ball, your hamster may be tired.

, Squealing is usually a bad sign. It could be your hamster is angry, annoyed, scared, or in pain. Check for illness or other possible causes. Squeaking means that either your hamster is frightened or wishes to be left alone. Constant gnawing on the cage means that your hamster needs something to chew on, as it is bored or stressed. If your hamster frequently runs, stops, frantically looks around, and ferociously grooms itself before repeating the routine, your hamster may be bored, stressed, wanting to exercise, anxious or flustered. Give it something to do and check for any sources of stress. Yawning and stretching are good signs, as it means they are content or recently had good sleep. If your hamster starts showing any type of irregular behavior (coughing, sneezing, wheezing, walks hunched up, etc.), it could be sick.

Look for signs that your hamster is ill.,
Keep him warm.,
Check for dehydration.,
Drip fluids to him.",How to Treat Your Sick Hamster1," If you spot behavior that is different from the norm, monitor the hamster even more closely. This could be your first hint that he is about to become sick. Look for signs of the following:


Is your hamster sleeping longer than usual? Keep in mind that old hamsters naturally sleep longer.
Has your hamster lost his appetite?
Does he no longer groom himself?
Is he irritable?
When awake, is he slow moving, or does he have a hard time getting around?
Has your hamster lost any of his fur, or have bald spots? Keep in mind that this is normal for older hamsters.
Does he have a wet chin or throat? This can be a sign of dental problems.
Does he have difficulty eating, such as dropping food out of his mouth?
Does he have a runny nose, teary eyes, or wet bottom?
Do his droppings look different? Hamster droppings should be rod-shaped. Watery droppings indicate too much fresh fruits and vegetables. Hard, dry droppings indicate not enough.;
, There may be situations where you hamster just feels unwell. There are some general things you can do to help nurse your hamster back to health. Make sure to keep him warm. Sick hamsters often lose body heat and feel cool to the touch. You can try standing the cage on a hot water bottle so that he gets under floor heating. Also try wrapping a small hot water bottle in a towel and rest the hamster on it. Be careful to do this in an escape proof box so the hamster doesn't run off.

, If he is not eating or drinking, or if he has wet tail, he will quickly become dehydrated. You will get a clue this has happened if you gently pinch his scruff and let go. If the scruff stays in a peak, then he is dehydrated. You can give him ordinary water, or purchase a fluid-replacement powder designed as a supplement for people with diarrhea, such as Pedialyte or Dioralyte.


Make this up as advised on the instructions., If your hamster won’t drink this on his own, obtain a 1 mL syringe. Hang a drop of the fluid on the end of the syringe and hold it to the hamster's lips. Hopefully he will lick it off. If he doesn't, then wet the fur around his mouth so that he grooms himself and takes in the fluid.


Be extremely cautious about syringing fluid into his mouth. His small size makes it likely you will flood his mouth and he may inhale the fluid, taking it down into his lungs, which can cause serious pneumonia."

Pick up your hamster very carefully.,
Make sure your hamster has a neat and clean home that they cannot escape from.,
Let it get used to its surroundings.,
Spend time with your hamster.,
You generally want to clean its cage every week.,
Give your hamster treats to show it how much you love it.",How to Build a Relationship With Your Hamster," Find one that bonds and connects with you. You might not connect with all of the ones in the store, so try to find one that seems happy (or at least the most willing of all of them) to be with you.;
, If it escapes, you may never find your hamster.

, When you bring your hamster home leave it in its new cage for a little bit and watch it to see how it reacts to its surface and living space.

, Once it's settled into its home make sure to have time alone with it and that you take it out of its cage. When starting out, it is recommended to not let it out with no boundary lines around the two of you so that it can't escape. Know that if your hamster wants to jump out of your hands, it can. It can fit through very small spaces.

, Give it fresh bedding toys regularly. You should give your hamster fresh water and food everyday.

, Hand feed them to it as well, so it remembers that you gave them to it. But make sure your hands don't smell of food so that you won't get bitten.

Respond to respiratory problems.,
Help with dental problems.,
Treat digestive disorders.,
Take care of broken bones.",How to Treat Your Sick Hamster2," If the hamster has a discharge from his eyes or nose, if he sneezes, or if he is hunched up and breathing using his stomach muscles, then he may have respiratory disease. There are certain things you can do to help with this.


Make sure his bedding is clean at all times. Bedding soiled with urine gives off ammonia, which is extremely irritating to the respiratory system. Use a spoon or a scoop to spot clean any wet bedding, and make sure the cage smells clean. If you can smell urine or ammonia, then the effect is a thousand times worse for the hamster.
Spot clean every day, but try to do this in such a way that it does not disturb your hamster too much and add to his stress.
Check that the room temperature is within the recommended range and make adjustments accordingly.
If the hamster has a sticky nose, try and wipe it clean with a damp cotton ball. This helps to keep the airway clear, which makes it more comfortable for the hamster to breath., Teeth problems can make your hamster feel unwell. A clear or milky discharge from the eyes can be a sign of overgrown teeth roots. Check to see if your hamster is eating properly. If he isn't, then a vet check is advisable to make sure there isn't a problem with overgrown teeth. If there is a problem with this, the vet can trim them back. If this is the case and the teeth are not trimmed, the hamster may progressively starve because he is unable to eat.


Another sign of dental problems is a wet chin or neck. This happens when spurs of teeth dig into the cheek or tongue, making it painful to swallow.
Prevention is easier than a cure. This means you should give your hamster suitable items to chew on in order to keep his teeth short.
Avoid giving too many soft foods, such as strawberries or bananas, to your hamster because they don't need much chewing. Instead, give him dry pelleted food and a block of wood for him to gnaw on. Also give him cardboard tubes or boxes, which will keep his teeth healthy. Plus, he will love to demolish them., If your hamster has a wet tail, he will have a wet bottom and will be slower and crankier. Act immediately because this can be deadly. Wet tails come from dirty cages, so you should keep his cage very clean. To treat this issue, get a broad spectrum antibiotic immediately from your vet.


If your hamster has diarrhea, stop feeding him fruits and vegetables until he is better. This condition is usually caused by intestinal or stomach blockage. The best way to avoid this is to provide some alfalfa as part of his diet.
Constipation is caused by lack of water in his diet. Make sure fresh water is available for him at all times. If your hamster does become constipated, give him some carrots or other fresh fruits or vegetables as well as more water., There are levels of breakage that can either be deadly or be healed. If your hamster breaks a leg where you can see bones sticking out, he must visit the vet. If it isn’t too bad, the vet may dress it and bandage the wound. If it is a really bad fracture with broken skin, he may need to be humanely euthanized.


If the leg is at an odd angle but the bones are not exposed and he is eating and otherwise looks healthy, restrict him to one part of the cage for 4 weeks and take away his wheel. This forces him to rest so he doesn't use the leg. This gives the bones the best chance of knitting together. You may also take him to the vet and let him bandage his leg, though he will likely also recommend limiting your hamster’s movements in his cage.
Never give pain relief to your hamster unless prescribed for the hamster by the vet. His small size makes overdose extremely likely."
"
Keep a close eye on your hamster at all times.,
Stress your hamster as little as possible.,
Limit extremes of temperature.",How to Treat Your Sick Hamster3," This will help you get to know what is normal for your hamster. Check him at least twice a day and get used to how much he eats every day, how much he drinks, how active he is and when he most likes to play. By knowing this, it helps you spot when things aren't right, such as his appetite has dropped off or he's drinking more than he did.


Knowing these small details will help you spot any possible sickness early in your hamster if it manifests in his daily routine.

, Stress puts a strain on the immune system, which makes your hamster less able to fight off infection and get himself well again.Stress to a hamster includes feeling threatened or unsafe, so make sure the family cat or dog can't sit staring at him for hours on end. Consider covering half of the cage with a towel so the hamster has privacy and can retreat to a safe area if he needs to.


Avoid loud noises, which can also frighten your hamster. Avoid anything in the air that could put a stress on its respiratory system, such as tobacco smoke or spray air fresheners.

, The ideal room temperature for a hamster is between 68 to 72 degrees. If it is very hot, the hamster can suffer from heat stress, so make sure there is a fan blowing near the cage in order to circulate air and cool him off. Very low temperatures below 50 degrees, especially for more than 24 hours, can trigger the hamster to go into hibernation. This makes them go to sleep and they are not able to wake up when you stimulate them, so it can appear the hamster is dead.


If you suspect this is the case, put the hamster in a hamster safe box, such as his carry case, and pop him in the airing cupboard for a few days. Hamster that went into a state of hibernation will wake with this method."

Each type of cage will have its own benefits and drawbacks. Review the following list to get an idea of which type of cage might work best for you and your new hamster:Mesh or wire cages are easy to clean and have great ventilation. However, they may have small openings that can let smaller hamsters escape.
Glass aquariums can provide a safe and secure home for your hamster. However, these cages are more difficult to clean.
Plastic habitats provide modular compartments and tunnels that can be very engaging for your hamster. The down-side of plastic habitats is that they have poor ventilation and are very difficult to clean.;
, Your hamster will want plenty of room to run, sleep, eat, and play in. You will have to find a cage that is also big enough to allow your hamster to nest and burrow in. Remember to leave room for any toys or exercise equipment that you plan on placing in the cage.You will need a cage that is at least a minimum of two square feet.

, Once you have a cage for your hamster, you will need to find a good spot in your home for that cage. You will need to find a place in your home for the cage that meets the following criteria:The ideal temperature for your hamster will be between 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit.
Avoid placing the cage next to any strong drafts, heat sources, or direct sunlight.
Put the cage in a quite place. Your hamster won't feel comfortable if they are disturbed often or are in a noisy environment.

, If you have just brought a new hamster home, you will want to allow it time to become used to its cage and new environment. By letting your hamster adjust to its new home, it will be more relaxed and more open to bonding with you.It can take up to three weeks to bond with your hamster, so be patient and work slowly.

, Start approaching the cage more often and introducing yourself to your hamster. Don't try to work too quickly. Allow your hamster to see and hear you without touching or handling it.Let the hamster know you are nearby. Try talking to it as you work to introduce yourself.
You can try placing your hand in the cage, but don't try to touch the hamster.
Allow your hamster to get used to your scent and presence before any handling is attempted.

, While your hamster is eating its food or a tasty treat you left it, you can try petting your hamster. By showing your hamster that your touch is nothing to fear, it will eventually relax and enjoy your handling it.


It may take a few days until your hamster is used to you touching it.
Don't try to pick up the hamster at this point.
If your hamster gets nervous and wants to hide, let it.

, After your hamster has been allowed time to acclimate to both its new home and owner, you can begin to hand feed it. Work towards this goal slowly and never force any interaction between you and your hamster.Start by placing your hand in the cage without food. Don't try to touch your hamster, instead, allow it to investigate your hand on its own.
Add a treat to your hand when you put it in the cage. Allow your hamster to investigate and take the treat if it wants to.

, After your hamster seems used to your presence and touch, you can try to pick your hamster up. Work slowly and gently as you do so, watching for any signs of stress or fear from your hamster.Never lift your hamster by the tail or the front legs as this will only cause injury.
Make sure you cup your hands and support the entire body of the hamster.
Try to let your hamster climb up and onto your hand before lifting it out of the cage.
Any pain or discomfort felt by your hamster will undo any bond and cause your hamster to fear you.
Make sure your hamster won't get hurt from falling if it escapes from your hand.

, After your hamster has been tamed and is comfortable with you picking it up, you can take it out of the cage to play. As always, be careful when holding your hamster to prevent injury or stress.Never squeeze your hamster as you hold it.
Hold your hamster close to the ground or near your lap in case it jumps from your hands.
If your hamster bites you, it may be tired and time to return to the cage.

, An exercise ball is a great way for your hamster to safely explore your house. These are hollow balls that your hamster can walk inside of, moving the ball and getting great exercise.Exercise balls will keep your hamster safe as it walks around your house.
You should still look for some dangers such as a staircase or other fall hazards.
Let your hamster play for no more that twenty minutes before allowing them a food and water break.

, Before you let your hamster out to explore and get exercise, you will need to check the room for any hazards that may be present. Hamsters can move quickly and are easily injured, so you will need to keep a close eye on them as they play.Keep other pets or animals out of the room.
Look for any electrical cords that your hamster might chew.
Block off any small spaces that your hamster might squeeze into and become stuck.

Look for signs of a fracture.,
Distinguish between an open and closed fracture.,
Know when to go to the veterinarian.,
Be prepared for surgery.,
Let your hamster get lots of rest.,
Feed a nutritious diet.,
Avoid bandaging the fracture.,
Be patient and look for signs of healing.",How to Treat Your Hamster's Broken Leg," You may be able to tell that your hamster is in pain. He might not be as active or won't want to move at all. Other signs that your hamster has a fracture include:Swelling
A crackling or popping sound (from the broken bone rubbing against itself)
The bone visibly sticking out of the open wound (which is rare);
, Once you suspect your hamster has a broken bone, you need to determine what type of a break he has. If it's an open fracture, the white of the bone will be visibly poking through the skin. If he has a closed fracture, the bones aren't visible and there's no skin wound. Instead, the broken bones remain sealed within the muscles of the leg. If your hamster has a closed fracture, you will notice:Dragging of the leg
The hamster avoids putting weight on the leg
A crunching sensation beneath your fingers when you gently feel the area

, If your hamster has an open fracture, you must visit the vet. You won't be able to treat this kind of break at home and without medical treatment, your hamster will get infected bone stumps, leading to general tissue infection, blood poisoning, and death. This is slow and painful for your hamster, so get immediate help.You should be prepared for the vet to suggest euthanasia, to prevent the hamster from suffering. If there's no medical option to treat the leg, euthanasia will save your pet from pain and suffering.

, If your hamster has an open fracture, the veterinarian may suggest that the best course of treatment is amputating the limb, or trying to fix the fracture. Both of these are high risk procedures which need to be done under strict sterile surgical conditions in order to avoid infection. Your hamster will need anesthesia to deal with the pain. Be aware that the procedure is high risk and there is a high likelihood of the hamster passing away



Do not try to replace the bone ends under the skin without anesthesia, since this is incredibly painful for your hamster. It should only be done under trained medical supervision.

Do not give pain relief at home since the small size of the hamster makes it inevitable you will overdose the hamster. Too much pain relief is harmful and could cause gastric ulcers or death.

, Take away the hamster wheel to prevent further damage to the leg. If he lives in a rotastak system with multiple levels and pipes to climb through, remove all of the connections, shelving, or ladders to keep him in one unit. You should also avoid putting him in his exercise ball while his leg is healing. In general, avoid handling him in case he struggles and moves awkwardly on the broken leg.By preventing the hamster from being too active, you will reduce the amount of weight he places on the leg. This lets the fractured ends start knitting together and repairing.
If the hamster is active and uses his wheel, he will disrupt the early scar tissue and delay or prevent healing from taking place.

, Talk with the veterinarian about recommending a healthy diet that includes fresh fruits and vegetables. Consider offering them dried vegetables and other pellets so that they don't rot when your hamster tries to hoard them in a corner of his cage. You may also want to offer milk to drink, since the calcium can help heal bones. But, make sure the milk is fresh and replaced at least every two hours to avoid bacterial contamination. Don't feed your hamster too much, or it may grow overweight, which would put extra weight on its broken leg.Not all hamsters can digest milk, so if his pellets become soft or he develops diarrhea, stop offering milk immediately.

, Since hamsters are so small, it's impossible to bandage the fracture in any way that will help the healing process. It's more likely that a bandage would rub and cause skin sores, or distress your hamster. Your hamster would most likely chew off the bandage, possibly swallowing some of it. The pressure of a bandage on the fracture could also cause more pain.Keep in mind that while other animals, like cats or dogs, can have fractures supported in bandages, their bones are first aligned. The tiny size of a hamster makes this impossible to do.

, Typically, a fracture takes at least 4 weeks to heal, but some hamsters could take longer, up to 12 weeks. Once you've given him some time, watch for signs of healing, like walking on the leg, or no swelling over the fracture site. When you gently handle the leg, he won't react with pain and there shouldn't be any grating if the fracture has healed. If he reacts with pain, stop handling him immediately.


The clearest way to tell if healing is complete is to have your hamster x-rayed. But, this is expensive and you may need to anesthetize your hamster.If your hamster has healed, you can reintroduce his wheel or multiple levels of his cage. There is a chance that your hamster's leg may heal incorrectly. If it does, don't panic. Just monitor your hamster and it should be fine.

Seek veterinary treatment.,
Give the antibiotics as prescribed.,
Monitor your hamster for side effects.",How to Treat Hamster Respiratory Illnesses1," Common causes of respiratory illnesses in hamsters are bacteria (Pasteurella, Streptococcus) and viruses (flu virus).If your vet determined that a bacteria caused your hamster’s respiratory illness, they will prescribe antibiotics.The type of antibiotic will depend on the specific type of bacteria your vet identified during testing.


Antibiotics will not work against viruses. However, a viral infection can weaken the immune system, causing what is called a secondary bacterial infection. If your hamster has a secondary bacterial infection, your vet will prescribe antibiotics.Antibiotics may not work if they are given when the respiratory illness is already advanced.;
, Follow your vet’s prescription instructions carefully. For example, make sure you give the entire course of antibiotics to your hamster.Even if your hamster starts looking better, give all of the antibiotics so all of the bacteria are killed. If you stop treatment early, bacteria could remain that would become resistant to antibiotics.


The antibiotic will be a liquid that you will draw up into an eyedropper.Place the eyedropper into the side of your hamster’s mouth. Slowly and gently empty the prescribed amount of antibiotic into your hamster’s mouth.
Eyedroppers are available at your local pharmacy.

, Hamsters are very sensitive to certain antibiotics. These antibiotics can cause digestive problems for hamsters, such as diarrhea.If your hamster develops diarrhea during antibiotic treatment, call your vet right away. Your vet may prescribe another antibiotic for your hamster.

Know when a new litter is born.,
Keep the mother in a safe, quiet environment.,
Watch for weaning.,
Provide adequate food for weaned babies.,
Remove pups at 3 weeks.,
Separate hamsters into pairs, or alone.",How to Learn When to Separate Hamsters1," Hopefully, you’ve already noticed that your hamster is pregnant. Her belly has probably been bulging, and she hasn’t been moving around very much. Or, she may seem aggressive and restless—moving around quite a bit.Hamster pregnancies last between 16 and 22 days.
Check the cage each day and mark on your calendar the day that the baby hamsters appear.;
, Make sure she has plenty of nesting material, such as cedar shavings. This helps the mother feel safe, and lowers the possibility that she will abandon or eat her young.Leave new mothers undisturbed for 7 days.
Make sure the mother has plenty of food and water that is easily accessible.

, Pups will try to nurse for several weeks, but the mother will start to discourage them after 10 days to 2 weeks. Weaning is a sign that the hamsters are almost ready to be separated., When the pups are being weaned, provide some solid food that has been soaked in water. This can be pellets or other commercial hamster food.Make sure the food and water are accessible to even the smallest pups.

, By now, the pups should all be eating solid food. You can remove them from the mother’s company safely.


If some of the pups are particularly small or unhealthy, they may need to stay with the mother for an extra week.
Hamsters should be separated from the mother by 10 weeks at the latest.

, Dwarf hamsters do well in same sex pairings. This is particularly true of females. Syrian (or Golden) hamsters cannot be housed in pairs. They must be kept alone or they will become territorial and fight."

Separate your sick hamster.,
Make your hamster’s cage comfortable.,
Feed your hamster soft food.,
Keep your hamster hydrated.",How to Treat Hamster Respiratory Illnesses2," If you have several hamsters in one cage, put the sick hamster in a separate cage. This will give the sick hamster some peace and will prevent the healthy hamsters from getting sick.Keep the sick hamster in a separate cage until it has fully recovered.

, During treatment, your sick hamster should be as comfortable as possible. Make its cage comfortable by keeping it at a constant, warm temperature.Hamsters are most comfortable when the temperature is 65‒75 degrees Fahrenheit (18‒24 degrees Celsius).Normal room temperature falls within this temperature range, so place your hamster’s cage in an area with a constant room temperature.


If your hamster is having trouble breathing, place an open jar of Vick’s vapor rub near the cage where your hamster could smell it, but not have access to it.Vick’s vapor rub is available at your local pharmacy. It helps relieve congestion.
Place soft and comfortable bedding, such as plain, unscented toilet paper, in the cage. Tear the toilet paper into strips so your hamster can make a warm nest to curl up in.Place the cage in an area that is draft free and out of direct sunlight.Make sure this area is quiet.

, With a respiratory illness, your hamster will not feel like eating much, if at all. To encourage your hamster to eat, feed it soft, moistened food. If you feed your hamster pellets, soften the pellets with a little bit of water before feeding them to your hamster.


You could also offer your hamster small amounts of scrambled eggs or baby food (fruits or vegetables). Because the baby food has a liquid consistency, feed it using an eyedropper.If your hamster cannot eat on its own, feed your hamster by hand.

, Staying hydrated will help your hamster feel better during treatment. Move your hamster’s water bottle closer to where your hamster sleeps. If your hamster feels too weak to drink on its own, give it a few drops of water at a time using an eyedropper.You could also mix lukewarm water with milk and a little bit of honey.Talk with your vet before mixing anything into your hamster’s water.

"
Place the cage in a comfortable location.,
Keep the cage well ventilated.,
Clean your hamster’s cage regularly.,
Do not overcrowd the cage.",How to Treat Hamster Respiratory Illnesses3," After your hamster has recovered from its respiratory illness, take steps to make sure it doesn’t become sick again. Just like during treatment, your hamster’s cage should be in a draft-free area that is out of direct sunlight., If your hamster’s cage does not have enough fresh air flowing through, there could be a buildup of ammonia from your hamster’s urine. The ammonia could irritate your hamster’s airways and cause respiratory problems. Wire cages provide much better air flow than glass aquariums.


If you have a glass aquarium, you can use a mesh lid rather than buying a whole new cage. A mesh lid would increase air flow through the cage.
A lack of fresh air could also make your hamster’s cage very humid, which could lead to respiratory illnesses. A well-ventilated cage will prevent your hamster’s cage from becoming humid., A dirty living environment can cause respiratory illnesses in hamsters. To keep your hamster’s cage in good shape, clean it twice a week. Cleaning your hamster’s cage involves replacing the bedding, as well as washing the water bottle, food bowl, and other cage accessories with soap and water.


Before you start cleaning, place your hamster in a separate cage.After cleaning, let the cage and cage accessories dry completely before putting everything (and your hamster) back in the cage.
Do not clean the cage too often. This could remove your hamster’s scent from the cage items, making the cage feel unfamiliar to your hamster., An overcrowded cage would be stressful to your hamster. This stress could weaken your hamster’s immune system, making a respiratory illness more likely.If you have a pair of dwarf or Chinese hamsters, their cage should be at least 2.6 feet x 1.6 feet x 1 foot (80 cm x 50 cm x 35 cm).If you have more than a pair of dwarf or Chinese hamsters, consider buying a larger cage or another cage of the same size.
Remember that Syrian hamsters must not be housed in groups because they are very territorial."

Create a comfortable home for both hamsters.,
Look for signs of a positive relationship.,
Look for signs of injury or bullying.,
Enlarge their living space.,
Separate the hamsters if the relationship has not improved.,
Keep hamsters separated from now on.",How to Learn When to Separate Hamsters2," Hamsters like companionship, but it’s important that they have enough personal space. There should be two “houses” and two of any toy to reduce competition.Make it impossible for one hamster to trap the other. Boxes or houses must have at least two exits.
Tubes should not be too long and should not contain blind corners.

, Signs of a good relationship are sleeping, eating, and playing together. You can also look to see if the hamsters are grooming each other.Hamsters are very active at night, so it’s possible you may not see them play together during the day.

, Some squabbling and fighting is normal and even healthy. Hamsters may be working out territory or dominance issues. However, if one hamster seriously injures another, that is not healthy.If a hamster is bleeding or appears weak or wounded, you need to separate the hamsters.
Let the fight resolve before removing a hamster. Interrupting can make things worse or put you or the injured hamster in danger.

, Sometimes hamsters fight because they do not have enough space. If your hamsters are not getting along, you can try giving them more space before separating them.Make sure there is plenty of healthy bedding now that the space is larger.
Giving them a larger space may not solve the problem. Keep an eye out to make sure that the hamsters aren’t hurting each other in the new space.

, You need to remove one of the hamsters before things get dangerous. When the hamsters are relaxed, reach into the cage and remove one of the hamsters.The separated hamster will need a new home with plenty of bedding and things to play with.
The hamsters can be kept near each other, but make sure they cannot physically reach each other.

, Sometimes people try to reintroduce hamsters after separating them. Do not do this. There is a high likelihood that the hamsters will recognize each other as threats rather than old friends.You may choose to introduce new hamsters to the cages, depending on the species of hamster.

Separate hamsters if necessary.",How to Learn When to Separate Hamsters3," If you don’t know what species your hamster is, check with your local pet store or with a veterinarian. Some species of hamster must always be housed alone.Syrian hamsters must be housed alone.
Dwarf hamsters generally do well in pairs.
Never place hamsters of different species together.

, Telling the sex of a hamster is usually rather easy. Males have very noticeable testicles underneath their tails.When pairing hamsters, always choose two hamsters of the same sex, unless you’re an experienced breeder.
Female pairings almost always work well. Male pairings more often lead to conflict.

, Even hamsters that are from a social species sometimes prefer to be by themselves. You can place your hamster in a cage by themselves and see if they seem active and happy.Hamsters housed alone should get plenty of playtime with you. This satisfies their need for social interaction.

, If you suspect that your hamster would like a companion, you can try introducing a new hamster to their home. Watch their interactions carefully.Look for signs of positive companionship and of competition.

, If the hamsters fight continuously and do not exhibit positive ways of relating, you may need to house them alone once more.Do not separate hamsters in the middle of a fight. Wait until they are calm and relaxed.

Talk with your vet about surgical treatment.,
Discuss the risks of surgery.,
Ask about other cancer treatment strategies.,
Feed your hamster food and water.,
Have your vet perform surgery.,
Pick up your hamster.,
Examine the incision site.,
Watch your hamster for signs of pain.,
Observe how much your hamster eats.,
Follow up with your vet.",How to Treat Tumors in Hamsters," After your vet has diagnosed a tumor in your hamster, talk with them about how to treat the tumor. For external tumors (located on the skin), surgery is the best treatment option. For internal tumors (inside the body), though, surgery would be more challenging because of a hamster’s small size and tiny internal organs.Your vet can help you determine whether surgery would be a good treatment option for your hamster.
If you have a female hamster that has breast cancer, your vet may suggest other surgical procedures in addition to tumor removal. They may recommend removing the reproductive organs (spay) or removing the affected mammary gland (mastectomy) to keep the cancer from coming back.;
, Although surgery is usually the best treatment option, it does not come without risks. For example, because hamsters are so small, they can suffer from shock during surgery.Shock occurs when the vital organs, like the heart, do not receive enough blood to function properly.In addition, because internal tumors are usually quite large by the time they are discovered, they are very difficult to surgically remove.


Surgery can be expensive, once you factor in the costs of anesthesia and any medications that may be needed before or after surgery.When you talk with your vet, bring up any concerns you may have about your hamster undergoing surgery.

, Sometimes, a hamster’s tumor cannot be completely removed surgically. It may be too large or located in an area that would make surgery difficult. In these cases, other treatment strategies, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, might work. Chemotherapy involves the use of drugs that kill cancer cells by disrupting the cell cycle (cell division and replication). Radiation therapy uses a focused beam of radiation to kill cancer cells.


Your vet may recommend either chemotherapy or radiation therapy for your hamster. Keep in mind, though, that because hamsters are so small, they are usually unable to handle chemotherapy or radiation therapy.If you are concerned that chemotherapy or radiation therapy on your hamster would do harm than good, you could decide to either let your hamster live with the tumor or euthanize your hamster. Make your decision based on whether your hamster will have a good quality of life with the tumor.

, Unlike other larger pets, hamsters can have free access to food and water up until surgery. Prior to surgery, continue to feed your hamster as usual and provide it with plenty of fresh water. On the day of surgery, prepare a package of your hamster’s normal amount of food. Bring this food with you to the vet, along with your hamster’s water bottle.

, Because of your hamster’s small size, your veterinary team will be extra careful to monitor your hamster during surgery. After anesthetizing your hamster, they will monitor its body temperature, breathing rate, and heart rate. They will also give your hamster fluids so it remains well hydrated during surgery.


Your vet will make an incision and carefully remove the tumor.
After the surgery, either your vet or a member of the veterinary team will call you to let you know how the surgery went and how your hamster is doing after surgery. They will also let you know when you can come pick up your hamster.

, When you pick up your hamster, your vet will give you a set of instructions on how to care for your hamster at home. Make sure to follow these instructions carefully to help your hamster recover after surgery. Before heading home, ask your vet any questions you may have about at-home care, including:


How long will it make my hamster to recover?
What if my hamster looks sick?
Will my hamster need medications?

, Check your hamster's incision site each day. It is normal for the incision to look a little red for a day or two after surgery. However, if the incision site is swollen or oozing yellow or green discharge, it may be infected. Take your hamster back to your vet if the incision site looks abnormal.


If the incision is infected, your vet will prescribe an antibiotic for your hamster. The antibiotic would be in liquid form. You would place the prescribed amount of antibiotic in a small syringe (without the needle), open your hamster’s mouth, and slowly push the syringe’s contents into your hamster’s mouth.
To keep your hamster from chewing at the incision, your vet may give you a small plastic collar (Elizabethan collar) to put around your hamster’s neck.Your hamster would need to wear the collar for at least a few days after surgery.

, Your hamster will probably be in some pain after surgery. However, because hamsters are prey animals, they try to hide signs of pain.Your hamster may try to hide its pain, so you will have to watch it extra closely for any signs of discomfort. Signs of pain in hamsters include:


Decreased activity, scruffy furDecreased appetite, squeals of painHunched posture, not wanting to come out of their sleeping area Call your vet if your hamster is in pain. Your vet may prescribe a liquid pain medication for you to give your hamster.

, Your hamster will probably feel a little groggy right after surgery, so it may not want to eat much at home.Feed your hamster its regular amount of food and see how much it eats. If your hamster still isn’t back to its normal eating routine after a few days, it may feel sick or be in pain.


If your hamster is not eating normally, your vet may recommend a product called Oxbow Critical Care. This product is usually fed to herbivores (plant-eating animals) like guinea pigs, but might encourage your hamster to start eating again., Even if your hamster has a smooth recovery after surgery, your vet will want to see your hamster for at least 1 follow-up visit. During this visit, your vet will examine the incision site and make sure your hamster looks healthy overall. Your vet may also want to see your hamster every few months to examine it for new tumors.Your vet will let you know how often to bring your hamster in for an examination.
If your hamster has developed other tumors, you and your vet will discuss treatment options again.

Consider feeding your hamster raspberry bush leaves or arrowroot.,
Reintroduce vegetables after the diarrhea stops.,
Watch for improvement.,
Keep your hamster’s cage warm.,
Clean your hamster’s cage.,
Remove uneaten food.",How to Treat Diarrhea in Hamsters," In small quantities, fresh vegetables are part of a healthy, balanced hamster diet.They are very nutritious and have extra moisture that keeps hamsters well hydrated. Eating too many vegetables, though, can cause diarrhea because of too much moisture. To help stop your hamster's diarrhea, take fresh vegetables out of its diet. Feed your hamster only dry food (hamster pellets).Hamster pellets are very nutritious, so you don’t have to worry about your hamster not getting enough nutrients when it eats only dry food.;
, Like people, hamsters become dehydrated if they have diarrhea. Make sure your hamster has plenty of fresh, cool water to drink so it can rehydrate itself.If you notice your hamster isn’t drinking its water, give it water by hand:Fill a small eye dropper with cool water. Holding your hamster, put the eyedropper in the corner of its mouth. Squeeze a few drops of water at a time into your hamster’s mouth.
Talk with your vet about how often you should give your hamster water by hand.

, Raspberry bush leaves and arrowroot can help a hamster recover from diarrhea.Talk with your vet before feeding either of these items to your hamster. Your vet can advise you on how much of these items to give your hamster to treat the diarrhea.

, After a day or two without vegetables, your hamster’s diarrhea should stop. Don’t start refeeding vegetables right away, though. To allow your hamster to fully recover, wait one to two weeks before adding vegetables back to the diet.When you feed your hamster vegetables, make the portion size equal to a few raisins. Feed the vegetables once a day., With normal cases of hamster diarrhea, the hamster will look otherwise healthy (no hunching over or loss of appetite) and be completely healthy again after a few days of eating a dry food-only diet.However, with more severe diarrhea, a hamster will not improve after a day or two. In fact, the diarrhea may get worse and the hamster may look sicker (dull and sunken eyes, ruffled coat, weight loss).


Severe diarrhea is a symptom of Wet Tail, which causes serious illness in hamsters. If your hamster is not getting better, take it to your vet right away for further treatment., While you treat your hamster for diarrhea, make sure its cage stays warm (70‒85 degrees Fahrenheit/21‒29 degrees Celsius).Normal room temperature is around 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius), so keep your hamster’s cage in a non-drafty room that’s at room temperature. You could also place a heating pad (available pet stores) under the cage using these suggestions:Place the heating pad under a small portion of the cage so your hamster can move away from the heat when it wants to.
After the heating pad has been on for a while, touch the bedding to see if it is warming up.
Do not use a human heating pad, since these pads automatically shut off and can leave your hamster feeling cold.

, This is important if your hamster has severe diarrhea from Wet Tail. A dirty cage can have a buildup of bacteria or other harmful organisms.Cleaning the cage will remove disease-causing organisms. Below are cleaning suggestions:Each day, clean the food bowl and water bottle with hot soap and water. Refill the food and water.
Change out the bedding weekly. Leave a small section of old bedding in the cage so your hamster recognizes its scent on the bedding.
Once a week, remove everything from the cage. Clean and disinfect the cage and plastic toys.

, Each day, check your hamster’s cage for uneaten food. Remove and discard this food. If you leave the food in the cage, it could spoil and become an easy place for bacteria and mold to grow.Bacteria and mold could make your hamster very sick.

Repeat treatment, if necessary.,
Clean your hamster’s cage.",How to Treat Skin Disease in Hamsters1," Mites are one of the most common skin diseases in hamsters. Your vet will diagnose mites by taking a skin scrape (thin scrape of skin using a scalpel blade) and analyzing it with a microscope.Your vet may also brush your hamster while holding a white piece of paper to catch the mites. Your vet would then look at the mites with a magnifying glass.Two species of mites can affect hamsters. One of the species, Demodex criceti, is fairly easy to see and will look short and squat when viewed with a microscope.;
, If you have multiple hamsters, isolate the one with mites until after treatment is complete.Mites are contagious, so you would not want your healthy hamsters developing a mite problem. If multiple hamsters are affected, treat them all at the same time.

, Several treatments are available for treating mites. One treatment is medicated shampoo. However, hamsters don’t like baths very much, so your hamster may resist getting bathed with the medicated shampoo.Another treatment is a medicated ointment that you would apply to the affected skin areas.Oral ivermectin, which kills parasites, is a treatment option.You would place the prescribed number of ivermectin drops into your hamster’s mouth.
Anti-mite sprays are available as an over-the-counter treatment.Talk with your vet before using an over-the-counter medication on your hamster.
A whole body dip is recommended for severe mite infestations. This dip would be with a medicated bath product containing ivermectin.Your vet would explain how to perform this dip at home.

, Old hamsters and those with a weak immune system may need to be treated for mites more than once.Talk with your vet before repeating treatment.

, Hamsters can get mites from their cage bedding. Therefore, cleaning and disinfecting your hamster’s cage is essential to treating mites. First, remove everything from the cage and throw away all of the bedding. Wash the entire inside of the cage with hot, soapy water and a sponge or scrub brush.


Wash all of cage accessories (food bowl, water bottle, plastic toys) with hot, soapy water as well.Use a hamster-safe cage disinfectant, which is available at your local pet store. Disinfect the cage and the cage accessories according to product label instructions.
Allow everything to dry before placing the items back in the cage. Use clean, fresh bedding.

Take your hamster to your vet.,
Allow your vet to treat the abscess.,
Give your hamster antibiotics as prescribed.,
Have your vet trim your hamster’s teeth.,
Feed your hamster soft, smooth food while he is healing.,
Make sure your hamster gets enough fiber.,
Consider using only soft bedding in your hamster’s cage.",How to Treat Cheek Abscesses in Hamsters," Before beginning treatment, it will be important to determine whether your hamster’s swollen cheeks are due to an abscess or food storage. Because your hamster’s cheek pouches are so large, your hamster can stuff a lot of food into them and make them look swollen. If the swelling goes down after your hamster empties the pouch, then there is no abscess.If the swelling doesn’t go down, then your hamster likely has a cheek abscess.
An abscess would make your hamster feel sick. Your hamster may eat less and look unwell in general (e.g., scruffy fur, low energy level).A cheek pouch stuffed with food wouldn’t make your hamster feel sick.;
, If you think your hamster has an abscess, take your hamster to your vet for treatment. Your vet will examine the swollen cheek pouches carefully to verify that an abscess is present. Your vet may need to sedate your hamster to look inside its mouth.


During the appointment, give the vet as much information as you can about your hamster and the cheek abscess. Tell your vet what types of food your hamster eats, as well as the type of bedding in its cage.Also, tell your vet when you first noticed the cheek swelling.

, To treat the abscess, your vet will open the abscess and allow it to drain. Opening the abscess is a surgical procedure, so your vet will anesthetize your hamster. Once your hamster is anesthetized, your vet will open the abscess with a sharp surgical instrument.


To drain the abscess, your vet will use a surgical drain. This drain will prevent the abscess’s contents from entering your hamster’s mouth and spreading through its body.
After the abscess is empty, your vet will clean the empty pocket and flush it with an antiseptic solution that will kill any remaining bacteria.
You should be able to take your hamster home on the same day as the surgery, provided your hamster recovers well from the procedure.

, To prevent infection after the surgery, your vet will probably prescribe an antibiotic for you to give your hamster.Follow the prescription instructions carefully and give the entire course of antibiotics. If you stop the antibiotic treatment early, the remaining bacteria could become resistant to antibiotics, making future treatment very challenging.


The antibiotic will likely be in liquid form. To administer the antibiotic, draw up the prescribed amount of antibiotic into a small syringe (without the needle attached). Hold your hamster snugly, open his mouth, and gently push the syringe's contents into the mouth.
Your vet can give you the syringes. If you are unsure about how to use the syringe, ask your vet to demonstrate how to use it.
Contact your vet if you have trouble giving your hamster the antibiotic.

, Overgrown incisors (curved middle teeth) can damage the cheek pouches and are the most likely cause of an abscess.If your hamster’s incisors are overgrown, your vet will need to trim them down with specialized dental tools. Do not trim the teeth yourself! You could damage the teeth and create even sharper tooth edges.


Your hamster will need to be anesthetized for the teeth trimming.
Your vet may want you to schedule regular teeth trimmings.

, If your hamster eats something sharp, that food could scratch the linings of the cheek pouches. Soft foods like cereal and rice would be good to feed your hamster as his abscess heals.If your hamster eats pellets, you could soften them by adding a little bit of water to them (not so much that the pellets become soggy).Other soft foods include:Scrambled eggs
Cooked oatmeal
Yogurt
Talk with your vet about how much of the soft food to feed your hamster.

, You may be worried that hay or chew toys (e.g., hard dog biscuits, wooden sticks) might harm your hamster's cheek and cause another abscess, but this is unlikely. By depriving your hamster of these things, you may actually be increasing his chances of getting another abscess, as his teeth may become overgrown without fiber and things to gnaw on.


If you use wooden sticks, make sure the wood is not pine or cedar—pine and cedar are toxic to hamsters.

, Once your hamster has been treated for a cheek abscess, it will be important to prevent future cheek abscesses. Using soft bedding is a great prevention strategy, since soft bedding will not scratch the lining of your hamster’s cheek pouches. Shredded paper is ideal soft bedding for your hamster. You do not have to buy shredded paper—simply tear unscented toilet paper or paper towels into strips.You may wish to provide soft bedding while your hamster recovers, but it is likely not necessary to make a permanent switch.
Carefresh® and Yesterday’s News are soft beddings that you can purchase.
Wood shavings, hay, and straw have sharp edges.Do not use them in your hamster’s cage.
Create a thick layer of bedding on the cage floor. Replace the bedding when it becomes dirty or wet.

Have your vet diagnose ringworm.,
Follow treatment instructions.,
Clean your hamster’s cage.,
Keep the cage well ventilated.",How to Treat Skin Disease in Hamsters2," The term ‘ringworm’ is misleading because ringworm is actually caused by a fungus (Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum). If your hamster has ringworm, you will see patches of hair loss where the skin looks crusty, flaky, and red. Your vet will diagnose ringworm by looking at the affected skin with a special lamp and examining some of your hamster’s fur with a microscope.The affected areas of skin look like rings.Ringworm is common in older hamsters., Several treatment options are available for ringworm. One option is medicated shampoo, containing either povidone iodine (antibacterial) or an antifungal medication. Consider trimming your hamster’s fur before the bath so the shampoo is most effective.Be mindful that your hamster may resist getting bathed.


Topical treatment with griseofulvin, an antifungal medication, is another treatment option. Your vet would shave the affected skin areas first, then you would apply the ointment at home as prescribed.Isolate the affected hamster during treatment.Treatment for ringworm usually lasts 18‒21 days.Hamster ringworm is contagious to humans, so you should wear gloves when handling your hamster and wash your hands after handling., A hamster can get infected with ringworm from its cage bedding. Clean the cage and its contents with hot, soapy water. Throw away all the bedding and put in clean bedding when the cage is completely dry. As with handling your hamster, wear gloves when cleaning its cage., If your hamster’s cage doesn’t get much fresh air, it could become damp inside, which would promote fungal growth and increase the risk of a ringworm infection.If you do not have a wire cage, consider purchasing one. A wire cage would have great ventilation.


If buying a new cage is not practical, purchase a wire cage top to improve the cage's ventilation.

Take your hamster to your vet.,
Allow your vet to treat the wound.,
Remove the cause of the wound.",How to Treat Skin Disease in Hamsters3," A hamster can get a skin wound by fighting with its cage mate or getting scratched by sharp bedding. This wound can become infected, causing an abscess (pocket of infection) to form. When you take your hamster to your vet, they will take a sample from the wound to identify the type of bacteria in the wound.The type of bacteria will determine which antibiotic will work the best.


Territorial female hamsters can bite each other., If an abscess has formed, your vet will surgically remove it and inject an antibiotic in the affected area. If the abscess ruptures on its own before surgical treatment, your vet will drain the abscess and flush the area with an antiseptic until it’s clean. For at-home care, your vet will prescribe an antibiotic ointment that you would apply to the affected area., If your hamster has a bite wound from its cage mate, put the hamsters in separate cages. If the wound was caused by sharp bedding, replace the bedding with something soft, like shredded toilet paper or paper towel.By removing the cause the wound, you can help prevent future skin wounds.

Know a dwarf hamster’s average adult weight.,
Find a scale suitable to weigh your hamster.,
Weigh your hamster.,
Keep track of your hamster’s weight.,
Observe your hamster’s general health regularly.,
Put your hamster on a diet.",How to Tell if a Dwarf Hamster Is Obese1," In general there are three different species of dwarf hamsters that are kept as pets — Russian or Siberian dwarf hamsters, Roborovski dwarf hamsters, and Chinese dwarf hamsters. Each species of hamster has a slightly different average weight range, as follows:A Russian or Siberian dwarf hamster, also known as a Winter White or Campbell’s dwarf hamster, normally weighs 1.5 – 2 ounces (or 40 – 60 grams) on average.
A Roborovski dwarf hamster will normally weigh 1 – 1.5 ounces (or 25 – 40 grams) on average.
A Chinese dwarf hamster will normally weigh 1.5 – 1.8 ounces (or 40 – 50 grams) on average.;
, In order for the weight of your hamster to register on a scale, the scale needs to be one designed for items like food or postal items. Based on the average weight of a dwarf hamster, the scale needs to be able to read weights as low as 1 ounce or 20 grams. Scales such as these can be found at kitchen stores or department stores, or even online., Hamsters aren’t know for sitting still for very long periods of time! As such, you’ll need to entice your hamster to stay on the scale long enough to obtain a weight. If you find your hamster won’t stay on her own, you can try the following tricks to weigh her:Place a very small box or container on top of the scale. This box needs to be big enough to hold your hamster, but small enough to fit on the scale.
Place a couple of treats or seeds inside the box or container.
Reset the scale to zero so the weight of the box and treats aren’t included in the measurement.
Place your hamster inside the box or container and hold your hand over top to discourage her from escaping.
Take note of the weight.

, Once you know what your hamster weights, write it down in a chart. From this point forward weigh your hamster on a regular basis — once a month, or once every few months. Each time you weigh your hamster, write it down in the chart. And, each time you weigh your hamster, compare his actual weight to the average adult weights for that hamster breed.Baby hamsters will obviously weigh quite a bit less than adult hamsters, so you won’t need to compare your hamster’s weight to the adult average until he's at least 12 weeks old.
If your hamster weights significantly more than the average adult weight for that hamster species, your hamster could be obese.

, Comparing your hamster’s weight to the average adult weight of that species of hamster is one way to determine if your hamster is overweight, but it’s not the only way. If you hamster has a higher than average weight, but she's active, energetic, bright-eyed, and eating properly, she may not be obese, just higher than average.If you hamster is showing signs of illness, in addition to being over the average weight for her species, there’s a significant chance your hamster is obese.
Look for general signs of illness like dull eyes and fur, laziness and excessive sleep, and a serious lack of energy and activity.
Feel for the amount of fat that covers your hamster's bones. OK, hamsters are tiny, but you should be able to get an appreciation of where her ribs are and her backbone. If you can't and there is padding between your fingertips and the spine, then the hamster is likely to be obese.

, If you find that your hamster has an above average weight, and he’s gotten a little lazy, it may be time to put him on a healthier diet with more time for exercise. Allowing your hamster to stay overweight for too long is very unhealthy and can lead to more serious problems, such as: a reduced lifespan, type 2 diabetes, heat intolerance, skin issues, heat and other circulatory system problems.A hamster diet simply means you need to follow a regular schedule and only provide your hamster with the proper amounts of food every day. You should also give your hamster the opportunity to do a variety of activities every day.
The combination of both a healthy diet and regular exercise should get your hamster back to an average weight. If, however, your hamster has been overweight for a long time, or he is showing other signs of illness, you should take him to your veterinarian to be examined.
If you have concerns about your hamster’s diet, take him to your veterinarian and get help on what and how much to feed your hamster in order to help him lose weight."
"
Ensure your hamster always has access to water.,
Feed your hamster healthy food in the proper amounts.,
Cut up some fruits and vegetables for your hamster.,
Give your hamster healthy treats.,
Have a salt lick in your hamster’s cage.,
Pay attention to the amount of food your hamster hoards.,
Provide your hamster with in-cage exercise.,
Allow your hamster out of her cage for exercise.",How to Tell if a Dwarf Hamster Is Obese2," Hamsters, just like most pets, need access to a source of fresh water 24 hours a day. Because hamsters spend the majority of their time inside their cages, the best source of water is via a water bottle that hangs on the side of the cage.While the water bottle may hold enough water to last more than one day, it is best to refill your hamster’s water bottle every day.While a hamster can drink out of a water bowl, they aren’t recommended. Not only can bowls tip easily (which means you have to clean the cage more often) but it’s easy for your hamster to get her poop or bedding in the water.
An average, inexpensive water bottle will most likely be made of plastic. But because hamsters like to chew things, plastic water bottles (and plastic food dishes, and plastic anything) will likely get chewed and damaged over time and need replacing. Instead, you might want to consider buying a water bottle made of glass and/or metal so it won’t need to be replaced later.

, In general, you should look for store-bought hamster food that contains 12 – 15% protein and 3 – 6% fat. If you hamster is already obese, you’ll want to look for a food with a lower fat content. All hamster food should have this information printed on the package, most likely on one of the sides. Hamsters also need their food to be high in carbohydrates because they need a lot of energy to be so active. Other things to consider when buying hamster food are:Always make sure the food hasn’t expired by checking the expiry date. Select the bag with the expiry date that is furthest away.
If you have store-bought hamster food at home for more than three months, throw it out and buy new food.
Dwarf hamsters only need to be fed 1 – 2 tablespoons of hamster food per day. You can give this amount all at once, once a day, or break up the amount and feed your hamster twice a day.
Always store your hamster’s food in a cool, dry place. You can even put it inside an airtight container and store it in the fridge.
A hamster’s daily food intake should consist of at least 50% store-bought hamster food.
It’s okay to feed your hamster both store-bought seed mixes and pellets at the same time. In fact, your hamster may appreciate the variety.
Seed mixes usually contain a variety of different seeds, grasses, grains, dried fruits, and vegetables. Some hamsters may pick and choose which items they eat and which they leave behind — and they’re more likely to eat the high-fat items first. You can always sort out the seed mix and remove the high fat seeds (e.g. sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc.) and only provide them as a treat once in a while.

, Hamsters can be fed all sorts of different fruits and vegetables, but each individual hamster may have her favourites. You can add approximately 1 square inch worth of fruits and veggies to your hamster's diet every day. If you feed your hamster too many fruits or vegetables, he may get diarrhea. It’s also a good idea to remove any leftover fruits and veggies from your hamster’s cage within 30 minutes. Hamsters can’t always tell if fruit or veggies have gone bad, and can get sick from eating spoiled produce.The following fruits and vegetables are safe to feed your hamster: celery, carrots, apples, broccoli, plums, figs, peas, strawberries, melons, beets, cauliflower, grapes, plantains, soy sprouts, pumpkin, sweet potato, rose hips, cucumber, zucchini, dandelions, clover, mint, timothy hay, herbal hay, stinging nettles, chamomile, apples, pears, hazelnuts, and bananas.
You can also give a hamster the twigs from apple, pear, hazelnut and beech trees to chew on, although make sure they’re from trees that aren’t sprayed with pesticides.
The following fruits and vegetables should be avoided, as they may make your hamster ill: cabbage, onions, leeks, spinach, sorrel, rhubarb, raw potatoes, corn, alfalfa, citrus fruit, peaches, apricots, nectarines, pineapple, raspberries, twigs from evergreen trees, horse chestnuts, ivy, acorns, and any type of house plant.

, Every hamster will have treats that she prefers over others. In addition to fruits and vegetables you can also try giving your hamster a small amount of the following carbohydrates: whole wheat bread, cooked pasta or rice, sugar free cereals, cooked potatoes, barley, wheat, oats, and even dog biscuits on occasion for a special treat. You might even find that your hamster likes the following sources of protein: cooked eggs, cottage cheese, live mealworms, insect larvae, grasshoppers, crickets, and small bits of cooked chicken, beef, or fish..Be careful when feeding your hamster the carbohydrates listed above, especially if you want your hamster to lose weight. Most store-bought food should have enough carbohydrates to balance your hamster’s diet, so only give these as a special treat.
Most store-bought food will have enough protein that you won’t need to provide any extra. But if you want to give your hamster one of the proteins listed above, do so only as a special treat.

, Hamsters, like a lot of wild animals, need to ingest salt on a regular basis in order to retain the water they drink and stay healthy. Small salt licks are available that can be placed inside your hamster’s cage, sometimes they’ll even come in the form of a toy. Your hamster will only consume the amount of salt he needs., Hamsters are like squirrels: they hide their food and save it for later. Some foods — like seed mixes — make it easier for your hamster to hoard food because they already come in a small, storable size. The key is to make sure you stick to feeding your hamster ONLY her daily amount of food. It may look like she’s hungry because her food bowl is empty, but in reality she may simply have hidden her food elsewhere in her cage., The most common form of exercise for a hamster inside his cage is a hamster wheel. These wheels attach to the side of the cage and are open on one side. The hamster is able to climb inside and run, like he's on a treadmill. In general, exercise wheels that do not have gaps between the rungs are best. Wheels with gaps can injure your hamster very easily, as his foot can get caught in the gap.If your hamster’s cage is in someone’s bedroom, you may want to investigate which exercise wheel is the quietest. Hamsters will normally use their wheels at night, when you’re trying to sleep, so the quieter the better.

, Hamsters love exercise. While they’re awake they should be constantly on the move. In the wild, hamsters can run over a mile every day in search of food!To give her a little variety over the exercise she can receive inside her cage, make her a play area outside of her cage as well. If you have no other pets (or the other pets don’t harm or stress your hamster) you can just let her out of the cage to run around. Or, if you prefer something a little more secure, you can build her a small play area enclosure.Get creative — build a hamster play area using old boxes, cardboard tubes (toilet paper tubes, paper towel tubes, etc.), ramps, and more. Then hide treats in and around the play area for your hamster to find. Use these items to create a maze for your hamster with treats at the end.
One great way to give your hamster exercise is to let her climb the stairs. Because a dwarf hamster is so small, it’ll probably need to be stairs that are covered in carpet.
The quintessential hamster exercise machine is the hamster exercise ball. It’s basically a large plastic ball (maybe the size of a volleyball) that has a door and lots of air vents. You can put your hamster inside, through the door, and then put the ball on the ground. Your hamster will run around inside like she would on their exercise wheel, but the ball will move from place to place so she can explore. While it may look funny, don’t let your hamster go down the stairs in an exercise ball or allow her anywhere near standing water, like a pool.

Flip your hamster over carefully.,
Locate the genitals.,
Check the distance between the two openings.,
Check for nipples.,
Look for testicles.,
Consider size.,
Do not attempt to determine sex before 3 or 4 weeks.,
Do not flip a hamster over it if resists.,
Separate dwarf hamsters around 4 weeks old.",How to Determine the Sex of a Dwarf Hamster," You want to pick your hamster up gently and then turn it on its back. Hamsters, especially young hamster, may resist this process. Go slowly and be gentle.Cup your hand and allow your hamster to get into your hand. Once your hamster is seated on the palm of your hand, gently flip it over.
You can clasp your hand gently around the hamster's body and slowly flip it backwards. Without squeezing, hold your hamster securely. Hamsters do not like being flipped over and will likely kick and resist.;
, A hamster's genitals are located near its tail. You may have to gently spread apart your hamster's legs to get a clear look. Hamster's have two holes near their tail, one for the anus and another for the genitals.You may also have to part the fur in order to get a look at your hamster's genitals.
If your hamster is squirming, you may need a friend to assist.

, Genitalia can be differentiated by the distance between the two holes. With male hamsters, there will be a clear distance between the anal and genital opening. With female hamsters, the two openings will be side-by-side. They may be so close they appear to be touching., It is not always possible to view a hamster's genitals. If you have your hamster flipped over, thick fur or excessive kicking can prevent you from noticing the genitals. If this is the case, look for nipples. Nipples are usually an indication your hamster is female.Run your finger gently along the underside of your hamster.
If you have a female, you should feel two rows of nipples on the stomach. You can part the hair to see down to your hamster's skin to confirm the presence of nipples.
If you do not find nipples, your hamster may be male. However, young female hamsters may also have less pronounced nipples that are harder to detect.

, If your hamster will not allow you to flip it over, observe the hamster as it's moving around. If your hamster is male, testicles may be overtly visible at times.In an older male hamster, testicles will give the rear end a pronounced and pointed appearance. There will also be noticeable swelling near the penile area by the tail.
The rear of a female hamster lacks bulges. It's much smoother in appearance.
Testicles may be more difficult to locate in younger hamsters.

, As your hamster grows, sex will be easier to determine. Male hamsters are both longer and wider than female hamsters. If your hamster is noticeably bigger than other hamsters in the cage, you may have a male., You will not be able to tell sex before this age. If your hamster has a litter, wait until the babies are 3 or 4 weeks old to determine sex. Their genitals will not be fully formed before this age, and trying to determine sex before this will only stress them out., The best way to determine a hamster's sex is to examine its genitals. However, not all hamsters will allow you to flip them over. If a hamster is squirming, biting, or resisting excessively, do not attempt to flip it over. Find other ways to examine the genitals.Try putting your hamster on a glass surface and looking at its genitals through this surface. You could, for example, place your hamster on a glass table or in a glass ball.
If you drop your hamster, you can injure it. While sex determination is important, it's not worth risking the health of your hamster.

, If you want to prevent breeding, you should separate hamsters by sex when they reach 4 weeks old. Have two separate cages ready for the female and male hamsters.Mothers and daughters can safely be paired together.

Get new toys for the new hamsters.",How to Deal with Baby Hamsters," This will help to establish contact with a vet should an emergency arise with the hamster birth. You can consult about the pregnancy and options for the pups once they're born. Many vets will have experience with dealing with hamster births, but you'll want to establish the relationship before the birth so you know what experience your vet has., When you know your hamster is pregnant (she will probably be more aggressive), clean her cage so that when the babies come, they have a clean cage. Also, when the babies are first born, you cannot touch the nest, so you will not be able to clean it then. Make sure to do the following to make the mother calm before and after birth:Remove the wheel and toys. if the mother hamster uses the wheel around the babies she will injure them.
Remove the father from the cage. If you don't, the mother hamster may become pregnant again.
Give the mother lots of soft bedding and food. She will want to build a nest and be protective. She will also need food to recover and also feed her babies.

, This includes disturbing the cage to clean it. For a day or so leading up to the birth, you should leave the mother hamster alone. She will be stressed and protective. She will probably bite you if you try to pick her up.You can tell the birth is imminent when the mother gets restless and becomes more active. She may also have vaginal bleeding during this time., Check the cage three times a day to make sure there is enough food.To avoid disturbing the mother or babies, quietly place food away from the nest of the mother.This will mostly be the normal food the hamster already eats (mixed grains and fresh vegetables), but eggs are especially good for pregnant hamsters., The mother hamster will be less protective so the cage can be cleaned.You'll want to watch the mother hamster's reactions to your cleaning, and if she puts up a fuss at this stage, you may want to wait another few days., Handling babies at this young age will help them get used to being picked up, but be careful as they are fast. This is especially necessary if you intend to re-home them. Be gentle with them, as they are still very small at this point., To check the hamsters' sexes for Syrian hamsters, you simply check to see if they have testicles (as Syrian hamsters' testicles are rather large). For dwarf hamsters, you need to judge the distance between the anus and the sex organ hole. For female dwarf hamsters, the distance is much shorter.Keep the following breed-specific tips in mind when separating the hamsters.At five weeks old, Syrian hamsters should each be put in their own separate cages.
Dwarf hamsters can live in gender groups. If there are fights as they grow up, separate them.

, There might be a fee to surrender your pet, but it can help smooth the process, and you know the hamsters will be in good hands. You should wait until the baby hamsters are at least 4 weeks old before surrendering them.

, Make sure you include photos, and tag any people you think would be interested in adopting one of your hamsters. For best results, make sure you post about it when Facebook or Twitter have higher traffic. You wouldn't want to post about your hamsters at 4am. By the time most people get up, the post will likely be buried under tons of other posts about babies, pets, and recent news., You do this online or through your local newspaper. For some sites, it will be free, but for others you may have to pay a small fee. To find a good home for your hamsters, be descriptive in your ad and include pictures. People will likely be more interested with pictures., To do this, ask them questions about their ability to care for the pet. Do they seem to know about hamster care? Do they want the hamster as a pet, or do they intend to breed them? Do they have the necessary supplies (cage, food, toys, etc.)? You need to consider their ability, willingness, and knowledge to ascertain whether they will provide a good home for the baby hamsters., At five weeks old, your baby hamsters have grown up into adult hamsters. Play with, feed, and love them as you would any adult hamster.Hamster food is not too expensive (around $.50/lb), but remember you'll be increasing the amount of food substantially. You may be able to save by buying in bulk.Remember that keeping just one hamster can be time-consuming. Now imagine multiplying that by 6 or more hamsters. If you have a large family, most of whom are interested in the hamsters, you may find it perfectly feasible to keep all the new hamsters. However, if you're single or very busy, and struggle to take care of just the one hamster, this might not be the best option for you., You'll need all the normal accessories, including a hiding place, a water bowl, etc. Don't forget bedding materials. You'll want your new hamsters to have the same quality of life as their mother. The typical hamster litter is 4 to 6 pups.Depending on the type of hamster, this means you could need anywhere from 2 to 6 new cages. Syrian hamsters require separate cages (they can't be caged together). Dwarf hamsters can be caged in gender groups (you may need more cages if members of a particular gender group don't get along.As spaying or neutering is only recommended in the case of a health issue with the hamster, separation by gender is the far easier and cost-effective measure for keeping hamsters from reproducing.As a hamster cage can cost anywhere from $15 to hundreds of dollars, this can be a costly enterprise. Plan on spending at least $30 to $90 on cages alone for the new pups.Hamster bedding can cost around $5/cubic foot.The amount you need will vary widely based on how many hamsters are housed together and how large the cage is, but the costs can add up quick., Again you'll want to include new toys for the new hamsters. This could include tunnels, a running wheel, and chew toys. Don't forget to get toys for each new baby hamster. Hamsters need stimulation to be happy.You can get a hamster wheel for $5 to $10, and a hamster chew toy can cost around $1-2 each. This means anywhere from $12 to $66 dollars just for the basic hamster toys."

Separate the pups.",How to Care for Your Pregnant Hamster," Besides having kept the hamster in with a male hamster, the following signs may be present:


The hamster may become irritable and fight with other hamsters in the same cage or nearby
The hamster becomes more reclusive, shy and retreats easily; she may behave in a nervous or jumpy manner
The hamster gets defensive; she may growl when picked up, moved or has her cage cleaned
The hamster becomes more lethargic and slows down considerably
The hamster might drink more than usual and hoard her food;
, She may turn this material into a nest for having her babies. If so, this is an indication that she is due soon.


Food may be taken to the nest.
If another hamster is present, the pregnant hamster will behave defensively about the nest and guard it.

, This is the shortest pregnancy period of any mammal. If you have any concerns about the hamster's well being, or you don't want the pregnancy to continue, see your vet immediately.

, The hamster should be given extra protein and food filled with extra vitamins (vitamins are found readily in fresh produce).


Good sources of protein include cooked egg, bread soaked in milk, boiled bone-free chicken pieces, etc.
Plain oatmeal is much liked by many hamsters.

,, This will reduce stress levels for her and she won't need to behave defensively, which may result her eating the babies.

, It should be warm but not too hot. Normal room temperature is good, provided you don't like it too cold!

, Tissue paper, plain unprinted paper, toilet paper are good nesting material items.


Do not use paper with ink on it, as this may be toxic to her and the babies.

, This will ensure that harmful bacteria do not build up.

, This will give her enough light but allows her to feel safe by not being exposed under a glare. You could also cover one side with a blanket.

, If you do, this might interfere with the birthing when the time comes.

, She needs to stay fit during pregnancy and not get overweight. Having constant access to an exercise wheel will allow for her to stay active, keep her weight in check and contribute to the healthy birth of her litter.

, If she appears sick, see the vet quickly.

, When she is ready for giving birth, the pregnant hamster will often curl up in her nesting corner in her house or cage. Leave her be, as she needs plenty of peace for the birthing effort ahead. Ensure she has access to food and water as usual.


Expect the hamster's nipples and belly to grow a lot just prior to the birth.

, This behavior is natural and is done so the litter as a whole stays healthy.


Never place dad in with the pups. He will attack and eat the babies.

, The mother will continue to touch up the bedding to ensure the comfort of the babies.

, The new mother is excitable, nervous and easily disturbed. She will stuff her pups into her cheek pouches if she is worried about their safety. Keep curious children and pets away from the house and don't poke your hand in or touch the pups for the first week.

, However, do not touch them for the first seven days, or when their eyes open; if you do, your scent mark may cause the mother to kill and eat the baby. You may feel safer not touching them at all until they are weaned (about 3 weeks old).

, Baby hamsters are not tame and need taming before they can make suitable pets. Some of them will bite at first and attempt to get away from you; you will need to persevere to get them used to human handling. To tame a pup:


Wait until its eyes have opened (about 14 days after birth).
Rub your hands in the sawdust it lives in. This will disguise some of your human scent.
Sit on the floor or somewhere that the pup won't be harmed if it jumps out of your hand.
Scoop up a pup with care, placing it on the palm of your hand to hold carefully and using your other hand to cover and prevent it from falling. Remember that pups are very delicate!
Hold each pup briefly. Expect some to bite or resist you; this is a natural reaction, so don't give up or drop the pup. Be gentle and stay very calm. Most will respond well to calmness.

, Suitable choices include milk-soaked bread, hard boiled egg pieces, finely diced ham mixed with finely diced cucumber and milk-soaked bread. Keep all food given in small amounts. Remove uneaten food within 24 hours.


Place water bottles low enough for pups to reach. If using a dish, keep it shallow to avoid drowning.

, Remove the male pups after four weeks. At this time they are matured enough to start mating and you don't want this happening. They can now be rehoused or given to a trusted new owner. Separate all the pups (and mom) after 6 weeks. At this stage, all of the babies definitely need their own homes. This means separating all siblings from each other and the pups from their mom.


Be aware that is is possible for hamsters to become pregnant from around 8 weeks. This is not healthy as the hamster will be too young to have a safe pregnancy; as such, it is really important to separate males and females at around the 3 to 4 week stage. Most breeders recommend 4 weeks as the male/female separation time.

Care for your hamsters as you would any other adult hamster.",How to Care for Hamster Babies," Though your female hamster will gain weight once she is pregnant, weight gain alone does not indicate pregnancy. Other indications of pregnancy include nest-building, possible hoarding of food, and signs of aggression as her gestation period progresses., Hamsters reach sexual maturity quickly in life, with some hamsters capable of breeding as early as four weeks old.However, it is generally recommended that breeders refrain from pairing hamsters for mating until five to six months of age.The gestation period for hamsters varies widely by breed. Syrian hamsters typically gestate for 16 days, while many dwarf breeds gestate for 18-21 days.Roborovski hamsters may gestate for up to 30 days.Females capable of reproduction will want to mate every four days.A couple days before your hamster is going to give birth, her stomach will swell to a very large size. However, this may also be an indication of a more serious condition. Swollen abdomens may indicate the presence of a tumor, impending heart failure, liver cysts, or in rare cases Cushing's Disease.If your hamster's belly is swollen, it's best to have her examined by a veterinarian to determine whether it's pregnancy weight or something more serious.

, It's important that your hamster delivers her babies into a clean environment. In order to ensure that this happens, clean your hamster cage two weeks after your hamster gets pregnant (or when you determine that your hamster is pregnant), and add additional fresh bedding.Know that, since the mother hamster will not like being disturbed as it gets closer to her delivery date, you may not be able to clean the cage later in her gestation period. Cleaning the cage within 2 - 3 days of her ""due date"" can unsettle a female hamster sufficiently that she rejects the babies when they are born. Cleaning the cage as soon as possible after determining that she is pregnant may be your best option.
After cleaning the cage during the gestation period, do not clean the cage again until 14 days after the birth., Pregnant hamsters need a diet high in protein and fat. Aim for a hamster food that contains 18 to 20 percent protein and seven to nine percent fat.You may also want to provide your mother hamster with milky food to provide additional calcium and promote lactation.Offer your pregnant hamster nutritious treats like carrots, nuts, hard boiled eggs, cheese and greens. You should also put extra food in her cage, as she will begin stockpiling the food for her babies (and will be eating more than normal herself). However take care with foods that will go bad, since if she stock piles them the food may go mouldy in her store. It is best to give plenty of dry food, and offer perishable items as treats, in order to increase the chances of her eating it all, rather than storing it., This is important in order to prevent the accidental injury or death of baby hamsters once they are born., Female hamsters may act aggressively toward males when they do not desire a mate.Some hamster enthusiasts claim that Dwarf hamster fathers are actually very helpful in raising the litter. Consult with a vet or pet store hamster specialist if you are considering leaving your hamster dad in the cage.

, One of your hamster’s first reactions when she gets pregnant will be to build a soft nest to give birth to her babies in. You can help this process along by providing pieces of toilet paper for your hamster to shred up and use in her nest.


Clean facial tissue or toilet paper works best for nest building. It is soft to the touch and very absorbent, and your hamster will be able to tear and arrange it easily.
Avoid any long or heavy materials that the baby hamsters may become tangled or smothered in.

, You only need to do this if you aren't planning on keeping the babies after they are born. If you are having a hard time finding friends who want to take a baby or two, try posting an ad on Craigslist. You can also check with teachers at local schools, as hamsters make excellent classroom pets.


Never breed hamsters unless you want baby hamsters and ready to take care of them. Find them a home or provide for them in your own home.

, The birthing process usually happens over the course of one to two hours, in about 15-30 minute intervals between pup births. Give her space and do not disturb her during or after the birth., For approximately two days or so leading up to the birth, you should leave the mother hamster alone. She will be stressed and may become aggressive in order to protect the nest from perceived threats or intrusions, so its best to leave her alone.She can also become highly agitated after she gives birth--she should be disturbed as little as possible or else she might abandon her babies, or even, in some cases, kill them., You want to avoid disturbing the nest and leaving your scent on the infant hamsters, or their mother might abandon or kill them.The mother hamster may also become very aggressive if you try to handle her offspring and may attack your hand.


If you do need to move a baby for some reason, use a spoon. This will ensure that you do not get your scent on the baby. You will most likely not have to do this--even if you see that a baby has strayed from the nest, mama hamster will soon go to retrieve it.

, While it may seem odd not to clean your hamster cage, it really is in the babies' best interest that you don’t interfere in the nesting space. Forgo cleaning the cage for two weeks after the babies are born.If you notice that there is a really wet spot in the cage, you can spot clean it but make absolutely sure that your spot cleaning won’t disturb the nest.
Keep the room temperature around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, or 21.1 degrees Celsius., You should check the cage at least twice a day to make sure that there is enough food and water to support your hamsters. When the babies are a week old, you can begin to scatter food along the sides and floor of the cage. The mother hamster will go out and collect the food for her babes, but the little ones will also begin to explore and get food on their own.Be sure that you are feeding the mother and baby hamsters a diet high in protein and fat content.Avoid using a water bowl, as young hamsters may drown if they fall into the bowl. Use a shallow dish instead.
You will want to make sure that the sipper bottle is low enough that the young hamsters can reach the lip of it and get a drink, which will typically happen after the first 10-20 days.

, Sometimes, baby hamsters are orphaned due to complications during the birth. If the hamsters are 12 to 14 days old, they will have a much easier time surviving. Place a heating pad on the lowest setting under the cage to make up for the lack of body heat in their mother's absence. Shred up toilet paper and create a nest for the babies yourself. Make sure the babies have adequate food to keep their nutrient levels up. The water bottle should also be lowered to their height.


When hamsters are born, they emerge hairless and blind. Do not be alarmed by this, as this is how all hamsters look at birth.Over the course of the first week, hamster babies will gain weight, begin growing fur, and their ear canals will develop. They will also begin to crawl and forage by the middle of the second week.Use Lactol, an animal milk replacement, to nurse the hamster pups with a dropper. Lactol is available in most pet stores. If you cannot find Lactol, try using powdered baby formula.Squeeze out a small drop and touch it to a baby hamster's mouth. Do not squeeze the dropper; rather, let the infant hamster suckle and lick the milk out.
Remember that infant hamsters cannot regulate their own body temperature. Keep the room at 70 degrees Fahrenheit, or 21.1 degrees Celsius, or use a heating pad on a low setting if necessary., Wipe all of the residue from the nest/birthing process off the hamsters, so that the new mother will not recognize them as belonging to another litter due to the scent.For this reason, you may want to wear rubber gloves during this process.


Gently wrap the baby hamsters in a clean terry cloth towel and rub the towel gently to stimulate circulation (and thus warmth.) Find a surrogate mother who has babies that are a couple days older or younger than your babies. Place nesting material taken from the surrogate mom’s nest and wrap it around your babies. The goal is to get the smelling exactly like the surrogate mom’s babies. Distract the new mother with a treat and then place the babies in the nest with the other hamsters. Keep the mom away for as long as possible to give the babies a chance to wriggle into the nest and get covered in the smell.Keep a close eye on the surrogate mother. If she senses that there is something wrong or different about the babies, she may kill them.
It may be difficult to find a lactating female hamster in your time of need. Be prepared for the possibility that you may have to raise the young hamsters by hand. you can feed the baby hamsters with lactose, which helps the baby grow.

, At this point, the mother hamster will be a bit less protective, allowing you to go in and clean up after the last two weeks. Clean the cage as you normally would, but place a few pieces of toilet paper in the cage after you are done, as the mother hamster may want to build another nest.

, Handling babies at this young age will help them get used to human touch. The mother hamster will also be fine with them smelling like you at this stage in the babies development. Keep in mind that baby hamsters can move very quickly, so take precautions when handling them.

, Baby hamsters will continue feeding from their mom until they are about 26 days old. After that, the babies should be weaned from their mom.

, You will need to check the genders of your baby hamsters and split the boy and girl hamsters up into their own separate cages. They should be put into cages separate from their mother, who will have lost interest in nursing them by this time.Around 40 days after birth, the litter of hamsters will be capable of mating and reproducing. It is important to separate them before this happens.Syrian hamsters are solitary animals and should each be put in their own separate cages after around six to seven weeks.This breed of hamster tends to be very territorial and will become aggressive if it feels that its space is being threatened.
Dwarf hamsters can live in same-sex pairings and colonies fairly peacefully. Dwarf hamsters will often play together, beginning around the time their eyes open. This is normal, but after approximately 12 weeks you might begin to notice some actual fights occurring. If you see this, you should split the pair into separate cages. If it is occurring in a colony, you should put the hamster that is being bullied into his or her own separate cage.Beware that if you don't separate them, they may start to breed with each other, leaving you overrun with lots of inbred pups within a few weeks.

, At five weeks old, your baby hamsters have grown up into adult hamsters. Play with, feed, and love them as you would any adult hamster.

Make the mother feel secure.,
Add tissue or toilet paper.,
Minimize interaction for two weeks.",How to Handle Unexpected Baby Hamsters1," Immediately following birth, mother hamsters need to feel secure. If she is startled by a loud noise or sudden light, she may become stressed and go into survival mode. For a mother hamster, this means cannibalizing her young. Accordingly, do everything you can to ensure calm and quiet atmosphere in the room where they live.Keep other pets out of the room.
Put the hamster enclosure against a wall and out of direct sunlight.
Cover part of the enclosure with a blanket or cloth. The darkness this blanket provides will reduce stress.;
, Throw some unscented tissue paper or toilet paper into the enclosure. Be sure not to surprise the mother hamster when doing so. She will shred up the paper and use it to increase the comfort and coziness of her nest. This is more important than you may realize. If the mother doesn’t feel like the environment is sufficient to raise pups, she’ll eat them.Do not provide the artificial fluff sold for this purpose. Despite the marketing, these products can potentially injure your hamsters.

, If a mother hamster feels threatened by an unfamiliar scent, she will readily make a snack of her offspring. While it may seem as though there are a lot of reasons a mother hamster might go cannibalistic, they are all informed by the same sentiment. From a survival perspective, a protein rich diet of baby hamster flesh may give her the energy to escape whichever risk she has perceived. Accordingly, do not mess with her, her babies, or her cage for two weeks following the birth.In particular, do not clean the cage. If you notice she is pregnant just before she gives birth, give the cage a good cleaning in preparation.
Though it can be challenging, resist the temptation to handle the baby hamsters for two weeks. Touching all but guarantees that they’ll be eaten by their mother.

"
"
Feed the mother well.,
Help feed the babies after a week.,
Introduce yourself when they’re two weeks old.,
Separate the babies when they’re 5 to 6 weeks old.",How to Handle Unexpected Baby Hamsters2," Good nutrition is especially important for the mother following birth. You can probably guess why. Great protein options include finely chopped cooked eggs, plain boiled chicken, and tofu. Also feed her extra well chopped fruits and veggies, especially carrots and leafy greens. Wait to provide these foods until a few days after birth, unless she is low on food.Take care not to spook her when adding food to her enclosure, and try to slowly place the food away from her and her babies.
If you notice she is pregnant before she gives birth, stock the enclosure with a bunch of food that won’t go bad too quickly. This will include lots of hamster food as well as sunflower seeds.
While you usually want to limit sunflower seed consumption, their fattiness is actually ideal for a mother hamster. Also fill up the water bottle all the way so you can avoid doing so for as long as possible once the babies arrive.

, Do practically nothing for a week. After 7 or 8 days, the pups will first begin to move around their enclosure. At this point, they’ll also be able to nibble on solid food. Sprinkle well-chopped pieces of carrots, tofu, and leafy greens into their enclosure. They will enjoy discovering this food, and will also begin to eat from their mother’s dish.At about 3 weeks of age, the babies will be weaned by their mother. This does not mean they should be taken from the enclosure, though they will no longer be nursing.

, You can begin to handle baby hamsters when they open their eyes, at around 13 to 14 days old. Once all of the babies’ eyes are open, do a full cleaning of the cage as well. Don’t separate them permanently from their mother quite yet, as they still have plenty to learn., This is the age that the hamsters will reach sexual maturity. You may keep young dwarf hamsters of the same sex together. All Syrian hamsters must be kept separately from one another. When they’re 6 to 8 weeks old, Syrian hamsters will begin to become territorial. They will soon be able to seriously injure one another, and will do so as soon as they are able."

Try to line up human owners early.,
Put them up for adoption.,
Do not drop your baby hamsters off at a pet store.",How to Handle Unexpected Baby Hamsters3," Your litter may contain more than a dozen juvenile hamsters in search of a new home. It will likely prove challenging to find humans capable of housing each one, so start searching as soon as you find out about the babies. Ask your friends and family if they’re interested, and post the cutest photos you can get on every single social media platform you use., Websites such as adoptapet.com and craigslist.org are good spots to put a post about free baby hamsters. Petfinder.com also has a classified section that is quite popular. Do not try to profit from your hamsters – they are readily available.At the same time, try to keep reptile owners from getting their hands on your hamsters. You can guess what they’ll do with them. Accordingly, charge a small “adoption” fee, such as $5. This is much cheaper than buying a hamster from a store, but will keep those who favor scaled creatures giving their own pets a free living lunch.

, They don’t need them, and they don’t want them. They likely even have policies against accepting hamsters from unknown sources. This means that they won’t care for any hamsters that show up outside their door, thought they may feed them to the scaled animals they’re selling.Try to avoid leaving hamsters at shelters as well. If you do, include a donation, as many shelters are not well-enough funded to care for hamsters.

Some options include:


Keeping them as pets
Selling them as pets (though it's not likely to bring in much income)
Giving them away to good homes;
, You might think ""I'll just give them away to good homes,"" but that's likely going to be harder than it sounds. Think hard about your market before breeding, or you'll have more hamsters than you have customers.


How will you advertise your hamsters? Good places to start include online, in the newspaper, and at the pet store.

, If you already own some hamsters from the same family, you don’t want to breed them together. When you allow brothers to mate with sisters, or fathers/daughters or mothers/sons, you create an inbred line of hamsters. Inbred lines can suffer from genetic flaws. For healthy hamsters, avoid inbreeding at all costs.

, If your current hamsters are related or if you don't yet have any, talk to several hamster breeders about where they get their stock. You only need one male and one female to get started. However, buy them from different suppliers to ensure the two breeding animals are not closely related. It is almost always a poor idea to buy breeding hamsters from chain pet stores. Pet stores treat their hamsters quite poorly and many get their hamsters from dirty, cramped, locations. Their baby hamsters, if chosen from a commercial pet store, is likely to suffer from mental and physical and fatal deformities, will almost always have poor temperament, and have a very ugly coloring.


You might also contact a hamster breeder directly., Hamsters can start breeding as early as two months of age. However, it's best to let them grow to 4-6 months before breeding them. This improves the chances of a healthy litter.

, This means cages of a good size that are at the very least 450 sq. inches or larger. Since many commercial cages are too small, you may have to do a small DIY. You only want them to breed when you plan for it, so buy each its own hamster cage. Keep them separate unless you are actively trying to breed them. Keep the cages in the same room, but not close together. In each one, place:


A food bowl with high-quality food. The best hamster food by far is the Harry/Hazel Hamster mix.
An inverted water bottle
Exercise toys
Anything else you think will make them feel more at home

, This will allow your male and female to see and smell each other. Let them introduce themselves, but don’t put them together yet. Another way to let them get to know each other is to put them into separate exercise balls. While you're watching, let them roll around in their pods, smelling each other and interacting safely.

, Once your hamsters are at least four months old, you can introduce them to each other in a third, neutral cage. If the female attacks the male, she is not ready to mate. Get him out of the cage as soon as possible to avoid injury.

, You can't mate your hamsters if the female isn't going to be receptive to the male. She could go into heat every 4-5 days, though, by this age.


Gently stroke the female on the bottom. If her tail goes erect, she's in heat.
That means she's ready to mate with the male.

, Hamsters are territorial animals. If they don't want to mate, they'll likely ending up fighting instead. This could lead to injury, or even death. Check the female every day until she's in heat before placing them together.

, Either gently place her in the male's cage or put both hamsters in a neutral third cage. Don't put the male in the female's cage, though, as she will likely fight him to protect her territory.

, If all goes well, the female's tail should go erect, and the male should mount her more than once. This may last for around 30 minutes, and the male will likely clean himself between attempts.Be watchful for fights, even if the female seems receptive.

, You'll be able to tell when they're done because they will seem suddenly disinterested in each other. When this happens, move the female back into her cage.

, An important part of breeding hamsters is keeping good records, so you know what to expect. Either mark mating dates on a calendar or write them down in a notebook.


Hamsters hibernate when the temperature dips below 50°F (10°C). They will not breed at that temperature., Sometimes, a hamster's behavior changes noticeably when she gets pregnant. Note if she's being strangely quiet, cleaning herself more, or eating and drinking more than usual. Another common sign is an instinct to gather up large nests. If you see these telltale behavior changes, she is likely pregnant.

, Syrian hamsters usually grow and carry their babies for 15-18 days before giving birth. Look up the date on which you last mated your hamsters and add 15 days to it. That is the earliest likely due date for your new litter.

, You won't be able to tell she's pregnant for sure until just a few days before she gives birth. By ten days after the mating, you should be able to see her belly swelling clearly, just like with human pregnancies.

, A pregnant female will have a natural instinct to build herself a big nest. Give her extra bedding materials like paper towels or bathroom tissues so she can shred them up for her nest.


You might also offer a safe (non toxic, no ink, not sharp) bedding material like Pennine “Curl Up” Hamster bedding., Make sure you've cleaned the cage five days or so before the due date, and that there is extra food and bedding in the cage. Prepare ahead of time so you don't disturb the mother and babies for the first week after birth.

, You want to keep her as calm and relaxed as possible. Keep her environment quiet and soothing — dim or remove bright lights. Keep curious pets like dogs and cats away from her as she gets ready to deliver her babies.


Hamsters usually give birth without problems if you wait until they're old enough to mate (4 months).
The birth will likely happen at night when everything is quiet.
Litters can be as small as 4 or as large as 16 babies., Female hamsters sometimes eat their own babies if they get stressed out. It's very important to keep the environment as calm as possible. Though you might be eager to play with the babies, give the mother space and peace for their safety.


At first, the babies will look pink and hairless. They are born with their eyes closed.

, While you don't want to disturb her, you do still need to make sure she has everything she needs in her cage. For the first week and a half to two weeks or so, discretely refill the mother's food bowl and water bottle.


You don't need to provide the babies with anything at this point. They'll get everything they need from nursing.

, Scatter small portions of broccoli, grated carrot, wheat germ, or tofu in their nest for them to eat.The mother will also store food in her cheek pouches, and bring it back to the nest to feed her babies.

, A week after birth, they'll start to grow fur. You should just be able to tell what colors they are. The pups will also start making little noises at this age. One or two adventurous babies may leave the nest, but don't worry if the mother picks them up in her mouth and puts them back.

, Enough time should have passed by now to let the mother settle into her new role, so you can give the cage a much-needed cleaning. It's also your first opportunity to handle the babies, which is an important step in socializing them to humans. By handling them at two weeks, you make them more comfortable with human interactions.


Get your hands ""dirty"" with the scent of the used litter before touching the babies. This prevents the mother from rejecting or attacking them later.Move the hamsters into another cage one by one.
When cleaning the cage, avoid completely destroying the nest.
Hamsters will usually have a “toilet” area in the cage. Concentrate your cleaning there, and leave the nest more or less intact.
Of course, if the nest is soaked or filthy, go ahead and replace it with fresh materials.

, While cleaning the cage, make a few changes to transition them into adulthood. Add a second food bowl to the cage. The mother's water bottle will be too high for the babies, so place a second one at a lower position. You could also place a raised platform under the mother's bottle so the babies can reach it.


Don't lower the mother's water bottle to the babies' height because then she won't be able to reach it.

, At this age, the babies should have all their fur and be running about independently. Though they were born with closed eyes and ears, they should be starting to open up now.

, This can be a tricky process. Look at the distance between each hamster's anus and genital opening. The distance on a male will be longer than the distance on a female.By four weeks, the males' testicles should also be noticeable, as should the nipples on the females' bellies.

, Hamsters have a lot of loose skin, and you can hold them by the scruff of their necks or by the loose skin down their backs. Don’t drop them, though, and be ready to return them to the cage if you start to lose your grip.

, Not all hamsters mature at the same rate, so you have to make sure you gendered them correctly. For a few days after you separate them into male and female cages, keep checking gender every day. You might notice testicles one day that you didn't see before in a cage of baby “females.” If so, switch the baby to the correct cage.


If you are unsure about the sex of your babies, take them to your vet or an experienced hamster breeder for help. You want to avoid accidental breeding of siblings.

, Place your hand in the cage so they can smell it, and let them climb up into your palm if they want to. You can also scoop them up with a small cup and start gently petting them on the back.


The babies will be ready for their new homes after 35 days of age., Don't wait too long to start looking for people to take your hamsters, because 35 days goes by fast. Keep your customers updated as the hamsters approach 35 days in age, so they can prepare their own homes.

, Make sure you send them off to reliable homes with families that will love them. Provide the new owners with information on hamsters and hamster care. You want the babies to have the best new start you can provide.

, If you keep any of the babies, know that the females are highly territorial. While you can house adult males together as long as there's enough food and space, adult females are terrible roommates. When they reach 2-3 months of age, separate all females into their own cages.

Assess the parents' risk factors.Hamsters reach sexual maturity as young as 6 weeks old, though it is not advisable to let them mate at this age.,
Look for signs of birth.,
Prepare the cage is ready for birth.,
Be sure a nest has been built.",How to Care for Newborn Hamsters1," A female should be at least 8 - 10 weeks old before mating, and males 10 -12 weeks old. Once a hamster reaches 12 months of age, it should no longer be bred, as health risks skyrocket.


The average hamster lifespan is 18 - 24 months.;
, Hamster pregnancies are very short, lasting just 15 - 18 days. When you know your female is expecting, look for the following signs that she's preparing to give birth:


Restlessness
Nest-building behavior
Conscientious grooming
Eating more than usual

, When you see the signs that the mother is close to giving birth, make sure the babies have an adequate cage to be born into. The cage should be cleaned and prepared before birth, but not too close to the mother's due date. It is important not to disturb the mother in the last few days of pregnancy, as it raises the odds of her cannibalizing the babies.


A few days before her due date, put her in a clean cage by herself and leave her undisturbed. If you don't know exactly how far along she is, isolate her when you notice her belly swelling.Remove toys from the cage. The mum might hurt or kill the babies if toys get in the way.
Don't use cotton wool or other materials that could form strands on the cage floor, as they could tangle around the babies. Also avoid straw, as the sharp ends could hurt them. Safer alternatives include aspen, paper flakes, Carefresh, or wood fiber pulp.
Provide the mother with nesting material - something warm she mother can burrow into. Recommended materials include un-dyed tissue paper, toilet paper, or kitchen paper.
From 2 days before the due-date to 10 days after birth, do not change anything in the cage or handle the mother.

, When the mother is almost ready to give birth, she will build a breeding nest. Thus, there is no need for you to add any extra housing or move the babies to a separate location. In fact, disturbing the nest after birth could be disastrous. Hamsters are known for cannibalism, and stressing the mother in any way could endanger the babies. This risk is highest the first week after giving birth, and in first-time mothers."

Prepare the mother for birth.,
Scatter food for the mother to bring the babies.,
Check the cage frequently.,
Avoid touching the babies until they've grown fur.,
Encourage naturally weaning by providing an adequate supply of food.,
Separate baby hamsters from their mother after 21 to 28 days.,
Determine the sex of the babies.,
Make sure there's enough food and water.,
Keep the cage dry.,
Refrain from cleaning the cage early on.",How to Care For a Mother Hamster and Her Babies," If you know the mother is pregnant ahead of time, you can work on preparing her for birth. You can tell a hamster is pregnant if she has gained weight and is engaging in nesting behaviors, such as piling wood shavings and other material in one corner of the cage.Clean her cage and replace all wood shavings or other substrate with clean supplies.You should also remove wheels and toys to prevent injury to the babies.
Place toilet paper somewhere in the cage so the mother can build a nest.
Give the mother slightly extra food than usual.;
, You do not need to worry about feeding newborn hamster babies yourself. The mother hamster will nurse her babies for the first two to three weeks and then she will feed them by bringing them scattered food from around the cage. Scatter pellets and other hamster food throughout the cage and allow the mother to forage for food to feed the babies.As the babies age, you will see they begin to explore the cage and hunt for food themselves.

, Once the babies are born, it's vital to make sure there is enough food and water to go around. The water dish or bottle should be full at all times and there should always be plentiful food scattered on the floor for the mother to bring the babies. Check the cage frequently throughout the day to make sure no supplies have run out.Be quiet when checking the cage. While it's important to keep the hamsters well fed, you want to make sure you don't disturb the mother. Peace and quiet is important for the first few weeks.

, A mother may be protective of her babies and dislike having your smell on them. When the babies are very young and have not grown much fur, refrain from touching them as much as possible.Usually, it's safe to touch the babies after 10 to 14 days. At this point, they have plenty of fur, their eyes are open, and they're eating solid food.

, Weaning usually begins at two to three weeks. The babies will eventually transition naturally to solid food as their mother discourages them from nursing. Providing enough food during this time can help the process run smoothly.Provide pellets for the hamsters, adding bowls for each baby.
Make sure to check the cage frequently during this time to make sure the babies have enough food.

, After three to four weeks, hamsters are generally old enough to be separated from their mother. If babies are left with their mothers for too long, the mother will start becoming aggressive.You should separate the male and female hamsters to prevent inbreeding. In general, hamsters of the same gender should be able to share a cage. However, if fighting occurs frequently, you may have to separate the hamsters.

, You need to make sure you do not pair hamsters of the same sex together. Hamsters reach sexual maturity quickly and you do not want siblings breeding with one another.Carefully pick up the babies and look just under their tails. Hamsters have two distinct openings in this area.
Males have openings that are slightly apart. Females have openings with no space in between.

, It is vital to keep the food and water supply plentiful, especially just after the mother gives birth. If the mother feels resources are scarce, she may kill her babies to spare them from starvation. Be proactive about filling food and water bowls in the cage., A wet cage can be deadly for baby hamsters. If a water bottle leaks or a water bowl spills, clean up the water quickly. Add fresh bedding to the cage promptly and remove any wet or soiled bedding., Unless you need to clean up a water spill, leave the cage alone when the babies are first born. You should not clean the cage until about two weeks have passed or when the babies have opened their eyes."
"
Interfere very little for the first week.,
Understand how the babies will develop.Hamster babies are born incredibly vulnerable — furless, deaf, blind, and with their limbs are only partially developed.,
Let the mother care for her babies.,
Make sure the mother is well-fed.In the first couple weeks, when the babies get all their nutrition from the mother, it's important that the mother is well-fed and healthy.,
Provide food and water for the babies.,
Separate the hamsters by sex at the appropriate age.Syrian hamsters must be segregated by sex at 3-4 weeks, at which age they will begin to fight.",How to Care for Newborn Hamsters2," After the babies are born, continue to refill water bottles and food dishes for a week, but don't disturb the mother and her babies. Keep them as isolated from traffic and noise as possible — keep curious children, loud TV or radio sounds, and nosy dogs or cats out of the room.


Do not handle babies at all for 14 days after birth.
Do not clean the cage for those 2 weeks, either
Keep the room temperature around 70 F.

, However, they grow and develop very quickly. As they grow, keep these approximate landmarks in mind to make sure they're developing at a healthy, normal rate:


5-15 days: eyes and ears should open
7 days: they start to crawl around
7-10 days: they take an interest in solid food
10 days: hair starts to grow
10-20 days: they start to be able to drink from a sipper bottle

, The newborns' best chance of survival is if they have a mother with strong nurturing instincts. You job is to stand back and let her do all the work. If you upset or disturb her, she's more likely to turn on her young, so stay out of her way. With newborn hamsters in the care of a mother, less is definitely more.

, You can choose fresh foods like timothy grass, carrots, and other food, but you can still feed her hamster food.


Pelleted food suitable for rats or mice is preferable to hamster muesli. This is because the hamster can selectively eat the tastier bits of the muesli, leaving behind the less tasty but more nutritious bits.

, At around 7-10 days, the babies will be ready to get food and drink from a source other than the mother. Don't put a water bowl in the cage, as they may drown in it. Instead, place a sipper bottle with the nozzle about 1–2 centimeter (0.4–0.8 in) above the bedding. This is in addition to the mother's normally placed bottle — the babies' bottle will be too low for the mother to reach. The babies will begin snacking on their mother's food when they're ready. Once they start to eat solid food, make sure there's plenty to go around.

, You can leave dwarf hamsters together safely, but you should separate them by sex if you don't want them to mate. This should be done within 48 hours of weaning, which can be done around 21-28 days after birth.


Puberty starts around 2 - 18 days after weaning. Hamsters are ready to reproduce at this time.

Understand the risks.,
Be very careful using a surrogate mother.Though natural hamster milk is the best source of nutrition for developing babies, hamsters are not very well-suited to surrogacy.,
Replace the mother's milk as best as possible.,
Use an eyedropper to feed them.Suck some Lactol up in the eyedropper, then squeeze it so a drip hovers on the end of the pipette.,
Regulate the temperature for them.Hamsters are born furless, so until they're about 10 days old, they cannot regulate their own body temperature.",How to Care for Newborn Hamsters3," Successfully raising orphaned hamsters is almost unheard of. Newborn hamsters are born very poorly developed, and need a precise balance of nutrition. The mother's milk is the best source for their needs, and manmade replacements won't help them grow healthy organs and bones the same way.Don’t be disheartened if the orphans die. Their odds were never good, but at least you gave it a go.

, Even if you have a lactating female without babies of her own, there's a high likelihood that she would cannibalize any strange babies you put in with her. A non-lacting female won't have the milk the babies need.

, The closest you can get to hamster milk is Lactol, which is a milk replacement designed for use with dogs.Hamster pups need strict hourly feeding 24 hours a day until they start to eat solids. Luckily, they usually begin showing interest in solids early, at around 7-10 days. Once they start eating solids, you can reduce their milk feeding to once every three hours.

, Hold the drop against the baby's mouth. Hopefully, it will try to suckle, or at least lick the milk from the tip.


Avoid squirting milk into the hamster pup's mouth. They're so tiny that even a small amount of fluid could flood down into the hamster's lungs and either drown them or cause pneumonia.
This is one of the main reasons orphans are so difficult to rear.

, Keep them at a constant temperature of at least 70 F by either using a heat pad or keeping the room at that temperature.


The babies will be comfortable in temperatures up to 80F. Above this, the youngsters may start to develop heat stress.
When the pups are in the nest, partially cover them with bedding to help keep them warm.

Spend time with your hamster every day.,
Observe your hamster’s eating habits.,
Observe your hamster’s activity.,
Check for diarrhea.",How to Know if Your Hamster Is Dying1," It is important to spend time with your hamster every day so that you know her normal behavior. A change in your hamster's behavior is an important indicator that she is sick. If you don’t spend time with your hamster regularly, you might not recognize important changes in your hamster’s behavior.Get into a routine, so that you spend the same part of the day with your hamster. This will help you get accustomed to how the hamster is acting during the same period of time every day.;
, A healthy hamster will eat regularly throughout the day. Although hamsters will sleep during the day, they will wake up frequently to eat.Be careful to note if your hamster is eating and how much he is eating.
If your hamster is eating less, but still eating, keep very close watch over his eating over the next day or two.
If your hamster stops eating altogether, you should take your hamster to the veterinarian right away.

, Hamsters are normally very active, especially during the night. Your hamster will likely sleep during much of the day, so do not worry if your hamster sleeps a lot when the sun is out. If your hamster appears lethargic all the time and does not want to play, then she might be sick.


If your hamster begins to act much less active and playful than in the past, pay close attention over the next couple of days.
If the hamster’s activity levels do not return to normal, take your hamster to the veterinarian.
Hamsters will naturally hibernate when the temperature stays cold for a long time. If you think your hamster is hibernating, indicated by what appears to be a very deep sleep and extremely shallow breath, warm up the area and make sure there is food and water on hand for when the hamster awakens., A common illness in hamsters is called “wet tail” and is accompanied by diarrhea. It can be evidence of a very serious infection.Check the base of your hamster’s tail for a wet, mucus-like substance.
If your hamster has diarrhea, accompanied by changes to eating and activity levels, it may be wet tail. Wet tail can be fatal within 48 hours. Therefore, you need to take action immediately and see the veterinarian.
If the veterinarian finds a case of wet tail, he might prescribe antibiotics, anti-diarrheal, or give fluids."

Look at the hamster’s skin.,
Look at the hamster’s fur.,
Look at the hamster’s face, mouth and eyes.",How to Know if Your Hamster Is Dying2," Changes to your hamster’s skin can be indicative of health problems. In particular, look for signs of infection, like redness, swelling, and abscesses.


Red, flakey skin can be a sign of an infection or of other skin diseases.
Check for dehydration by lifting the loose skin (the scruff) over the hamster's shoulders. Let go and it should snap straight back into place — this is normal. If the hamster is dehydrated the skin ""tents"" or stays in a peak. This is a serious sign and you should get the hamster checked by a vet.
Your hamster may scratch more when she has a skin problem. This can help tip you off to the fact that one exists. However, it can also cause infection if the hamster is picking at her skin. , Normally, a hamster’s fur should be be full and shiny. As hamsters age, their fur will thin. This is normal. However, if your hamster starts to lose fur all at once, he might be sick.


Wet, matted fur around the hamster’s belly and tail can be signs of an infection., In particular, look for a runny nose, red or inflamed eyes, and puffy cheeks.


Hamsters often get a runny nose when sick, and are particularly vulnerable to catching colds. These are often not the most deadly of sicknesses, but if they persist, see a veterinarian.
Your hamster has pouches in his cheeks to carry food around. If you notice that these pouches look full for a long time, it may be that they are infected.

Pick out male and female dwarf hamsters.,
Set up cages for your hamsters.,
Supply hamsters with food and water.,
Wait until the female hamster is in heat.,
Place the hamsters together in one cage.,
Watch signs of the female getting ready to deliver.,
Remove the male before the birth.,
Wait 18 to 30 days for the birth.,
Expect around 5 or 6 babies.,
Avoid touching the nest after the birth.,
Separate the male babies after 4 weeks.,
Watch the babies eat solid food.",How to Breed Dwarf Hamsters," If you don’t already have a sexually mature male and female hamster, you should find one at the pet store. Check the genitalia to ensure that you are getting a male and a female. It is pretty tricky to tell the difference. For males, the testicles and anus are far apart. On females, the genitalia and anus are so close together they look like they are in the same place.You can find these points on the bottom of the hamster, just below the tail and between the hind legs.
Make sure the males are at least 30 days old, and that females are at least three or four months old.It is better for the male to be older than 30 days, preferably around the same age as the female.
Make sure they are healthy before purchasing so that you don’t have to worry about treating illnesses.;
, You need one cubic foot of space for a single dwarf hamster, and an extra half cubic foot per extra hamster in a cage. Size is very important for any hamster cage, but especially for breeding. The base should be solid, like a plank of wood or solid plastic. You need to have easy access to all parts of the cage.Consider getting a cage with tubes built in to give your hamsters a better quality of life. Just be prepared to break them down and scrub them out now and then. You do at least need a running wheel.
Get bedding that is made from cellulose fiber or aspen wood shavings. Avoid cedar or pine shavings because the wood bears natural chemicals harmful for your hamsters’ lungs.Find a cage with extremely small openings or solid walls to keep babies from falling out of the cage.
Place the mother’s cage in a quiet area after you have bred her.
Give the female extra bedding for nest building material.

, Attach a water bottle where the hamsters can easily reach. You can buy water bottles that hang on the side of a cage upside down. You can feed them with commercial hamster food available at the pet store. If you want to feed your dwarf hamsters fresh food, focus on seeds, whole grains, fresh green vegetables, and boiled eggs.After the mother gives birth, supply her with a slice of bread soaked in cow’s skim milk daily. Continue offering this milk bread until the pups reach four weeks.
To minimize disturbing the mother after the pups are born, stock the feeder with food. You will be offering the milk-soaked bread, but if you stock the feeder well, you might not have to disturb the hamsters to refill it very much.

, Sexually mature female hamsters are at least three or four months old. They go into heat (called estrus) every four days. Hamsters are nocturnal, so a female’s time of heat will occur at night and last for 12 hours.You will know your hamster has mated because her vagina will have a white substance in it. This is the “copulatory plug” and is proof that the male released sperm.

, When you see the female dwarf hamster in her estrus cycle, or in heat, you can place the male in the cage with her. Actually, since dwarf hamsters can live quite happily in the same cage, you might keep mating pairs together until the female gives birth.If you place the mating pair together without supervision, the female will become pregnant quickly.
Evidence of a female’s first mating is blood near her genitalia, under the tail.

, She will build a nest late in her pregnancy by gathering bedding material into one location. She will also start to eat more, groom more, and dig more. She may become more restless and startle more easily., If the male is still present in the same cage with his family after the female gives birth, this puts the female’s life at risk. She will be in heat immediately after giving birth, and the male will mate with her. It isn’t healthy for her to get pregnant again right away. Take the male out when you see signs of the mother getting ready to give birth, such as nest building., Dwarf hamster gestation is between 18 and 30 days, but the average time from mating to birth is 21 days. The Roborovski hamster usually goes the full 30 days. Once you place a male and female together in a cage, you can expect to have pups within about three weeks.Remember to take the male out before the birth so that they don’t mate again right away.
The female goes back into heat within 24 hours after having the pups.

, The average size of a dwarf hamster litter is four to six pups. There can be as few as three and as many as twelve, however. They will nurse for about three weeks, although they will start to drink water at the two-week mark. They will huddle and move around the cage together.They will start to eat solid food at the end of their nursing days, anywhere between day 16 and 21.

, The mother hamster will be quite skittish while she nurses. For the first three weeks after the pups are born, avoid touching the nest at all costs. The mother might panic and kill her babies. If you need to clean an area of the cage, use something besides your bare hand to get it out. Be very careful to avoid the nest.A tissue can be used instead of your hand. Try to keep your human smell out of the cage.
You might also consider fully stocking a water bottle and the food bowl so that you spend as little time as possible disturbing the mother hamster.

, You should remove male pups after they are weaned (at age four weeks). They are sexually mature at this age, and you want to prevent inbreeding. Dwarf hamsters are more mild than other breeds, so you can leave the female pups in the cage with their mother. Since the father will reject male babies, place the male pups in their own cage after they are weaned.


Since they wean at about three weeks, giving them one extra week with their mother to adjust to life on solid food is good.

, When the babies are about three weeks old, or between 16 and 21 days old, they will start to eat solid food on their own. Make sure you stock the cage's feeder with enough food for both the mother and babies."

Decide what type of hamsters you want.,
Get a male and female.,
Look for hamsters that are in good health.,
Buy two large cages for your hamsters.,
When you bring each of your hamsters home, allow it at least a day alone.,
Wait until the female is in heat.,
Put the female into the male's cage.,
Isolate your female hamster once the mating is over.,
Wait.,
Look for the babies.,
Allow the mother to nurse for three weeks without any disturbance, not even cleaning the cage.,
Wait three and a half weeks.",How to Breed Hamsters," Syrian hamsters are good pets, partially because they are solitary animals, but they can be quite hard to breed. If the male and female are introduced at the wrong time, they may fight. Dwarf hamsters are thought to be nippy with humans, but are more social with each other, and can actually be easier to breed.


There are also Russian hamsters, winter white hamsters, and other varieties. If you're buying from a breeder, talk about the different varieties and discover whether they are social or not, to have some sense of the breeding process.;
, It's best to get your breeding hamsters from a breeder, so you have a wide selection of colours and types. It's also good to know the breeding history of the hamsters.


At a pet shop, you will often find siblings or hybrid breed hamsters that are less desirable for breeding. Also, pet store workers often have a difficult time telling the difference between males and females.

, Make sure that their eyes are clear and bright, their fur is smooth and glossy, and that they look active and interested in their surroundings.

, Plastic bin cages or aquariums are a massive advantage in breeding. Put one hamster in each cage and fill the bottom with wood shavings, megazorb, or carefresh. Try to avoid sawdust, as this gets into hamsters' eyes and can affect their breathing.


Avoid wire cages. Hamsters, especially newborn ones, can squeeze out through them.
Get a small plastic or preferably wood ""hamster home"" for your hamster to huddle in. Fill it with some of the same shavings as in the cage.
A hamster wheel is also a must for the habitat. For dwarf hamsters the size can be almost any size, as long as they are able to use it, but for Syrians it must be more than 8 inches (20.3 cm), and it should be plastic, not wire, as holes in these wheels are very likely to harm your hamster. Also, never give your hamster a wheel where it's running with arched back, even just a little, as that can cause serious health problems.
You'll also need a water bottle, food bowl, hamster food, treats, and anything else that you can think off.

, Don't handle them or take them out of their cages, but make sure the habitat is well stocked to help your hamsters get used to their new environment without disruption. It is best to start handling them the day after you bring them home. If your new hamster hasn't been handled a lot then be prepared to tame them.

, When hamsters are 28 days old, they will reach their sexual maturity. The female enters heat roughly every 4 days. When the female is in heat, it will behave much like a cat in heat, crouching low to the ground and raising its tail. You may also notice that the hamster is smellier than usual because it is giving off pheromones.


If the female is not in heat, trying to breed them can be very dangerous and counterproductive. The female will often fight and kill the male.
When you're planning on breeding them, place the two cages side by side for a few days, so they can see and get used to each other, and so the pheromones can do their work.

, Hamsters are nocturnal animals, so it's best to start in the early evening. Put them into the neutral territory or the males cage. A spare cage is a good option, as she is more likely to attack the male if he is put in her cage. If they start fighting, remove one hamster from the cage, and try again another day.


Keep following these steps until they mate. If you miss the ""heat"" window, wait for a few days until it comes back around.

, While some male hamsters will care for the babies, some others will attack and eat them. It's best to be on the safe side, even if you have a kind and loving male hamster, to separate him for the duration of the gestation and birth, which should only be about two weeks.


If you're breeding dwarf hamsters, the time to reach sexual maturity and the gestation period are slightly longer. It takes one month to 5 weeks for a dwarf hamster to reach sexual maturity, and the gestation period is about three weeks. However, no hamsters under 5(for males)/6(for females) months should be bred as this increases the risk of something going wrong.

, At this stage, you need to be patient and watch the progress. If your female is pregnant, she should start ""showing"" within a few days, and by the time she's ready to give birth will have very prominent ""saddlebags"" on each side. You don't need to do anything special, just avoid holding the hamster roughly and leave the hamster alone.


You will know the babies will be born soon when the female becomes particularly restless. She wanders around her cage, gathering food and nesting material for her nest. Then labor begins: you see her sides starting to heave and tiny pink bodies begin to emerge. One by one, they are born while she is on the move in her cage, and one by one, she carefully picks them up in her mouth and brings them back to the nest.
When the hamster gives birth, do not attempt to interfere or help in any way. Birth, especially the first birth, is often difficult on the hamster, but there's nothing you can do to help at this point. Just avoid interference and let nature take its course.

, It is during this time and the days that follow that you must take extra care not to disturb her. If she leaves any pups lying around the cage, you must not touch them. If for some reason you must, rub a spoon well into the substrate, then scoop them up in it and return them to the nest.

, Leave her, the cage, and especially her babies alone, except for discreetly topping up her food and water. This is particularly important for the first time mother, who under stress, has been known to kill and even eat her babies.


Don't assume the mother is eating the babies if she puts them in her mouth. This happens if she is startled and thinks they are in danger.

, At this point, it's safe to separate the new hamsters, determine their genders, and separate them. They become sexually mature at 5-6 weeks, and you do not want sibling breeding, that will cause genetic disorders. Keep females in one cage, males in another for another two to three weeks until they go to their new homes.

Take a quick look at your hamster to see if his injuries look minor (e.g, small cuts and scrapes) or major (e.g., broken limbs, lots of bleeding).


Minor injuries are typically treatable at home, but major injures require immediate veterinary care.If your hamster has major injuries, he will have other symptoms, including labored and raspy breathing, excessive squeals, and aggression when handled.
Be mindful that hamsters can be good at hiding just how much pain they’re in.;
, If your hamster’s injuries are major, call your veterinarian immediately to let him or know you will be arriving soon with an emergency case.Be aware that not all small animal veterinarians treat pocket pets (e.g., hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs). If your veterinarian is not able to treat your hamster, ask if he or she can refer you to a veterinarian who can.


By calling, your veterinarian can advise you on what first aid you can give your hamster before you get to the veterinarian’s office.

, If you have determined that your hamster’s injuries are minor, begin preparing to treat him at home. You will need a number of supplies, including clean towels, Q-tips, several 10cc syringes (without the needles), and some sterile 2 x 2 gauze. In addition, you will need a bottle of sterile saline, a disinfectant solution (Betadine) and an antibiotic ointment.You can find treatment supplies at your local pharmacy.
Your veterinarian can advise you on the specific type of antibiotic ointment you should use.
Betadine is also known as povidone iodine.
Hydrogen peroxide has commonly been used as a disinfectant, but it may not be as beneficial as previously thought. The bubbling seen with hydrogen peroxide can damage cells, so using it may do more harm than good., Hamsters are very hardy animals and can recovery quickly from injury. If you see that he has only minor cuts and scrapes, consider letting him tend to them on his own. Many times, hamsters will lick and clean the wounds, which will heal them.The wounds from minor cuts and scrapes can become infected if your hamster doesn’t tend to them and clean them. An infected wound can turn into an abscess,which is a pocket of infection.
Abscesses are serious and must be treated by a veterinarian.They will also require at-home care, such as wound cleaning and antibiotics.

, Another option is for you to treat the minor injuries. Before getting to the wounds, wrap your hamster in a small, clean towel to restrain him.Hamsters can become very nippy when they are injured,so you should protect yourself from getting bitten.


Wrap him up in such a way that you can still get to his wounds.
Other than cuts and scrapes, your hamster may have skin sores as a result of injury. These are open wounds that look inflamed and might be bleeding.If there is not a lot of blood, you can treat the sores at home.
Your hamster may not be able to clean open sores on his own, so you should do this for him.

, With your syringe, draw up some sterile saline. Gently squirt the saline around the wound and pat the wound dry with a piece or two of the gauze.Do this a few times to make sure the wound is clean and free of debris.


Cleaning it yourself can prevent abscess formation, since you will be able to clearly see how well you’ve cleaned it.

, When the wound is dry, use another syringe to draw up a small amount of Betadine. Dispense this onto the wound and pat it dry with some more gauze. Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment to the wound with a Q-tip.Disinfecting the wound will help kill microorganisms that could cause infection.
Betadine can stain your skin, so you may want to wear gloves when you use it.

, No matter the injury, it is important that your hamster rest and recover comfortably in his cage. Place his food and water bowls near his sleeping area.The cage should be in a warm and quiet area of your home.


It is ideal that your hamster recover in a cage without bars,such as an aquarium, to prevent further injury. If you do not already have an aquarium and buying one isn’t practical, keep a close eye on your hamster when he is moving around in his cage.

, To prevent these minor injuries from happening again, you should try to identify what caused them in the first place. For example, your hamster may have rubbed against a sharp edged toy that cut his skin. Or, there may be a loose wire in his cage that is scraping against his skin.If your hamster has a cage mate with whom he doesn’t get along, they may have scratched or bitten each other.
Your hamster’s nails might be too long, causing him to scratch himself.Whatever the cause, do your best to manage or remove it so your hamster doesn’t get injured again. This may involve separating your hamsters.

, Major injuries must be treated by a veterinarian immediately.Giving your hamster first aid can stabilize him and increase his chances of survival before you get to your veterinarian’s office. First aid is most useful if your hamster is bleeding.


With a small towel or piece of facial tissue, apply gentle pressure to the wound to try and stop the bleeding.Blood loss in a hamster can be life threatening, since hamsters do not have a lot of blood to begin with.Do not use up precious time waiting for the bleeding to stop!

, Your veterinarian will be able to provide further care for your hamster. When transporting your hamster, keep him wrapped up in a towel in his travel carrier. This will keep him calm and quiet during the ride.Prepare yourself for the possibility that your hamster may not make it. Some injuries are so serious that, no matter what a veterinarian does, the hamster will not survive. If your hamster is severely injured, the best option may be to put him to sleep (‘euthanasia’).

, Your veterinarian will do what he or she can to treat your hamster’s major injuries. For example, if there is an abscess from an infected wound, your veterinarian will lance and drain it.If your hamster has become dehydrated from not wanting to drink water after his injury, your veterinarian can give him fluids under his skin to rehydrate him.


A serious wound may require stitches.If your hamster has a broken leg, you may be surprised that there’s not much your veterinarian can do to fix it. If he or she tries to put a splint or wrap on the limb, your hamster will likely chew it off.Your veterinarian will recommend that you let the broken bone heal on its own. The leg may be a little crooked as a result, but your hamster will be fine.To lessen the pain, your veterinarian may prescribe pain medication.Your veterinarian will recommend treatment for a broken limb only if your hamster is dragging it around or the leg looks inflamed.Be aware that if your hamster can no longer use his back legs, your veterinarian may recommend euthanasia., When you take your hamster home from the veterinarian, you will need to do a few things to keep him comfortable while he recovers. Other than pain medications, your veterinarian may recommend using a cold compress on the injury to lessen inflammation. Since your hamster is so small, his whole body could get cold from the compress.


Keep him snuggly wrapped up during and after use of the compress to keep him warm.
If your hamster has an infected wound, your veterinarian will send you home with antibiotics to give to your hamster.
Your hamster may be in so much pain that he refuses to eat and drink. Hand-feed him by placing small bits of food in your hand and holding your hand close to his mouth.
Handle him as little as possible when he is recovering.

, This is especially important if your hamster has a leg injury. Take out any toys or accessories that would require your hamster to use his legs, as well as ramps, ladders, hamster wheels. Remove tubes that he would be tempted to crawl through.Keep only the necessities in his cage, such as comfortable bedding and bowls for food and water.

See your vet.",How to Keep Your Hamster Comfortable When It is Sick or Dying," If you have a habitat that houses multiple hamsters, provide your sick or dying hamster a separate space to rest. Using an isolation habitat can keep your hamster comfortable, prevent stress from other animals and activity, and minimize the risk of disease transmission to cage mates.Place the isolation habitat in a location away from other pets, family members, bright light, and noise.
Make sure the new tank into which you move your hamster is large enough to keep it comfortable. Although the hamster might not move much, it should still have room to move.
Move cleaned food and water dishes to the isolation habitat. You can use diluted soapy, water to clean the dishes.Avoid placing an exercise wheel in the new habitat. Hamsters are known to exercise when they’re sick, which can cause injury or dehydration.Remove any tunnels or plug them so that the cage is simple and homey. This can keep your hamster’s movement to a minimum.;
, No matter if you have multiple hamsters or a single Syrian hamster, which prefers solitude, it’s important to clean the cage thoroughly. This can minimize the transmission of disease to cage mates or give a single hamster a clean and comfortable environment.Wear protective gloves or wash your hands thoroughly when finished. If you are pregnant, ask someone to clean the cage for you to minimize your risk of rodent meningitis or fungal infections.
Use diluted, soapy water or a bleach solution of ¼ cup bleach to 2¼ cups water to sanitize the entire habitat. Clean all of the surfaces in the cage and make sure to rinse them thoroughly, especially if you’re using a bleach solution. Bleach vapors can be toxic to a hamster in an enclosed space.

, Hamsters that are ill often won’t eat or drink, which can cause them to become chilled.They may even go into hibernation, which can be dangerous for domestic hamsters.Making sure that your hamster is warm, but not hot, will keep it comfortable and minimize any stress it has.Put plenty of plain, unscented toilet paper in the habitat. Tear the toilet paper into strips, which your hamster will use to make a nest that in which it can curl up and get warm.Use a heating pad or heat lamp to warm the habitat to 70-85 degrees Fahrenheit (21-29 degrees Celsius). If you’re using a heat lamp, place a small hamster house inside the habitat so your pet can escape the bright light. Make sure to not overheat the habitat, as it can cause heat stress or heat stroke., If your hamster is comfortable and not fighting you, wrap it in a small towel and hold it close to your body. Your hamster may curl up and sleep on you while the towel and your body heat warm it up.Stroke your hamster if it allows you. You can also talk or sing to it. This can further soothe and comfort your hamster.

, If you haven’t done so already, wash your hamster’s food and water dishes in hot and diluted, soapy water. Dry them thoroughly and then add fresh new food and water. This can minimize the risk of your hamster becoming more sick and may stimulate its desire to eat.Avoid using a bleach solution to wash your hamster’s food and water dishes. Leftover bleach could be toxic to your hamster.

, Many hamsters feel lethargic and stop eating when they don’t feel well. It’s important that they eat and drink regularly to fight off illness and recover.Placing your hamster’s food and water dishes closer to it gives access to sustenance while keeping movement to a minimum.Place the dishes close to your hamster’s nest. This allows your hamster to easily move between its warm spot and the food and water it needs.

, Protein can help your hamster build strength. Adding some tasty, protein-rich foods to your hamster’s diet may help it fight illness and recover. Remember to wash the dish as necessary with certain high-protein foods such as eggs or milk. The following are good sources of protein for an ailing hamster:Plain scrambled eggs
Tofu
Milk-soaked bread
Yogurt with probiotics in small amounts
Baby food free of garlic, onion, and lemon juice
Hard-boiled eggsCooked chicken in small bits

, For an ailing hamster, getting enough liquids is an even bigger priority than food. Making sure it has a fresh source of water and providing foods high in water content can keep your hamster hydrated. This may help it feel better.Recognize that the best source of liquid for your hamster is water. You can also give it a weakened solution of unflavored electrolyte. Do this by mixing one part electrolyte solution to one part water.
Add fruits like pears and apples to increase your hamster’s liquids. Even a piece of milk-soaked bread will provide extra liquid to its diet.

, If your hamster doesn’t seem to be eating or drinking from its dishes, you can feed it by hand or by syringe. This may be easier for your hamster than moving to its dish. It can also provide vital nutrients and liquids.Place bits of food in your hands and see if your hamster takes it. You may want to do this sitting in a comfortable spot so you can give your hamster time to eat. Stroke your hamster and talk to it so it feels comfortable and soothed.
Try a 1cc syringe to give baby food and liquids if your hamster won’t eat out of your hand. Place the syringe in the corner of the mouth behind the front teeth. Then depress the plunger. Your hamster may even grab the syringe and feed itself.

, If your hamster seems very hungry, let it eat for a few minutes. Then take a break and try feeding or giving it more food. Letting your hamster eat without a break can make its illness worse and may also make it feel worse., Hamsters that are ill or dying will usually exhibit one or many mild physical signs. Paying attention to your hamster(s) on a daily basis can help you identify potential problems, give it comfort, and seek veterinary help if they symptoms don’t go away within a couple of days. Some physical signs of illness or dying in a hamster are:Coughing
Constipation
Diarrhea
Hair loss
Head tilt
Nasal discharge
Excessive urination
Itching
Sneezing
Wheezing
Damp, dried out, or ruffled fur, Some hamsters may exhibit more concerning symptoms of illness or death. Seek immediate veterinary treatment if your hamster has any of the following signs:Enlarged or swollen abdomen that is not from eating
Difficult, labored or rapid breathing
Collapse or coma
Discharge from the genitals or anus
Bulging, cloudy, crusted, or squinting eyes
Sores or scabs
Swelling beneath the skin
Wet tail, In addition to watching your hamster’s physical appearance, it’s important to pay attention to its behavior. It may not have physical symptoms of illness, but a hamster’s behavior can also cue you into potential illness or death.Some behavioral signs of illness in a hamster include:


Changes in interaction with other hamsters
Change in interaction with you
Cowering
Nipping
Exercise intoleranceLoss of appetite
Excessive drinking
Head tilting

, If your hamster doesn’t respond to any of your attempts to make it comfortable and keep it fed and hydrated, take it to your vet.

The size of a hamster's cage is important for his health and wellbeing. A single hamster needs a cage that is at least 12 inches wide by 12 inches high by 18 inches long. However, a bigger cage is generally better. This gives your hamster more room to run and play, allowing him to get more exercise. If you're getting a specific breed, like a Syrian hamster, a bigger cage may be necessary as these hamsters can grow as long as 6 inches.In terms of accessories, you will need a bare minimum of a hanging water bottle and a ceramic bowl of food.

However, do not give your hamster rotten food. This can cause indigestion and other health problems.Hamsters tend to eat fattier, tastier foods from a pile first. For example, they may eat all their sunflower seeds without touching their fruit. This is normal but do not take it as an indication you should feed your hamster more sunflower seeds. You need to make sure your hamster has a balance of healthy foods in addition to fun snacks and treats. Moderation is key to a healthy, happy pet., In addition to food, hamsters need plenty of water.

Panting
Bright red tongue
Slobbering
Depression
Weakness
Lack of movement
Convulsions;
, Walk through your home and try and find where it is the coolest. Try and move your hamster’s cage there.

Lymphoma, which is a cancer of the immune system, is a common tumor in hamsters. It can affect many internal organs and lymph nodes, resulting in the formation of lumps in the belly.If the lumps are large enough, you would be to see and feel them.


Lymph nodes are small nodules located throughout a hamster’s body. They are part of the immune system.
Lymphoma that affects the belly is common in young hamsters.It is caused by a virus called Hamster Polyomavirus.
Female hamsters can develop mammary tumors. Mammary glands are the small nipples that run lengthwise down a female hamster’s chest and belly. Mammary tumors look like large masses.;
, Lymphoma commonly causes swelling of the lymph nodes in the armpit and neck. If you see lumps in your hamster’s neck and armpits, the lymph nodes in those areas are likely swollen with cancer cells., Hamster Polyomavirus can also affect the skin. This virus causes little wart-like tumors called trichoepitheliomas to form on the skin. These skin tumors are most common in adult hamsters.A hamster infected with Hamster Polyomavirus can develop mange, a skin condition caused by tiny parasites called mites. If your hamster has mange, its skin will be scaly and itchy., Hamsters can develop other lumps called abscesses, which are pockets of infection. When diagnosing a tumor in hamsters, it is important to make sure the lump is a tumor and not an abscess.An abscess will be red and maybe even warm to the touch, indicating infection and inflammation.


A tumor probably won't be red or feel warm.However, some tumors might show signs of inflammation and infection.Your vet will be able to determine whether the lump is an abscess or a tumor.

, In hamsters, tumors tend to grow very quickly.If you see a lump on your hamster that suddenly gets bigger, your hamster likely has a tumor.

, When a hamster has a tumor, it will probably eat less.You will know if your hamster is eating less if it doesn’t finish all the food you normally feed it at meal time. Also, your hamster may not want to eat the treats it usually enjoys.


If your hamster is eating less, it will also lose weight. Weight loss is common in hamsters with tumors., Lymphoma in the digestive organs (e.g., stomach, intestines) can cause signs of digestive upset, especially diarrhea.You will not see vomit, because hamsters cannot vomit.

, Commonly, hamsters get tumors in glands (adrenal, thyroid) that produce hormones. Thyroid and adrenal tumors disrupt the normal balance of hormones in your hamster’s body. One result of this hormone imbalance is hair loss.Lymphoma in hamsters can also cause hair loss. This hair loss is patchy., Thyroid and adrenal tumors can also make a hamster extremely thirsty.If you are refilling your hamster’s water bottle more frequently than usual, your hamster might have a thyroid or adrenal tumor.

, The physical discomfort of a tumor could cause a hamster to start acting strangely. For example, your hamster may groom the area of the tumor to the point of causing baldness or injury. Your hamster may also start walking strangely if the size of the tumor makes walking difficult.Your hamster may also become very weak.It will not be as playful as it used to be.

, As soon as you see a lump on your hamster, take your hamster to your vet. Since tumors can grow quickly, you do not want to wait and see if the lump goes away on its own. The sooner you can get your hamster to your vet, the sooner your vet can diagnose and treat the tumor.During the appointment, give your vet a full history of your hamster, including when you first noticed the lumps and what other symptoms you observed. Also, tell your vet about your hamster’s normal diet and if your hamster has had any previous illnesses.

, The best way to diagnose a tumor is to analyze a small sample of it. This sample is called a biopsy.Your vet will anesthetize your hamster to take a biopsy. Next, they will send the biopsy to a veterinary expert who will analyze it and determine the tumor type.


It will probably take at least a few days before your vet receives the results of the biopsy.

, After diagnosing a tumor in your hamster, your vet will want to discuss different treatment options with you. If the tumor is on your hamster’s skin, your vet will likely be able to surgically remove it.However, tumors inside the body may be difficult to remove, especially if they are really big.

Choose a high-quality hamster food.,
Look at the label.,
Consider reducing how much food you provide.,
Keep your hamster’s food in a dish.,
Be aware that hamsters are active animals.,
Give your hamster a bigger cage.,
Give your hamster a hamster wheel.,
Allow the hamster to explore in a hamster ball.,
Have your hamster examined by a vet.,
Provide plenty of fresh, clean water.,
Keep its teeth trimmed.",How to Get an Overweight Hamster to Lose Weight," Just as with human food, there is healthy hamster food, and then there is junk food. Investing in a high-quality hamster food will help your hamster lose weight, especially if it has been eating a lot of empty calories.For example, if your hamster is eating a lot of seeds, a lot of treats, or a lot of food filled with sugar, it will gain weight unnecessarily. It is OK to give your hamster a special treat every now and then, but it shouldn’t make up a significant portion of its diet.
In addition to hamster food, hamsters also need fresh food to eat. It is important to provide it with a small amount of something fresh to eat each day. Examples include grass, clovers, and carrots. You can also feed leafy greens, such as lettuce, but it should only have a very small amount of this because it can cause diarrhea.
Occasionally, you can also give your hamster a small piece of dog biscuit to gnaw on. This will provide protein and also help grind it’s teen down.;
, At pet food stores, you can often find pre-mixed hamster food that aims to meet many of your hamster’s nutritional needs at once. However, as with any type of pet food, the cheapest brands often contain low-quality ingredients. The goal of these brands is often to sell something to make money rather than to provide a quality diet for your hamster. Thus, you need to look at the labels carefully before choosing.A balanced hamster diet will have a mix of seeds and cereals, as well as insect larvae or insects such as crickets.
If the label shows that the hamster food is high in sugar, you should put it back. Sugar is not necessary or healthy for a hamster.

, Hamsters do have a very high metabolism, which means they need to eat a lot to maintain their energy. However, it is possible to feed a hamster too much, especially if you just fill its bowl whenever it is empty. For most hamsters, a tablespoon of high-quality hamster food each day is enough.Though a tablespoon of mixed food is enough, you also need to supplement your hamster’s diet with a few treats each day to make sure it is getting all the necessary nutrients. For example, you could give your hamster a couple of greens and a floret of cauliflower, a small handful of raisins, or a couple of apple slices.
Remember that even though you might not see food in its bowl, your hamster may have stashed food around the cage for later.

, Hamsters are hoarders. If you spread its food across the bottom of its cage instead of putting it in a bowl, a hamster might hoard more food than it needs because it constantly has to “forage” for it. On the other hand, if the food is kept in a bowl, the hamster will view this as its “stash” of food, so it won’t feel the need to hoard so much food.Keeping your hamster’s food in a dish also offers a method for you to monitor how much it is eating.
Each day, you should remove any uneaten food and replace it with fresh food. You can put the old food outside for birds and squirrels to eat if you don’t want to waste it.

, In the wild, a hamster might run several miles each night, and a hamster in captivity needs to have a way to exercise. Not only is this important for its health, it is also important for its well-being.A hamster who doesn’t have any stimulation could become depressed.

, If your hamster doesn’t have much room to move around, it won’t be able to burn many calories through exercise. Remember that hamsters are quite active, and need space in order to be healthy.The bigger your hamster’s cage or aquarium, the better. However, if you have limited space, you should try to get the biggest cage that your space allows. Your hamster will live its life in that cage so the more space it has, the better. Your hamster’s cage should have a minimum of two square feet.
If you can’t afford the space to give your hamster a spacious cage, consider getting a taller cage. Some hamster habitats will have two or three stories that allow your hamster to go up and down.
You can also make a hamster playground for your hamster out of common household items. Creating a hamster playground in addition to your hamster’s normal cage will provide exercise and stimulation for your curious hamster.

, If you have more than one hamster, it is best to provide a wheel per hamster. The size wheel you need depends on your hamster’s size, but generally, the bigger and wider, the better. Opt for wheels that are made of a solid piece of wood or plastic rather than a metal wheel that has bars. In many cases, a hamster may break its legs with this type of wheel because its legs slip between the bars.Make sure that the wheel is large enough so that the hamster’s back does not have to flex backward too much while it is using the wheel. Some wheels are created in a bowl shape to prevent this.
As a general rule, a dwarf hamster will need a wheel at least 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter. If you have a large breed hamster, the wheel should be at least 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter.
Pay attention to how your hamster looks while using the wheel. A wheel is too small if it causes the hamster to scoop their back to run in it.

, A hamster ball is a hollow plastic ball that is designed to allow your hamster to run around without getting into things it shouldn’t. This is a great way to get your hamster to exercise, and it is also very interesting for the hamster because it will be able to do a little bit of exploring in your home.For an adult Syrian hamster, you will need a ball that is at least 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter. If you have a dwarf hamster, you will probably need a smaller, lighter ball. Look for one that is designed specifically for dwarf hamsters.
You should never leave your hamster alone in its hamster ball to run around. You need to keep constant watch to make sure nothing goes wrong.
Don’t allow the hamster to play in its ball if there are any pets present. This will be terrifying for the hamster if the pet tries to chase the hamster.
Block off any areas you don’t want your hamster to get into. Make sure that any stairs or ledges are blocked so your hamster doesn’t fall off.
Limit your hamster’s time in the ball to no more than once per day for 20 or 30 minutes. Remember that a hamster cannot get to its water while in the ball, but as it runs around, it will become dehydrated.

, A veterinarian will be able to tell you how much your hamster should weigh based on the hamster’s breed and age. In addition to that, having your hamster checked by the vet regularly will help you stay on top of your hamster’s health.If your hamster has recently gained or lost a lot of weight for no obvious reason, your vet may be able to find an underlying cause.

, You need to change out your hamster’s water each day, even if you don’t think the water looks dirty, or if it has a water bottle. Hamsters cannot survive without water for more than one or two days.Water bottles can easily malfunction. Checking your hamster’s water every single day means you will notice if there is a problem before your hamster becomes severely dehydrated.

, You may not realize that a hamster’s teeth grow continuously. In the wild, a hamster will grind its teeth down on hard objects to keep them from becoming overgrown. Unfortunately, many hamsters kept as pets do not have access to something that it can use to grind its teeth on. Though you can trim your hamster’s teeth yourself, it’s best to have a vet show you how to do this properly before attempting it on your own.This is one more reason to have your hamster checked by a vet regularly. If your vet notices an overgrown tooth, a broken tooth, or a crooked tooth they can help you take care of the situation before it causes any bigger problems.
You can offer apple wood or hard dog treats to your hamster so it has something hard to gnaw on.

To make the decision process a little easier, look objectively at your hamster’s behavior. For example, watch how he walks—if his back is arched or he is unsteady on his feet, he could be feeling extremely sick.Hamsters love to run and play. If your hamster stays hunched over in a corner of his cage, he is very uncomfortable and likely very sick.Make a list of several activities your hamster loves to do (e.g., run in his hamster wheel, gnaw on chew toys, etc.). If he no longer does those things, his quality of life has worsened,making euthanasia a reasonable option.
Track his good days and bad days in a journal.When he starts having more bad days and good days, it is time to start considering euthanasia.;
, When your hamster becomes so sick that he is no longer eating or drinking, he is letting you know that he is feeling pretty miserable. Not eating or drinking for as little as 24 hours can be very serious in hamsters. Talk to your veterinarian about euthanizing your hamster if it has been at least one day since your hamster ate or drank anything., Your veterinarian cannot make the decision to euthanize for you, but he or she can guide you through the decision process. One way your veterinarian can do this is to accurately diagnose your hamster.When you know the details of your hamster’s sickness, and his prognosis, you can make a clearer decision on whether to euthanize him.


Geriatric diseases in hamsters (e.g. liver failure, kidney failure, cancer) are those that occur after 18 months of age. They have no cure and can worsen a hamster’s quality of life. Euthanasia is a reasonable option for hamsters with geriatric diseases.
If your hamster has a geriatric disease, keep him as comfortable as possible until life has become too unbearable to him. This includes keeping him in a quiet area and handling him as little as possible.Discuss treatment options, if any, with your veterinarian. Be aware that your hamster could be so sick that he would not be able to tolerate intense veterinary care.Do not let your hamster suffer through treatment if it will not bring him better quality of life.

, You will probably have a lot of questions and concerns about euthanasia. During your appointment, discuss your hamster’s sickness and the possibility of euthanasia. Ask your veterinarian questions about the euthanasia process,as well as options for cremating or burying your hamster.


Consider asking your veterinarian if he or she thinks euthanasia is right for your hamster.No matter how your veterinarian answers, remember that only you can make the decision to euthanize your hamster.
Ask your veterinarian if he or she performs at-home euthanasias.Be mindful that not all veterinarians will do this.
If you have children, discuss the best way to tell them about euthanasia. Children do not always understand end-of-life issues,so you will have to be careful about explaining how ending a pet’s life can be humane.
Ask your veterinarian about local pet loss support groups.
Ask as many questions as you can think of, and express any concerns you may have. Although euthanasia is a difficult topic, your veterinarian understands this difficulty and can help you talk things through.

, As if the euthanasia decision was not difficult enough, you should know whether you are considering your hamster’s wellbeing or your own. You may feel unsure, or maybe even a little guilty, but your hamster’s wellbeing should come first.If you are delaying the decision, ask yourself if it’s because you are not ready to let your hamster go. Be aware that delaying your decision could be prolonging your hamster’s suffering.

, When you make the appointment, indicate what time of day and what day of the week will work for you.To be sensitive to a pet owner’s needs, veterinarians will typically schedule a euthanasia at the end of the day, when there are no other appointments.


The day of the week will also be important. You may want to schedule the euthanasia for the end of the week, when you will have the weekend to process what happened and start the grieving process.
If you know the euthanasia will be hard for you, bring someone with you to the appointment. Check with them before making the appointment to make sure they will be available.

, Check with your local health department about home burials for pets. Local laws may not allow pet owners to bury their pets in their yards. If you live in an apartment, or in the heart of a city, it is unlikely that you will be able to bury your hamster.Your veterinarian can recommend professional pet burial or crematory services. Contact them before your appointment so those arrangements can already be in place.Your veterinarian may also work with a pet burial or cremation service.

, Your hamster may be very sick, but he will probably appreciate you spending time with him in his final days. Although you may feel sad, or maybe even guilty about having him euthanized, do your best to remain calm around him. He could pick up on whatever you are feeling, so stay as positive as possible., No matter how much you have prepared yourself for putting your hamster to sleep, the actual act of having your hamster euthanized may be difficult for you. Your veterinarian will make sure the euthanasia will be quick, painless, and peaceful for your hamster.Your veterinarian will most likely administer a lethal injection into your hamster's belly and your hamster will pass away as a result.
Your veterinarian will check your hamster for a pulse to ensure that he has passed away.
It is your decision whether you want to be in the room for the euthanasia.Some pet owners cannot bear the thought of seeing their pet euthanized, and others want to be close to their beloved pet until the very end.
It is also your choice in how to say goodbye to your hamster. You may want to say a few things to him before and after he has passed on. It is up to you., Although small in size, your hamster probably meant a lot to you. Acknowledge your grief and give yourself time to process the loss. There’s no timetable for grieving—it may take you a few days, maybe longer.Consider writing your feelings down if you’re having trouble processing your thoughts.

, Pet loss support groups help pet owners manage the grief of losing a pet. Many veterinary schools have pet loss hotlines that you can contact. Your veterinarian, or even other pet owners, can recommend some local pet loss support groups that you can contact.The staff at your local humane society may also be able to recommend pet loss support groups., Children can have a hard time dealing with the death of a pet. If you have children, encourage them to talk about how they feel about your hamster’s death.Do not buy another pet for your children to make them feel better.Give them time to express how they feel about your hamster’s death before bringing a new pet into the home.

, You may be the type of person who does not grieve for long over the loss of a pet. Or, you might need a long time before you are ready to even think about getting another hamster (or another type of pet). Do not feel the need to rush into buying another pet.Remember that a new pet is not a replacement for your hamster.You will know when the time is right for you to get another pet."

Don’t let your hamster overheat.",How to Diagnose and Treat a Dehydrated Hamster," One of the easiest ways to tell if your hamster is dehydrated is to do the ‘skin tent’ test. Using the thumb and index finger of one hand, gently pinch some skin at the base of your hamster’s neck to create a ‘tent’ of skin. Let go of the skin.If it stays up in a tent, then your hamster is dehydrated.If your hamster was well hydrated, then the skin would flatten back out as soon as you let your fingers go.;
, When your hamster is dehydrated, he’s not going to look too good. For example, his eyes will appear droopy, sunken in, and dry. His fur will also look ruffled and unkempt because he isn’t grooming himself like he used to.Overall, your hamster’s body may look thinner.If your hamster is severely hydrated, his tongue may swell., Your hamster will groom less when he is dehydrated, leading to the ruffled coat.He will probably move more slowly as well,since he isn’t feeling well and just doesn’t have energy to run around like he used to. Your hamster might even become irritable and seem confused in his cage.When your hamster is dehydrated, he will also urinate less. The urine that he does produce will be very concentrated (dark color) and have a strong odor.These symptoms are not necessarily specific to dehydration, but are clear clues that your hamster is sick and needs treatment.

, Dehydration in hamsters is very serious, so you should not delay in getting your hamster to your veterinarian. However, if you cannot get him to the vet right away, start rehydrating him at home to get him on the road to recovery. You will administer fluids by mouth with a syringe, which is available at your local pharmacy.


Rehydration by mouth is recommended when the dehydration is caused by diarrhea.The best type of rehydration fluid for your hamster is one that contains salts and sugars (e.g., Lectade, unflavored Pedialyte).Rehydration products are available at your local pharmacy and grocery store.
Plain water is not recommended because it would dilute the already-reduced amount of minerals, salts, and sugars in your hamster’s body.If you can’t go to the store, you can add a pinch of salt and sugar to plain water and give that to your hamster.However, it would be best to purchase a rehydration solution that already has the proper mix of salts and sugars.
Draw up the fluid in the syringe (preferably a 10 milliliter syringe). Wrap your hamster snugly in a towel with one hand.With your other hand, place the syringe just inside his mouth on one side and empty the syringe’s contents drop by drop.Make sure that you give your hamster a chance to swallow the fluid in between drops. Never force fluid into your hamster because there is a risk that you will force fluid into his lungs, which is likely to be fatal.

, Your veterinarian will be able to give your hamster more advanced dehydration treatment. Other than commercially available rehydration products, your veterinarian will also have other fluids available, such as 0.9% saline or lactated ringers solution, to rehydrate your hamster.Your veterinarian will assess how severe your hamster’s dehydration is before administering fluids. This will help him or her calculate how much fluid to administer to adequately rehydrate, but not over hydrate your hamster.
Your veterinarian will probably try to give your hamster fluids by mouth first. If your hamster cannot drink on his own, your veterinarian will inject the fluids under your hamster’s skin (‘subcutaneous injection) using a sterile needle.If an underlying health condition (e.g., Wet Tail, diabetes) has caused the dehydration,your veterinarian will treat that condition as well.

, Fresh produce with a high water content can also help your hamster if diarrhea is not the cause of his dehydration. Cucumber is a good vegetable that you can give him.Apples also have a high water content.Consult with your veterinarian before giving your hamster fresh produce to treat the dehydration—introducing fresh produce to your hamster’s diet too suddenly can give him diarrhea,which would make his dehydration worse.

, Hamsters commonly become dehydrated when their owners forget to refill their water bottles.Do not forget about your little hamster! Keep a close eye on his water bottle and refill it with fresh, clean water as necessary.


A constant supply of fresh, clean water is essential to keeping your hamster well hydrated.
Check the ball bearing in your hamster’s water bottle to make sure it is working properly.If the ball somehow gets stuck, it could prevent your hamster from being able to sip the water from the bottle’s spout.

, Keeping your hamster healthy with a well-balanced diet will go a long way towards preventing dehydration. Components of a healthy hamster diet are a commercially available hamster mix, a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, and a few sweet treats now and then.


Baked chicken, low fat cottage cheese, and plain low-fat yogurt are also good choices for your hamster’s diet. They are high in protein, which is an important nutrient for hamsters.Foods you should not feed your hamster include onions, tomato leaves, and raw potatoes.Other foods to avoid feeding your hamster are chocolate, junk food, and watermelon.Talk with your veterinarian if you are unsure what types of food to feed your hamster.

, Heat stroke (mild or severe) is another common cause of dehydration in hamsters.Unfortunately, heat stroke can happen very quickly in hamsters,so you must be diligent about keeping your hamster cool, especially in the summer months.


Keep his cage out of the path of direct sunlight.The room where you keep his cage should be well ventilated.
If you are traveling with him in the car, make sure his cage is not by a sunny window.Check on him frequently.
If he starts to suffer from heatstroke (saliva dribbling from mouth, heavy breathing, lying on side), move his cage to a cool location, take him out of his cage, and run cool water over him to cool him down. Dry him off and let him recover quietly in his cage.Start rehydrating your hamster with Pedialyte (or water, if that’s all you have).Get him to a veterinarian as quickly as you can for further treatment.

Have a vet diagnose a mite infestation as soon as possible.,
Follow your vet’s recommendation regarding treatment.,
Keep any hamsters undergoing treatment in a temporary cage.",How to Get Rid of Mites in Your Hamster's Cage1," Hamsters often have a few mites hitching a ride, and they can easily be eliminated if they become an issue. However, stress, malnutrition, or advanced age may lead to a weakened immune system and less resistance to mites. If you’re hamster starts scratching heavily or has visible patches of irritation, balding or redness, take them to the vet and ask them to examine your hamster for mites.Recognize the possible signs of a mite infestations – especially irritated patches of skin – and get them to the vet quickly. Another sign to watch for is your hamster rubbing itself against the sides of its cage.;
, Depending on the type of mites involved, your vet may recommend a selenium sulfide shampoo or other topical treatment to kill the mites. With other types of mites, your vet may prescribe a medication such as ivermectin. Follow your vet’s directions about any specific treatment regimen.The only way you or your vet can be certain about a particular mite infestation is by taking a small scraping of your hamster’s skin and examining it under a microscope.

, More specifically, do not return your hamsters to their cage before cleaning the cage first. The cage may still contain mites and mite eggs that will quickly infect your hamster again. Further, if you have other hamsters, consider ensuring that they are not infested by taking them to the vet as well.If you do not have one, get a ball in which your hamster can roll about while you’re cleaning its cage, etc.

Remove all of the used bedding and throw it away.,
Clean literally everything that will go back into the cage.,
Clean all the surfaces inside the cage with antibacterial soap.,
Disinfect the cage with isopropyl alcohol rubbing alcohol.,
Replace food, water, and any worn toys.,
Clean the hamster’s cage once a week.",How to Get Rid of Mites in Your Hamster's Cage2," The most likely culprit of uncleanliness in your hamster’s cage – and the location where more mites are likely living – is the old bedding. When setting out to clean the cage, your first step should be removing all of the bedding and disposing of it in an outdoor trash receptacle., Take everything out of the cage and take it all apart. Remove the lid, any feeding dishes or water bottles, and all toys, tubes, ladders, or other furnishings. Anything plastic or metal should be washed with antibacterial soap and warm water, and then thoroughly rinsed and allowed to fully dry.Opt for an unscented antibacterial soap, as aromas are likely to persist and bother your hamster.
Wash any food or water equipment in the same way. Be sure to rinse food and water equipment an extra time; you do not want soap residue getting into anything your hamster will consume.

, Be diligent in cleaning every single spot in the cage. For instance, your hamster likely urinates and defecates in a particular location. Pay extra attention when cleaning this area. Wash everything with antibacterial soap and warm water, then rinse it and allow it to fully dry. Ensure the cage does not still smell of soap, and rinse it again if necessary., Following a mite infestation, you’ll need a second cleaning to disinfect all of the surfaces of your hamster’s dwelling. Rub rubbing alcohol on any surface of the cage or plastic or metal climbing structures, and dry the surfaces with a clean paper towel.Take care to avoid applying rubbing alcohol to any food or water equipment.

, You should replace anything you were unable to clean. Wooden toys in particular should be replaced frequently. Further, make sure a water bottle is not leaking after it is re-installed. Finally, make sure all the fastening components of the cage and any structures are also secure., Mites can be prevented from returning by maintaining a clean living environment for your hamster that will prevent your hamster from becoming stressed. Relatedly, be sure you are providing ample high quality food for your hamster, as proper nutrition also decreases the likelihood of a mite infestation.For more specific information regarding your hamster's dietary needs, see the wikiHow article on how to feed hamsters.

Refill your hamster’s habitat with Aspen shavings.,
Consider other types of bedding.,
Use shredded paper temporarily.,
Freeze new bedding before refilling the habitat.,
Avoid certain types of widely-available hamster bedding.",How to Get Rid of Mites in Your Hamster's Cage3," Aspen shavings make one of the safest and most natural forms of bedding. They also make for the best form of bedding following a mite infestation. Make sure you acquire Aspen shavings from a pet supplies store or website, as it will have been specifically treated keep mites away.Unfortunately, Aspen shavings do have one drawback: they are not quite as absorbent as some other manufactured options.
Your hamster’s cage may develop an unpleasant aroma more quickly with Aspen shaving bedding than with another option – however, this may be a good things, if it prompts you to clean the habitat more often.

, Your choice of bedding should account for several factors. Namely, choose a bedding that does not pose a risk to your hamster’s health or safety. There are several other good options that satisfy these criteria. In particular, consider:Carefresh Ultra or Carefresh Colors. Carefresh hamster bedding is soft, safe, and free of scented chemicals. It is made from cellulose fiber, which helps it absorb a considerable amount of moisture – a vital feature for hamster bedding. While most colored bedding is not recommended, Carefresh Colors uses a safe dye that will not harm your hamster.
Kaytee Clean & Cozy (unscented). This is a plant-based paper bedding that excels in absorption and odor control. Avoid the scented options; some hamsters can suffer from breathing complications when exposed to scented bedding.

, If you have ordered bedding and are waiting for it to arrive, or want to temporarily house one of your hamsters away from the others, you may use finely shredded paper as bedding. Make sure the paper is both non-toxic and free of any inks. Accordingly, do not use newspaper.Do not attempt to use paper as a continual source of bedding, as it will do an extremely poor job with absorption and aroma control.

, Whatever you use, you should take one final measure to ensure it is entirely free of mites or any other critters that may harm your hamster. To do so, place the bedding you’ll use in a new Ziploc bag and place it in the freezer for at least 48 hours. Allow the bedding to return to room temperature without the application of artificial heat. Simply leave it on the counter in the bag. Add it to your hamster’s habitat once it has returned to room temp., Believe it or not, there are several types of hamster bedding that are commonly sold, but that may actually harm your hamster. In particular, avoid pine and cedar shavings, and these may splinter into sharp, potentially injurious pieces. Further, these materials may give off toxic fumes when exposed to your hamster’s urine. Finally, avoid “fluffy bedding”, which is made from artificial fibers that your hamster may not be able to safely digest, as well as cat litter, which is also dangerous for hamsters to eat."

Be proactive during the winter.",How to Get a Hamster out of Hibernation," Sometimes it can be hard to tell if your hamster is simply hibernating or if it has actually died. Hamsters in a hibernating state appear still and lifeless; their breathing and heart rate slow down. They even might go weeks without eating. And with such tiny bodies, it can often be difficult to notice the subtle signs of life in a hibernating hamster., During true hibernation, hamsters will move very little. But sometimes they can enter a “sleep” phase of minor hibernation in which they often tremble or nod their head from side to side.Noticing these kinds of movements is a good indication that your hamster is just hibernating.

, During hibernation, your hamster’s breathing will be slower than usual, but not altogether absent. Hold your hamster in your hand and listen closely for breathing sounds. You can also put your finger near their mouth to see if you can detect any exhale breaths., A hibernating hamster will maintain a warm body temperature though it might be slightly cooler than usual. A hamster that is truly dead will lose its body heat completely, so a warm hamster is probably a hibernating hamster., Pick your hamster up and hold it in your hand against your body. Use your body heat to provide warmth for your hamster. Keep holding it for at least 30 minutes and see if there are any changes in their behavior or if they start acting more alert.

, Wrap your hamster in a towel with a water bottle full of hot water. Make sure the hamster is not directly touching the water bottle and doesn’t get too hot. This will help warm his body and bring him out of hibernation., Try placing your hamster on a warm heating pad that is heated to about 90̊ Fahrenheit for 30-60 minutes. This will help your pet warm up quickly and help them come out of their state of hibernation.If you don’t have a heating pad, try putting your hamster on a towel on top of a radiator. This will have the same effect. Just make sure you monitor your pet closely and make sure the heat isn’t too much for it to handle.

, Once your hamster starts becoming more alert, even if only slightly alert, try to give it warm milk through a medicine dropper. You should heat the milk up in the microwave or on the stove but test it first to make sure it is not too hot. It should be tolerable to the touch. Feed it to your hamster in a bowl or in their water dropper container.Alternatively, you can try to give your hamster plain water, water with sugar, or children’s Pedialyte with a medicine dropper.Anything you can do to get them to ingest water is good. Rehydration will help your hamster come out of its hibernation state.

, Sometimes hibernation is triggered by a lack of food or water in order to conserve energy. To avoid sending your hamster into hibernation, ensure that it always has access to plenty of food and water., The bedding in your hamster’s cage will help insulate it and protect it from the cold. Make sure your hamster has sufficient bedding to stave off hibernation. If your hamster starts hibernating, try adding more bedding to prevent this from happening again., Having more body fat will help prevent your hamster from going into hibernation mode. Try feeding your hamster more fattening food items like sunflower seeds, peanuts, or avocado. However, be sparing with the fatty foods because a little goes a long way with tiny hamsters., During the cold winter months, be more mindful of your hamster’s behavior and if it seems warm enough. Maybe give your hamster some extra bedding in its cage during the winter and provide more fatty foods than normal. Keep an eye on your pet to make sure it stays safe and alert during the cold season.

Pick the right cage.,
Clean the cage regularly.,
Choose the right bedding.,
Encourage exercise.",How to Keep a Hamster Healthy1," For starters, you want to make sure you get your hamster the right type of cage. Hamsters require spacious cages. Your cage should be, at minimum, 12 inches wide by 12 inches high by 18 inches long. However, bigger is usually better. If you have more than one hamster, or a larger type of hamster, invest in a larger cage.Hamsters catch colds easily. Therefore, place your hamster's cage in a warm area of your home away from doors or windows that cause drafts. Pick a safe and stable place to keep the cage where it's unlikely to get accidentally knocked over or disturbed.Hamster cages usually come with either plastic or wire bars. However, hamsters are known to chew so keep an eye on the cage's bars to make sure your hamster is not wearing them down. If he escapes, he could get into an accident.You can also get aquarium style cages if your hamster has a habit of chewing through bars. If you go this route, make sure to keep your cage out of direct sunlight. Aquariums heat up easily.;
, You should clean your hamster's cage on a weekly basis. An unclean cage can cause a build-up of bacteria, resulting in illness.


To start, place a few handfuls of bedding in a pet carrier, cardboard box, or other hamster-safe container. Secure your hamster here during the cleaning process. You might also want to add some water and food in case your hamster gets hungry or bored during the process.Throw away all the bedding and droppings. Any toys made of disposable materials like cardboard should also be thrown away. You can wash other toys and your hamster's food and water bowls in warm water and mild dish soap.Take a sponge and scrub down your hamster's cage with mild dish soap or a disinfectant spray. Get everywhere, including the bars or sides of a cage. Remember to rinse thoroughly when you're done. Hamsters chew so you want to make sure all soap or disinfectant is removed.Dry the cage and add a layer of fresh bedding. Replace any cardboard toys or accessories. Place the washed toys, food bowl, and water bottle back in the cage. Now, you can safely return your hamster to his cage., Make sure you choose quality bedding for your hamster. Cedar bedding should be avoided, as it can cause skin irritation for some hamsters. You can find bedding safe for your hamster online or at a local pet store.Never use pine bedding, scented bedding, fluffy bedding, newspaper, cat litter, or corn cob as bedding. These can be harmful to some hamsters.If you're using a litter box for your hamster, make sure the substance you use in the litter box is completely different from his bedding. For example, if you're using a wood-based bedding do not use a wood-based litter. This will discourage your hamster from using his litter box.

, Hamsters are naturally active and need a lot of exercise for their health. Make sure you provide your hamster with a wheel and toys. This way, he can stay active in his cage. A lack of exercise can cause digestive problems and weight gain.


Make sure your hamster has a wheel. Even a big cage does not provide your hamster a lot of room to run around. Therefore, a wheel is essential.You could also invest in a hamster ball, which is a sealable plastic ball you can place your hamster in. This way, he can run around outside his cage.
You should also provide a lot of toys. Plastic tubes and ladders encourage your hamster to climb and explore. Small plush toys and blocks for chewing on can also be fun for your hamster."

Make accommodations as necessary.",How to Determine if Your Hamster Is Blind," Hamsters are naturally very near-sighted. Whereas humans rely primarily on their sense of sight to get around the world, hamsters rely much more on smell and hearing. Just because your hamster doesn't seem to be able to see like a human does not mean anything is wrong., Although it may be difficult to diagnose with any certainty, excessive clumsiness may be a sign that your hamster is going blind. Take notice is he starts walking into things or falling off of things.

, If your hamster's eyes look milky, this is a sign of cataracts. Cataracts usually occur in older hamsters, and they can lead to total blindness.There is no treatment available for cataracts in hamsters, but the condition doesn't cause them any pain.

, If your hamsters eyes seem inflamed or his eyelids are stuck together with a crusty discharge, he may be suffering from a condition called conjunctivitis, but he is most likely not blind. This condition has a variety of causes, including bacterial infection or irritation from a foreign object.You can attempt to loosen your hamster's eyelids by wiping the discharge away with a clean, moist cotton ball.
If your hamster's symptoms continue, you should take him to the vet. He may need to have his eyes flushed with saline, or he may need antibiotics.

, If your hamster's eyeball seems to be protruding from the socket more than usual, he may be suffering from a condition called exophthalmos, also known as proptosis. This is a serious condition that can cause your hamster to lose his eye. Other symptoms include an enlarged eyeball, redness, and watery discharge. This condition requires immediate veterinary care!

, Just like humans, hamsters can develop glaucoma, which eventually leads to blindness. If you hamster has glaucoma, you may notice that he has a strong aversion to light or that his eyes bulge a bit. If you notice these symptoms, take your hamster to the vet. Without treatment, glaucoma can be very painful.
Some hamsters can be treated with medications, while others may need to have their eyes surgically removed.

, You should always bring your hamster to the vet if you believe there is anything wrong with his eyes. If it turns out the be something like a cataract, your vet will not be able to offer any treatment, but if it turns out to be an infection of the eye, treatment is available., If your hamster is blind or is losing his sight, there's not much you can do about it. It may be helpful to know, however, that most hamsters can still live perfectly normal, happy lives even without their vision. Because hamsters have poor vision to start with, they don't rely on it much to get them through their daily lives., Some hamsters may become more skittish or irritable when they become blind, so don't be too alarmed if you notice these behaviors in your hamster., Although most hamsters will do just fine without their eyesight, some may have a harder time adjusting. If you notice that your hamster is becoming very clumsy, take care to remove anything from the cage that might cause injury.

Ask yourself if the stillness is unexpected.,
Consider how old your hamster is.,
Consider the ambient temperature.,
Assess your hamster's access to food and light.",How to Cure Your Not Moving Hamster1," Did your hamster seem ill recently? Clues to this might be that it stopped eating or lost its appetite, it was drinking more than usual and you were having to clean out wet bedding more frequently, it smelled bad, it had lost a lot of weight, or its habits had changed radically, for example it had stopped playing on its wheel. These are all indicators of ill health and could indicate your hamster has died.On the other hand, if the hamster seemed perfectly healthy before hand and this stillness is unexpected, it doesn't rule out death but it makes hibernation more likely.;
, How old is the hamster? An average lifespan is 18-24 months, with the odd hamster making it to 36 months. If your hamster is older than this, then it was very elderly, and the chances of it having passed away increase., Hibernation is temperature dependent. If the air temperature where the hamster was kept is above 20°C then hibernation is not very likely. On a hot day, consider if the hamster's cage is near an air conditioning unit. Air conditioners can kick out extremely cold air, which could cause your hamster to go into hibernation, so don't discount a low air temperature even in sweltering weather.

, Hibernation tends to happen at times when it would be difficult for the hamster to find enough resources to survive. These tend to be associated with harsh winters, when there are low temperatures, short day lengths, and a lack of food.Ask yourself if the hamster has more than 8 - 12 hours of daylight a day and has plenty of food. Scarcity of food teamed with low temperature and short day length could trigger hibernation."

Pick quality hamster food.,
Add fruits and veggies.,
Provide other table foods.,
Consider dietary supplements.",How to Keep a Hamster Healthy2," Your hamster's diet is a major factor in his overall health. Make sure you choose the right food source for your hamster.


You can buy hamster pellets or mixtures of dried seeds and nuts at your local pet store. These are specifically created for hamster consumption so they include the minerals and nutrients necessary for your hamster's wellbeing.Ask your vet how much your hamster should eat each day. Hamsters come in different shapes and sizes and therefore have different dietary needs. Just make sure you put out new food regularly. Stale food can cause digestive problems.It is not advised that you give your hamster wet food unless a vet recommends it. Wet food is usually given to hamsters who are sick or who have digestive problems., Hamsters crave variety in their diet. Supplementing store-bought food with a variety of fresh fruits and veggies is great for your hamster's overall health.


For veggies, try carrots, squash, cauliflower, broccoli, zucchini, romaine lettuce, spinach and other leafy greens.For fruits, go for apples, pears, bananas, grapes, and a variety of berries.Rinse produce under cool, running water before giving it to your hamster., Hamsters also enjoy other table foods. In moderation, it's okay for hamsters to have things like bread, yogurt, seeds, and nuts. However, do not overfeed your hamster. Hamsters tend to go for saltier, fattier snacks before healthier options. If your hamsters eats all his sunflower seeds and doesn't touch his strawberries, do not respond by providing him with more seeds. A balanced diet with a variety of foods is best for your hamster's diet, so he needs to learn to eat all his snacks., If your hamster is a picky eater, you might want to consider offering him nutritional or dietary supplements. You can easily crush supplements and sprinkle them over your hamster's food. However, check with your vet beforehand. You want to make sure this is safe for your hamster and that you're going with a reputable brand."

Check your hamster's nose and eyes.,
Keep an eye on his skin and fur.,
Check his bottom.,
Feel for lumps or bumps.,
Make sure your hamster's weight stays stable.,
Pay attention to water consumption.",How to Keep a Hamster Healthy3," If you want to keep your hamster healthy, you'll need to periodically make sure he's not showing signs of illness. As hamsters are prone to colds and infections, check his nose and eyes on a weekly basis.


Check your hamster's nose. If it's wet or you notice running or discharge, he may have a cold. You should monitor his symptoms for a few days and take him to the vet if he does not improve. Hamsters can catch colds from humans, so avoid handling your hamster if you've been sick.A hamster's eyes should be clean and clear. Unusual discharge or reddish eyes can be a sign of infection. Certain breeds of hamsters, like Winter Whites, get eye infections easily. You should not wait out an eye infection as infections often require antibiotics. Take your hamster to a vet if you notice anything wrong with his eyes.If your hamster is having nose and eye irritation and medical causes have been ruled out, he may be allergic to something in his cage. Remove any new items, like new toys or accessories, and see if symptoms improve. You may also want to try a different bedding or litter., Older hamsters may have bald patches or thinning fur. However, if your hamster is younger his skin and fur should be free of bald patches, scaling, rashes, and scabs. Unexpected hair loss or skin changes should be evaluated by a veterinarian.Skin and hair changes can be the result of something benign, like mites or fleas. However, it can sometimes be a sign of a chronic condition like Cushings Disease. This is why veterinarian evaluation is so important. If skin and fur changes are the result of a serious condition, the sooner you get it checked out the better., If your hamster is experiencing digestive problems, you can tell by examining his rear end. Loose stools, staining, or a wet tail can be an indication of diarrhea. Such ailments should be evaluated by a veterinarian. Your hamster may need a change in diet or he may have an infection or illness that requires medication.Stress can also trigger diarrhea in hamsters. If there have been any recent changes to your home, your hamster may experience diarrhea.If you have a female hamster, an infection of the womb called Pyometra can be detected by examining the rear end. If you notice any discharge or a foul smell from the opening above the anus, take your hamster to the vet for evaluation., You should also periodically pick up your hamster and gently feel for any lumps and bumps. Hamsters are prone to cysts, most of which are benign. However, in rare cases a cyst could be a sign of cancer. In the event a lump is cancerous, the sooner it's treated the better. Any new or growing lumps should be evaluated by a vet.Some hamsters have scent glands on the top of their hips. They're often mistaken for rashes or lumps but are in fact a normal part of your hamster's anatomy., A hamster's weight should remain relatively stable. If your hamster is gaining or losing weight inexplicably, you'll need to take him to the vet.


Hamsters tend to gain weight steadily until they're around 6 months old. After reaching the age of 18 months, hamsters will lose weight each month. Between 6 months and 18 months, your hamster's weight should remain stable.Weight loss or weight gain can be caused by a medical condition or your hamster's diet. Take your hamster to a vet for evaluation if you notice any changes in his weight., Keep track of how much your hamster usually drinks on a day-to-day basis. For example, know roughly how often you refill his water bowl. Hamsters can develop diabetes and one of the early warning signs is an increase in water consumption. If your hamster is suddenly drinking more water, take him to the vet and have him tested for diabetes."
"
Trim teeth and nails regularly.,
Take precautions when introducing a new hamster.,
Get the right wheel.,
Supervise your hamster when you let him out of his cage.",How to Keep a Hamster Healthy4," A hamster's teeth and nails do not stop growing. This is why hamsters need chews and sand to keep their teeth and nails filed down. Occasionally, you may need to have your hamster's teeth or nails trimmed if they become overgrown. Unless you're professionally trained, it's best to take your hamster into the vet when he needs a trim. You want to make sure the procedure is done safely and your hamster is not hurt in the process., Hamsters are not always friendly to new pets. If you're going to introduce a second hamster, do so when your current hamster is still young. Also, do not place a male and female in the same cage unless you want them to breed. Hamsters are very fertile and a female can give birth to 3 to 18 babies every 30 days.If you do add a new hamster, you should spend several days introducing them. Keep your hamsters in separate cages where they can see each other for a few days. When you do place them in the same cage, keep an eye on them to make sure there's no fighting. You might want to wear protective gloves during the introduction. In the event of a fight, you may have to separate the hamsters., As stated, a wheel is an essential part of your hamster's health. However, you want to make sure your hamster's wheel is big enough for safe use. Small wheels can cause back problems from your hamster bending his back to fit the wheel. If you have a larger hamster, go for a bigger sized wheel.At minimum, look for a wheel of at least 6.5 inches. Certain types of hamster, like Syrian hamsters, tend to grow very big. In this case, you should get a wheel that's at lest 8 inches., You should never let your hamster out of his cage unsupervised. If you use a hamster ball or similar device, only allow your hamster to roam in it when you're watching. Accidents and mishaps can occur, resulting in injury and even death. Your hamster should never be allow to roam the house without supervision."
"
Watch your hamster to see if it's breathing.,
Try to detect a heartbeat.,
Ignore body heat as an indicator between hibernation and death.,
Check the hamster's body for stiffness.",How to Cure Your Not Moving Hamster2," If hibernation is a possibility, watch your hamster very closely for several minutes. Look for signs of breathing. Be aware that the whole of the hamster's body systems slow down, so the breathing rate can become as slow as one breath every two minutes.


Watch the hamster for more than two minutes because it's possible to blink and miss that one breath. If you watch for just two minutes, and you could wrongly assume the hamster is dead.

, If you don't see the hamster breathing then feel for a heartbeat. The heart rate of a hamster can slow down significantly. It can be just four beats a minute, or one beat every 15 seconds.It can be difficult to find a hamster's heart beat because they are so tiny. To do this use your forefinger and thumb of one hand and place them on either side of the hamster chest just behind its elbows. Apply gentle pressure, sufficient that you could hold the hamster this way to stop it running away but without hurting it. Wait patiently and feel for a heartbeat against your finger tips.

, Don't worry it the hamster feels cold. This doesn't automatically mean it's dead. The hibernation process is triggered by chilling and its body temperature will drop to match the environment.

, One difference that indicates death is rigor mortis. If the hamster feels stiff and hard like board, then he may have rigor mortis, which is a sign of death.

"
"
Put a hamster that you suspect is hibernating in a warm room.,
Warm the hamster up, relatively rapidly.,
Remember that hibernation is a natural process.,
Remember that hamsters have relatively short lives.,
Prevent the hamster from hibernating in the future.",How to Cure Your Not Moving Hamster3," The room temperature should be around 20°C. Wait for 2 - 3 days. If the hamster is merely hibernating it should wake within that period. If it doesn't wake up, then more obvious signs of death should occur such as an unpleasant odor and rigor mortis. A hibernating hamster should not smell unpleasant.
Experts advocate this as the preferred option of waking a hamster because it closer simulates the natural waking process and places less strain on the body's blood glucose reserves than a ""rapid reboot.""
Make sure plenty of food and water is available for the waking hamster.

, Instead of warming up your hamster slowly in a warm room, you can warm it more rapidly. Put the hamster, in its cage, in a warm place such as an airing cupboard. Depending on the temperature, the hamster may wake within 2 - 3 hours.


Remember to keep the hamster in a secure container, because if it is just in a cardboard box it may wake and chew its way out!
Another idea is to stand the cage on a hot water bottle to radiate heat up through the floor of the cage.
Ensure the hamster has food and water, because it will use up valuable energy reserves to wake up, and these need to be rapidly replaced or the hamster could suffer liver damage.

, If your hamster was hibernating, be aware this is a natural process, from which it recovered. Unless you are concerned, if the hamster is back to hits usual self - eating, grooming, and running in its wheel - there is no specific need to get it checked by a veterinarian.

, If none of your attempts help to wake the hamster up, it has probably passed away. Remember that hamsters generally have very short lives and their time might unfortunately be up. Eliminate all other possibilities first, but then you may need to accept that your hamster has died.

, So that you don't have to suffer this anxiety and worry again, make sure the hamster is always in a room above 20°C, that he has 12 hours + light a day, and plenty of food and water. That way his body never thinks he has to conserve energy and hibernate.

For example, a hamster with respiratory problems may have a thick, mucus-like discharge coming from their eyes and nose.The discharge is opaque or yellow.


If your hamster has a respiratory illness, its eyes and nose may also look red.;
, Respiratory illnesses make breathing difficult for hamsters. Your hamster may wheeze when it breathes, causing its chest to visibly widen and contract with each breath.You may be able to hear the wheezing, along with possible rattling or crackling noises, when your hamster breathes.

, If your hamster has a respiratory illness, it may start sneezing.When your hamster sneezes, you may see discharge come out of its nose.

, A healthy hamster has a shiny hair coat. A hamster with a respiratory illness, though, will have a dull hair coat.If your hamster is sick, its hair coat will lose its natural, healthy sheen.

, In general, hamsters with respiratory illnesses don’t look so good. The sickness will cause your hamster to eat less, leading to weight loss.If your hamster has a respiratory illness, it will look thinner than usual.

, Hamsters with respiratory illnesses can start to shake and shiver.This may be because they’re feeling cold.

, A respiratory illness can make your hamster feel so sick that it doesn’t want to eat much anymore.If you’re concerned that your hamster has lost its appetite, measure the amount of food you feed it each day. At the end of the day, measure the amount of food left over in the cage.


Remember that hamsters tend to hoard food in their cages.If your hamster is showing other signs of respiratory illness, though, you may see leftover food in the cage because your hamster feels sick and doesn’t want to eat—not because it’s hoarding the food.

, Healthy hamsters are very playful and active. If your hamster is sick, though, it won’t feel playful. Instead, it may want to stay curled up in its bedding and not move around very much. Decreased activity may be the first sign of respiratory illness that you see.If your hamster looks sick and stays in its bedding, do not try to force it out to play.

, Sick hamsters can become quite grumpy. For example, if you try to handle your hamster when it is sick, it may bite you.If your hamster seems more nippy than usual, leave it alone in its cage.

, Respiratory illnesses can make hamsters very sick, very quickly. Because hamsters are so small, invading bacteria or viruses can quickly overwhelm a hamster’s immune system. What starts as a little cold can turn into a serious case of pneumonia.When you recognize the signs of respiratory illness in your hamster, call your vet right away to make an appointment.

, When you bring your hamster to your vet, they will observe your hamster in its cage first. Then, they will examine your hamster from head to toe and listen to its heart and lungs. If your hamster is having trouble breathing, your vet will give it extra oxygen before doing the physical exam.

, During the physical exam, your vet will ask you questions about your hamster’s illness. For example, they will ask you what symptoms you observed and when you first noticed them. Also, because respiratory illness can be transmitted from one hamster to the other, and from humans to hamsters, your vet will ask if you or the hamster’s cage mates are sick.Poor housing conditions, such as drafts, can make a hamster sick. Your vet may inquire about your hamster’s living environment.

, Respiratory illnesses in hamsters are caused by bacteria (Pasturella, Streptococcus) and viruses (flu virus).To treat your hamster most effectively, your vet will need to know which specific organism is causing the illness. To do this, your vet will take a sample of fluid from your hamster and analyze it.

, If your vet thinks your hamster has pneumonia, they may want to take x-rays of your hamster’s chest. Chest x-rays would help your vet determine the severity of the pneumonia. X-rays of your hamster’s skull may be helpful, too, to look at the nasal passages.

Recognize the signs.,
Talk to someone who can help.,
Consider your hamster's suffering.,
Prepare your friends and family.",How to Deal With Your Hamster Dying1," There are many reasons that may claim the life of your hamster. Old age, for example, may make your hamster’s eyes go dull. You may notice his fur getting thin. It may make your hamster listless and cause his appetite to disappear. Your hamster may exhibit unusual signs, such as urinating in its nest. , Your parents may be able to offer advice on how to help your hamster. You may be able to talk to an experienced professional, like a vet, for more specific details on how to care for your hamster. She will give you advice on diet, exercise, and care.

Recognize the signs of shock in your hamster.,
Warm up your hamster.,
Move your hamster.,
Take your hamster to your veterinarian.,
Make your hamster’s cage safer.,
Keep a close eye on your hamster during playtime.,
Supervise children who are handling your hamster.",How to Care for Your Shocked Hamster," Shock occurs when the organs in the body are not getting enough blood or oxygen.When you hamster is in shock, he will appear limp and have a dazed look in his eyes.Without good blood circulation, his body temperature will drop. Your hamster will feel cold to the touch,and may also start shivering.Other clinical signs of shock include a rapid pulse and shallow breathing.;
, Before you take your hamster to your veterinarian, try to give him some first aid at home. The best first aid you can give is to his increase his circulation, which will warm him up. Gently pick him up and rub his body slowly.Be gentle when you rub him.Vigorous or forceful rubbing is not necessary to improve his blood circulation.
You should start to feel your hamster’s body warm up as you rub him.

, When your hamster starts warming up (even if he’s still out of it), place him back in his cage and move him to a warm, dark, and quiet area of your home to continue recovering.The quietness of the room will help him recover without being startled by loud noises and other distractions.


Check on him after about 30 to 60 minutes to see if he has improved. If not, take him to your veterinarian for further treatment., Even if your hamster is showing signs of improvement, your veterinarian should still check him out. In addition, if your hamster is seriously injured, your veterinarian will need to treat that injury.Your veterinarian may give your hamster some fluids to improve his circulation.
Depending on the extent of your hamster’s underlying injuries, you may need to give him pain medication to help him recover. Your veterinarian will let you know what type of treatment and medication your hamster will need.

, As much as your hamster likes to run and play, he may play a little too hard and injure himself in his cage. You will need to ‘injury-proof’ your hamster’s cage to prevent the risk of fall or injury.For example, if the cage is multi-level, make sure your hamster has a sturdy ladder or ramp so he can get from one level to the other without falling.


If the cage already has wire ramps or ladders, cover them with a solid material, such as cardboard, laminate flooring, or coroplast, Playtime outside of the cage is important for your hamster. However, he could seriously injure himself when he is outside of his cage. If you have him in his hamster ball, keep him as far away from the stairs as possible!A tumble down the stairs could cause injury serious enough to lead to shock.


Rolling down the stairs in the hamster ball could also knock your hamster unconscious. If he is unconscious and in shock, he will need immediate veterinary care.When your hamster is in the hamster ball, keep him in an enclosed room so there is no chance he could roll near or down the stairs. Another possible solution is to lay a hula-hoop on the ground, and have the hamster ball roll around in that.
If your hamster is allowed to run free in the room, make sure he does not climb on any furniture. He could suffer a serious injury if he jumps or falls from the furniture.

, Often, children can be rough with small pets, such as hamsters, without knowing they are actually hurting the animal. If you have small children, watch them as they handle your hamster.That way, if they are handling him too roughly, you can intervene and place the hamster safely back in his cage.


You could also turn this time into a teaching moment on how to properly hold a hamster.

Check for the signs of wet tail.,
Remove fruits and vegetables from the diet.,
Isolate the sick hamster.,
Take your little friend to the vet.,
Ask the vet to hydrate the hamster if necessary.If the hamster is very dehydrated, ask if the vet recommends giving him an injection of saline under the skin.,
Allow the vet to hospitalize your pet if recommended.,
Give the hamster its medication at home.If the vet doesn’t recommend hospitalization, you need to be attentive to your pet's medical care at home.,
Keep the hamster warm.,
Reduce stress.,
Practice good hygiene at all times during the care period.,
Be prepared to make a difficult decision.",How to Treat Wet Tail1," The hallmark of this condition is wetness around the hamster's tail — hence the name ""wet tail"". However, this is a description rather than a diagnosis in its own right. What we call ""wet tail"" can actually have several different causes, but the result is the same: diarrhea and fluid loss. The following signs indicate wet tail in a hamster:Tail end and sometimes abdomen are wet, matted
The wet area is soiled and smells bad from excessive watery diarrhea
Failure to groom, dull, ruffled coat
Dull, sunken eyes
Abdominal discomfort, which can show itself as grumpiness or aggression
Lethargy, hiding away and being reclusive
Irritability, discomfort, and hunched posture
Protruding rectum caused by straining
Weight loss
Loss of appetite and low energy levels.;
, Before seeing the vet, do not remove all food, but remove fruits and vegetables. Your vet will provide further advice on diet once he’s examined the animal. Dry food ""binds"" the bowels better than fruit and vegetables. More watery foods can encourage diarrhea, so removing fruits and vegetables from the diet can help prevent it.

, Wet tail can be contagious, so it's best to be on the side of caution. Separate your sick hamster from any others you may have to prevent the illness from spreading. The sick hamster may prefer to be left alone anyway, so isolation can reduce its stress levels. Consider asking a trusted friend to care for your healthy hamsters during the recovery period. This will allow you to concentrate on the sick ones. It also reduces stress for yourself and for your hamster.

, The vet will prescribe a course of antibiotics as well as medication to cure diarrhea. Avoid adding antibiotics to food and water. Your hamster probably isn't eating drinking anyway, so this would be an ineffective way to medicate him. If he is drinking, you don't want to discourage this by putting something that tastes strange in the water. If the hamster is very unwell, the vet may give antibiotics by injection to ensure he gets the correct dose.


Because hamsters are so small, it's hard to run diagnostic tests (bloods and imaging) on them. This makes it difficult for the vet to reach a definitive diagnosis of the underlying cause of the illness.

, You can check for extreme hydration by pinching the skin on the back of the neck. Healthy, hydrated skin will snap back immediately. If it takes longer than 2 seconds to return to normal, you should raise concerns of dangerous dehydration.


A saline injection does not always make as much difference as hoped because absorption can be slow when the animal is unwell.

, If the vet is concerned about the hamster's health, defer to his opinion. He may ask you to leave your pet at the clinic so the staff can administer fluids regularly and give additional antibiotics by injection.

, Your vet may prescribe an antibiotic called Baytril to be taken by mouth. This is a very concentrated antibiotic, and the dose is usually one drop per day. The vet may also suggest dripping a balanced electrolyte solution (Lectade or Pedialyte) into the hamster's mouth to keep it hydrated. This needs to be done with great care to avoid flooding the hamster's lungs.


The best way is to give the electrolyte solution is with an eyedropper. Squeeze a single drop of the solution from the dropper and touch it to the hamster's lips.
The surface tension of the solution will cause the drop to soak the hamster's mouth, which it will then lick dry.
This should be done every half-hour to hour, if possible.

, Small mammals like hamsters have a large ratio of surface area to volume. As a result, they can get dangerously cold very easily when they are sick. A hamster's ideal environment should be between 70-80F., Experts believe wet tail to be a stress-related disease, so that's the last thing your buddy needs.Remove any source of distraction or stress from the room where the hamster is resting. This includes other hamsters, barking dogs, inquisitive cats, bright lights, and anything noisy.


Other than removing wet foods from its diet, do not change the usual food unless your vet advises you to. This can cause more stress.
Try not to move the hamster around more than necessary, beyond vet visits and initial isolation. Transportation is a source of stress.

, This is especially important when you have more than one hamster, as sloppiness might spread the infection.


Always wash your hands before and after handling the hamster.
Keep everything clean, including the cage, drink bottle, food dish, and toys.
Clean the cage every 2 or 3 days. Trying to clean it any more often can result in additional stress, which is not good for the hamster's recovery.

, Unfortunately, hamsters often don't respond well to therapy. so if your hamster develops signs, be prepared for the worst and that they might not get better. The success rate for treating wet tail is low, and if the hamster does not rally within 24 - 48 hours then the chances are it won't. If, despite all your efforts, the hamster continues to deteriorate, it may kinder to consider putting your pet to sleep.


Look for dehydration (lifting his scruff and watching it fall back down), lack of activity, lack of response when touched or handled, continued diarrhea, and a foul smell which is getting worse.
If you start treatment and the hamster's condition worsens, at least you gave him a chance. But it may now be kinder to relieve him of his pain and let him go.

Find a good spot.,
Prepare the medicine.,
Restrain the hamster, if need be.,
Administer the medicine.,
Reward your hamster.",How to Feed a Hamster Medicine1," Pick a place where you can safely administer medicine to your ailing hamster. Your hamster might be most comfortable on the floor. Avoid using tabletops or counters, because the animal could fall and be seriously injured. Also make sure that there are no nearby glasses, knives, or other sharp objects.Once you’ve found a spot, begin to set out your materials. This might include the bottle of liquid medicine, an eyedropper or syringe, and a clean towel.;
, Oral medication is usually given to hamsters in liquid form, with a small syringe or dropper. Make sure that you have a dropper as well as the bottle prescribed by your veterinarian.First, read the directions on the bottle of medicine. Look closely for the proper dosage.
Take the bottle of medicine and give it a shake, if need be. Then, open the bottle and insert the dropper.
To draw the medicine, either pull back on the syringe’s plunger or press the dropper’s rubber bulb. This will create suction and fill the plastic tube with medicine.
Make sure that you draw the proper dosage. Hold the tube level and look at the measuring scale to check the amount.

, Some hamsters can be tempted to take medicine right from the dropper, so long as the taste is not too foul.You may have to restrain your pet, however. There are several humane ways that you can do this.


One way is to hold the animal down with the palm of your hand. Gently but firmly cup your palm and put it over the hamster’s body, so that it cannot move and only its head is free.Your other hand will be free to administer the meds.
Use a towel to swaddle the hamster, alternately. Just wrap the animal so that its paws are inside the towel and its head is sticking out. Hold the animal with one hand.
You can also “scruff” the animal. Hamsters have lots of loose skin around the neck and front of the shoulders, which you can grab with your thumb and forefinger.Just be aware that too much tension on the scruff can cause the hamster's eyes to pop out. Have your vet show you a safe way to scruff the hamster before attempting this at home or use a different method.

, Take the dropper with your free hand, while continuing to restrain the hamster. Hold the dropper to the animal’s mouth and, if it licks the tool, gently push the medicine out.


The hamster might not be cooperative. It may squirm and resist. In that case, first try to insert the mouth of the dropper into the side of the animal’s mouth where it has no teeth. Squeeze the medicine out and it will be swallowed.
Do not try to open the hamster’s mouth with your fingers. While this can be done by pulling up at the mouth, making the animal “smile” and exposing gaps, you can also be bitten.

, Taking medicine orally can be an unpleasant experience for your hamster. The liquid may taste bitter, and being restrained is traumatic. Give your pet a reward for good behavior and to help calm it. Things such as Sunflower Seeds or Yogurt Drops sold at pet stores would be rewarding.


A piece of food may also cleanse the palette, if the medicine was bitter.

Start raising the hula hoop.,
Try getting your hamster a ball.,
Advance the stakes.",How to Train Your Hamster to Jump Through a Hoop," It could be a large ring covered in ribbon or a purpose-made one from the pet store. It must be large enough that the hamster can fit through it with ease but not so large the hamster isn't aware of going through an object.;
, Get a treat or push your hamster a little over the hoop. Repeat 1-4 times.


Put a treat on the opposite side from where your hamster is starting. This will encourage your hamster to step through the hoop and eat the treat.

, Now that your hamster is comfortable with walking over the hoop, start raising the hoop and encouraging your hamster to walk through it. Keep the base of the hoop right on the floor, your hamster is still getting used to things. And keep a treat on the other side to encourage walking through the hoop.

, This will help teach your hamster to stretch its body, which can be helpful when you're about to teach the hamster to start jumping up and through the hoop. Spend time rolling the ball away from the hamster and encouraging to chase after it, lunge for it, etc. Again, make use of treats.

, Now it's time to teach your hamster to jump in the air. Raise the hoop just above the floor and hold it in place (or use something to hold it in place). Try giving your hamster treats or calling its name to get it to jump up and through the hoop. You'll need to keep practicing a lot, so have patience and be dedicated.


Do not raise the hoop too high. Your hamster is delicate and shouldn't be landing from any great height. Keep the jump level very small and keep the landing soft, such as a nice soft carpet or a padded surface.

Hold the cloth or swab on the eye.,
Wipe away any crust from the eyelid.,
Open the eye gently.,
Visit the vet if you have any trouble.,
Wash around you hamster's eyes regularly.",How to Help a Hamster With Sticky Eye," One reason your hamster's eye may be watery or closed is that something is stuck in the eye. If this is the case, there won't be any crust present holding the eye closed, so you can gently open your hamster's eye and look. If there is dust or sand in the eye, you can use a Q-tip or similar, dipped in lukewarm water to gently remove the debris. If an object has actually punctured the eye, don't try to remove it or you could cause further damage. Take your hamster to the vet as soon as possible., Animals, as well as humans, can contract conjunctivitis, commonly known as Pink Eye. The condition is usually not harmful to hamsters, but you should still see the vet to make sure your pet heals properly. Schedule a visit to the vet if your hamster exhibits the following symptoms.A watery eye discharge. This may become more pus-like as time goes on.
Sticky eyelids.
Swollen eyes.
Redness around the edge of the eyelids.

, It is possible for the eyeball to actually protrude from a hamster's head. It can occur from an infection or trauma. This is a serious condition that requires veterinary attention as soon as possible. Don't waste time if you see this condition in your hamster. The faster you get to the vet, the better the chances you can save the eyeball., You'll want to avoid hurting your hamster while cleaning out the eye. Being too rough while handling him for this procedure can cause injury that will require veterinary attention. Pick him up gently and don't start cleaning until he's settled down. Be sure the hamster is comfortable and has stopped struggling before you start cleaning out his eye.

, Either of these objects will work, as long as you use lukewarm water. Make sure the water isn't hot, or you could burn your hamster and cause damage to the eye. , You shouldn't abruptly pull the eye open. The crust associated with the sticky eye will be holding the eye shut, and pulling it apart can cause damage. Instead, you have to break down and soften the crust that is keeping the eye shut. You can do this by holding the wet cloth over your hamster's eye for a few minutes. This will help loosen up the eyelid. He may even be able to open his eye on his own after this without any further help. Try two minutes of this before taking any further action., After you've held the cloth over your hamster's eye for a few minutes, the crust should be soft and loose. Now you can gently brush it away from his eyelid without hurting him.If the crust doesn't come away easily, don't force it or you could hurt the hamster. Instead, go back to holding the cloth on the crust and let it loosen further.

, If a few minutes go by and your hamster is still unable to open his eye by himself, you'll have to open it manually. After wiping away the crust, it should be easy to open the eye. Gently pull the lids apart until your hamster is able to open his eye on his own.Remember to stop right away if you have any difficulty doing this. Go back to holding the cloth over the eye and wiping away crust, then try again.

, If you can't get the eye open or suspect that anything else may be wrong, don't hesitate to go to the vet. If there is a problem, catching it early is key for your hamster's health.

, If your hamster is prone to sticky eyes, you can prevent the problem with regular washing. Take a wet cloth and gently wipe around the eye to get rid of any fluid buildup. This will prevent crusting and help keep your hamster's eyes from getting stuck together. You should especially do this if your hamster is getting old since older hamsters are more prone to the problem."

Consider the hamster’s breed.,
Keep an eye on young hamsters.,
Don’t over-handle newly weaned hamsters.,
Be aware of gastrointestinal disturbances.Adult hamsters tend to develop the symptoms if the balance of microorganisms in their guts is disturbed.,
Take the hamster’s other conditions into consideration.It may well be that the gastrointestinal problems arise not from disturbances like stress or diet, but from an underlying medical condition.",How to Treat Wet Tail2," Dwarf hamsters can get severe diarrhea, but they do not get wet tail. Long-haired teddy hamsters, on the other hand, seem to be the most prone to wet tail.Ask your breeder or veterinarian about your breed’s risk of wet tail when purchasing hamsters, so you know your pet’s risks.

, Very young hamsters between 3 - 8 weeks of age seem especially vulnerable to an infection. This is likely because their immune systems are still developing, and aren't very good at fighting off bugs yet. Research suggests that most the bacteria most likely to case wet tail is the Desulfovibrio species., The most easily affected hamsters seem to be weaned baby hamsters up to the age of 8 weeks.Always give new hamsters time to adjust to their new surroundings before handling them too much. Otherwise, you might stress them out too much and contribute to wet tail conditions.


Give new hamsters about a week to settle in before handling them often.
It is also a good idea to isolate them during this time, as wet tail can be incubating for 7 days before the symptoms appear., This lets a bacterium called clostridium overwhelm the gut, causing diarrhea and wet tail symptoms. Factors which can trigger the initial gastrointestinal disturbance include:


Stress (for example, from an overcrowded cage or from fear of a predator like a house cat)
Change of diet
Certain antibiotics given by mouth for other illnesses

, Conditions like irritable bowel syndrome or bowel cancer can be contributing factors to wet tail.

Measure the proper dosage.,
Dissolve the medicine in water.,
Dissolve the medicine into food, alternately.,
Be cautious if administering antibiotics.",How to Feed a Hamster Medicine2," Medicine in food or water is easier to administer to your hamster but, at times, less effective. On one hand, you’re “hiding” the meds and do not have to handle the animal. On the other, it is hard to keep track of consumption, and the animal might taste the medicine and avoid eating or drinking.Take the medicine bottle and measure out the correct amount with a small dropper.
Again, follow your veterinarian’s instructions and be sure you have the exact dosage. Hamsters are small animals and can easily overdose., If the veterinarian has suggested it, you might be dissolving meds into your hamster’s water supply. Take the animal’s water bottle from the cage and open it.


Fill the bottle with water and add the medicine from the dropper. You will need to make sure that the meds are fully dissolved and well-mixed and that they are changed daily.Use only purified, de-ionized water. No tap water.Monitor your pet closely once you have returned the bottle to the cage. Make sure that the animal continues to drink normally.

, Place the proper amount of drops onto a piece of your hamster’s food and then offer the food to the animal. You might place it directly into the cage, or you can tempt the hamster with the treat from your hand.


Hamster pellets are small. It might take you quite a few of them to administer the medicine, depending on the dosage.
Bribing the animal with a special, medicine-laced treat – like cottage cheese or baby food – is another idea. Put a small amount of food with the full dose on the spoon, and let the animal eat until it is gone.

, Hamsters are sensitive to anti-biotics, which change the microbial balance of the animal’s intestines and can kill it. If the vet has prescribed antibiotics, follow her instructions to the letter.Give the hamster a small amount of white, live-culture yogurt (1/10 of a teaspoon) twice per day if you are administering antibiotics, once in the morning and again in the evening. Do so for the duration of the therapy and for another 5-7 days.The yogurt will help to replace the intestinal bacteria that your hamster loses because of the antibiotics.

Get instructions from your vet.,
Prepare your site and supplies.,
Draw the medicine.,
Restrain the hamster.,
Administer the shot.",How to Feed a Hamster Medicine3," Although giving medicine orally is easier and less expensive, “parenteral administration,” i.e. a shot, is often a more effective method. Your vet will tell you if this is the best way. Also, some medicines can’t be given to hamsters orally.Ask the doctor for step-by-step instructions if you have to give the shot yourself. It is not particularly hard, but you must be able to do it correctly.
Try to have the vet write down the instructions on paper, if possible. This will allow you to refresh your memory at home.

, Beforehand, take the syringe and other supplies to draw out the correct dosage of medicine. Besides the syringe you will need the vial of meds the vet gave you, an alcohol pad, and a needle or sharp. Like before, set up shop in a safe place.


Read the instructions closely before going ahead. As always, you must be careful to get the right amount to avoid an overdose.
Take the cap off the vial and wipe the top with an alcohol pad to sterilize it.

, Hold the syringe in your hand like a pencil and take the protective cap off the needle. Pull back the plunger to the line on the scale for your dosage. This will fill the tube with air.Next, hold the vial right side up, push the needle through the rubber top, and push out the air. Doing so will keep a vacuum from forming.
Turn the vial upside down so that the needle is in the medicine. Then, pull back on the plunger to your dosage amount. Remove any trapped air bubbles by tapping on the syringe with your fingers, and gently push the plunger to expel them from the tube.
Remove the needle from the vial. Keep it sterile. If you have to set the syringe down, be sure to cover the needle with the protective cap.

, Carefully and gently take your pet from the cage. You may want to clear out obstacles like exercise wheels and food dishes, so that the animal cannot evade you. The best way to give a shot to a hamster is by scruffing.


Again, gently pinch the scruff between your thumb and forefinger and pull it taut. Then, turn the animal over while supporting its body with your palm. The hamster should be immobilized.

, Take the syringe with your free hand and remove the protective cap. Hold the animal steady and prepare to deliver the medication.


For a shot into the body cavity (called an intraperitoneal injection), wipe the lower left part of the abdomen with the alcohol wipe and let it dry.
Tip the animal so that its nose is pointing down a bit and insert the needle at a 30 degree angle in the sterilized area. Push the plunger to inject the medicine and then remove the needle.For a shot under the skin (called a subcutaneous injection), lightly pull up the skin over the injection site to make a small pocket. Sterilize the pocket with alcohol and insert the needle.
Retract the plunger. If you see any blood or fluid, reposition the needle. Repeat. When you have found a good site, push the plunger to inject the medicine and remove the needle.Return the animal to its cage when you are done.

Make sure that your hamster is familiar with your scent and voice.,
Get a sunflower seed or any other delicious treat that you know your hamster likes.,
Move your end at the end of your hamster's cage, opposite of where it is sitting.,
When your hamster comes to your hand, let it take the treat and eat it.

,
Repeat the above steps several times.,
After the hamster comes to your hand several times in a row, repeat steps above, except without the treat.,
Wash your hands to remove any germs or odors that may hurt or scare your hamster.,
Place a treat in the palm of your hand.

,
Hold your hand at the end of the cage, opposite of where your hamster is sitting.,
As the hamster comes towards you for the treat, repeat its name several times in a slow and clear manner.,
Repeat the steps above, but move the treat a little farther from your hamster each time.,
Soon, you can start calling it towards you without a treat.",How to Train Your Hamster to Come when You Call," Wash your hands before and after handling your hamster, as strong odors on your hands might alarm the hamster. Certain scents will cause the hamster to flee. Plus, washing your hands well before handling your hamster will make sure you aren't introducing any germs to it that might cause its health to go down.

, Place it in the palm of your hand.

, Slowly move your hand up and down to get the smell of the treat to your hamster's nose more effectively. This will make sure it knows there is a treat at the other end.


Keep in mind that some hamsters - such as the dwarf varieties - will consider movements a threat and either run for safety or bite! Hand movement should be slow and non-threatening.
If your hamster appears frightened by you, stop moving.

,, However, have your hand closed over the treat the next few times so your hamster can't tell whether you have a treat in your hand or not.

, After a while, the hamster should come when you hold out your hand.

, Again, this is best for its health and safety.;
,, Let it know you have a treat in your hand by slowly moving your hand up and down to get the scent towards it.

, Make sure you don't mumble or say its name too fast; otherwise, the hamster might not understand.

, Also, close your hand around the treat so that it can't see it.


If your hamster shies away at the thought of coming any closer, move your hand back to where it originally was and patiently work your way farther and farther. However, don't move too far at once!

, When it comes to you, give it a stroke or cuddle. However, keep in mind that if you continually do this and never give it a treat again, your hamster may refuse to respond or come to your any more. Give your hamster treats frequently, but not all the time.

When you bring your hamster home, leave it alone for a couple of days.,
Get your hamster used to the sound of your voice.,
Provide digging opportunities.,
Put a sunflower seed or a hamster treat in your hand.,
Teach your hamster some tricks.,
Do the same thing with other tricks like ""paw"".,
For ""turn"" or ""roll over,"" put the treat on its backside.,
Train your hamster about what not to do.,
Teach your hamster how to jump.,
Teach your hamster to climb up your shoulder.,
Use the ""find"" trick.,
Try giving the hamster a carrot as a treat.",How to Train Your Hamster," This will give your hamster the space needed to get comfortable with its new habitat. The space allowed will teach your hamster that you won't push it into doing something it doesn't want to do.


Make sure that your hamster's food dish has food when you put it in the cage.
Make sure the hamster's cage is at least 360 square inches (2232.6 square centimeters). If it is any smaller, it can induce aggression and a lot of bar chewing caused by boredom. (Remember: bigger is always better!)
Do not leave your hamster in his ball (if you have one) for too long since the balls have a bad air circulation and also the hamster might go to the bathroom in the ball. The urine will leak through the cracks, making a mess, and it will soak into your hamster's fur (which could cause illness or health problems).;
, You may be able to do this by reading a book or quietly singing a song to it. This will make it feel more comfortable and secure when it hears your voice.


Make a sound such as a clucking with your tongue, whenever you interact. Always make this sound when giving food so it will know it's you!
Pet your hamster and spend time once or twice a day for 5 minutes or longer with it so your hamster can get used to you, a good idea is to increase the time you spend with them from small amounts to get them used to you and then longer when they get more comfortable with your presence.
Let your hamster crawl on you and your clothing so it can start to get used to your scent. A tip is to rub their bedding on you too, as they then will associate your smell with safety.
To get it used to your scent, cut an old pair of your cotton underwear -- unlaundered so it has your scent -- into 2"" squares. Add a square with their bedding for it to take to its nest.

, Get a box a little bigger than the size of a sticky note then fill it with sand. Have the hamster's bedding level with the box so it will be able to climb onto it. Then, the hamster will be able to dig. This isn't a trick but it's a nice way of letting your hamster enrich its own play.

, Lay it flat in the cage. Wait patiently for your hamster to climb on your hand and take the treat. When the hamster climbs on your palm, slowly lift it out of the cage and stroke its fur. This teaches it that you love the hamster and it can trust you. Eventually it will climb on your hand and will be waiting for you to pick it up.

Be prepared to do this for about an hour.
Your hamster might grab your finger instead and bite it. Be prepared for this possibility and do not scold the hamster; learn to move your fingers quickly out of the way. A way to avoid it biting you is by taking your hamster to the bathtub and let it crawl around on you so it will get used to your scent. After a while it will be used to you and your scent.

, This will not only help you both to bond, but it will make your hamster respond to you better.


Start simply with ""stand"". Hold a treat over its head and wait for it to stand on two legs. Say ""stand"" over and over. It will get on two feet and take the treat. After a while when you say ""stand,"" it will do this standing trick on it's own. Don't forget to reward your hamster!







, Instead, put the treat in front, so it will put a paw forward to get the treat.

, He will turn around to get it. Then do the same thing as ""stand"". Say it and repeat it. Don't use treats until after the trick has been performed and now you have a trained hamster.

, If it chews on something it's not supposed to, respond with a firm ""No"". Whenever your hamster does what you ask, give it a reward! Try not to make the reward a treat all the time because too many treats are a bad thing.


If your hamster is always angry, trying to bite you or not cooperating, then use a hamster ball or something interesting that it will be attracted to. Let it play until it is happy or excited, then let it on your hand.
Never stroke or try to hold your hamster when it is eating, washing itself, sleeping, etc. because sometimes it will get annoyed by the interruption and bite.

, Put a treat up above the hamster and go up with the treat. When it is standing, say ""jump"" again and again. Continue until the hamster associates the word with the jumping action.

, Place it on your shoulder to get comfortable. Do that for a few days. Then, place a treat under your shirt and hold your arm out to it. The hamster will go up to your shoulder looking for treats. Eventually you will not have to put treats under your shirt and it will go up voluntarily.


Don't put your hamster on your shoulder if it is uncomfortable!

, Make a maze, out of anything. Ensure that it has no cracks. Put a treat anywhere in the maze (randomly placed). Put your hamster in the maze and say ""find"". Do this for one hour every day. Fairly soon, the hamster will look when you say ""find"" without you putting a treat. Reward the hamster after 3 minutes in the maze.


Make sure your hamster sees you put the treat in the maze!

, Most hamsters like carrots. Do not give carrots to your hamster often, but only once in a while. Your hamster will appreciate a new treat. Hamsters also like plain Cheerios, but do not feed your hamster Honey Nut Cheerios. It contains enough sugar that makes your hamster sick.


Hamsters love it when you give them sunflower seeds, fresh fruits and vegetables as treats for being good.
Vary the treats you give your hamster and how much - to keep it interested!

Do not be surprised if your hamster uses the litter box to urinate only.,
Replace the litter with fresh litter once a day.",How to Potty Train a Hamster," You can buy a litter box for your hamster at your local pet store or online. Most commercial litter boxes are triangular in shape to fit into the corner of the hamster’s cage or rectangular to fit against the side of the cage.The litter box may come with a lid or a cover to keep the smell inside the box. Some litter boxes also come as pans with high corners and no lid.;
, If you want to save money and make your own litter box, you can repurpose a glass dish or bowl. Glass litter boxes are good because your hamster cannot chew on them and they can be rinsed out pretty easily.Look for a glass dish or bowl that is a little bit bigger than your hamster, with high walls. Depending on how big your hamster is, a one-pint or ½ pint glass jar may work.

, Another option is to use a clean, plastic tupperware that is a little larger than your hamster. Make sure the tupperware comes with a lid.Use scissors to cut a 2 to 3 inch hole on one side of the container, about 1 inch above the bottom of the container. This will ensure the litter does not get out of the litter box and all over the cage.
You may want to sand down the edges of the hole so there are no sharp points that could scratch your hamster.
Keep in mind though plastic litter boxes are easy to make, your hamster may chew on it and you may have to replace it more often than a glass litter box.

, A cardboard box, like a tissue box, can act as good, cheap litter boxes. Once it is used, you can throw it away and replace it with a new box. The cardboard will also help to soak up the urine so the sand in the litter box does not get wet.However, your hamster will likely chew the box quickly and you will need to replace the litter box on a constant basis. Cardboard may be a good temporary option, rather than a permanent solution for a litter box for your hamster.

, Sand is a good option for litter as your hamster will enjoy peeing on it and digging in it. It is also inexpensive, as chinchilla sand often comes in 1.5 pound bags for $5-$8. Most hamsters also tend to avoid eating the sand and enjoy the texture of going to the bathroom on the sand.Some hamsters enjoy rolling in the sand and it can get all over the cage. Sand does not keep the smell of urine down do you will need to change it often.

, Critter Litter is a commercial product that is made of non-toxic materials and is highly absorbent. It also helps to keep the smell in the litter box down and keeps the surface of the litter dry. It is easy to scoop out of the litter box.Critter Litter can be a more expensive option, especially if you have more than one hamster in the cage at a time. If your hamster pouches the litter in his mouth and continues to eat it, it could lead to health issues. So, if your hamster tends to eat and chew the items in his cage, this may not be an ideal option.
Do not use cat litter for the litter box, as it can cause respiratory issues for your hamster., Paper pellet litter can be found at your local pet store. You can also make your own paper litter by tearing up sheets of the newspaper into small strips or pellets. Paper litter absorbs urine well, does not smell, and is easy to clean out., Rather than select a spot for the potty yourself in your hamster’s cage, let your hamster show you where he would like the potty to go. He will do this by going to the bathroom in a specific corner in his cage. Place the potty in his designated spot.This is an important step, as your hamster may ignore the potty if you simply place it at random in his cage. He may end up going in his designated spot, not in the potty.

, Put enough litter to cover the bottom of the litter box. Then, add a little bit of the soiled bedding from the cage as well as a few droppings. The droppings and the soiled bedding will signal to your hamster that is it okay to go to the bathroom in the litter box., Once your hamster is awake and moving around in his cage, put him in the litter box. He will sniff the box and try to determine what is going on.Allow your hamster to explore the litter box and avoid forcing your hamster to stay in the potty. Let him investigate and get comfortable in the box. Most hamsters will eventually understand the litter box is for going to the bathroom after some time in it.

, To ensure your hamster uses the litter box for the bathroom and not for sleeping or eating, make sure he has a separate sleeping space and a separate eating space in his cage.Your hamster may not like his current sleeping area if he ends up sleeping in the litter box. Check that there is enough space in the cage for him to eat, sleep, and go to the potty in his litter box.
You should also note if the cage is rather large and your hamster is using more than one corner to go to the bathroom. You may need to add another potty to his other go to corner so he gets comfortable using the litter box.

, Some hamsters end up using their litter box for urinating only, and will defecate outside of the potty in their cage. The upside is that their pellets usually do not smell and can be easily picked up and flushed down the toilet., Maintain the litter box so it is appealing to your hamster by replacing the litter with fresh litter on a consistent basis. Try to toss out the soiled litter once a day, rinse or wash the litter box, and add new litter so the litter box stays fresh for your hamster.

Choose the right size rope.,
Set up the tightrope.Tie a rope between two solid, heavy objects.,
Place a layer of soft bedding below the tightrope.Even though you’re placing the rope at a low elevation, it’s best to be extra cautious to prevent your mouse from suffering an injury.,
Ensure your pet will not escape.",How to Train a Hamster or a Mouse to Walk on a Tightrope1," For mice, the rope should be at least 24 inches (61 cm) long and have a circumference of one inch (two centimeters).This will give the mouse an adequate distance when making its tightrope walk and provide enough width for its little feet. For a hamster, you might want to use a pet leash with flat (not curved) sides about one inch (two centimeters) wide. The flatter, wider surface is important for successfully teaching your hamster this trick, as it cannot walk across a thin wire or string.


Alternately, you could try to walk your hamster across a balance beam by laying a chair with smooth, flat-sided legs about one inch (two centimeters) wide on its side, and encouraging your hamster to walk across it.
Do not buy a rope of sisal. It might make your mouse sneeze.;
, The rope should not be very high off the ground. A height of three to five inches is sufficient. This way, if your mouse or hamster falls, it will not be injured. Pull the objects away from one another until the rope is tight.


Tying a rope between two table or chair legs is a good option.
Each end of the tightrope should have a small ledge or platform from which the mouse or hamster can ease itself onto the tightrope, and onto which it can step once it has traveled the entire length of the rope.

, With something soft below your tightrope, you’ll ensure that your mouse or hamster isn’t hurt if it falls. You could use several pillows or fluffy blankets to pad the area below the tightrope., Mice and hamsters are quick little creatures. They can easily slip under the crack beneath a door, or disappear through an open ventilation duct. Ensure that the room in which you’re training your pet is secure and offers no opportunities for escape.If that happens, not only will you be sad, but your mouse or hamster will be in danger of being stepped on or caught by a cat.


Stuff blankets into the crack beneath your door.
Think like a mouse or hamster. Get down on the ground before training your mouse or hamster to walk on a tightrope and look for gaps, cracks, and other areas into which your mouse could escape. Take action to seal these exits appropriately.
If you’re worried, you could invest in an infant playpen with solid sides. These are square or rectangular open-topped structures designed to keep babies confined, but they could just as easily serve to keep your mouse or hamster within a safe area.

Repeat until your are satisfied.

,
So now you know a few basic tricks!",How to Teach a Hamster Tricks," Teaching a hamster will NOT work if the hamster is scared of you. Get to know your hamster by giving it treats daily from your hand until it will come out of its house and explore your hand for treats when you put your hand down, palm up, into the cage.;
, Many people say that dwarf hamsters are not smart enough to do tricks and are likely to bite, but despite common beliefs, dwarf hamsters are surprisingly compatible and intelligent. If you hamster is a very grouchy one, you may want to reconsider teaching it tricks as it will probably get impatient and slouch away. If you hamster is very hyper, it will take more patience from you to get it to know what you want it to do.

, Training your hamster to do tricks will take lots of patience and plenty of treats. Here's a hint - have a good supply of treats in store before you start to train!

, This trick is the easiest to do, but will still take a few weeks of training. Simply hold the treat above your hamster so that he/she knows its there. It will stand up and sniff the air, then try to reach for it. Lower the treat so that it's at eye-level with the hamster, but before the hamster can get it, move the treat in a circle, while saying the training word(s), i.e. ""Do a circle!"" or ""Turn around!"" Keep it short and simple. The hamster should follow the treat around in a circle. Then give the hamster the treat.

,,,, If the hamster does not turn around, go back to step 4 for a few more days. If it does turn around, give it the treat right away. Do this again until you can hold your finger above the hamster, say the training word(s), and it will turn in a circle. Once you are satisfied with the hamster's abilities, make sure that you reward it with a treat.

, This one will take a little longer to do than the Circle, but it is much more impressive as well. Cut out a cardboard or plastic hoop large enough that the hamster can climb or jump through with plenty of room to spare. Hold the hoop in the cage. Hold the treat on the OTHER side that the hamster is on. Most likely, your hamster will trundle around the hoop to get to the treat. When this happens, push the hoop in front of the hamster so that it has no choice but to go through the hoop.

, Be sure that you repeat this trick as many times as you can over the past week, reviewing whatever other tricks you have taught it.

,, This trick is easy to teach, and very practical when cleaning out a hamster's cage, or getting it back in the cage after the cleaning. The point of the trick is for the hamster to go wherever you tap your finger.

, It's easiest to start by tapping on a corner of the cage, easily accessible for your hamster to get to. The hamster should run inquisitively over and see what it is. Immediately reward your hamster with the treat that you should be holding in your OTHER hand, so that the hamster doesn't just come over for the treat.

,, Be creative and teach your hamster new ones after you get the hang of the overall training sessions! And don't forget to show off your pet to your friends! ;)

, When your dwarf is in its cage, open the door and call its name while holding something tasty. For example, use a treat of one sunflower seed or a raisin.

, Then give it the treat.

,, That way, if it bites you, it will not hurt. Eventually the hamster will trust you enough that you can take the gloves off and it won't bite.

, During feeding, use your hamster's name.

, After about a month of getting used to you calling its name, see if someone else can get the hamster to come forward at the call of its name. Have your friend or family member do this a few times a week over several weeks, until the hamster responds well to someone else too. Be persistent, as this can take some time to work.

In fact, most cages are instead meant to house smaller animals like hamsters and gerbils.Unlike other animals, guineas pigs need floor space, not vertical space. They need ample room to move around and exercise in order to stay healthy.
A cage that is too small for a guinea pig can cause the animal to become bored and depressed. Imagine if you had to spend your entire life living in a closet with little room for activity and stimulation.
Guinea pig cages that are too small have also been linked to the development of certain medical conditions. They are more likely to get pododermatitis (the equivalent of bed sores, but on their hocks) as a result of sitting still on soiled bedding.
Larger cages are also better if you have more than one guinea pig so that each pet can have its own personal space.
Larger cages also have benefits for you as well! They're easier to clean because they enable guinea pigs to separate their ""bathroom"" space from their other living areas.;
, Typically, the recommended standard cage size is about 2 square feet per guinea pig. However, this is insufficient, as there is not enough room for everything a guinea pig needs, including food, water dish, nest, and bathroom area. Instead consider the following guidelines, which provide more space and consider the number of pigs in the cage:1 guinea pig - 7.5 square feet (0.75m2) minimum size. More is advised. Aim for a cage that is 30"" x 36"" (75cm x 100cm).

2 guinea pigs - 7.5 square feet (0.75m2) cage (minimum). However, 10.5 square feet (1m2) is advised. Aim for a cage that is 30"" x 50"" (75cm x 125cm).

3 guinea pigs - 10.5 square feet (1m2) cage (minimum). However, 13 square feet (1.25m2) feet is advised. Look for a cage that is 30"" x 62"" (75cm x 165cm).

4 guinea pigs - 13 square feet (1.25m2) cage (minimum). However, more space is advisable and you should look for a cage about 30"" x 76"" (75cm x 200cm).

, Where you place the cage in your home is very important. For sanitary reasons, avoid keeping the cage in or very near to the kitchen. You'll need to consider several factors in order to determine the right spot, including:Temperature - Make sure to keep your guinea pig cage away from extreme temperatures because the animals don't like very cold, warm and humid temperatures and can become ill. The ideal temperature for a guinea pig cage is about 65-75℉ (18-24℃). Keep the cage away from drafty spaces like doors and windows and place it on an elevated surface.Activity - Guinea pigs enjoy being near family activity and benefit from more attention when they’re easy to see and hear. A family room or living room works well, but make sure your pigs have a place to retreat if they need some quiet time.Noise - Guinea pigs have very sensitive hearing and their cages should not be placed next to stereos, televisions or other loud noises., Put the cage in an area in your home where you can supervise interactions between your children and the guinea pig so that your guinea pig does not escape or get injured. Similarly, keep your pig safe from any pets (especially cats and dogs) by keeping the cage inaccessible to curious pets., Some people choose to keep guinea pigs indoors, where they are safe from extreme weather and predatory animals, while others prefer to keep them in outdoor hutches.If you choose to keep your guinea pig indoors, attempt to get your pet out into the sunshine regularly to aid Vitamin D synthesis for healthy bones and teeth. If you have an outdoor hutch, the guinea pig requires daily attention from the owner. Bring your pet inside in extremes of weather.In addition, guinea pigs are social animals and thrive when they are able to interact with humans. Keeping them outdoors limits opportunities for daily socialization.

, Do not use cedar or pine shavings as bedding, even though these are widely available as bedding for small pets. These materials have phenol, which can be harmful to guinea pigs. Instead, buy bedding made of paper or straw, as it retains heat and keeps the pig warm. Guinea pigs like to burrow into their bedding and make tunnels. Make sure to provide about 2-3 inches worth of bedding, so that there is sufficient absorption.Change bedding weekly and spot clean daily if it becomes wet or sodden. Guinea pigs prefer clean, dry bedding.

, To keep your guinea pig healthy and happy, make sure to provide it with clean, fresh water. In general, a sipper bottle is a better option than a water dish because it doesn't spill as easily or become soiled with other material in the cage (such as food bedding, etc.).Look for a 32 ounce glass water bottle. You can also purchase a plastic bottle, which is more easily available in most pet stores. Place the bottle so that it hangs off the side of the cage and it easily in reach of your guinea pig.
Provide your guinea pig with fresh water every day (even if the bottle hasn't been drained). Wash the bottle each week when you clean the cage. You might want to use a bottle brush to scrub the bottle in case there are any hard-to-remove particles or substances. You can also use a Q-Tip to clean the nozzle of the water bottle to make sure that the sipper works properly and is not blocked.

, Like all animals, guinea pigs need sustenance to survive. Try to choose a ceramic food bowl, rather than a plastic bowl. Ceramic dishes are harder to topple and are chew-resistant. They're also more durable than plastic bowls.Choose a wide and shallow bowl that will allow the guinea pig to put its front feet on the rim of the bowl. This is typically how guinea pigs like to eat.
Make sure the food bowl is placed far away from its bathroom area for sanitary reasons.
Clean the bowl as needed if your pet kicks bedding or droppings into it.

, Though guinea pigs rarely overeat, you need to provide them with the right balance of pellets, hay, and fresh vegetables.Hay - Hay is key to your guinea pig's diet. Hay provides a key source of fiber and serves both serves as food and bedding. It also aids the digestive systems of guinea pigs. Choose fresh bags of timothy hay, although orchard hay is also an option.Pellets - To make sure that your guinea pig gets all of the nutrients it needs, provide it with a commercial feed specifically for guinea pigs. Give a small amount of extruded pellets (all the nuggets look the same) about a teaspoon a day. Pellets should come second to hay, which they need to chew to keep their teeth from growing out of control. Getting all of their calories from pellets will lead to overgrown teeth, or cause them to become obese. Purchase pellets made from timothy hay, rather than alfalfa hay. These pellets will be fortified with vitamin C, but since it degrades once the package is opened, it's important to supplement with vegetables high in vitamin C.Vegetables - Veggies are a key source of vitamin C for guinea pigs and give them additional nutrients. They also help vary your pet's meal choices and make eating more exciting. Try to choose leafy greens like kale, mustard greens, spinach, and romaine lettuce, because these are high in vitamin C. Other fresh veggie options include bell peppers, brussel sprouts, carrots, cucumbers, peas, and tomatoes, among others. Try experimenting and seeing what your guinea pig likes! Note that some vegetables can cause gas build-up guinea pigs' digestive system and should be fed only in small quantities and from time to time. These include bok choy, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and collard greens.Fruits - Guinea pigs love fruit! Try to choose fruits high in vitamin C, like cantaloupe, strawberries, kiwi, and papaya. However, because fruit is high in sugar, provide it only in limited quantities and just a few times per week. Fruit should never amount to more than 10% of your guinea pig's diet.Use caution when feeding your guinea pig apples as the acid in apples can sometimes cause allergic reactions (look for sores and scabs around your pig's mouth).

, Because a guinea pig's diet includes a large amount of fresh produce means that you have to be checking the cage constantly and removing anything that is uneaten and can perish or decompose. A good rule of thumb is to check for unfinished food about an hour after you've put them in the cage.Be sure to supplement the pellets with produce high in vitamin C. Once the bag of food is opened the vitamin C starts to degrade, so it's important not to rely solely on formulated food to provide vitamin C. Similarly, make sure to check the milling date of guinea pig pellets. Dispose of any remaining pellets after three months past this date.

, Certain foods can cause digestive problems in guinea pigs. One way to tell if a food is adversely affecting your guinea pig is if you notice it producing soft stools or even diarrhea. In general, avoid feeding your guinea pig dairy products, beans, garlic, raw and dried lentils, onions, potatoes, and rhubarb.Avoid chewy and sticky foods, such as peanut butter, which can cause your guinea pig to choke. Other choking hazards include nuts and seeds.
Avoid foods with sharp edges, like crackers or chips, because these can puncture your guinea pig's mouth.
Avoid feeding your guinea pig all processed and junk foods, including chocolate and candy.
Commercial treats aren't needed if you're feeding your guinea pig the right mix of pellets, hay, and fruits and vegetables. If you want to give your pig a special treat, you could mix some rolled oats into the pellets., Cages should be spot-cleaned everyday and completely cleaned once a week.Everyday make sure your remove any uneaten food and provide fresh water. Clean out any food pellets or droppings that aren't where they should be.
Once a week you should replace the dirty bedding and thoroughly clean out the cage. Remove everything inside and scrub the bottom of the cage with warm water. Make sure to dry everything before adding fresh bedding. Clean the cage completely once a week by replacing dirty bedding and scrubbing the bottom of the cage with warm water. Be sure everything’s dry before adding fresh bedding.

, Wooden blocks or cardboard boxes are good choices because guinea pigs like to gnaw on things; guinea pigs' teeth never stop growing, meaning that chew toys can help keep the teeth at a comfortable length. You can easily find wooden blocks at pet stores like Petsmart. Be sure to avoid purchasing wooden blocks or other toys with any paint on them.You can also make homemade toys using items around the house, including paper bags, boxes, toilet rolls, etc.
Make sure to only add large toys into the cage. Small toys can be choking hazards if swallowed by your animal.
Add a hammock. Another bonus addition to outfit a guinea pig cage is a hammock, which can be found at stores like Petsmart. Though hammocks are mainly for ferrets, they can also be used for guinea pigs. However, be sure to observe your guinea pig once you install the hammock to make sure it is safe.

, Put a little hut or tunnel in your guinea pig's cage. Each guinea pig needs its own hide to shelter in and have privacy.Guinea pigs can be extremely shy and they love to hide under things and get a little privacy. Again, these are things that you can either purchase at any main pet supply retailer or make inexpensively at home.


For example, you could buy a tube/tunnel from a pet store, but for a lot less money, you can make your at home using an empty Quaker Oats container. Be sure to remove the plastic and metal lips from both ends and all labels. To make a little ""house"" where your pig can hide, use an old, plain (i.e., no dyes) shoe box. Your pig will love the little house and it's totally safe for chewing.

, Even when your guinea pig is inside the cage, show it attention. Guinea pigs love to interact with humans. Showering your pet with love and attention is one way to help your animal settle into the cage and feel comfortable.


Interact with your guinea pig several times every day. It's important that you handle your guinea pig daily, touching and cuddling him as often as you can. You can also let him out of the cage and let him get additional exercise by running around a small room or other enclosed space; this is also something you should try to incorporate into your pig's daily routine. Make sure to only let your guinea pig out in rooms that have no small openings through which the guinea pig could escape or become lost. You'll also need to keep a close eye on your pig because guinea pigs will chew on anything they can, including dangerous items like electrical wires and cords.Because of their social nature, guinea pigs are happier when living with another guinea pig (or more). So if you want your pig to have even more companionship, consider getting another one!

You can purchase a ""hamster potty"" online or at a local pet store. Such devices are small plastic enclosures that you place in the corner of your hamster's cage. Many store-bought litter boxes come with their own scoop and bag of hamster-safe litter.You can also make your own hamster potty at home. All you need to do is find a small plastic enclosure, like old packaging of some sort, and cut a hole in it big enough for your hamster to fit through. However, the one downside to building your own enclosure is that repurposed materials may not be resistant to urine and feces. You might have to periodically replace a homemade container if it absorbs these materials and leave a smell.;
, Hamsters are fairly neat animals. Your hamster probably already has a particular corner of his cage where he likes to eliminate. In order to help him understand what his new box is for, you'll need to observe where he usually does his business. For best results, place his litter box somewhere in this area., Once you've established where your hamster likes to use the bathroom, set the litter box up here. Simply clear any sand or chips out of the area and place the box in this space. Make sure it is secure and will not topple over when your hamster climbs in and out.


Most hamsters eliminate somewhere in the corner of their cages. Therefore, most store-bought containers are made in a triangular or square shape so they can be easily fitted into this corner.Cover the bottom of the litter box with some kind of padding to soak up excess urine. Add some litter to the container. You might want to put on some gloves and move a few of your hamster's droppings into the litter. This will help him understand what the litter box is for., Once the litter box is set up, place your hamster near the new box. Allow him to familiarize himself with the new contraption. Many hamsters will instinctively understand what the box is for, especially if you've moved some of his droppings into the box. If your'e lucky, you may not have to spend much time training your hamster from here., If your hamster does not take to the litter box on instinct, you'll have to do some training. Like dogs and cats, hamsters and other smaller pets can be trained via clicker training. Buy a small training clicker at a local pet store. Clicker training works by teaching a pet to associate positive feelings with the clicking noise. Then, you press down on the clicker each time the animal engages in the desired behavior., Training areas are areas of your home where you can supervise your hamster as he performs a certain behavior. You should use a safe, enclosed space free from any distractions. For example, you can use a box with high sides. Training areas are normally used to teach tricks and not useful behaviors like litter training. However, if your hamster is nervous around his litter box it might help. Try to place him in a training area after you've seen him eating or drinking. He may be encouraged to go in his box if there's nowhere else to eliminate., You'll need to train your hamster to associate a clicking sound with a positive experience. You can use treats, praise, or petting to teach the hamster the clicker means he's being rewarded.


You have to time the click well. Take a treat and present it to your hamster. As soon as his mouth is near the treat, click.Do not just click and treat randomly. Watch for any small indication of the desired behavior and then click. If you see your hamster go near his litter box, click and treat. If your hamster eliminates near the box, click and treat., After a few weeks, you should only click and treat when your hamster does the desired behavior. When you see your hamster use his litter box, click and treat. Do not click and treat if he eliminates near the litter box.

, As you observe your hamster in day-to-day life, work hard to reinforce the behavior. Keep an eye on him while you doing activities around your home. Keep your clicker in your pocket or tie it on a string around your neck. When you see your hamster using his litter box, click to reinforce the behavior. After a certain point, you do not have to use treats. Your hamster will learn to associate clicking with rewards and praise in and of itself., Obviously, it's not possible to observe your hamster 100% of the time. However, work to be as consistent as you can. With time, your hamster will learn that his litter box is where he should eliminate. This will make clean-up time much easier on you.


If your hamster goes outside his litter box, it may help to move his droppings inside the box. This way, he'll associate the smell of feces and urine with his litter box. He may then better understand he needs to eliminate in the box.

, Hamsters are neat animals. They will not like using a dirty litter box. If the box is not clean, your hamster may eliminate outside of it. Scoop out the litter box at least once a day and change the litter each week when you clean your hamster's cage.

, As stated, handling or petting is not the best form of reinforcement when training a hamster. However, if you would rather use petting over treats take certain precautions to make sure your approach is effective.


Make sure your hamster is comfortable with you handling him. If you don't usually pick him up or pet him, take a few days to let him get used to you. Place your hand in his box and let him sniff it before you try to pet him or pick him up. Spend a few minutes handling him each day until he gets comfortable.
Make sure your hamster enjoys the handling or petting you're using as reinforcement. If he's squirming, sneezing, licking his lips, or yawning these are signs of anxiety. Stop handling your hamster in this way. You do not want your hamster to associate clicking with a negative experience., Some hamsters may be particularly stubborn about toilet training. Clicker training may not work for all hamsters. Other hamsters may not instinctively use their box. If your hamster does not seem to take to his litter box, try changing things up.


Try a different type of box. Switch out a store-bought box for a homemade one, for example. Your hamster may simply dislike the material you're using, which could make him resistant to his litter box.
Experiment with a different type of litter. Your hamster may also dislike the litter you're using so try swapping it out for a different brand. Hamsters tend to take to sand most easily as a form of litter, so look for a sand-based brand.Your litter should be a completely different material than what you use for the bedding and bottom of the cage. If your hamster's bedding is wood-based, for example, you'll need to use a paper-based litter. Otherwise, your hamster will not use his litter box., Many people may use cedar bedding as a form of litter or as a bed for their hamster. While sometimes used for other small mammals, cedar bedding can cause respiratory problems in hamsters. Make sure you only use litter marketed specifically for hamsters."

Familiarize your mouse or hamster with rope walking.Putting a few low-hanging, easily accessible ropes in your hamster or mouse’s cage.,
Earn your pet’s trust.,
Provide proper motivation.,
Extend the length that the mouse or hamster must walk.There are two ways to extend the length of rope your pet can walk.",How to Train a Hamster or a Mouse to Walk on a Tightrope2," This will give it the opportunity to develop its balance by playing and walking on the ropes.


Additionally, you could provide other agility-enhancing equipment. Mice and hamsters love jumping up and into stationary tire swings, under climbable wire frames, and through sea-saw tunnels.This equipment can be purchased at your local pet store.

, Train your mouse or hamster to do other, simpler tricks before training it to cross a tightrope.This will give it confidence when it comes time to teach it to walk a tightrope.


For instance, you could train your mouse or hamster to come and sit in your hand when called. To do this, offer a treat by placing it toward your wrist, so that the animal must come onto your hand to obtain the treat.
When your pet performs any trick or obeys any command successfully, say, “Great job!” and give it a tasty treat.

, If your mouse or hamster has nothing to gain from walking across the tightrope, it probably won’t want to do it. However, if you reward them with a small treat, they will respond enthusiastically to the tightrope training. Stick to healthy treats in small amounts to avoid making your pet sick. Tasty treats you could use to train your hamsters or mice include cauliflower, unsweetened cereals, blueberries, strawberries, and sunflower seeds.When your mouse first starts walking the tightrope, you should hold a treat just out of range of its snout. Move the treat along the length of the tightrope so that your mouse follows it. When your mouse successfully traverses the tightrope, give it the treat.

, One way is to lengthen the rope. The other way is to place your mouse or hamster further away from its end goal each time you have it walk the tightrope.


To extend the length of rope that your mouse or hamster walks on, start out with a very short length of rope of about six inches. Place your pet on one of the platforms that each end of the rope connects to. Slowly lengthen the rope each time your pet successfully walks the tightrope.
For instance, you might start out with a rope of about six inches, then push your pet to cross a rope of eight inches, then a rope of ten inches, and so on.
The other way you can get your hamster or mouse to negotiate longer ropes is to start out with it very close to the finishing end of the rope.
For instance, you can place your pet on the last four or five inches of the rope, and place a treat on the platform where the rope leads. The animal will scramble across the rope to get the treat. Next time you practice the trick, place your pet six to ten inches away from the end of the platform with the treat on it. Continue moving your mouse or hamster further away from the treat each time so that it has more time on the tightrope.

"
"
Be patient.Mice and hamsters, like people, have limited attention spans.,
Train frequently.,
Look for signs of stress.,
Get help.",How to Train a Hamster or a Mouse to Walk on a Tightrope3," If it starts losing interest in the training session, put it back in its cage and try again another day.


Don’t expect each mouse or hamster to learn at the same rate.Every hamster and mouse is different. While some might learn to walk across the tightrope quickly, others will need more practice. Don’t hold every animal to the same standard.
If you have more than one mouse or hamster, and one of them is a particularly brilliant student, let your other mice or hamsters watch them walk the tightrope first and encourage the others to follow. They will learn from the example of their “leader.”, If you only train once a week, or once a month, your mouse or hamster will not learn how to walk across a tightrope. Practice the trick at least once each week. The more frequently you practice the trick, the faster your pet will learn it.However, do not wear your pet out. Performing the trick two or three times each day should be the maximum. More than that and you not only risk stressing your pet, you also risk indigestion, since its little stomach will fill quickly with all the treats you deliver when it completes the tightrope walk.

, Walking a tightrope can be a harrowing experience. (If you doubt it, just try it for yourself!) Pets that are hesitant or stressed by the experience might poo or pee excessively.If your pet is stressed, discontinue training.


Never force a mouse or hamster to walk the tightrope if it is uninterested or stressed., If you’re having a hard time getting your rodent friend to walk across a tightrope, consider working with a professional. There are many professional mouse trainers available.Check the American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association’s list of trainers at http://www.afrma.org/afrmalinksrmweb.htm#training to find a trainer near you.


While there is no national hamster training organization, there are many local organizations out there. Network with hamster lovers in these organizations to find someone who might be able to help you train your hamster to walk a tightrope.

Lift your hamster out of his cage.,
Place him back in his cage.,
Do not leave your hand in your hamster’s cage.,
Do not grab or scruff your hamster.,
Do not punish your hamster if he bites.",How to Hold Your Syrian Hamster," If you have just brought your Syrian hamster home, he is going to need some time to adjust to his new surroundings. Let him explore his cage for a day or two before you start trying to hold him. During this time, he will mark his territory by washing his face and grooming a lot (‘scenting’).Do not mistake scenting for nervousness or anxiety. This is his way of settling in and knowing where things are in his cage.Approach his cage slowly and talk to him in a low and soothing voice while he is adjusting to his new home. It won’t take long for him to become used to your voice and even respond to it.;
, When your Syrian hamster has settled in, begin to work on picking him up and holding him. It is important that you wait until he is fully awake—usually about 30 minutes after he’s woken up.Hamsters tend to sleep very deeply, so it would be frightening for him to be woken up suddenly—he may think you’re a predator.Hamsters are nocturnal animals, so your hamster will be fully awake in the evenings.If you would like to wake him up, speak to him in a soft voice.However, it is better to wait until he has woken up on his own.

, Since hamsters do not see very well, they use their noses to ‘see’ things in their environment. For example, if you have more than one Syrian hamster, the scent of one hamster on your hands could make the other hamster feel like he is being attacked.Wash your hands between handling each hamster.Wash your hands with unscented soap before holding your hamster(s). Fruit-scented soap could make your hands look like a tasty piece of fruit to you hamster!, Hamsters can easily injure themselves if they fall from at least 20 cm (8 inches) above the floor.Sitting on the floor will put you close to a flat surface, and allows your hamster to fall into your lap in case he jumps off your hands.It may help to move his cage down to the floor before picking him up so you can already be seated when you reach into his cage.

, Even though your hamster is small, you should give yourself plenty of space to reach in and lift him out of his cage. Take the entire lid off the cage.Syrian hamsters are not known to be high jumpers, so you won’t have to worry about your hamster jumping out of the cage when the lid is off.

, How you hold your hands is important when learning how to hold your hamster. Since hamsters are small, you could hold one hand like a scoop. However, it may be easier to use both hands, with one hand slightly behind the other to give his backend more support.Your hamster may jump off your hands before you have the chance to lift him up. That’s okay—he may be scared of being in your hands at first. Let him jump on and off your hands as much as he wants until he’s comfortable with being held.Your hamster may nibble your hand as a way to investigate something new in his environment. Be careful not to jerk your hand away—this would frighten him and possibly make it harder for you to hold him.
Be mindful that it may take a few days before your hamster will feel comfortable enough for you to lift him out of his cage., Initially, your hamster may be frightened by being lifted out of his cage. To make him feel a little more comfortable, face him towards you. Being able to look at you will give him a steady frame of reference when he is in the air. Also, he will also be less likely to jump.Your hamster could become disoriented if you lift him up with his back to you.Don’t be surprised if your hamster bites your hands when you lift him up. These are little ‘warning’ bites to let you know he is feeling alarmed.Blowing a soft puff of air in his face should stop the biting.Holding your hamster close to you may lessen his anxiety, as well as make him less likely to jump.If your hamster continues to bite your hands, or seems really uncomfortable with being held, gently lower him back into his cage. Continuing to hold him when he’s uncomfortable will frighten him even more.Gently curving your fingers around his body could get him more comfortable with being held., Initially, your hamster may not enjoy being held for very long. When you sense he is getting uncomfortable or he is trying to bite, gently lower him back into his cage and give him a treat.To prevent him from falling and injuring himself, hold him in your hands until your hands reach the bottom of the cage.


Depending on your hamster’s comfort level, you may have to place him back in his cage sooner than you want to. That’s okay—it may take him a while to be comfortable with being held.
The first few times you hold him, hold him for about a minute. Gradually increase the time as he becomes more comfortable with you., For most hamsters, it is recommended to place your hand in the cage to get the hamster comfortable with it. However, this approach does not work for Syrian hamsters, since they are so territorial. Leaving your hand in your Syrian hamster’s cage could negatively affect his emotional and physical health.Your hand’s presence could increase your hamster’s stress level. Instead of eventually coming to your hand and accepting treats, he will probably just run and hide.For Syrian hamsters, it is recommended to start holding them as soon as their acclimation period is over., Picking your hamster up with your fingers could frighten your hamster and cause him to nip and bite at you.Scruffing your hamster by grabbing the skin at the base of his head is not only frightening to him, but also dangerous—it can put a lot of pressure on his head and possibly cause his eyes to bulge out., If your hamster bites your hand, you may think that punishing him will keep him from doing it again. However, hamsters do not respond well to punishment because they cannot link their action to a certain consequence. The puff of air in his face is unpleasant enough to stop the biting behavior without actually punishing or hurting him.Do not try to pull him off your finger, or, even worse, flick him off when he bites. Trying to pull him off will cause him to bite even harder, and flicking him off could seriously injure him."

Do not punish your hamster.",How to Hold a Hamster," If you just brought your hamster home, chances are he will need a little time to get used to you before he will enjoy being handled and held. Wait at least 12 to 24 hours before trying to hold him.Crouch near your hamster’s cage and speak to him in a soft, friendly voice.You can also get him comfortable with your presence by simply reading a book or watching TV in the same room as him.Make sure your hamster can see you and knows you are a friend, not a predator.;
, In the wild, hamsters are grabbed only by a predator,so your hamster will need to learn that you are not acting as a predator when you hold him. Start by placing your hand in his cage and leaving it there for him to investigate.So as not to startle your hamster, hold your hand limply in his cage.It would also be helpful to hold your hand as a clenched fist initially. You can unclench your fist, with your palm facing upward, as he becomes more comfortable with your hand.Hamsters have a tendency to nibble as a way to test their environment. If your hamster starts to nibble at your hand, gently pull your hand away. Jerking your hand away will startle him and may make him more reluctant to approach your hand., Your hamster may be very wary of your hand. If this is the case, try placing treats in your hand to encourage him to approach you. When he is comfortable accepting treats from your hand, he will be more amenable to you picking him up.Ideal treats are those that your hamster would normally eat in the wild. For example, you can treat him with fresh, rinsed vegetables (e.g., broccoli, cauliflower, carrots) and fruits (e.g., bananas, berries).Make sure to chop the treats in small pieces before feeding them to your hamster., Hamsters rely on their noses to navigate their environment, and strong smells can cause them distress. Washing your hands before handling your hamster will help him feel more comfortable. Use an unscented soap—a fruit-scented soap may make your hamster see your hand as food.Washing your hands is especially important if you have more than one hamster. The scent of another hamster on your hands could make the hamster you are handling feel like he is being attacked., In the wild, hamsters have few defenses other than running. Any sudden changes in your hamster’s environment can be very alarming to him, so it is very important that he can see your hand approaching him.When you place your hand in your hamster’s cage, leave it there for at least a few seconds so that he can acclimate to it., It is very important for your hamster to feel secure in your hands when you hold him. When he climbs into your hand, cup your hand under him to support him.Cup your other hand so that he can rest comfortably and securely in the palms of both of your hands.If your hamster does not want to climb in your hands, consider using a scoop. Allow him to walk into the scoop before lifting him up. You can them transfer him from the scoop to your hand when you have him out of the cage.You can also use a 1-liter plastic soda bottle, cut in half, as a scoop. Place the bottom half of the bottle in your hand, and let your hamster crawl into it. He will feel the warmth of your hand, but will not be able to bite your hand through the plastic.Make sure the bottle’s edges are smooth.
With time, your hamster will become more comfortable with being held and you will not need to lift him with a scoop.

, Being lifted up can be very disorienting and frightening for your hamster. Before lifting him up, face him towards you in your hands. This will give him a frame of reference, and will make him less likely to jump, as you lift him up. Lift him up slowly and gently. Be aware that your hamster may start biting your hand as you lift him up. His bites will likely not be enough to break the skin, but will serve as more of a warning signal that he is feeling alarmed.If he starts to bite, gently blow a puff of air in his face. The hamster will take a step back and blink, wondering what he just smelled. This gives you time to free your hand from his grip., Keeping your hamster close to your body as you hold him will keep him safe.It will also prevent him from trying to run or jump away.

, Because your hamster is not used to being held, he will probably not want to be held for long periods of time. If he seems agitated or is trying to bite you, gently lower him back in his cage.


Gently lower your hamster back in his cage. Hamsters can easily injure themselves if they fall, so you should lower your hamster until he can easily walk out of your hands and onto the bottom of his cage.
You can spread out your palm and allow him to simply step off your hand.
Hold him for a short period of time initially (less than a minute), then work your way to longer stretches of time as he becomes more comfortable with being held., Hamsters tend to sleep very deeply. In the wild, they will burrow deeply into the ground where they can sleep relatively undisturbed. If you wake him up suddenly to hold him, he will likely interpret this as trouble (e.g., a predator) being nearby.If you would like to wake him up, do so gently. For example, you can speak softly to him.You can also gently ruffle your hand in his bedding., Hamsters are very prone to injuries from falling, so you should keep your hamster fairly close to the ground when you are holding him. Do not lift him more than 12 inches (30 centimeters) off the floor.If he tries to make a run for it, keeping him close to the floor when lessen the likelihood of injuring himself if he jumps.Consider holding him when you are lying back on the floor, which would keep him even closer to the ground., Talking to your hamster in a calm and soothing voice will help him feel more comfortable with being held. However, kissing noises can actually be frightening to him., Scruffing your hamster to pick him up can put immense pressure on his head. This pressure may be enough to cause his eyes to prolapse.You should also never pick up your hamster by one of his appendages.Not only would this likely injure your hamster, he would be even more disoriented by being lifted in the air by his legs.

, Hamsters do not know how to make an association between actions and consequences. Therefore, punishing him by yelling at him or physically punishing him will only lead to your hamster seeing you as the enemy.A firm ‘no’ should be the strongest punishment you use.Blowing in his face, particularly when he bites you, should be enough to deter him from doing the action again."

Use a “scoop” to transfer them.",How to Handle a Hamster Without Being Bitten1," Before you attempt to pick up your hamster, it is important for you to wash your hands. If your hands smell like food, cosmetics, or anything else scented, your hamster will be much more likely to nibble. Also, by washing your hands before handling them, you will keep your hamster safe from germs., Hamsters will become aggressive whenever they are frightened.

Instead, entice your hamster to come to you. Hold out a treat (such as a sunflower seed) and allow your hamster to come and take it. With a second treat, lure your hamster to walk onto the open palm of your other hand. Then lift them out of the cage., In order to keep your hamster calm, you must hold him properly. Hold him in one hand with your fingers gently curled under his belly. Your other hand should be supporting his bottom. When you pick up your hamster, always use both hands., Hamsters will become especially defensive when you snatch them out of their cages. You can prevent them biting you by using a scoop to remove them from their cages, instead of your hand. This is particularly useful for anytime you must move them quickly. You can purchase a scoop from a pet store, or cut a two-liter bottle in half to make a DIY scoop."

Some people find it after a few hours, others find it after a few days, while some people find their hamster weeks later. Don't lose hope.Remember, sudden movements and loud noises may scare your hamster away, so ask everyone to stay calm and quiet, and to keep away from the area.;
, Secure the areas where the hamster may hiding. Close the doors to the rooms once you find out the hamster is missing. Cover up any crevices in the wall or floors, and make sure all the windows are secure. Try to trap the hamster in the smallest area so it's easier to find. Plus, you don't want your hamster moving rooms while you search.Lower toilet lids to ensure the hamster doesn't drown.
Tell everyone to be careful where they step while the hamster is missing.

, As soon as you discover your hamster is missing, remove any pets from the rooms. Pets you should watch include cats, dogs, and ferrets. If you can, place them outside, in secure rooms, or in crates.Remove any mousetraps, rat poison, or other harmful substances that your hamster may get into.

, Search the rooms for the hamster. Hamsters like dark, warm places. Look for places that haven't been touched or seen light for awhile. Look where the pipes are, near heaters, behind the toilet, and behind furniture.You may also find hamsters in cabinets, behind drawers, under the refrigerator, behind the washing machine, or under beds. Grab a flashlight and check closets.


Decide where your hamster likes to hang out. Where do you think it would like to go? Try to think about its behavior.
Look for signs of hamster poop or seed trails., One way you can determine which room the hamster is in is to leave a small pile of the hamster's favorite food in each room before you go to bed. Line food along the edge of the floorboards, where the hamster is more likely to walk.Close all the doors. Your hamster is likely to be in the room where the pile of food has been eaten, which will help you to narrow down your search.

, If you verify which room the hamster is in, secure the perimeter. This means move all other people out of the room and close the door to lessen the chance of your missing hamster getting hurt by accident by other people. Then get on your hands and knees and crawl around. Check likely hiding spots, be quiet, and watch the escape routes.

, Place the hamster's cage on the floor. Put some food and water in the cage, and leave it with the door open near where you think your hamster is hiding. Hamsters may eventually want to go somewhere secure that smells familiar.If you have an aquarium cage, you can place it on its side.

, Another way to try to catch the hamster is to put the wheel out. When you hear the squeaks at night, you will know which room the hamster is in. You may be able to sneak up on the hamster and catch it., Put some of the hamster's favorite food on some tinfoil in corners of the room. Dim all lights late at night and listen for the hamster rustling the tinfoil as it goes after the food., When you put treats out at night, surround the treats with a ring of flour. When the hamster goes to the treats and takes them back to its hideout, the feet will leave a trail of flour back to where it's staying., A humane mousetrap might be a way to catch your hamster. Set them out at night, making sure to check them as soon as you wake up in the morning., Turn off all lights and electronics. Stand very still in the dark room. Listen for sounds of the hamster. You may have to wait a little bit. Eventually, you will hear the hamster moving around.You can try tying a string with a bell on it to a carrot stick. When the hamster eats the carrot stick, he will move the bell.

, When you finally find the hamster, you need to catch it. Toss a lightweight towel over the hamster so that the towel covers it. This will stop the hamster and hold it in place while keeping it safe. Gently pick up the hamster and place it back in the cage.

, If you know where the hamster is, you can try to lure it into a tube with one closed end. Place the tube close to the hamster and place some food into the tube. When the hamster is inside, cover the opening and gently lift the tube. Place the hamster back into its cage., Find a clean, small clean bucket. The bucket needs to be deep enough so the hamster can't get back out, but shallow enough to not risk injury, put a clean blanket in the bottom to cushion it's fall. The bucket should be approximately 10"" deep.Make sure that the bucket you are using is tall enough so it can't escape.Put a towel or shavings on the bottom to cushion your hamster when it falls in., You need to lure the hamster to the bucket. To do this, place fragrant food inside, such as peanut butter or apples. You also can put a toilet paper roll inside the bucket. Put some cucumber inside so your hamster can stay hydrated, do not put a ceramic dish inside in case, it could injure itself in the fall. , Pile a few books, CD cases, or DVDs to act as steps into a bucket. You can also make Lego stairs, use hamster tubes from the cage, or build a ramp with a piece of wood. The stairs should lead up to the rim of the bucket., Cover the top of the bucket with tissue paper. Your hamster will climb onto the paper and fall into the bucket.

, Leave a trail of treats or hamster food leading to the bucket, and then up the steps and into the bucket. Line the steps up to the top of the bucket, and a place a small pile of food on the paper.Don't put too much food on the steps leading to the bucket. You want to lure the hamster, not make it full so it won't investigate further., If you haven't narrowed the hamster's location down to a single room, place a bucket trap in each room., Similar to the bucket, use wax paper and a trashcan. Place wax paper or tinfoil over a trashcan. Do not fasten the paper or foil, simply rest it there. Lean a yardstick or ruler against the trashcan. This will allow your hamster to walk up the stick and onto the paper.


Make a line of food or treats up the ruler and place a few in the center of the paper or foil.
Make sure to use a shallow trashcan. The hamster should not fall any farther than 10 inches.

, Check for whatever came off, became loose, or doesn't work properly and allowed the hamster to escape. Fix it immediately.


If the hamster escapes often, close the cage with a metal lock on the outside. A plastic lock can be hazardous and useless if your hamster chews on it.

, Double check your hamster's cage to see if it has chewed any holes into the bottom wiring or the sides. It might have chewed through the cage in places that you can't easily see., Make sure you reinforce the cage door. Try bulldog clips for wire cages. You can also try tape on the outside of cages, too., If the hamster has been subjected to loud noises, constant comings and goings of people or pets, or other disturbances, it may hate where its housing is situated. Shift it to somewhere quieter and less frequented by other beings.

, If your hamster got out, it might be a sign that your hamster is unhappy and wants to get away. When you capture it, observe it and if it looks like it's sad, consider getting it new toys or food. Maybe it needs more attention; if so, give it some.

Allow your hamster to settle in for few days after you bring him home. Don't try to pick him up during this time. Once his new home is comfortable and familiar, he will grow less aggressive and be more open to training and interaction., Hamsters are quite farsighted, which means they have trouble seeing things that are close up. To compensate for this, hamsters have an excellent sense of hearing. In order to help your hamster get used to you, allow them to grow accustomed to your voice. Put on some music and sing near your hamsters cage, take a phone call in the same room, or simply speak directly to your hamster., In addition to excellent hearing, hamsters make up for their poor eyesight with a strong sense of smell.

Brush your guinea pig regularly.,
Invest in a de-shedding tool.,
Clean their cage regularly.,
Remember that guinea pigs are seasonal shedders.,
Remember that babies shed their baby fur so their adult fur can grow in.",How to Stop a Guinea Pig from Shedding1," Daily brushing will help reduce the amount of hair your guinea pig sheds. Be sure to brush gently and never scrape the brush over bald patches of skin. Guinea pigs have very sensitive skin and this can hurt them.Use a soft baby brush or a metal greyhound comb to remove loose hair and keep your guinea pig’s coat shiny and healthy.;
, De-shedding tools are typically metal combs designed to catch loose fur when you brush it over your pet’s fur. Any de-shedder will work for your guinea pig. Ones designed for small cats and kittens work especially well.


Be sure to avoid damaging your guinea pig’s sensitive skin. De-shedding brushes and combs can be sharp and abrasive, so take care to be gentle when using a de-shedder.

, Cleaning your guinea pig’s cage daily or at least several times a week is vital to their health. Since your guinea pig doesn’t get immunizations at the vet like dogs and cats do, they are more susceptible to illness if left in a dirty cage. This can cause a variety of health problems, including infections that can trigger hair loss.Avoid using harsh chemical cleaners when you clean your guinea pig’s cage. Instead, opt for mild soap and water or a solution of vinegar and water. Make sure the cage has time to dry before you put your pet back in it., It’s important to keep in mind that you won’t be able to completely stop your pet from shedding. Guinea pigs, especially long-haired ones, shed seasonally, so you can expect to find more hair than usual when they lose their winter coats in the spring and early summer., Baby guinea pigs’ fur thins out to make room for their thicker, slightly coarser adult fur to grow in. This is a natural process and cause of shedding and is nothing to be concerned about.For this stage, there are no preventative steps to take because it’s a necessary part of your guinea pig growing into a healthy adult. To minimize the mess from this shedding process, keep their cages cleaned out and sweep or vacuum your home to pick up extra hair.

Make sure they are getting enough protein.,
Check for fungal infections.,
Check for parasites.,
Don’t use cedar chips in their cages.,
Eliminate stress for your pet.",How to Stop a Guinea Pig from Shedding2," Vitamin C deficiency in guinea pigs can lead to excessive shedding and hair loss. Although guinea pig pellets are fortified with vitamin C, the vitamin C in these can degrade over time. The best way to ensure that your pet isn’t losing fur due to a vitamin deficiency is to feed them fresh fruits and vegetables that are high in vitamin C.Some good options for your guinea pig include oranges, tomato, broccoli, and cabbage.You can also find vitamin C powders and drops at your local health food store, and you can mix these supplements into your pet’s water., Although your guinea pig is a herbivore, they still require protein in their diet.

Aim to make 15% of their daily diet come from a protein source.Vegetarian sources of protein suitable for guinea pigs include oatmeal, peas, beans, and artichokes.

, Itchy bald spots on your guinea pig are tell-tale signs of a fungal infection. These infections almost always cause some degree of excess shedding. Treatments for fungal infections include topical creams and oils. However, you will want to see your vet so they can properly diagnose your pet.Try to keep your guinea pig’s environment cool and dry. Warm, humid environments can lead to fungal infections.

, Mites, lice, and other parasites can take up residence with your guinea pig, causing them to itch and excessively shed. If you check under their fur and see small black bugs, your pet likely has a parasite infestation. Take them to the vet so he or she can prescribe medicines that will kill the parasites and help stop your pet’s itching and hair loss.

, Some owners think cedar chips are good for their pet’s cage because cedar will keep it smelling fresh. While this is true, cedar chips should never be used in guinea pig cages because they can exacerbate skin problems and shedding, and the oils in cedar chips can cause liver and respiratory problems in guinea pigs.Opt instead for bedding made of paper, which won’t cause health problems for your pet., Guinea pigs can shed excessively if they feel stressed out. They are sensitive animals and nervous by nature. Their stress can often manifest as hair loss if the stressor isn’t resolved.For example, if you have two guinea pigs and one is being the “alpha” and bullying the other one, this can be a source of stress for the quieter pig. Try giving them some time apart or putting a physical barrier up in their cage so they can still see one another, but the “alpha” pig cannot harass the other one.

Consider pregnancy as a possible cause.",How to Stop a Guinea Pig from Shedding3," As humans, when our hormones are out of whack, we experience a variety of health problems, including hair loss and balding. Hormonal imbalances can have the same effect on your guinea pig, causing patchy hair loss and excessive shedding.Talk to your doctor if your pet’s fur falls out in clumps or you notice bare patches of skin, as this is not normal or seasonal shedding.

, Cushing’s disease is a condition that affects the way adrenal glands work in the body. Enlarged adrenal glands can also lead to shedding. Guinea pigs are susceptible to this disease, and it can cause excessive hair loss and bald patches. Talk to your vet about testing your guinea pig for adrenal problems like Cushing’s disease.Testing your pet's health will consist of a physical exam and blood testing. Blood work will tell your vet whether your pet has thyroid or adrenal issues or infections. The physical exam will check the general health of your pet, such as its temperature, the quality of its coat, and the health of its eyes and ears.Guinea pigs cannot handle penicillin. Most vets should be aware of this, but a vet inexperienced with guinea pigs might not know this. For the safety of your pet, double check that any antibiotics the vet prescribes don't contain penicillin., If you have a female guinea pig who has been around other male guinea pigs, consider that pregnancy might be the cause of her shedding. Just like with human women’s hair, female guinea pigs experience changes to their fur while pregnant. Your pig’s shedding problem might resolve itself once she delivers her babies."

Behind or under bookshelves.
Inside cabinets and wardrobes.
Inside kitchen and dresser drawers. Keep in mind when searching drawers not to push them back too hard in the event your hamster is hiding behind a drawer.
Behind large furniture like tables, vases, and mirrors that are on the ground.

, Most hamsters will chew through objects to get inside and burrow or hide. Your hamster can also squeeze into a hole as small as an inch in diameter, so she may try to chew or scratch through objects or even a crack in your walls. Turn off any sources of noise and then switch off the lights in the room. Sit still and listen for any scratching, chewing, or rustling noises. This may help you determine where your hamster is hiding., Sometimes, hamster who escape bring a hoard of sunflower seeds with them. Look for piles or trails of half-eaten sunflower seeds, or seed husks in any of your hamster’s usual hiding places. You may want to use a flashlight to check dark and narrow spots.Your hamster may also end up going to the bathroom when he is outside of his cage. Look for any droppings or poop trails, as this may lead you straight to your missing hamster.

, If you know which room your hamster escaped in and you have sealed off all possible exits and hiding places, you can try to bait your hamster with sunflower seeds.Set a trail of ten sunflower seeds leading into your hamster’s cage. Then, turn off all the lights in the room and sit quietly in one corner of the room.
Your hamster will be attracted to the seeds and should reveal himself to you. He may even walk straight back into his cage. However, it may be some time until he shows himself and you may have to wait awhile in the dark room.
You can also dust the floor around the seed bait with flour. Then when the hamster walks through the flour to get to the seeds, you will be able to see where he was headed.

, This is one of the most popular ways to catch a hamster. It is also a very simple trap that you can whip together using a tall bucket, a towel, several boxes or books, and a handful of treats.Flip over a tall, plastic bucket so the opening is facing upward. Place the towel in the bucket to cushion your hamster’s fall when he lands in the trap.
Put a handful of treats in the bucket as bait. It could be peanut butter on a cracker, a pile of sunflower seeds, or other treats that have a strong, enticing smell that your hamster will pick up on. You may also want to place a piece of lettuce or a water bottle on a stand in the bucket so your hamster has something to drink when he lands in the bucket.
Create a ladder leading up to the bucket. Use a stack of books, legos, or a set of small boxes to make stairs your hamster can climb up on to reach the bait, and the trap.
You can also place sunflower seeds or another treat on each step leading up the ladder to ensure your hamster makes it all the way to the top of the ladder and falls into the bucket.
Close the door to the room and check the bucket periodically to see if your hamster has fallen for the trap.

, Hamsters are nocturnal creatures, so your hamster will likely be more active at night. If you have spent the day searching for your missing hamster to no avail, try placing sunflower seeds in your hamster’s cage and leaving the cage door open overnight. Your hamster may come back into the cage on his own and end up burrowing in his cage.Check his cage in the morning to confirm he is back in his cage, safe and sound.

, Avoid putting it on the floor unless it is your only option. This is because when they are on the floor they can feel more vibrations when people are walking, someone is using the vacuum, etc. The area should be in a high traffic area, or an area where the family usually is. This makes them feel like they are in the family and will be happier. The area should be a bright room with indirect sunlight. If you have a window that will bring occasional light in the cage, that is good too. The room should also have a stable temperature between 65-75 degrees. If you are comfortable with the room temperature, so are they. See warnings for where not to put the cage.

, If you have a toddler, cat or dog that could easily get to your Guinea Pigs when you're not around, you should make a closed cage. If you have any of those and they can't get to the Pigs when you're not around, you could have an open cage.

Brush its hair regularly.,
Cut your guinea pig’s hair.,
Trim your guinea pig’s backside.,
Give it a bath.",How to Groom a Guinea Pig1," Long-haired guinea pigs require daily brushings to prevent their hair from getting tangled and developing knots. If you do come across any knots, a comb may be handy to remove them. For short-haired guinea pigs, you only need to brush and comb their hair once a month.You can buy guinea pig specific brushes and combs at most pet stores.
If you do not brush your guinea pig regularly, its hair may become so knotted that your only solution is to cut it off.;
, A long-haired guinea pig’s hair grows about an inch a month and will require regular cutting. Once its hair begins to touch the ground, trim the hair so that it does not drag. You may also want to cut your long-haired guinea pig's hair to a comfortable length in the summer. This will keep it from overheating.Keeping your guinea pig’s hair off of the ground will prevent it from becoming wet with urine and feces that may be on the ground in its cage. Regular trimming can prevent health issues, such as urinary tract infections, associated with bacteria.
When giving your guinea pig a trim, consider using round tipped scissors with guide combs to avoid cutting its hair too short.
If you and your guinea pig live somewhere that is not climate controlled in the summer, you will want to keep your pet comfortable by cutting its hair. Long-haired guinea pigs are susceptible to overheating.

, Some long-haired guinea pigs are prone to urinary tract infections because the hair on their backside collects bacteria. This can be the result of it coming into contact with the ground and being soiled with urine and feces. Because of this, it is important that you do not neglect to trim your animal’s backside., Guinea pigs rarely need baths. In fact, some never need to be washed. However, your guinea pig may become stinky and need a bath. Place your guinea pig in a small bowl of warm water and gently scrub them with a shampoo for small animals. Be sure to quickly dry the animal with a towel to avoid it getting too cold and becoming sick.If you want to kill two birds with one stone, try cutting your guinea pig's hair while it’s still wet from the bath. Wet hair is easier to cut than dry hair.If your guinea pig has dandruff, is itchy, or sheds more than normal, it may have a parasite or fungal infection on its skin. Take your animal to the veterinarian and do not shampoo it unless the vet gives you a medicated shampoo. Washing it may dry out its skin more and make the condition worse.

Plan the hutch.,
Collect your materials.,
Build the frame.,
Install the floor, walls, and roof.,
Weatherproof the structure.",How to Make a Guinea Pig Cage1," Guinea pig hutches are meant to be used outdoors and should be sturdy. Planning the layout is the first step. How big should the hutch be? Generally speaking, the bigger the better. Guinea pigs need at least 8 square feet of cage space or, for two, at least 10 square feet. For a hutch, aim to have a length of approximately four to five times that of your animal and a maximum length of about 36 inches (91 cm).It can also be designed to have two stories, one atop the other, to make more space. The hutch should be off the ground, otherwise it will be too cold for the animal and the wood may start to rot. You will therefore need it to be elevated, either on a table at about waist height or on its own legs.An old cupboard or small cabinet can often be converted into an effective hutch. This will save you from having to buy all new materials and construct the frame yourself.
Try drawing up a blueprint with your planned dimensions.;
, The best hutches are made from good solid wood, which will better protect your guinea pig from the elements as well as give it insulation. A well-designed hutch will also ward off potential predators. Avoid cheap and flimsy plywood. You will additionally need wire mesh, wood staples, screws or nails, galvanized latches, and tools like an electric drill, hammer, screwdriver, tape measure, wire-cutters, and saw, and work space for the assembly job.Readers who are less comfortable with do-it-yourself projects can buy guinea pig hutches at pet stores or online, pre-made or with easy to assemble parts, for between $100-$300. In the latter case, instructions will walk you through the construction process.

, Start by doing your measurements and cutting. Depending on how big you want the hutch, you will need to have three separate lengths for the wooden pieces: one for length, one for height, and one for width. Your dimensions, for example, might be something like 45 x 32 x 20 inches (50.8 cm). You will need at least four pieces of each size, and more if you want to construct individual frames for each of the hutch's six sides and an opening door. Measure the wood and double-check your measurements before you cut. With the electric drill, drill the attachment holes with a slightly smaller bit than your screw size and then insert the screw with the drill. Assemble the pieces together.Assembly and construction can be challenging on your own. If you don't have experience with tools and design, pre-made frames can be purchased at pet stores or online.

, The hutch must have a solid floor and roof, made from either wood or plastic. While some people recommend using mesh for the floor, this can be dangerous for the animal and can easily lead to a broken leg. The roof should meanwhile slope backward at a slight angle, so that water drains away, and should be covered with 2 to 3 layers of roofing felt to make it waterproof. Make the walls from wire mesh like chicken wire, cutting pieces to fit the frame and then affixing them with wood staples.Wooden floors unfortunately soak up urine. You will need to provide the animal with a deep floor cover and change it regularly.Timothy hay works great. Some guinea pigs may also gnaw at the floor, requiring repairs., To protect the hutch from the elements, rot, and your animal's urine and droppings, weatherproof it with a wood sealant. You will need to choose carefully, so as not to make the animal sick accidentally. Find a sealant that is safe for animals. If you will keep the hutch in a semi-enclosed space, weatherproofing is not as important but can still extend the life of the structure."

Know when to trim your animal’s nails.,
Place the guinea pig in your lap or on a flat surface.,
Hold its foot.,
Cut the nail at an angle.,
Dip its nail in styptic powder if you cut too deeply.",How to Groom a Guinea Pig2," Guinea pig nails grow constantly and need regular grooming. You should cut your guinea pig’s nails once every four to six weeks in order to keep them maintained. You can cut the nails yourself or take the animal to a veterinarian for clipping.The veterinarian or a vet tech will likely show you how to trim you guinea pig’s nails if you are unsure.
You can use a pair of human nail clippers or a blunt tip pair designed specifically for trimming the nails of small animals. The smaller opening of the human clippers makes it more difficult to cut off too much of your guinea pig’s nail.

, When you go to trim your animal’s nails, sit the guinea pig in your lap or on a stable surface, like a counter or a table. Hold the guinea pig in place with your non-dominant hand and use your other hand to operate the clippers.If your guinea pig squirms a lot, you might want to ask someone to hold the guinea pig while you trim its nails.

, Grab one of its feet and hold it firmly in your hand. You want to hold it firmly enough that it does not move while you are cutting its nails, but not so tightly that your hurt its foot. Try to spread the foot between your fingers to make it easier to get to the nails.If your animal is making noises like it is in pain, you may be squeezing its foot too tightly.

, Inside a guinea pig’s nail is a blood vessel known as the “quick.” You will want to cut your animal’s nails at an angle in order to avoid cutting into the quick, as cutting the quick can be very painful and result in bleeding. Try clipping the tip of the nail at a 45 degree angle to avoid cutting into the quick.If you animal’s nails are light colored, you should be able to see the quick as a pink coloring in the nail. However, if they are dark, you may need to shine a light up from underneath them in order to see the quick.
If you do not regularly cut your guinea pig’s nails, they may curl backward into the pads of the foot and result in severe pain and possibly infection., If you cut into your guinea pig’s quick, dip the wound into styptic powder, which is an antihemorrhagic agent. This will stop the bleeding and help numb the pain from the cut."
"
Take care of your guinea pig’s teeth.,
Check your guinea pig’s ears.,
Clean its grease gland.,
Prevent fleas.",How to Groom a Guinea Pig3," Your guinea pig’s teeth will grow over the course of its life and they may get too long and become painful. To prevent this, you should provide your guinea pig with things to chew on like unpainted woodchips, straw, twigs, or even empty paper towel rolls. These things will help naturally wear down your guinea pig’s teeth and keep them from getting too long.You should check your guinea pig’s teeth once a month to make that they are not getting too long.
If your guinea pig stops eating, its teeth may be sore and preventing it from eating properly. Consult your veterinarian about getting your animal's teeth clipped., In order to keep your animal’s ears from becoming infected, you should check them every week and clean them every two weeks. Use a soft cloth to gently wipe the part of the ear that you can see. Be careful not to delve too deep into the animal's ear, as this can hurt it and impact debris in the ear canal, which can in turn result in an infection.A drop of mineral oil on the cloth may also help with the cleaning process.

, Both male and female guinea pigs have a grease gland on their lower back. Male guinea pigs are particularly greasy and secrete a sticky and pungent oil from this area when they are courting females or fighting other males. This grease can build up on your guinea pig’s hair and skin, making your animal smell bad and lead to an infection of the gland. Use a cotton swab with a non-abrasive oil or soap to clean the area of grease., Your guinea pig may get fleas at some point. The best way to deal with this problem is to give your animal a bath and scrub it with shampoo. To avoid fleas in general, you should regularly clean your guinea pigs cage and change out its bedding.Do not use flea removers designed for other animals. This may make your guinea pig sick and kill it.

Sketch out blueprints.,
Gather materials.,
Build the frame.,
Install the wire mesh.",How to Make a Guinea Pig Cage2," A guinea pig run is a more specialized structure for outdoor exercise, letting your animal roam about without the risk of it getting lost or escaping. It is basically a large mesh cage without a bottom, which you can place directly on the grass. Runs can be fairly large – four feet on each side and one foot in height are fairly typical dimensions. You can build yours as a separate structure, but it is also possible to incorporate it into an existing hutch. In fact, the structure will be a lot like the hutch in its design. In its most basic form the run is a wooden frame with wire mesh sides. Sketch out a blueprint and all of your planned measurements before getting started., As with the hutch, you will need wood, screws, wire mesh, wood staples, a drill, and a saw. However, runs are designed to be lightweight, at least those that are portable, so that the wood will ideally be lighter and rather less solid than that used in the hutch.Like hutches, guinea pig runs can be found online or at some pet stores for between $50 and $100. Instructions will walk you through the assembly process.

, As with the hutch, again, start by measuring and cutting the frame. The run is slightly more simple in that you really only need to construct a simple frame. There does not need to be a roof, floor, or even a door. Measure the wood per your blueprint specifications, double check the measurements, and make your cuts. Then, with the drill, drill your attachment holes and assemble the pieces., Cut the wire mesh once you have finished the frame. The mesh will need to cover each side of the run frame, at the least, and be secured with wood staples. You can also put mesh over the top of the run, though this is not strictly necessary. Guinea pigs like to jump (called “popcorning”), but there should be little danger of them escaping if you have made the run at least one foot high."

Get your materials.,
Connect the storage cube grids.,
Measure the inside of the enclosure.,
Measure, mark, and cut the coroplast to size.,
Mark and score the coroplast.,
Make fitted corners.,
Snap the edges away and tape the flaps.,
Place the box inside the grid.",How to Make a Guinea Pig Cage3," Cube and Coroplast cages are probably the most popular type of cages for indoor guinea pigs. They are also easy to construct. To make one you will need storage cube grids, corrugated plastic called coroplast, and a box-cutter. These materials can be easily found and purchased at big-box stores like Costco, Target, or Kmart., Assemble the cube grids in a rectangle of your desired dimensions. Then, take the plastic grid connectors (these are small plastic ties) and connect the grids so that they are tight. You can make the cage even more sturdy by using cable ties, which are available at most hardware stores., You will need these dimensions in order to cut the coroplast, which will sit inside of the storage cube grids. You can measure with string if you'd like. Then, add 6 inches to the length and width to find your “cutting dimensions.” When you cut and insert the coroplast, these extra inches will give you a six-inch internal wall all the way around the cage.

, Use a tape measure, yardstick or long straight-edge, and pen to measure and mark the coroplast. Then cut it with the box cutter. A pair of heavy duty or even regular scissors will work, as well. Remember, the piece of cut coroplast should be to the size of the enclosure plus 6 inches on all sides.

, Now you can start to make your enclosure walls. Measure and mark 6 inches in on all sides to create the inner dimensions. Use a box cutter or razor blade to score the coroplast along the lines you made, but don't cut all the way through. You can practice on a scrap piece first. It is also much easier to score with the grain of the coroplast rather than against it.

, Cut in 6 inches each way at all four corners of the coroplast to create flaps. Doing so will allow you to snap up the edges and place the coroplast snugly inside of the enclosure. If you forget this step, it will not fit.

, Snap the edges of the coroplast upward from where you scored your lines to create your cage box. Then, tape the edges to make them more sturdy and secure. Make sure that you tape the outside, using two or more large strips of tape for extra strength.

, You now have a basic C & C guinea pig cage. The next step is to find a suitable location for the cage and to finish the living space with bedding, a food bowl, and a water bottle. Choose a place where there is fairly high traffic. Guinea pigs are social animals and benefit from human contact. Find a place with natural light but one that is not in direct sunlight, and also avoid drafty areas."

Keep in mind, however, that human clippers squeeze the nail together before clipping it; this may be painful to your guinea pig.Animal clippers are guillotine-style, ensuring that the nail won't be squeezed. Also, they open more widely than human clippers, which makes the nails easier to trim. You can find this type of clipper at your local pet store.You can try both types of clippers to see what your guinea pig is most comfortable with.;
, These substances will quickly stop the bleeding if you trim the nails down too far. They are equally effective at stopping the bleeding, so you can use either one. Styptic powder can usually be found with men's shaving products at your local grocery store or pharmacy.
Cornstarch is located with the baking products.

, In case your guinea pig is squiggly during nail trims, you can wrap him up in the towel to restrain him more easily.


If you have previously used a towel to trim his nails, keep using the same towel each time. This will help to keep the process more consistent. Plus, he may feel more comfortable with one towel over another.

, Organizing everything that will you need for the nail trimming ahead of time will help the process go more smoothly.


Place a small towel, nail clippers, and styptic powder (or cornstarch) on a counter or table top.
Placing a small amount (about 1/4 teaspoon) of styptic powder or cornstarch on a paper towel ensure that you have quick access to these substances in you need to stop a nail from bleeding.

, After reaching into the cage with a slow and steady movement, place the thumb of one hand under his jaw and support his hindquarters with your other hand.Using the proper method to reach into the cage and pick up your guinea pig will not only ensure that he is not frightened, but will also keep you from getting bitten.

, Be careful not to wrap your guinea pig too tightly; this could cause him to quickly suffocate or overheat., He should be facing away from you, which will make it harder for him to bite or nip., There are several things that you can do to relax your guinea pig before trimming his nails, such as petting him gently behind his ears and giving him snacks.


Make sure you don't have any food around him so he doesn't get tempted while getting his nails trimmed. Keeping him relaxed will help you trim his nails more easily.
Healthy snacks for your guinea pig include bell peppers and carrots. Cut the vegetables into small pieces so that your guinea pig can eat them easily., Do not be surprised if your guinea pig wiggles when you do this. If he wiggles too much, release his leg and let him calm down before you try again.

, Using the hand that is holding your guinea pig's legs, steady the nail between the thumb and index finger. Do not squeeze too tightly to keep the nail in place; this may hurt your guinea pig and cause him to squirm.


Selecting a nail on one end of the foot and working your way to the inside or outside of the foot will help you keep easier track of which nails you've trimmed.

, Position them in front of the nail that you are about to trim.

, The quick is the blood vessel that runs in the middle of the nail. Identifying it will be easier to do with a clear nail than a darker nail. Using a flashlight may be helpful in seeing the quick in a darker nail.

, If you can see the quick, trim the nail down to just above the quick. If you cannot see the quick, use caution and trim a little bit at a time.


If you cut the quick, the nail will start to bleed. Although this will be painful to your guinea pig, you have not caused any serious damage. Simply dab a small amount of the styptic powder or cornstarch on the nail and the bleeding will stop quickly., If you see that your guinea pig is becoming restless, give him some time to calm down before trying to finish trimming his nails.


Giving your guinea pig a treat after trimming each nail can provide positive reinforcement and keep him distracted. Make sure that he finishes eating before starting on the next nail to prevent him from choking on his food.

, If this was your first time trimming your guinea pig's nails, don't be too hard on yourself if things didn't go quite as expected. Guinea pigs will wiggle when getting their nails trimmed at any age.


If this time didn't go well, consider trimming your guinea pig's nails over several days instead of all at once. This may be easier for the both of you.
If you put styptic powder or cornstarch on any of the nails, check these nails to make sure that the bleeding has stopped. Wipe off the substance from the nail before you put your guinea pig back in his cage to prevent him from eating it on accident.

They can easily become extremely stressed when put in a situation that involves water. The most concerning risk would be the chance of your guinea pig inhaling water into their lungs. If this does happen, your guinea pig will need medical care as soon as possible, which can put your guinea pig at the risk of death.

With the risk of danger and stress also comes the misuse of shampoos and/or conditioner which can cause irritated and dry skin. This issue is highly common among guinea pig carers.;
, Many guinea pig owners jump straight to thinking their guinea pig needs a bath due to natural odours, including the scent of urine. This is not true and your guinea pig doesn't need a bath due to certain smells that are natural for them. Most of the time it is the bedding that requires changing. Some types of bedding, such as newspaper, aren't absorbent enough and therefore do not do well in eliminating such odours.

The only time a guinea pig requires a bath is if they have been signed off by a professional exotic vet, have a sticky or resistant substance in their fur, or for medical reasons.

, Baby guinea pigs should never be bathed unless you need to for a medical reason confirmed by an exotic vet. Exposing baby guinea pigs to cold elements can be critical to their care. The same rule applies to pregnant sows which will get way too stressed out from the confronting situation., If you're ever unsure about a situation, then a vet check will determine whether it is necessary for your guinea pig to be bathed. Find a reliable, exotic vet with good standing to help guide you in your situation. If your guinea pig has a sticky substance stuck to their fur then it is recommended to see a vet as sometimes a bath isn't required or the best option to solve your problem.

A quick sign off shouldn't be costly, however, call up to check pricing first if you're concerned about cost.

, Do not use any human or dog shampoos on your guinea pigs. Guinea pigs have different skin types to other animals and humans, using the wrong shampoo can negatively impact them and cause dry skin irritation. Visit a vet clinic and ask an exotic vet for a prescription of critters care shampoo/conditioner. Most vet clinics have available guinea pig shampoo that you can buy or you can try a pet shop., A few companies advertise dust treatments to keep guinea pigs clean. Guinea pigs are not like hamsters and do not naturally take dust baths, therefore it isn't effective for them to use dust as a grooming method. Dust is actually quite harmful to guinea pigs and can cause respiratory problems, so avoid them at all costs., There are several options for where you can bathe your guinea pig including in the sink, in the tub, or in a bin. Whatever you choose to use, make sure the sides are tall enough that your guinea pig will not be able to jump out, If your guinea pig does not require a full-soak bath, then consider using a damp cloth to wash them instead. It can be a lot friendlier and safer for your guinea pig instead of using a tub with water, especially if they only have a few dirt patches on their rump. This can help reduce the need to give them a full bath.

If your guinea pig is jumpy then encourage them to stay calm with a vegetable treat such as a lettuce leaf or cucumber slice. Remember; guinea pigs love food!

, Guinea pigs generally do not like water and may become anxious or afraid if unceremoniously dropped in a tub. Be gentle with your guinea pig, stroking and talking to him or her to the bathing area.

Only wash one guinea pig at a time as when they are frustrated they may hurt/aggravate each other. While this may make the process longer, it is a much safer way to go through the bathing process and you will be able to pay attention to a singular guinea pig better than two at a time.

, You will need a suitable guinea pig shampoo and/or conditioner recommended by your vet (preferably a critter care brand), a shallow basin or wash tub, a dry towel, guinea pig brush and an optional hair dryer.

If you don't have a shallow tub, you can easily bathe your guinea pig in a normal bath or sink as long as it is safe and comfortable for your guinea pigs. If you're using a sink then make sure your guinea pig cannot run off the edge of the counter to injure themselves.

, Remember to gently stroke and soothe your guinea pig as you bring them over. You could also bring your guinea pig over in a small box, but make sure you do not bring them back to their cage in the same box unless you wash it out first--it will get as dirty as your guinea pig when you bring them over to the bath., You should only fill your container to about one inch of warm water that should come up to your guinea pigs feet. Any higher and they have the risk of inhaling the water into their lungs.

The water shouldn't be hot as their skin are sensitive but it also shouldn't be cold otherwise you run the risk of your guinea pig catching a cold! Warm water is safest for your guinea pig.

, Allow your guinea pig time to get adjusted to this new, wet environment. Never leave your guinea pig unattended inside the bath as complications may occur.

Keep your guinea pig calm and give them a treat or two to let them know they are in a safe environment.

, Rinse your guinea pigs body until their fur is wet. Avoid water contact to the face and ears, especially the nose and mouth. Try using your hands to rinse your guinea pigs fur which can be a calmer option to pouring a cup of water over them.

You can cup your hand behind your guinea pigs face to avoid getting water on their ears and face region
If your guinea pigs face is extremely dirty, use a damp washcloth to wipe off the dirt but avoid the eyes, nose, ears and mouth. Never pour water straight over their face as they can become very stressed and inhale the water.

, Pour a small amount of guinea pig formulated shampoo into your hands and gently wash it into your guinea pigs fur. Remember not to be too rough as their skin is sensitive. Again, avoid the face and ears region. Carefully wash the rump and body, including the belly., Pour warm water over your guinea pig or hold them under a gentle stream of warm water. Ensure that all the suds are gone and the soap has been fully washed off of your guinea pig's fur. Dry shampoo can cause skin irritation., Wrap them up so that the towel absorbs most of the moisture and keeps your guinea pig staying warm. Do not be alarmed if your guinea pig starts shivering - this is natural and they should stop after they have been fully dried.

Replace your towel when/if it dampens.

, You should gently wipe your guinea pigs eyes, ears and nose only if required and they are particularly dirty. Use a damp cloth to get rid of gunky bits collected on the face. If you haven't done this before, ask your vet to show you how to properly clean your guinea pig's ears, nose and eyes.

Be gentle and take precautions. Do not cause friction or roughness. You should be blotching at the face, not rubbing. Be extra careful with the eyes ensuring you don't poke them.

, This is especially important if you have a long-haired guinea pig. You want to make sure to get all the tangles out of their fur to prevent matted fur from developing, which is much harder to untangle and may need to be cut off., Although hair dryers are effective, they don't have to be used to dry your guinea pig, especially if it causes them to freak out or become stressed. To use your hair dryer on your guinea pig, put it on the lowest heat setting and the lowest speed. Continue to brush your guinea pig while using the hair dryer.

Do not rely on a heating pad to keep your guinea pig warm or dry. Guinea pigs have sensitive feet along with their skin. Heat pads have the chance of damaging the feet.

, You should at least clean your cage once a week. Some guinea pig owners like to spot clean daily and do a full clean every 2-3 days due to the amount of mess guinea pigs make. Clean the bedding, fleece, water/food dishes and any soiled patches., Spot cleaning is where you clean up little patches of dirt throughout the cage such as soiled patches, dropping and spills. Spot cleaning can be extremely effective in keeping the cage clean and can help save money on bedding and hay., If your guinea pig's hutch is set on dirt, consider moving to either grass or pavement, especially during colder months. Dirt can turn into mud and thus create a difficult situation for your guinea pig to stay clean, even when the dry is dry., Newspaper and hay aren't absorbent enough to be used as a type of bedding. They do not absorb the urine and are difficult in eliminating odours. Fleece, wood shavings and/or careFresh are common bedding types to use that help keep the cage clean and fresh., Puppy pads or newspaper should be lined underneath your bedding for extra absorbency and to catch any leaks., Long-haired breeds such as Shelties must have their fur brushed daily to prevent matted fur from developing. Short-haired breeds don't require brushing, however, it is effective in reducing hair shedding onto the fleece."

Take a piece of string.,
Find a carrot that is suitable for the guinea pig.,
Slide the string through the carrot.

,
Knot it at the bottom so that the carrot stays on the string.,
Tie the top of the string to the top of the cage.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Guinea Pig Toy1," Depending on how tall your cage is, make the string is long enough for the guinea pig to reach it without hurting itself.;
, Give it a wash and a quick dry. Poke a small hole in the middle of the carrot.

,, Make sure the knot is strong enough that when the guinea pig pulls the carrot, it won't fall off. Make it a double knot if needed.

, It is better if the string, or, twine, is holding the carrot just out of reach, to force your piggie to stretch. Now your little friend has a toy and a treat.

Play with your pig!",How to Make a Guinea Pig Run," You can use many materials:



C&C cage grids. These can be joined either with connectors or zip ties if you want a flexible fence. These are simple to make even for a beginner, and can easily be expanded as desired.
Wood and mesh fences. These types of runs are harder to make, but may look better, depending on the area. Make sure the wood has not been treated with poisonous chemicals, and is a type of wood safe for guinea pigs. Cut the wood to size, nail it together in the desired shape, and attach the mesh. Keep in mind that your piggies may chew on the wood or even urinate on it, so be prepared to take care of it in these situations.
Pre-packaged runs. These are easy to set up and use, but may be expensive. Follow the directions on the package to assemble, and ensure that they're safe for your pigs before use.
Plastic mesh or chicken wire. Make sure that the mesh is small enough that the guinea pig cannot get through or get their head stuck in the mesh. Additionally, ensure that no sharp ends are poking out that could potentially injure your pig. This works best on a lawn, as you can use tent pegs to secure it to the ground.;
, Zip tie your grids together, assemble the wood, or put together the run as instructed on the package.

, Check for places your guinea pig's head could get stuck, possible escape points, sharp edges, and anything else that could cause injury.

,


If the temperature is between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit, you may wish to set up the run outside. If so, choose a shady area with no poisonous plants nearby.
If you choose to have your guinea pig play inside, choose an open area where you have space to set up the run. Make sure that it is out of direct sunlight, and that your guinea pig won't be able to escape anywhere.

, Simply unfold and place the grids, or place the cage in the area you chose.

, If your guinea pigs enjoy chewing, newspaper alone isn't a good choice as they may eat it. You can lay down newspaper with a layer of fleece, towels, or something similar to absorb any accidents your pigs may have.

, Get creative, and build obstacle courses or mazes if you wish. Try putting in some toilet paper rolls, crumpled newspaper, or similar items for your pigs to poke at and enjoy.

, Water and hay are crucial to your pig's health, so always have a bowl or bottle of water and a pile of hay in the run somewhere your guinea pig can easily access it. Put in a bowl of pellets if the guinea pigs will be there a long time.

, Pipes, hides, and tunnels will provide fun running through, and make guinea pigs feel more secure. Guinea pigs are prey animals, so shelter is a must -- especially when they're exploring a new and exciting area.

, Place it gently in the enclosed area.

, Especially when introduced to a new area, your guinea pig may be frightened and simply run to a shelter to hide. Give it time, and it may decide to come out and explore eventually.


If it doesn't come out to play, don't be discouraged. Try again for the next few days, and soon your guinea pig will realize that there's nothing to be afraid of.

, Feel free to sit down inside the run and let it hop up on your lap. Bribe it with treats, or practice training to enhance the session.

Keep a box of disposable gloves to use when cleaning your guinea pig's cage.,
When cleaning your guinea pig's cage, gently take the guinea pig out and set it aside in a box or a playpen where it can't get out or hurt itself.",How to Keep a Guinea Pig Cage from Stinking1," Be sure your guinea pig isn't allergic to the type of bedding you are giving it or you might hurt its health. Set a budget so that you know how often you can afford to purchase bedding.;
, In order to prevent diseases or infections entering your body through your guinea pig's waste, you must protect yourself with gloves and not touch the soiled bedding with bare hands.

, Make sure the area you are temporarily placing it in is safe and secure. If you have other pets, close the door to where your guinea pig is while cleaning its cage.


It's recommended you place your guinea pig where you can keep an eye on it while cleaning its cage, preferably in the same room you are in.
If you think you can let the guinea pig roam around in its cage while you're spot cleaning the cage, let the guinea pig stay instead of moving it. This will minimize risk of it hurting itself or getting free. However, when completely cleaning out the cage, you must keep the guinea pig out of your way, especially when you wipe the cage bottom.

Look for the needed supplies for the guinea pig.,
Buy your housing materials.,
Purchase food supplies.,
Purchase a brush.,
Add the bedding.,
Place the hide-out, food bowls, and chew toys in the cage.,
Open the cage and hang the hay rack on the inside of the cage on the cage bars.,
Fill the food bowls and the hay rack, and make sure the water bottle/s are filled, according to the instructions given with the bottle.",How to House a Pet Guinea Pig," Find a pet store, not a regular store, and make sure they have quality items that won't break on you. This is important, because for example, if the cage breaks, you're in trouble until you can find a new one.;
, Make sure that you get materials first and then select your guinea pig/s so you have enough time to put them in a good place in your house. Be sure you have enough money as well. Here's a list to help you buy the right materials.


A cage (the best kind is with a plastic bottom and metal cage bars) - If you plan on having 1 guinea pig, purchase the smaller size they have. If you plan on having 2 or 3 guinea pigs, purchase a larger option. Make sure you don't confuse guinea pig cages with hamster cages, as guinea pig cages are much bigger. They're more like the size of a rabbit hutch, since guinea pigs can get pretty big.
Bedding - Steer clear of wood-chip beddings - guinea pigs are allergic to cedar. There will be other types of wood-chip beddings, but they aren't the best at locking in odor, and your guinea pig/s will chew on the bedding and ingest it, which is detrimental to their health. Choose a paper-based bedding. Try not to get the ones that are dyed - that also isn't very good for a guinea pig's health.
Hide-out (place for guinea pigs to hide and rest in) - Guinea pigs like a hide-out to sleep in and rest in, so make sure you purchase one. A wooden hide-out is the best option, as they can and will chew on it, which will provide as a kind of chew toy. A plastic option is okay too, but it's not so good for the guinea pig/s to chew on. Make sure it's big enough to fit the number of guinea pigs you want to take care of.
Chew toys - Buy a few additional chew toys for your guinea pig/s. Their front teeth grow like beaver's teeth, and they need to chew on something to keep them at a good length. Wooden chew toys with little or no coloring is your best bet.

, In addition to purchasing dry food, you will also want to have some fresh fruits and veggies lying around, such as lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, celery, watermelon, grapes, etc. Here is a food list to help you along.


Dry food - Purchase dry food that has not only pellets, but also some dried things, such as dried cranberries and seeds. These types of dry food are better for your guinea pig/s and the guinea pig/s will enjoy something besides pellets. Make sure the food also has vitamin C supplements - guinea pigs don't make much of their own, and they need a supplement.
Hay - Your guinea pig/s also need hay to eat. Your best bet is timothy hay. Make sure you get a hay rack for the hay too. A metal hay rack is the best option since they will likely chew on a wooden rack and break it or swallow some of it.
Water bottles - Purchase glass water bottles and get the bigger option since the small one wouldn't have much space. Purchase a water bottle for guinea pigs, not hamsters. A guinea pig bottle is about the same size as a bottle for a rabbit. If you want, you can put vitamin C tablets in the water instead of purchasing food with vitamin C supplements. Guinea pigs can be given normal tap water. If it's okay for you to drink, it's okay for them. Another option is giving them water from a filter.
Treats - Get a small bag of treats for your guinea pig. Treats can be given once or twice a week, and guinea pigs enjoy them quite a bit.
Food bowls - Consider getting a ceramic food bowl, since it can't be chewed on and will last you a very long time. If you get more than one guinea pig, buy 2 food bowls.

, Brushing your guinea pig's hair is very important, especially if they are long-haired. Brushing guinea pigs' hair will also prevent knots and hairballs.

, Take off the top of the cage and pour in the bedding. Spread it out until you have an even, 1-inch layer of bedding. This will be enough for 2-3 weeks, depending on the number of guinea pigs you have.

, Make sure to arrange them so the guinea pig/s will have space to run around and get to all parts of the cage. Put the top of the cage back on by clamping it down.

, Follow the instructions given with the water bottle/s you purchased to place them on the outside of the cage.

, Place a mat or an old clean rug underneath the cage if you have a wooden floor to prevent scratches (guinea pigs can actually move the cage overnight).

Spot clean your guinea pig's cage at least once a day.,
Change the bedding in your guinea pig's ""potty spot"" throughout the week.,
On the last day of the week, completely clean the cage.,
Once the soiled bedding has been cleared out and placed in a small trash bag, immediately dispose of the trash bag in a proper and hygienic manner that will ensure your own safety and health.,
Place your guinea pig back in the cage once it's ready for it.,
Dispose of the gloves and put on a new, clean pair to use while replacing your guinea pig's bedding.,
Finally, dispose of the gloves that you used to replace your guinea pig's bedding.",How to Keep a Guinea Pig Cage from Stinking2," In other words, discard pieces of soiled bedding and replace them with fresh bedding. However, when spot cleaning your guinea pig's cage, you don't need to clear out all the bedding.


If you find that you don't have time to spot clean once a day, do it at least four to five times a week to keep it clean.

, Guinea pigs tend to have a certain spot that they use most often. In order to maintain your guinea pig's health - as well as your own - and prevent possible infection, it's important that you keep this spot fresh and clean instead of letting a week pass before cleaning it up.

, This means you must clear out all the bedding in your guinea pig's cage, soiled or not soiled. Before you perform this task, wash your hands well with soap and water. Make sure you are wearing disposable gloves to prevent getting an infection or illness from the soiled bedding.

, Then, before you place new bedding into the cage, scrub the cage bottom with a solution of half water and half vinegar to kill the germs.

, Make sure everything is back in its place in the cage before replacing the guinea pig. Shut the cage door firmly and make sure it is latched securely before leaving the guinea pig.

, Put in at least an inch of bedding in the cage. If your guinea pig doesn't use the bedding very much, you can put in a little less than an inch to save money and prevent the unused bedding from going to waste.

, Wash your hands well with soap and water to kill any germs that may be on your hands. Even though you wore gloves to protect yourself, that doesn't necessarily mean that your hands are still clean. It's better to be safe than sorry.

Create a cleaning schedule.,
Remove the guinea pig from the cage.,
Remove all toys and dishes.,
Remove the bedding from the cage.,
Remove the newspaper lining.,
Make a solution of vinegar and water.,
Spray the sides and bottom of the cage with the solution.,
Rinse the cage and wipe it dry.,
Clean all toys and dishes.,
Line the bottom of the cage with newspaper.,
Pour new bedding over the newspaper.,
Replace the clean toys and dishes.,
Place the guinea pig back in its cage.,
Clean up after floor time.",How to Clean Out a Guinea Pig's Hutch," The more frequently you clean the cage, the easier the job will be in general. A cage should be thoroughly cleaned once or twice a week. Put a reminder on your calendar, so that you don't forget.


If you clean the cage twice a week or more, you will only need to do a thorough cleaning once a week.;
, You’ll need to take the guinea pig out in order to clean the cage. Guinea pigs love “floor time.” If you can, let the guinea pig roam around on the floor while you clean their cage. If your floor is not safe for them, you can put them in a bucket with tall sides.If you let your guinea pig have floor time, make sure there are no small places where it could escape to and get lost.
Be prepared to clean up after your guinea pig if it have floor time. It may leave a small mess behind.
Make sure the guinea pig still has access to food and water while out of its cage.

, Take the guinea pig’s toys out of the cage. Take out its food and water bowls, too. Look for any small toys it may have buried in the bedding. Put these in a tub or in the sink to be washed.If the guinea pig has disposable toys, such as an oatmeal container, throw these away.
Check for any wear and tear. If a toy has started degrading or getting chewed up, it should be replaced.

, You can use a whisk broom and a dustpan to remove hay or wood shavings. If your cage allows for it, you may be able to remove the entire bottom and simply dump it into the trash. If you use fleece or a towel as bedding simply remove it and put it in the washing machine.If you use wood shavings or hay, you can actually compost the bedding instead of throwing it out.
Wash towels or fleece with soap and hot water in the washing machine.

, You should always put a layer of newspaper at the bottom of the cage to line it. When you clean the cage, remove the newspaper and throw it away.If there are large or significantly wet spots on the newspaper, it means that you need to put more bedding in the cage, or that you need to clean it more frequently.
Never use plastic instead of newspaper. Guinea pigs can become sick if they accidentally ingest plastic.

, Mix 1 part white vinegar to 1 part water. White vinegar is non-toxic, but it’s a very effective cleaning agent. Stir these together and pour them into a spray bottle. One you have this solution mixed, you can store it indefinitely for future use.If you use a used spray bottle, make sure it is clean and free from any harsh chemicals.
Some people use a solution of 10% bleach and 90% water. However, bleach fumes can be dangerous for the guinea pig and should be avoided. If you must use bleach, always rinse it off well afterward.

, Spray the solution over all of the surfaces of the cage. Make sure you hit every surface, and be liberal with it. Let the vinegar solution sit for a few minutes to loosen debris that is stuck to the cage, the scrub the cage with a sponge.If a surface is proving hard to clean, make a paste with baking soda and water. Use the paste with an abrasive sponge to scrub away the caked-on debris.
You can also try using very hot water to clean the surfaces. Just make sure to also use vinegar solution afterward to sanitize the cage.

, Use a dry, clean towel or a paper towel. Wipe every surface dry so that no vinegar solution or water remains. You may need to use more than one towel or paper towel.Be sure that the bottom of the cage is completely dry. If it's damp when you replace the newspaper, the newspaper will get soggy.
Make sure to wash the towel you used to dry the cage. Even though the cage is clean, the towel should be considered dirty.

, Wash all of the toys and dishes with the same vinegar solution. You may want to wash these in the sink. You can spray the solution on them, wipe them with a sponge, and then rinse them in warm water. If the toys and dishes are hard to clean, you can wash them in hot water.
Don't submerge anything porous in water, such as fabric toys or toilet paper tubes. If these can't' be cleaned, throw them away.
Dry everything off with a towel afterward.

, Take some sheets of fresh newspaper. Lay them down to cover the bottom of the cage. Never use plastic, even if you think your guinea pig won’t get to it. This can be very dangerous for a guinea pig.Use a few sheets of newspaper so that there are a few layers between the bedding and the bottom of the cage.
Try to avoid shiny parts of the newspaper, such as ad sections. These are not very absorbent.

, Wood shavings, such as Aspen or CareFresh, are common types of bedding. You can also use hay, though that will not be as absorbent as wood shavings.Never use cedar shavings with guinea pigs. This can be bad for their health.
If you use fleece or towels, make sure they are clean and dry before placing them in the cage.

, Fill the food dish and water bottle up and place them back in the cage. Put the toys back in as well. If you’ve disposed of a toy such as an oatmeal container, you may want to replace it with something else.Everything should now be clean and dry. Check each item before you put it back in the cage.
You can add new toys every so often to keep your guinea pig stimulated.

, Your guinea pig will be thrilled to be back in its cozy, clean home. Pick it up gently and put it back in the cage. Be mindful to close the door so it won't escape., Your guinea pig might have made a mess on the floor. Sweep up any shavings or droppings it left behind. Wipe surfaces down with the same water and vinegar solution to sanitize the spaces where your guinea pig played.

Bring the dirty fleece into the washer.,
Take the fleece out to dry.,
Put your pet back in its cage to enjoy the clean cage.",How to Clean a Pet Cage with a Fleece Bottom," It would be very, very difficult to clean the cage with them in it. Besides, they would probably make it dirty while you are in the process of cleaning. A small animal playpen or carrier with a snuggle sack or blanket and some toys would be good to keep them out of the way while cleaning.;
, You can also use a dustpan and brush, but it will take longer and be much harder. Vacuum up all the feces on the fleece. If there are some that won't come off, you can shake the fleece outside. You want to get off as much as you can because the waste and litter isn't good for your washing machine.

, Wipe down the bottom of the cage without the fleece on it. This way, you will get the urine that leaked through the fleece, so bacteria doesn't grow and make your pet sick.

, Also wipe this down with the washcloth.

,, Take out your other blanket of fleece and set up the whole cage over again. Make sure you use the spare piece of fleece and not the one that you just vacuumed!

, For the soap, use a bacteria eliminator, not a fabric softener! This will put a layer on the fleece, and prevent it from being waterproof.

, It's better if it gets air dried because putting it in the dryer will have the risk of shrinking the fleece.

, Next time you clean the cage, you can use the fleece that should now be air drying.

Purchase thick wool in a bright color.,
Start making the body of the toy.,
Stop wrapping when the body of the toy is thick enough.,
Tie a piece of wool around the middle of the loops.,
Finish the body of toy.,
Cinch the strands in for safety.,
Hang the toy up and let your guinea pig enjoy!",How to Make a Dangling Guinea Pig Toy1," In order to stimulate you guinea pig into action, be sure to choose a playful, bright color of yarn. This will look more interesting to your guinea pig and will brighten up their enclosure. You also want to make sure to choose a yarn with wool that is not too thin, since guinea pigs tend to want to chew on things and thin wool won’t stand up to their teeth., To do this you are going to want to find an object to wrap the wool around that is small and fairly rigid, like a small cardboard box. Keep in mind you don’t want to choose an object that is too big, since this size of the box determines the amount of yarn wrapped around it, and you don’t want this part of the toy to be too big. Wrap the wool around the object once and tie tightly. Don't worry if it's not an extremely tight knot, it will still work. Continue to wrap the wool around the object, with each loop approximately on top of the last., You want the toy to be thick and plush, but if you use too much wool, the toy will be too bulky or heavy for your guinea pig to play with easily. As you determine how many loops are necessary, keep in mind that the thickness of the wool loops at this stage is about half the fatness of the finished toy. Depending on the size of your object and the thickness of your wool, this should be about 15 - 25 loops. When it is thick enough, cut the end of the wool from the ball of yarn, and don’t worry about tying that end off., Use a double knot, and tie it as tightly as you can. It may loosen a bit if you are doing this unassisted, but that’s okay. This is where using a box or other rigid item comes in handy, as it's easy to slide the wool under. If you wrapped the wool around a rounder object, use your fingers to push the tie under the loops., Now that the body is tied in the middle, turn over the object you wrapped the wool around and cut the loops. Try to cut exactly opposite from where your tie was in order to keep the dangling wool pieces even. If your scissors don’t cut through all of the wool at once, do it in sections, making sure the cuts are as straight as possible. When you are finished cutting, remove the loops from the box. You should now have a thick chunk of straight, even wool strands that are tied in the middle., Even though it will be dangling and the wool strands are tied, it is still possible for a clever guinea pig to pull loose strands out and eat them, which could be dangerous. In order to avoid this and make the toy safe, flip the body of the toy over so the middle tie is at the top. Take another strand of wool and tie this together around the bottom of the strands. You want to make sure this second tie is close to the bottom., Measure a piece of string that is long enough for the toy to dangle where your guinea pig can reach it, without being so easy to get to that it’s not exercising your pet. It is recommended that you cut a piece that is too long and trim it down later as you string it up. Take this long piece of wool and tie it through the middle of the toy body. Tie the other end to the roof of your guinea pig cage, and watch your guinea pigs enjoy their new toy!"

Provide chewing toys.,
Create hiding spots.,
Give toys that can be pushed and knocked around.,
Use toys made for other animals.,
Introduce new toys regularly.",How to Choose Toys for a Guinea Pig1," Your guinea pig's teeth are constantly growing. If the teeth become too long, it can be difficult for your guinea pig to eat and chew properly. Chew toys are for recreation and for the dental health of your pet. Chew toys are usually made from hard, natural materials like untreated (i.e. no paint, paint, or tarnish) wood.If your guinea pig's teeth become overgrown, see your veterinarian. This can be a serious condition.A chew toy is essential. If you do not give your guinea pig a proper chew toy, it will bite anything that it can such as cage bars, food bowls, etc.
Willow sticks and fruit tree sticks can also be used as chew toys.;
, Guinea pigs love to explore and play. Tubes, tunnels, and hidey houses provide a space to hide, sleep, and get away from their cage mates. Hiding spots create a sense of safety for your pig. Wooden tunnels and houses are nice because your guinea pig can chew on them as well.If you have more than one guinea pig in your cage, there should be a hiding place for each pig and a neutral hiding place. For example, if there are two pigs in the cage, you would need at least three hiding places.Stay away from items made with plastic or smooth rubber. Your guinea pig can easily chew through these materials and swallow them.

, Your guinea pig will love to push and play with a ball made from wood, wicker, or grass. In addition to pushing, your guinea pig will chew and bite the balls.Because of this, balls made from natural materials are ideal.


Your guinea pig will also like tennis balls or ping pong balls.Children's blocks are also a good option. These blocks are usually non-toxic and are too big to choke on., While there are toys made for guinea pigs, some cat, bird, and ferret toys are suitable for your guinea pig. When you shop at the pet store or online, you can check out the toys made for all of these different animals. Whatever toys you choose, make sure that they do not have small parts that can easily be swallowed.As far as cat toys, the balls with the bells on the inside can be given to your guinea pig.
Guinea pigs also enjoy hanging bird toys with bells on the end. Hang a small bungee cord or string across a corner in the cage and hang the bird toy. You can secure the toy using pipe cleaners or cable ties.
Your guinea pig may also enjoy ferret tunnels and hammocks.
If you are unsure about a toy, ask your veterinarian if it is safe to use.

, Guinea pig's enjoy a variety of toys. However, too many toys in the cage is not a good idea. Your pig still needs space to run around and exercise. Keep one to three toys in the cage at a time. For example, one cave, one tunnel, and a chew toy.If your cage is large, you may be able to accommodate more than three toys at a time.
You can also try different amounts of toys in the cage to see how your guinea pig responds. Each guinea pig has a unique personality.

Be aware that if your guinea pig is prone to nervousness or skittishness, it may try to squirm out of your hands and jump, which can lead to serious injury.;
, Once your guinea pig is properly restrained, move it into a safe, enclosed space from which it can't escape. Make sure somebody is around watching your guinea pig, and that there are no loud noises around that may scare it. Someone can hold your guinea pig, if you want.

, Long-haired guinea pigs need to be brushed daily.If you need to groom or bathe your guinea pig, it may be easiest to do so while your pet is out of its cage.


Unless your guinea pig has gotten sticky or smelly, it should only need to be bathed a maximum of 2-3 times per year., Your pet should be used to having a designated hiding place in its permanent cage. When you remove your guinea pig from its home, it may become frightened. If you can't fit its permanent hiding place into the temporary enclosed space, make a small temporary space by cutting the bottom out of a cardboard box., Remove excess food and waste and spot-clean the cage as needed with a wet paper towel. Scoop out any soiled bedding and replace it with dry, fresh bedding.

, This should be done every single day. If your guinea pig spills water into the food dish, remove that food and replenish the dish with fresh, dry food.

, Doing this every day will help prevent bacteria from growing in the food and water receptacles., Though daily maintenance and spot-cleaning are necessary, you will also need to thoroughly clean out your guinea pig's cage once every week. This will ensure that your guinea pig is healthy and happy, and its environment is odor-free.

, When you're doing a thorough cage cleaning, remove all of your pet's toys, as well as its food bowl, water bottle, and hiding place.

, A guinea pig will often get pieces of bedding and/or droppings into its food bowl, so it's important to clean food and water bowls regularly.Empty out any leftover food and water. Then run some hot water and submerge the water bottle and food bowl. Leave them in the sink to dry while you clean out the cage.
If your pet's hiding place can be washed, it's a good idea to rinse it off as well.

, Carefully brush everything into the bag, removing all substrate material from the enclosure.For really big cages, it is handy to have a cat-poop scooper to scrape out the cage. Do not use the same one as your cat, dog or other pet.

, You can use a mild detergent, or mix three-parts warm water and one-part distilled white vinegar.You can also use 1 part bleach to 32 parts water (1/2 cup bleach to 1 gallon of water).For deeper stains and messes, use undiluted vinegar, but make sure to clean off well afterwards!
Allow the disinfectant to sit on the surface for 10 minutes so that it has time to work, killing bacteria and other harmful elements., After allowing the disinfectant to sit, thoroughly rinse off every surface of the cage with hot water. Make sure there is no residue from the disinfectant on any surface., If you have the time, you can let it air dry. It's important to be sure your guinea pig's cage is completely dry before laying down the newspaper and bedding, as dampness can quickly cause a mold problem that can lead to illness for your pet., You should make the bedding about 1-3 inches deep, or 2.5-7.6 centimeters.


You should never use cedar or pine shavings. Though these wood chips are often sold for use in cages, they actually contain chemicals which can be harmful to your guinea pig.Generally speaking, hay makes a good bedding choice. But damp hay can harbor fungal growth, and dry, dusty hay could cause respiratory problems., Putting down new bedding and newspaper on a damp surface can quickly lead to mold and fungus growth in the cage.

, Hide your pet's favorite treats in paper towel rolls or hang them up by a piece of string. (But make sure your piggy can reach it!)

, Remember that guinea pigs need a constant temperature, and your pet's cage should not be exposed to direct sources of heat or cold.It's best to keep the room temperature from dropping below 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21.1 degrees Celsius) or getting above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32.2 degrees Celsius)."

Assemble the materials.,
Measure and cut your nylon string.,
Attach the clothespin.,
Hang the clothespin up.,
Finely chop your food treats.,
Clip the treats in the clothespin.",How to Make a Dangling Guinea Pig Toy2," Food is a great motivator for guinea pigs, and dangling food from the middle of their cage is sure to wake them up and get them in a playful mood. If you don’t already have these materials at your house, purchase them from a local craft store. You will need:A piece of thin nylon string
A few clothespins that have a loose grip (old or worn clothespins work great for this)
Thinly cut vegetable slices

, You want to make sure that you cut a length of string that will have the clothespin dangle at about 4 - 6 inches (10 - 15 cm) above the floor of your guinea pig cage. You it to be low enough so that your guinea pig is able to reach the treats, but high enough that they have to work for it a little bit so it is fun for them. Keep in mind that the length of string will also need to accommodate for the knots being tied at the top of the cage and around the clothespin, as well as the length of the clothespin itself. It is recommended that you cut a piece of string that is too long and then trim it down later after you string it up., Take your clothespin and tie it to the nylon string. Make sure to double-knot this, as you don’t want this string to detach, causing the whole thing to fall into the cage. Tie the clothespin so that it dangles relatively evenly when you hold the sting up. If it is too off balance to one side or the other, retie the string., Now that the clothespin is attached to the string, it will be easier to tell what the appropriate length for the rest of the string should be. Dangle the toy to the appropriate height for your guinea pig, and tie the top portion of the string to the roof of your guinea pig cage. Trim off any excess string., Guinea pigs are omnivores, and they love fresh fruit and herbs. Take vegetables like cucumber and carrots and thinly slice them lengthwise into long, super thin slices. Feel free to also add some small sprigs of parsley or cilantro as well. You just want to make sure the strips are thin enough that the guinea pig teeth can easily chomp through them so that there is no choking hazard., Now that your veggies are prepared, clip them into the already dangling clothespin (this is easier than trying to keep the veggies in while tying up the toy). Don’t overload the toy, since loose veggies will just fall out, and that’s not very fun for your guinea pig. Once the treats are clipped in, introduce your guinea pig to the dangling treats, and watch them enjoy playing and eating their new toy! Refill with veggies whenever you want your guinea pig to have some activity."

Fill an item with hay.,
Create a cardboard box cave.,
Create a tunnel.,
Make a towel tent.",How to Choose Toys for a Guinea Pig2," Fill a clean sock with hay (e.g.Timothy hay). You can tie the sock with another piece of fabric or sew the top of the sock to close it. Your guinea pig can push the sock around or use it as a pillow. You could also fill a lunch bag with hay.


This is a good alternative to giving your guinea pig stuffed animals. The filling used in stuffed animals can be dangerous for your guinea pig.You can also stuff a tennis ball in the toe of the sock and then fill the rest of the sock with hay.
Avoid bleached lunch bags.

, Cardboard boxes can be used to create a fun hiding place for your guinea pig. Turn the cardboard box upside down and cut a few holes in the box. The size of the box you use will depend on the size of your guinea pig. Your pig should be able to move in and out of the box without getting stuck.You can fill the box with hay, fruit, or vegetables for your guinea pig to eat. The treats in the box will encourage your guinea pig to move around and explore.
The cardboard house will also be a good hiding spot for your guinea pig. A hiding spot will help your pig feel safe and cozy.
Shoe boxes, tissue boxes, and soda can boxes can also be used to make a cave.Choose boxes that do not have a lot of ink or paint on them.

, An old oatmeal container, toilet paper roll, or paper towel roll can be turned into a tunnel for your guinea pig. Remove the interior and exterior labeling to keep you guinea pig from eating it. If you are using an oatmeal container, cut the bottom out of the container and wipe down the inside with a clean cloth to remove any food residue.


Cut away any sharp areas before you place the tunnel in the cage.
You can fill the tunnel with Timothy Hay or another treat that your guinea pig likes.
Cut a slit the length of the tube to prevent your guinea pig from getting stuck in the tube., Cut or fold a large bath towel into the shape of a triangle. In the corner of the cage, loop two ends of the triangle through the cage wires. You can secure the loops with safety pins of binder clips. Your guinea pig can now hide under the tent.Make sure there are no hanging threads on the towel. Your guinea pig will likely chew and possibly swallow the thread if left hanging.
This is a great option because it does not take up a lot of space in the cage and you can easily wash the towel and replace it.
An old-t-shirt can also be used to make this tent.

Avoid exercise wheels.,
Clean toys regularly.,
Monitor your guinea pig's behavior.,
Use safe fabrics.",How to Choose Toys for a Guinea Pig3," Many pet stores sell these items and say that they are safe for guinea pigs. However, guinea pigs cannot bend their backs. Placing your guinea pig in a hamster wheel or ball is very dangerous. Playing with these toys can cause back pain, spinal injuries,and foot injuries.Your guinea pig has different anatomy than similar animals like hamsters, gerbils, and mice.
Although some wheels will say ""for guinea pigs,"" do not buy them., Clean your guinea pig's toys every time you clean out the cage. This will prevent bacteria from building up on the toys. Wash non-wood toys with soapy water and allow them to dry.Toys made from paper products should be thrown away and replaced as these toys will become damaged if you put water on them.


Clean the toys and the cage every week.Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe down toys.
Change out toys when you clean them to keep your guinea pig from getting bored.
Wash your hands before and after you clean the toys., If you notice that your guinea pig has begun to drool, scratch excessively, or is inactive, you may need to make adjustments to the play environment. If your guinea pig is drooling, you may not have given it enough things to chew and nibble on. If your guinea pig is scratching a lot, you may need to clean out the cage and toys. If your guinea pig is inactive, it may be bored, and it's time to give it some new toys.Anytime you introduce a new toy, watch to see if your guinea pig enjoys the new toy or if it appears uninterested.
Even though you give your guinea pig specific toys for chewing, it will chew on anything that it can. As a general rule, do not give your guinea pig anything that is not safe to chew., Your guinea pig will chew any fabric that you place in it's cage. Blizzard and Alpine fleece are ideal because these fabrics fall into pieces when chewed. Fleece will not develop strings. If your guinea pig eats some of the fleece pieces, it will not become impacted.Fabric becomes wet and soiled easily, so you will need to change the fleece at least once a week.Wash fleece with unscented laundry detergent with hot water."

Feed your guinea pig fresh, moist vegetables.,
Include grass hay in your guinea pig’s diet.,
Give your guinea pig fresh water.,
Add plain yogurt to your guinea pig’s diet.,
Consider giving your guinea pig a probiotic.,
Add a vitamin C supplement to your guinea pig’s diet.,
Do not feed your guinea pig sweet, starchy foods.,
Observe an increased appetite and fecal output.,
Feed gruel to your guinea pig.",How to Treat Gastrointestinal Problems in Guinea Pigs1," Changing your guinea pig’s diet is one of the best ways to improve your guinea pig’s GI health. Fresh and moist green vegetables will give your guinea pig the roughage it needs to keep food moving through its GI tract. Examples of green vegetables are parsley, spinach, collard greens, and romaine lettuce.Vegetables are a good source of important nutrients, like vitamin C.
Rinse the vegetables to remove pesticides. After rinsing, chop the vegetables into small pieces that your guinea pig can eat easily.
Regularly remove uneaten vegetables from your guinea pig's cage to prevent food spoilage.;
, Grass hay is another great source of roughage for a guinea pig.Examples of grass hay are timothy hay, orchard grass, and oat hay. Give your guinea pig unlimited grass hay. Also, feed your guinea pig different types of grass hay so it doesn’t get bored with just one type.Grass hay helps a guinea pig digest its food. Place the hay in a small rack in the cage so the hay doesn't get contaminated with urine or feces.Look for hay at your local pet store. The hay should be green and soft.

, Fresh water is very important to a guinea pig’s diet. Make sure your guinea pig has access to fresh water at all times. If your guinea pig is not able to drink water on its own, your vet will give it fluids by injection.Moist green vegetables will help your guinea pig drink more water., Your guinea pig’s GI tract has a population of healthy (good) bacteria. With a GI problem, there is more bad bacteria than good bacteria. Yogurt has a lot of good bacteria that can help your guinea pig’s GI tract become healthy again. Talk with your vet before adding yogurt to your guinea pig’s diet.Your vet can recommend which yogurt to choose and how much yogurt to feed your guinea pig.

, Probiotics are products containing large amounts of healthy bacteria.Like yogurt, probiotics can increase the amount of good bacteria in your guinea pig’s GI tract. However, probiotics have not been shown to be very effective in small pets like guinea pigs.Talk with your vet about giving your guinea pig a probiotic.

, Vitamin C is an important nutrient for guinea pigs that they must get from their diet. If your guinea pig GI’s problem has caused it to stop eating, it will be deficient in vitamin C.In addition to getting vitamin C from foods like dark leafy greens, your vet may recommend a vitamin C supplement for your guinea pig.


Follow your vet’s instructions for adding the vitamin C supplement to your guinea pig’s diet.

, Sugary, starchy foods are not good for guinea pigs.Examples of high-sugar foods to avoid are grapes, raisins, and bananas., With a fresh, healthy diet, your guinea pig should start feeling better, eating more, and pooping more.However, if your guinea pig’s appetite doesn’t improve and you don’t see more feces in the cage, talk to your vet about other feeding options.

, If your guinea pig is unable or unwilling to eat food on its own, you will need to feed it with a syringe. Specific gruel products, like Oxbow Critical Care, provide nutrition for guinea pigs until they get their appetites back and start producing feces again.Use a 1 milliliter syringe to feed your guinea pig. Holding your guinea pig, place the syringe into the back corner of its mouth. Slowly empty about ¼ of the syringe at a time into your guinea pig’s mouth. Allow your guinea pig to swallow the gruel before feeding it more.If purchasing this gruel is not convenient for you, make your own gruel using food your guinea pig would normally eat. For example, grind up guinea pig pellets and mix them together with vegetables and water to make a gruel."

Recognize the clinical signs of conjunctivitis.,
Take your guinea pig to the veterinarian.,
Follow treatment instructions.,
Schedule follow-up appointments.,
Select a dust-free bedding.,
Keep your house clean.,
Reduce your guinea pig’s stress levels.",How to Treat Conjunctivitis on Guinea Pigs," If your guinea pig’s eyelids look pink or red around the edges, you can be pretty sure that he has conjunctivitis. You may also see different types of discharge coming from the eye: thick and yellow (indicates infection) or clear and watery. The entirety of the infected eye will look swollen and inflamed.Because of the irritation, your guinea pig will scratch his eyes, which makes the conjunctivitis worse.Your guinea pig’s eyelids might also be sticky due to the buildup of dried discharge.You may notice hair missing under your guinea pig’s lower eyelids. If something got in your guinea pig’s eyes and blocked the tear ducts, the tear fluid would end up constantly spilling onto the lower eyelid. The hair would fall out because of the constant wetness.Since guinea pigs like to root around in their bedding, your guinea pig may have gotten some bedding stuck in his eye that has caused inflammation and irritation.It probably wouldn’t be too hard to see bedding in his eye.;
, You may tempted to go to your local pet store, find some eye drops or eye ointment, and treat your guinea pig yourself. This is not a good idea, though—guinea pigs can be very sensitive to eye medications and develop allergic reactions to them. Go see your veterinarian first before doing any at-home treatments.If your guinea pig has something stuck in his eye, do not remove it! This will do more harm than good.Your veterinarian will be able to remove the object safely.
Conjunctivitis is most commonly caused by a bacteria (e.g., Bordatella, Streptococcus, Chlamydia).Only your veterinarian will be able to identify which bacteria is causing the conjunctivitis.
Your veterinarian will diagnose conjunctivitis by looking at the eyes and taking a sample of the discharge to identify which bacteria is causing the condition., When your veterinarian has diagnosed conjunctivitis, he or she will prescribe an antibiotic eye ointment or eye drop. Your guinea pig will also need an antiseptic eyewash for cleaning the eyes. To treat your guinea pig’s eyes, wrap him snugly in a towel to restrain him and give him the medications as instructed by your veterinarian.Have a soft, clean towel nearby to gently dry your guinea pig’s eyes after you clean and treat them.
Even if your guinea pig’s eyes start to look better, continue to treat them according to your veterinarian’s instructions. Stopping the treatment too soon may not kill all of the bacteria, leaving your guinea pig susceptible to getting sick again.
If you are unsure about how to treat your guinea pig’s eyes, have your veterinarian demonstrate the proper technique before you leave the veterinary office.
You may need to treat your guinea pig’s conjunctivitis for up to a few weeks.

, Your veterinarian will want to see your guinea pig at least once after the initial treatment to check his eyes. If your guinea pig’s eyes still look irritated, or there is still discharge coming from the eyes, your veterinarian will probably want you to keep treating the eyes at home. You may need to schedule several follow-up appointments to ensure your guinea pig’s conjunctivitis has been completely treated., Because guinea pigs like to root around in their bedding, they can get pieces of bedding or specks of dust in their eyes, both of which can cause irritation. Examples of dust free bedding are Carefresh, newspaper, and shredded paper.


Newspaper and shredded paper are not very absorbent and do not control odor. If you want to use paper bedding, you will need to use it along with a more absorbent bedding that also controls odor.
Polar fleece is also dust free and is becoming more popular as a bedding choice. Although it is good at wicking away urine, it should be used along with a more absorbent bedding, such as towels. Fleece bedding needs to be washed several times before use.
Do not use sawdust, since it is very dusty.Some wood shavings are low in dust, but the wood specks could get stuck in your guinea pig’s eyes.

, The cleaner your house, the lower the levels of bacteria in your home that could cause your guinea pig to develop conjunctivitis.Also, regularly dusting your home could lessen the chances of dust getting in your guinea pig’s eyes.


It may help to have a regular schedule of cleaning to make you don’t miss anything.

, In general, stress can weaken your guinea pig’s immune system and increase his risk of getting sick. Sudden changes to his routine, such as diet and playtime, can make your guinea pig feel stressed. Also, if you don’t hold him as much as you used to, or don’t hold him at the same time every day, he might feel stressed.Other than illness, signs of stress include depression, decreased activity, and possibly aggression.If you notice that sudden changes to his daily routine are stressing out your guinea pig, make the changes more slowly.
Whatever the cause of stress, try to identify it and remove and/or change it.

Give your guinea pig an antibiotic.,
Increase food movement through your guinea pig’s GI tract.,
Reduce your guinea pig’s pain.,
Relieve your guinea pig’s gas.",How to Treat Gastrointestinal Problems in Guinea Pigs2," Antibiotics called ‘broad spectrum’ antibiotics kill a wide range of bacteria.Guinea pigs are very sensitive to certain antibiotics, though, so your vet will be very careful with selecting an antibiotic for your guinea pig.Whichever antibiotic your vet prescribes, following the prescription instructions carefully.


Guinea pigs can develop a condition called antibiotic-associated enterotoxemia, which causes brown watery diarrhea, extreme dehydration, and hypothermia. Guinea pigs with this condition can die within one to two days of showing symptoms.If your guinea pig becomes extremely ill while on antibiotic treatment, take it your vet immediately.

, A diet high in roughage provides fiber that will help move food through the GI tract. Sometimes, though, a guinea pig may need medication to improve food movement. This medication should be used only if there is no obstruction or perforation (holes) in the GI tract.If food can’t move past the obstruction, the medication could worsen the GI problem.

, If your guinea pig’s abdomen is distended because of gas buildup, your guinea pig will be in a lot of pain. Your vet will prescribe a pain medication (carprofen, meloxicam) to relieve that pain.Pain can reduce food movement through the GI tract, which could worsen your guinea pig’s GI problem., Just relieving the gas-related pain won’t relieve the gas itself. A product called simethicone relieves gas.Other gas reliefs are also available, so your vet will recommend which product to use, and explain how to use it.


Your vet may want to perform a procedure to reduce the gas distension. For example, with your guinea pig anesthetized, your vet would insert a stomach tube down your guinea pig’s throat to its stomach to let the gas out."
"
Move your guinea pig’s cage to a dark, quiet area.,
Exercise your guinea pig each day.,
Have your vet trim your guinea pig’s teeth.",How to Treat Gastrointestinal Problems in Guinea Pigs3," Your guinea pig will feel pretty lousy when it has a GI problem. Before you begin treating your guinea pig, move its cage to a dark and quiet area of your home.This will help your guinea feel safe and comfortable as it recovers.


If your guinea pig has a cage mate, separate it from the cage mate until its treatment is complete.

, Exercise increases food movement through the GI tract. Exercise your guinea pig for 10 to 15 minutes about every 8 hours. You can either create a guinea pig-proof play area in your home or allow your guinea pig outside in an enclosed grazing area.To guinea pig-proof a room, remove all electrical wires and cords. Also, block access to stairs and cover all vents.In the outdoor grazing area, your guinea pig could nibble on grass, which would increase its roughage and fiber intake., Dental problems, especially overgrown incisors or molars, can make it difficult for a guinea pig to eat. If a guinea pig can’t eat, it may develop a GI problem.To prevent overgrown teeth, your vet can trim them.


Do not try to trim your guinea pig’s teeth by yourself. You could end up splitting the teeth and making the dental problem even worse.

Shake out the fleece to remove remaining debris.",How to Clean a Guinea Pig's Fleece Bedding1," At the end of each day, remove any loose stools or food you see on the bedding. You can use a plastic scoop, a small vacuum, or a small broom and dust pan. Pick up anything off the bedding that you can easily see., Hay often because strewn all over the floor of a guinea pig's cage. Hay can sometimes get onto fleece bedding. If you notice any hay on the bedding, pick it up and set it in a single corner., Curry combs are small rubber combs used to groom horses. Curry combs are also excellent tools for removing hair from fleece bedding. You can purchase a curry comb online. Simply run it over the bedding a few times after removing hay, pieces of food, and feces from the bedding. This should dislodge a lot of the trapped hair., Remove the fleece bedding from the cage. Give it a few good shakes. This will get rid of any lingering dust or debris you missed.Shake the bedding over a sink or outside to avoid getting your home dirty.

Understand the final treatment.",How to Treat Bumblefoot in Guinea Pigs," Because rough floors can lead to sores, creating a smoother floor can help your guinea pig get over bumblefoot. Wire-cage floors, plastic floors that have pieces jutting up, and other rough floors are all harmful to your guinea pig's feet. Wire-cage floors are the biggest culprit.A solid floor works best. You can look for a new cage that has an appropriate floor or try to find an insert for the cage that you have.
Canvas, plastic, or even coated metal are all appropriate choices for a solid floor. You should be able to find an insert specifically designed for your guinea pig's cage.;
, Increased bacteria can lead to more infection. Therefore, cleaning the cage more often can help decrease your guinea pig's chances of getting bumblefoot, as well as help with recovery if your pet already has it.Try to clean out the cage at least once a week.You may want to move outside to really clean out the cage.


Take the guinea pigs out, and bag up the old bedding. Have a disinfectant ready that's safe for small animals.You can find these disinfectants at pet stores. Alternatively, you can use a mixture of white vinegar and water (half and half).Wash thoroughly with soap and water. You can use dish soap for this purpose, but you should probably keep a dedicated bottle. You can soak any hard spots in vinegar and scrub them with a toothbrush.Disinfect. Spray the disinfectant on, being sure to get the whole cage. You can leave it on to help it do its work.Rinse it clean when it's done, making sure to remove all the disinfectant.
Once a month, use very diluted bleach as a disinfectant (one part bleach twenty parts of water).Make sure to always rinse the cage thoroughly to make sure you don't leave traces of the bleach.

, Sometimes, harder bedding can lead to bumblefoot. You should at least provide access to softer bedding. One choice is VetBed.Sometimes, the guinea pig won't want to use the softer bedding, which is why you can just put it in part of the cage at first to see if your guinea pig likes it.
Try to layer it slightly thicker than you normally do.

, If the bedding gets wet, it keeps the guinea pig's feet wet. In turn, their feet remain softer, which can cause the feet to crack. Cracked feet open the door for more infection.Try changing the bedding more often, especially where the guinea pig uses the restroom and under the water bowl or bottle.
Once a day, check for wet spots. Scoop the wet spot out, wipe underneath it with a paper towel, and then add dry bedding back in., While you should be trimming the nails at least once a month anyway, doing so while the guinea pig has bumblefoot is especially important. Long nails can sometimes be a cause of bumblefoot.You can use human nail clippers for this process, though you should dedicate a pair to your pet. You can also use the guillotine type meant for pets. However, since those are meant for cats and dogs, human nail clippers can sometimes be easier to use on guinea pigs.Have someone hold the guinea pig while you trim to make it easier. If you don't have another person around, you can distract the guinea pig with a carrot or some other treat while you trim the nails.Another option is to hold the guinea pig up against your chest with its stomach facing out. Have one hand under the stomach, while also using that hand to immobilize one paw at a time.Trim up and down, as opposed to side to side. Look for the quick first, which brings blood to the nail. You should be able to see it easily if the guinea pig's nails are light-colored. If they're dark, have someone shine a light through them. Make sure not to get the quick. If you do make the guinea pig bleed, use a styptic pencil on it to stop the bleeding.You can also use cornstarch, flour, or talc to stop the bleeding., In turn, their bodies won't produce enough collagen, which can increase problems with bumblefoot. Adding more vitamin C to the diet can help solve the problem.Check your guinea pig food. It should be providing at least 10 milligrams of vitamin C per day.Supplement with fresh fruits and vegetables. You can add some fresh vegetables to your guinea pig's diet, including greens like turnip greens, parsley, and kale, as well as other vegetables such as green peppers, broccoli, and cabbage. You can also use fruit high in vitamin C, such as oranges or strawberries.When your guinea pig is deficient, you can feed it quartered tablets of chewable, flavored vitamin C. Choose the 100 milligram option, which when quartered would equal 25 milligram tablets. You can give these quartered tablets twice a day for a week., Being overweight can cause or worsen bumblefoot. If your guinea pig is overweight, decrease its food a little bit. Reducing the calories your guinea pig eats should help it lose weight., Some people swear by soaking the guinea pig's feet in solutions to help with the bumblefoot. You need to supervise the guinea pig while it is in a soak, as it can get the medication in its eye. Ask your vet about a protective eye cream.To soak a foot, put the solution in a small cap, and hold the guinea pig, with the foot in the soak.Try a solution of a half a cup of warm water and a 1/8 teaspoon of epsom salt. Use a small portion of it in a cap a couple of times a day, up to three times.in a day.Try Betadine, a povidone-iodine solution. You can get this at your vet, and she will tell you how much you need to dilute it for your animal., Your vet can best diagnose this condition. Also, she can help you decide on the best course of treatment.Pick a vet knowledgeable in small animals like guinea pigs.

, Your vet will examine your pet thoroughly, which may include things like cutting back the hair. She'll also likely clean out any sores, as well as trim the nails.She may also run lab tests to determine the type of infection., Your veterinarian may do one of several treatments. For instance, she may flush the sores with an antibiotic solution. She may also inject antibiotics into the infected site.She might also use an anti-inflammatory medication with the antibiotics., Another common solution is to use foot soaks that contain antibiotics. While your vet knows best, generally you use a small container like a pill bottle lid to soak your guinea pig's foot in the solution several times a day.Always supervise your guinea pig while its foot is soaking to ensure proper treatment, as well as to make sure the guinea pig doesn't get it in its eyes or mouth.
Make sure to ask your vet for tips about foot soaking.

, You may need to apply antibiotics, much like applying an antibiotic ointment to a cut you have. Your vet can show you the best way to do it.Keep in mind that your guinea pig shouldn't ingest these creams. Therefore, you want to use as little as possible, while still covering the wound. Wipe off any excess.She may also recommend bandaging your guinea pig's paws to help with recovery. Make sure she shows you how to do it before you leave., Your guinea pig may need oral antibiotics, as well as pain medications. Usually, you'll only get these medications if the bumblefoot is particularly bad or advanced.You may also get a probiotic treatment to go with the antibiotic.The easiest way to give oral medication is using a syringe to give liquid medications. However, giving oral medications is never easy.


Try holding the guinea pig in your lap, wrapping your hand around its stomach. You need to grip the guinea's jaw with your hand, and you will need to grip it pretty hard. Your hand should be below the eyes.Push the syringe around the front teeth. You'll need to go in from the side of the mouth. Keep working it into the mouth.You'll know when to stop because the guinea will start chewing on the syringe. At that point, you can depress the syringe, releasing the contents slowly, watching to make sure the guinea is still chewing. If it's not, move the syringe a bit to get it chewing again. Having the guinea pig chew is important because it shows it is swallowing.You can also use this same technique with a pill. However, instead of a syringe, use a hemostat, which is readily available at medical supply stores. Place the pill in the hemostat, then use it to get the pill in the back of the throat, much as you inserted the syringe., If bumblefoot gets too bad, your vet may recommend amputating the leg. While the treatment is extreme, it could save your guinea pig's life."

If your guinea pig has foot sores, it will walk with a limp and favor whichever foot does not have sores., Foot sores will be very painful for your guinea pig. If your guinea pig can walk, you may hear it squeak from the pain., Because of the painful foot sores, your guinea pig may not want to walk around in its cage.Place some tasty treats in your hand. Lower your hand into its cage and see if it comes to you. If your guinea pig stays where it is, its feet may hurt too much to put pressure on them.


If it doesn’t come to you after the first try, do not try again.

, If your guinea pig’s foot sores are really bothering him, it may stop eating. This could be because it can’t physically get to its food anymore, or the pain has affected its appetite. With a decreased appetite, your guinea pig may start to lose weight.

, Your guinea pig’s feet will be extremely painful. The slightest touch of the feet could cause your guinea pig to cry out in pain.Consider using a soft and soothing voice and offering treats when you examine the feet.

, The skin on the bottom of a healthy guinea pig foot is smooth with a light pink color.If your guinea pig has foot sores, the skin will feel rough and crusty.Some of the roughness may come from scabs.


The skin may feel warm to the touch.The affected foot will not have pink skin. The skin will probably be dark.

, You will probably see some cuts and scrapes on the bottom of the affected foot. In addition, you may see ulcers, which are open wounds.These ulcers may be draining a yellow- or green-colored fluid, which would indicate infection.


The ulcers are usually 0.5 to 3 cm in diameter.If your guinea pig has a severe case of foot sores, you would also see abscesses, which are closed wounds that are filled with pus. Abscesses are indicators of a bacterial infection.

, As painful as your guinea pig’s foot sores may be, they are its body’s natural response to some type of injury or infection. Those foot sores will probably look red and swollen, indicating inflammation. If bacteria has entered your guinea pig’s foot and started traveling upward through the legs, the joints may also start swelling.


Inflammation of the foot’s skin is called pododermatitis.

, When you spot foot sores on your guinea pig’s feet, take him to your vet for diagnosis and treatment. During the appointment, provide as much information as you can about your guinea pig. Risk factors for foot sores include wire flooring and a lack of vitamin C, so make sure you tell your vet about your guinea pig’s cage environment and diet.


Describe the type of bedding in your guinea pig’s cage. Rough bedding, such as awns and straws, can damage the skin on your guinea pig’s feet, increasing the likelihood foot sores and infections.Other risk factors for foot sores are obesity and a dirty cage., Your vet will examine your guinea pig’s entire body, paying close attention to the feet and legs. When examining your guinea pig's body, your vet will listen to the lungs and heart, touch your guinea pig from head to toe, and look in the eyes and ears.When looking at the feet and legs, your vet will look for signs of inflammation (redness, heat, swelling, pain) and closely examine the skin.

, Diagnostic tests will help your vet determine the specific treatment for your guinea pig. Although antibiotics are often used to treat foot sores in guinea pigs, certain antibiotics can make guinea pigs very sick. Therefore, your vet cannot prescribe just any antibiotic.If your vet suspects the bacteria has entered your guinea pig’s bones, then x-rays would be needed."

Do some prep work.,
Place the bedding in a washing machine.,
Add vinegar.,
Wash on high heat.,
Dry the bedding.",How to Clean a Guinea Pig's Fleece Bedding2," Do not simply throw fleece bedding into the washing machine. Do your routine cleaning by picking up loose dirt and hay, running a curry comb over the bedding, and then shaking out the bedding. The bedding will come clean easier in the wash if you remove obvious messes first., Remove the bedding from a cage. Transfer it to a washing machine. Add your regular laundry detergent to the machine.If you have other laundry to do, you can throw in items of similar color and texture into the machine while washing fleece bedding.

, Pour about half a cup of white vinegar into the washing machine. White vinegar helps kill bacteria and also reduces odor., Turn the machine on and run it for a cycle. Run it on high heat, as fleece bedding should be cleaned in warm water., It's safe to dry fleece bedding at low or medium heat in your dryer. You can dry it with any other items you need to dry that day. You can also hang the bedding to let it air dry, but this will take longer. You do not want to delay returning the bedding to your guinea pig for longer than necessary."
"
Avoid dangerous, messy beddings.,
Do not use fabric softener or dryer sheets.,
Clean the bedding on a schedule.",How to Clean a Guinea Pig's Fleece Bedding3," Certain types of beddings spread easily and stick to fleece bedding. They are also generally unsafe for guinea pigs as they may cause respiratory and other health problems. Avoid the following:Cedar bedding
Clay-based bedding
Sawdust
Newspaper

, Fabric softeners and dryer sheets are not safe to use for materials meant for guinea pigs. Strong smells can be irritating for guinea pigs and may cause poor reactions. Avoid fabric softeners and dryer sheets when cleaning fleece bedding., It's important to stick to a schedule when cleaning fleece bedding. Simply cleaning it occasionally will not control odor from your guinea pig's cage. Make a habit of doing a light cleaning each day. Every five to seven days, wash your fleece bedding in a machine."

Feed your guinea pig healthy feed, fruits, and vegetables.,
Make sure your guinea pig has enough vitamin C in its diet.,
Exercise your guinea pig.,
Clip its nails.,
Clean the cage.,
Bathe your guinea pig.,
Make them happy!",How to Stop Your Guinea Pig from Becoming Ill," Select foods such as red or green bell peppers, kale, carrots, romaine lettuce (not iceberg), tomatoes, celery, dandelion leaves, baby tomatoes, cucumber, parsley, apple, pear, and seedless grapes. These foods are high in the vitamins guinea pigs need. Fruits should be given as a treat due to their high sugar content. Broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables, though high in vitamin C, should be given in moderation, as too much can cause gas. Also watch the amount of calcium you're giving them in certain vegetables as too much calcium can result in bladder stones which can be very painful for your pig.


If you are at all doubtful whether a certain food is safe for guinea pigs to eat (especially if your guinea pig has never eaten it before), consult this link: http://jackiesguineapiggies.com/fruitandveg.html.;
, This can be achieved by getting small tablets to add to their food, or making sure they eat foods with plenty of vitamin C in them, such as bell pepper and kale. Avoid adding vitamin C drops to their water, this can dilute the water and cause mildew (NOT what you want for your pet).

, Although a couple ounces overweight might not seem like much, it can really hurt your guinea pig. High levels of fat in a guinea pig's body can harm your pet because their hearts are very weak. Having them run after a carrot in your hand for a couple of minutes can really get them moving. Allow the guinea pig to nibble on the end of it every once in a while so it doesn't lose interest in chasing the carrot.

, Walking around in their cage near their feces can cause their nails to pick up bacteria that can cause your guinea pig to get sick! You can purchase guinea pig or ferret nail clippers at your local pet store, or you can just use toenail clippers. Make sure you don't clip too close to the top of the nail. There is a nerve growing there and it can really hurt the guinea pig if you clip too close!

, Buy soft bedding, not cedar chips, so it doesn't hurt their paws when they walk around. Some people choose to clean out the poop and pee spots everyday, but you can take out all of the bedding every week and put in fresh, clean bedding for your pet. Both work effectively.

, Bathe them about every other month or every month if they have lice or mites. It is healthy for your pet to be clean. This helps reduce the risk of mites and skin disease. Use unscented baby soap so that the guinea pig doesn't get irritated skin. Use lukewarm water in a sink about an inch deep. Set the guinea pig down, but make sure that its nostrils don't go underwater because it takes very little for them to drown. Massage the soap into the space behind their ears and pet it down with the rest of their body. Rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water. Dry them off with a towel and place them gently back in their cage.

, Play with them for at least 15 minutes daily, but feel free to play with them as often as you like! Make sure that you don't tire your guinea pig out too much though! Reward them for good behavior with healthy treats, such as granola or fruit from the list above. Small amounts of treats are good for guinea pigs, but too much can make them fat and unhealthy!

"
"
Give your Guinea pig fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Provide fresh pellets.,
Add vitamin C to the water.,
Provide Timothy hay.",How to Prevent Malocclusion in Guinea Pigs1," Guinea pigs’ do not produce enough vitamin C. You must feed your pet fresh fruits and vegetables that are high in vitamin C. Recommended vegetables include kale, parsley, cabbage, greens (collard, mustard, turnip), spinach, beet greens, broccoli, Brussel sprouts, cauliflower, romaine lettuce, and celery (with leaves). Always wash fruits and vegetables before serving them and remove the leftovers after a few hours.Fruit is a treat and should not be part of the daily diet. Recommended fruits include strawberries, raspberries, oranges, honeydew melon, rutabaga, apples, cherries, and peaches.
Green peppers and oats can also be served in moderation as well.
Feed your guinea pig 4 or 5 different foods, twice a day.;
, Purchase fresh pellets that are enriched with vitamin C. Your guinea pig should have one food bowl for pellets and another food bowl for fruits and vegetables. Purchase the pellets in small quantities so they do not go bad. Old pellets will not have enough vitamin C.Guinea pigs under 4 months of age should be given an unlimited amount of pellets. After 4 months, give your guinea pig 1 tablespoon of pellets each day.
You should buy new pellets at least once a month.
Never feed your guinea pig rabbit pellets. Rabbit pellets do not have enough folic acid and vitamin C.

, Add 50 milligrams of ascorbic acid to one cup of drinking water and give it to your guinea pig. Make a new batch of water every 12 hours. This is only necessary if your guinea pig is not getting enough vitamin C through its food. Signs of vitamin C deficiency include:


Decreased appetite
Diarrhea
Rough hair coat
Swollen joints and ribs
Bleeding gums
Inadequate bone and teeth development

, Hay provides your guinea pig with fiber and is good for its teeth. Chewing Timothy hay helps grind down all of your guinea pig’s teeth.Your guinea pig should have a constant supply of fresh hay. Remove the old hay and replace it with fresh hay each day. Your guinea pig will not eat all of the hay that you provide.You can purchase this hay from the pet supply stores.


Orchard grass is a good alternative for Timothy hay.
Alfalfa and other legume hays should not be used. They are high in calories and can cause your guinea pig to gain too much weight."
"
Use a well-ventilated cage.,
Place the cage in a draft-free area.,
Put low-dust bedding in the cage.,
Clean the cage.",How to Prevent Respiratory Problems in Guinea Pigs1," A well-ventilated cage allows fresh air to enter and circulate through the cage. Also, a cage with good ventilation prevents the buildup of ammonia, which can irritate a guinea pig’s respiratory tract. Wire cages provide great ventilation. Glass cages, however, do not., Proper cage placement is another prevention strategy. Put the cage in an area where your guinea pigs will not feel a constant draft of air.For example, place the cage away from ceiling and floor vents.


A constant draft of air could bother your guinea pigs’ respiratory tracts.
Within the draft-free area, make sure the cage is not in the direct path of sunlight.This could warm up the cage too much.

, Dust can lead to respiratory problems in guinea pigs. Yesterday’s News cat litter and CareFresh® are great low-dust bedding choices for guinea pig cages.If you are not sure if the current bedding is dusty, take some of it in your hand, go outside, and toss it up in the air. If you see lots of dust in the air as the bedding falls to the ground, switch to a low-dust bedding.Sawdust shavings contain a lot of dust.
Some beddings, such as cedar shavings and pine shavings, contain aromatic (scented) oils that can cause respiratory tract irritation.Change the bedding whenever it becomes wet or dirty.

, A clean cage is very important for preventing respiratory problems. First, place your guinea pigs in a guinea-proof room (no hiding spaces or visible electrical cords) or small travel carrier.Next, remove all bedding and accessories from the cage. Clean the cage with warm, soapy water and a sponge. Let the cage dry completely before putting fresh bedding, cage accessories, and your guinea pigs back in.Consider these other helpful cleaning tips:Make a schedule so you don’t forget to clean the cage.
Wash the food bowl and water bottle with unscented soap. Your guinea pigs may not like the smell of scented soap.
Instead of soapy water, spray a 50/50 mixture of white vinegar and water to clean the cage.
Clean the cage at least once a week.

Give your guinea pig sticks.,
Provide wooden blocks.,
Know that chewing toys are not a substitute for hay.",How to Prevent Malocclusion in Guinea Pigs2," Sticks are a nice chew toy. Always use guinea pig safe woods such as apple, crabapple, pear, hazelnut, oak, maple, basswood, linden, and elder. Do not pick up a stick from your natural environment and give it to your guinea pig. The stick must be untreated and not exposed to fungus, bugs, or pesticides.


Unsafe woods include pine, cherry, almond, nectarine, peach, plum, and cedar. These are toxic for your guinea pig.When you purchase wood from a store, be sure that it has not been treated with any chemicals.

, Wooden blocks are another chewing toy option for your guinea pig. Your guinea pig will enjoy them, and you will not have to worry about him choking on them. Children’s blocks are a good size.


Be sure the blocks you choose are non-toxic and are not coated with any type of sealant.You can also make your own wooden blocks if you purchase some safe wood from a hardware store.

, Chew toys are a supplement and should never replace hay. When your guinea pig chews hay, the hay is able to reach all of the teeth. Chew toys typically only reach the front incisors.Cheek teeth/molars are the teeth that are most likely to cause malocclusion.Most chew toys do not reach these teeth.

"
"
Recognize the symptoms of malocclusion.,
Check their teeth weekly.,
Take your guinea pig to the vet regularly.",How to Prevent Malocclusion in Guinea Pigs3," If your guinea pig is refusing to eat pellets, crunchy foods, or eat long strands of hay, he may be having dental problems. See your veterinarian if you notice any of these symptoms. Your vet may will able to intervene before things become serious.Other signs of malocclusion include:Weight loss
Drooling
Facial abscesses
Tooth grinding

, Set aside time each week to examine your guinea pig’s teeth. Make sure the front teeth (incisors) are not overgrown or chipped. Check for sensitive areas along the jawline. If your guinea pig reacts because an area is sensitive, he may have spurs.You should also weigh your guinea pig each week as weight loss an early sign of malocclusion.
Spurs typically grow on the outer edges of the molar and cause sores to develop in the cheeks., Your guinea pig should see a veterinarian every 6 months. At each visit, you can discuss your guinea pig’s diet and health. Your vet will also do a dental examination. A dental examination can recognize any problems early on and intervene so the problem does not become serious.


Make sure your veterinarian has experience working with a guinea pigs.Some guinea pigs have congenital dental issues (i.e. misaligned teeth) that increase their risk of malocclusion.Your vet will be able to identify this and create a treatment plan.

Avoid cage overcrowding.,
Separate fighting cage mates.,
Do not house guinea pigs with rabbits.,
Isolate a sick guinea pig.,
Quarantine a new guinea pig.",How to Prevent Respiratory Problems in Guinea Pigs2," Because guinea pigs are social animals, it is a good idea to house 2 or more guinea pigs together.However, if the cage is too small, the guinea pigs would be overcrowded and stressed. The stress would weaken the immune system and make respiratory problems more likely.To prevent overcrowding, choose a cage large enough for the number of guinea pigs you have:2 guinea pigs: 30 x 50 inches (76 x 127 cm)
3 guinea pigs: 30 x 62 inches (76 x 157 cm)
4 guinea pigs: 30 x 76 inches (76 x 193 cm)

, Sometimes, guinea pig cage mates do not get along. They may fight or bully each other. This aggression could increase stress levels.If you notice your guinea pigs are not getting along, place them in separate cages.

, Rabbits carry a bacteria called Bordetella in their respiratory tracts that they can transmit to guinea pigs. A guinea pig with Bordetella can develop serious respiratory problems. Also, a rabbit can bully a guinea pig, increasing the guinea pig’s stress and weakening its immune system.Keep your rabbits and guinea pigs in separate cages.


A rabbit with Bordetella usually doesn’t show signs of respiratory illness. A guinea pig with Bordetella, however, can show many symptoms, including difficulty breathing, discharge from the eyes and nose, loss of appetite, and maybe even sudden death., Respiratory infections are very contagious in guinea pigs. If one of your guinea pigs has a respiratory infection, keep it in a separate cage until it fully recovers.This will prevent your healthy guinea pigs from getting sick.

, If you have purchased a new guinea pig, keep it separate from your other guinea pigs for 2 weeks. Put the new guinea pig in its own cage and do not let it interact with the other guinea pigs. During this 2 weeks, make sure the new guinea is eating and drinking normally and looks healthy.If the new guinea is showing any signs of respiratory problems (e.g., sneezing, discharge from the eyes and nose), take it to your vet for treatment.


To prevent the spread of illness between the new and current guinea pigs, wash your hands between handling each one.After the quarantine, introduce the guinea pigs gradually. First, put their cages next to each other so they can smell each other. Then, introduce them face to face.Select a neutral area, such as a large play area, to make the face-to-face introductions.
A gradual introduction can prevent respiratory problems by reducing the stress of introducing a new guinea pig to the home."
"
Include Vitamin C in your guinea pig’s diet.,
Wash your hands.,
Have your vet correct dental problems.",How to Prevent Respiratory Problems in Guinea Pigs3," Vitamin C is an important nutrient for guinea pigs. Guinea pigs cannot produce vitamin C in their bodies, so they must obtain it through their diet. Feed your guinea pigs vitamin C-rich foods like oranges, broccoli, and leafy greens (e.g., kale, parsley, spinach). You can also feed them Vitamin C-fortified pellets.Vitamin C in pellets can break down quickly. Check the milling date (processing date) on the package. Feed the pellets within 90 days of the milling date to ensure your guinea pigs get enough vitamin C from the pellets.You could put vitamin C drops in your guinea pigs' water bottle. However, vitamin C breaks down very quickly in water. Plus, the drops could make the water taste bad.A guinea pig needs at least 50 milligrams of vitamin C each day to stay healthy.Without enough vitamin C, a guinea pig’s immune system could weaken., Your good hygiene can prevent respiratory problems in guinea pigs. If you have multiple guinea pigs, wash your hands between handling each one.This is especially important if one of your guinea pigs is sick.

, Dental problems can lead to respiratory problems in guinea pigs. For example, the tooth roots (located above the gum line) of a guinea pig’s cheek teeth are fairly close to the nasal airways.If these roots get pushed upward because of another dental problem, a guinea pig could develop respiratory problems, like a sinus infection.


Dental problems require veterinary treatment, such as surgery and antibiotics.

Keep your guinea pig on clean, dry bedding.,
Feed your guinea pig a low or reduced calcium diet.,
Give your pig a variety of reduced calcium foods.,
Encourage your guinea pig to drink plenty of water.,
Check if your guinea pig has parents with a history of bladder stones.,
Pay attention to your guinea pig’s urine for any blood.,
Notice if your pig squeals when he tries to pee or spends a lot of time squatting.,
Check to see if you guinea pig has stopped eating or has lost weight.,
Change your guinea pig’s diet.,
Get your pig’s urine checked for a urinary tract infection.Typical guinea pig urine is alkaline with a pH of 8.5, but if the pH of their urine changes, this can lead to the deposition of certain minerals.,
Consider surgical removal of the stones.,
Make the difficult decision to euthanize your guinea pig.",How to Prevent Bladder Stones in Guinea Pigs," Wet bedding discourages the pig from emptying his bladder and is a breeding ground for bacteria. These bacteria can then track up the urethra and into the bladder, causing an infection., The majority of guinea pig bladder stones are calcium based (calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate). If the guinea pig is feed a high calcium diet then his body becomes saturated with calcium and is more likely to form deposits in his urine. So, feed your pig well balanced pellet foods that are calcium controlled, like the Oxbow range of herbivore foods, as well as Cavy cuisine and Bunny Basics.Avoid foods high in calcium like alfalfa hay, spinach, celery, parsley, and strawberries. Exclude these items from your pig’s diet or limit them as a once a week treat.

, As any food is likely to be higher in certain minerals than others, vary up the types of foods you give your pig. For example, carrots are high in oxalate, a buildup of which can cause bladder stones. If you feed your pig carrots everyday there is a risk of inducing oxalate bladder stones. Alternating or varying up how often you give your pig carrots gives the oxalate time to wash out of your guinea pig’s system rather than build up.Never give your pig the same food two days running to allow the system to cleanse itself in between eating times.

, This will help to keep his urinary tract flushed through and healthy.To do this, place multiple drinkers in the run and hutch. This is especially important for a group of guinea pigs housed together, because the head pig may dominate a lone drinker and prevent others from having access to water.

, It is not entirely clear why some guinea pigs suffer from bladder stones though they still maintain the same diet as guinea pigs who do not have stones. One theory is that there is a genetic component that influences the way your guinea pig processes the minerals in food. If these minerals are not processed properly, they are deposited as a sludge or crystals in the bladder and may then stick together to form stones.

, You may notice your guinea pig has darker colored pee containing the occasional blood clot on his sawdust. Blood in his urine is caused by the bladder stones rubbing the bladder lining and causing inflammation.If you can’t tell what your pig’s pee looks like against the sawdust, replace the sawdust with newspaper as it is easier to see any red-tinged discoloration on the paper.

, If the stone moves from the bladder into the urethra, then the condition can become more serious and more painful for your pig. Unable to pass water, your guinea pig will become distressed, and may be vocal or squeal, as well as squat.Untreated, your pig will continue to strain to pass urine, but to no avail. The urine builds up in the bladder and refluxes back up into the kidney. The guinea pig then becomes toxic. If you notice your pig displaying symptoms like extreme lethargy, stupor, or lapsing into unconsciousness, take him to your vet for medical care immediately.

, Some guinea pigs become so pre-occupied by trying to urinate that their food intake is reduced and they lose weight., Once the stones have formed in your pig’s bladder, there is no diet that will cause the stones to dissolve. Guinea pigs differ from cats and dogs, as certain stones in their bodies can dissolve with a special prescription diet. But a change in your pig’s diet will lessen the build up of more stones or a recurrence of stones in your pig’s bladder., Urinary tract infections can lead to the formation of bladder stones because this infection causes your guinea pig’s urine to become more acidic, thereby encouraging stone formation in his bladder.A guinea pig with stones should either have urine sent for culture, or be treated with a course of antibiotics on the assumption that a urinary tract infection is present.

, Removing the stones through surgery is a viable option but surgery without preventative measures may only benefit the animal for a relatively short period of time, likely 3-4 weeks.It is sad but true that despite a successful surgery, guinea pigs are associated with a high recurrence rate of stones, perhaps even despite your best efforts to reduce that likelihood.

, If it is not possible for you to take preventative measures like changing your pig’s diet and consistently checking their urine for infection, you may need to consider euthanizing your guinea pig rather than taking him to get surgery. Because of guinea pigs’ high recurrence rate of stones and the high risk of your pig being ill with bladder stones on a frequent basis, euthanizing your pig may be a possible solution to ensuring he does not experience any more pain."

Let your hamster play more.,
Spend one-on-one time.,
Let your hamster sleep during the day.,
Give your hamster a bigger cage.",How to Make Dwarf Hamsters Stop Biting the Cage1," Let him roam around on you, on your bed, or in a hamster-proof area. Exercise may help work out the boredom that your hamster might be feeling.


An exercise ball is an excellent way for your hamster to get exercise every day, while also protecting him from potential household hazards. Just be sure to supervise your hamster while he's in his ball. To avoid overheating, never let your hamster roam in his ball in direct sunlight, and limit time in the ball to 15 minute intervals.Make sure you've hamster-proofed the area in which your hamster will be playing. Remove any electrical cords so he does not chew on them. Keep the area enclosed, either by closing the door to a small room or by setting up ""walls"" around your hamster's play area.If you're worried about your hamster getting into something he shouldn't, consider using a hamster ball. This will allow your pet to roam freely, while still be safely protected from potential hazards in your home.
Consider giving your hamster a wheel to run on. Hamster wheels are a great way for hamsters to get exercise and work out extra energy. Avoid wire-frame wheels, as these could potentially injure your hamster.;
, Hamsters are very social animals and need to spend some time with their human(s) on a regular basis. Giving your hamster one-on-one attention, like holding him outside of his cage or letting him run around in your lap, is important for his emotional wellbeing and may be a factor in preventing attention-seeking behavior in the first place.Use a scoop or a small box, held in front of your hamster, to remove him from his enclosure. Reaching into the cage might make your hamster feel that his space is being invaded.Let your hamster crawl around on top of you while you lie on the floor. Hamsters love to explore, and once your hamster has developed a trust in you as his owner, he'll want to climb on and around you.

, Hamsters are nocturnal, which means they sleep during the day and are awake and active at night. Waking your hamster up during the day, whether to play with him or to clean his cage, may cause him irritation. Interrupting his natural sleep schedule could lead to further undesirable behavior., It's possible that your hamster is bored with his surroundings and longs for more room to play in his enclosure. If this is the case, your pet might benefit from having a bigger cage.As a general rule, a dwarf hamster needs at least one cubic foot of space. With each additional hamster in the cage, you'll need at least an additional 0.5 cubic feet of space."

Give your hamster wood to chew on.,
Try giving your hamster dog treats.,
Give your hamster cardboard.,
Take your hamster to the vet.",How to Make Dwarf Hamsters Stop Biting the Cage2," Hamsters' teeth continue to grow their whole lives. If your hamster does not have a chew toy, his constant chewing may not be attention-seeking behavior.Hamsters need to chew everyday to prevent their teeth from becoming too long, which could cause serious pain and potentially harm your pet.Untreated, paint-free, oil-free wood is the best choice for chew toys. Avoid using wood harvested from outdoors, as this wood has not been properly inspected and could harbor harmful parasites or be treated with pesticides.Wood from an apple or pear tree is ideal, as these woods do not have any harmful oils and are therefore less likely to pose any threat to your hamster's respiratory or digestive health.Never give your hamster pine or cedar wood to chew on. The oils in these woods can be toxic to your hamster., A hard biscuit can make an excellent alternative chew toy for hamsters.Give hamsters hard treats like dog biscuits about once every week.Be sure the dog treats you give your hamster are free of garlic. Garlic is known to cause digestive problems in hamsters.

, The cardboard tube from a roll of paper towel or toilet paper makes an excellent chew toy for hamsters, and has the additional benefit of providing your hamster with a convenient hiding place.Try cutting a small hole in the tube before you give it to your hamster. That may help him see the potential in the tube, and may inspire him to make his own chew holes.

, A veterinarian can trim your hamster's teeth down to a manageable length, which may be necessary if your hamster has not responded to chew toys.Having a vet trim your hamster's teeth is quick and does not cause any harm to your hamster.Do not attempt to trim your hamster's teeth on your own, unless your vet has approved this procedure and given you proper instruction in how best to do this.

"
"
Try a different cage.,
Give him alternatives.,
Consider using a bite deterrent.",How to Make Dwarf Hamsters Stop Biting the Cage3," If your hamster continues to chew the bars of his cage, and you've ruled out teeth management as the cause, you may want to consider keeping him in a glass aquarium tank instead of a traditional cage.Some hamster owners actually find that a glass enclosure is easier to clean than a metal or plastic cage, and is less likely to need repairs or replacement., If your hamster isn't interested in using his wood chew, try rubbing a carrot or apple on the wood.If he still doesn't respond well to his wood chew, try giving him hard-shelled nuts to chew on., If all else fails, and you cannot move your hamster into a glass enclosure, you may want to consider using a bite-deterrent spray on the bars of your hamster's cage. Bite-deterrent sprays use a bitter tasting liquid, like lemon juice or apple vinegar, to make the surface of the bars undesirable to your hamster. You may also use a small amount of olive oil. These products are often used successfully by other cage-biting pets, like ferrets, and may work for your stubborn hamster as a last resort.You can also cover the bars with a thin layer of olive oil.

Never spray the bars while your hamster is in his cage, as this may cause him to be inadvertently sprayed, which would be unpleasant.
Always take your hamster out of his cage before spraying the bars, and be sure that the spray has dried before you return him to his enclosure.

House your guinea pig with sows after 4-6 weeks.",How to Neuter Your Guinea Pig," Due to their small size, guinea pigs are vulnerable to risks when it comes to surgery. And it is a common myth that neutering will make boars get along better with other guinea pigs or make them friendlier. Neutering doesn't affect the personality of a guinea pig in any way―it is a tactic to prevent pregnancy.

If you don't need to get your guinea pig neutered, then don't. Avoid the risks and unnecessary cost of neutering. Unless you're planning to keep him with female sows, there is no need to castrate your boar.;
, Performing surgery on small animals is a complicated process for the surgeon, especially one that isn't as experienced. The smaller the animal, the more risks involved. Risks can happen during and after surgery. Respiratory issues can result from surgery due to the given anaesthesia or the infections following the surgery if proper care isn't provided.

You should go through the risks of neutering with your vet too so that you fully understand any complications that can arise and gain knowledge on the situation your guinea pig is potentially being put in.
Castrating a male is much easier than spaying a sow, hence why some vet clinics won't perform on female guinea pigs. Castrating your boar will be easier (and maybe cheaper) than choosing to spay your sow., Avoid the assumption that any vet can easily neuter a guinea pig. Find an exotic vet that has experience with guinea pig neutering and, of course, good outcomes from surgery.

Ask around from friends or online forums for advice on finding a suggested vet to go through with neutering your guinea pig. It can be difficult to find a vet alone.

, As much as the cheapest option may seem the best option to go with, sometimes this isn't always the truth. You should opt for an average priced neuter from a reliable vet clinic.

Costs for surgery can come anywhere between $50 and $300. The average would be about $100.

, These places are cheaper for a reason. Vet schools have students learning to become vets, which means that they may not be well-experienced in neutering guinea pigs. Avoid clinics that have bad reviews. This is an obvious one!, When finding a reliable vet or vet clinic asking around goes a long way! As much as it can be a minor help, sometimes asking your friend or family member isn't good enough into guiding you to choose the right place for your cavy. Shelters can assist you with finding a reliable vet considering they should have quite a few experiences with guinea pigs and their health. Optionally you can locate a vet in the vet section of the yellow pages.

Look for vets and/or vet clinics specialised in small animals and exotic pets.

, When it comes to finding a vet, the best thing you can do is question them to know whether they're right for your guinea pig. Make sure you're asking questions to do with how many guinea pigs they have neutered, their success rate, over what period of time they have neutered guinea pigs, any experience with complications and possibly references from past patients. These are all safe questions that shouldn't be restrained from being asked. It's completely fine to be extra sure.Ask how the surgical procedure will go and which anaesthesia will be used. Isoflurane gas if preferred whilst halothane and methoxyflurane gas are considered unsafe to be used.

, You will have to wait at least 4-6 weeks until you can house your boar with a sow as it takes time for the viable sperm to die off. A just neutered guinea pig still has the risk of impregnating a sow., An unhealthy guinea pig that isn't doing too well physically shouldn't be put through with surgery especially due to risks associated with after surgery is performed., Most vets will perform a vet check prior to surgery to ensure your guinea pig is all good to go through with the medical procedure. If this isn't included with your guinea pigs castration you should arrange an appointment to ensure your guinea pig is in good condition., Weight is a major factor to do with your guinea pig's health. 650 grams is considered the minimum of neutering your guinea pig. Regular weight checks should be performed nether the less as a way to spot early symptoms in potential healthy issues., There is actually a recommended age when it comes to neutering guinea pigs. The most preferred age is to get your guinea pig neutered at as young as 4 months. A 3-4-year-old guinea pig isn't recommended to get neutered.Some vets will have an age limit. Ask first and get their recommendations.

, Make sure you set-up a cage for your guinea pig before you bring them home as they will need extra care, supervision, and isolation away from other guinea pigs, animals, children, and noises., Your guinea pig should start eating again 2 hours after their surgery and remain active. They may show aggressive behaviour, An indoor environment is the best environment while your guinea pig recovers from surgery. An indoor environment reduces stress, infection and temperature can be regulated as well as being able to supervise your guinea pig more frequently., Do not give your guinea pig any antibiotics or medication that hasn't been prescribed to be given to them. Only give your guinea pigs medication if your vet has instructed you to. Antibiotics shouldn't be added to their water if it isn't recommended as your guinea pig can be put off from drinking due to this.

You will most likely be given antibiotics to help your guinea pig during their healing process and have the option to administer pain killers to your guinea pig to get their eating faster.

, You should refrain from using your normal bedding for your guinea pig during the healing process. Anything with small fragments should be avoided such as wood chippings/shavings as these can irritate the wound. You should opt for white towels instead which will help with monitoring your guinea pigs urine and droppings. Line newspaper at the bottom first and then the towels which will need to be changed at least once a day.

Your vet might suggest you with what kind of bedding to use to prevent infections and irritants to the wound.

, The hay can be irritable to your guinea pigs wound. You must keep the hay compacted into a tube or suitable rack that restrains the guinea pig from sitting in it. Make sure you're buying a soft brand of hay such as meadow hay (but not too soft that it isn't any good for your guinea pig). You should avoid oaten hay as it's a lot tougher., They should be kept separate from any cage mates while they are recovering from surgery. This includes other guinea pigs, animals, and people. The only one that should be interacting with the guinea pig is you. Small children should be kept away from your guinea pig to reduce unnecessary stress., You should be giving your guinea pig 50-75 mg of vitamin C depending on their weight. You can give them vitamin C naturally through vegetables such as (green) capsicums., Weighing your guinea pig can help identify signs of early illnesses; especially if their weight rapidly drops all of a sudden., After surgery, your guinea pigs wound is prone to infections during the healing process. You should keep an extra eye on your cavy each day to ensure their health is stable. This is why it's optimal to keep your guinea pig indoors while they are healing.

Additionally you should monitor their behaviour and eating habits too.

, If you plan on doing so, then after at least 4 weeks you are able to keep your boar with a sow. You must wait four weeks to give any viable sperm time to die off, otherwise there is still a high risk of your boar impregnating the sow."

Bring your guinea pig to the vet if they are not showing signs of improvement.",How to Look After Your Sick Guinea Pig," If you notice any signs of illness in your guinea pig, bring them to the vet right away., Guinea pigs often contract an illness due to improper care, an improper diet, or interaction with another guinea pig who has an infectious disease. You should talk to the vet about your pig’s symptoms and your care procedures for your pig, as it can help them to determine the cause of their illness. Guinea pigs are susceptible to the following illnesses or issues:Digestive disorders caused by bacteria, viruses, or a parasite. The symptoms of a digestive disorder include diarrhea, weight loss, dehydration, a lack of energy and a lack of appetite.
Dental issues, such as slobbering. This is caused by a misalignment of your guinea pig’s teeth, which then make it difficult for your guinea pig to swallow or chew. This can result in excessive slobbering or drooling. They may also experience weight loss, bleeding from the mouth, or abscesses in their mouth.
Nutritional disorders, such as a vitamin C deficiency. Like other small mammals, guinea pigs cannot produce their own vitamin C and must eat vitamin C in their diet. If your guinea pig has a vitamin C deficiency, they may display an inability to walk around, a limp, or low energy.
An adverse reaction to antibiotics. Guinea pigs are highly sensitive to certain antibiotics and penicillin-based drugs such as amoxicillin are toxic to guinea pigs. If your guinea pig has an adverse reaction to antibiotics, they may display symptoms like diarrhea, a lack of appetite, dehydration, or a drop in body temperature. Sometimes, antibiotic poisoning is fatal to guinea pigs.

, The vet should examine your guinea pig, noting their symptoms, and prescribe medication for their illness. The vet may also suggest certain home care tactics you can try to make your guinea pig more comfortable and help them recover.Make sure your vet does not prescribe any oral penicillin-based drugs, including penicillin, ampicillin, lincomycin, clindamycin, vancomycin, erythromycin, tylosin, tetracycline, and chlortetracycline for your guinea pig, as they can harm your guinea pig. The vet should prescribe antibiotics that will be gentle on your guinea pig’s system, and will not have a toxic effect on your pig., Liquid medication may be prescribed for a respiratory bacterial disease or for a digestive disorder.If the vet prescribes liquid oral medication for your guinea pig’s illness, you will need to use a 1cc syringe with no needle to give your pig the medication. Shake the medication before you put it into the syringe in the correct measured amount according to the prescription.Prop your pig in your lap with their back pressed into your ribcage. Hold them with your left hand around their stomach and use your forefinger and thumb to grip their head and jaws, just below their eyes. Keep your grip around their head firm and secure so they cannot move their head around.
Use your right hand to stick the syringe into the side of their mouth, behind their front teeth. Move it down toward their back teeth until they begin to grind on the syringe.
Slowly depress the contents of the syringe into their mouth. Stop doing this if your pig stops chewing, as a chewing motion indicates that they are swallowing the medication. Wiggle the syringe until they starts chewing again and all the medication has been swallowed.

, Your guinea pig may need to be given vitamin C pills if they has a vitamin C deficiency.A hemostat is a scissor-handled clamp that is used for compressing bleeding blood vessels. You can find them at medical supply stores or online. The shape and size of the hemostat is good for dosing your guinea pig with pills, as it can fit down into your pig’s molars.Hold your guinea pig in the same way you would hold her to give them oral medication with a syringe. Use the hemostat to insert the pill down to their molars. Make sure that they make a chewing motion as this is an indication that they have swallowed the medication.

, Subcutaneous fluids are often prescribed only if your guinea pig cannot take oral medication or liquid medication via their mouth. The vet can show you how to insert a butterfly catheter into your guinea pig. You will need to use a catheter to give your guinea pig subcutaneous fluids as a form of medication., If your guinea pig develops eye issues, the vet may prescribe eye drops. You can administer eye drops by placing your guinea pig on a table, facing away from you. Then, hold the bottle dropper above and behind their head. Hold open her eye with one hand as you apply the drop from above her. This will ensure they cannot see the dropper clearly and get spooked as you try to give them the medication., While guinea pigs often live in loose bedding in their cage, placing your pet on flat, folded towels can help you to keep track of their urine and stool production. It may also be easier for them to lay down and walk around if they isn’t feeling well., Your guinea pig may feel chilled due to their illness. You can use these wraps to relieve sore muscles. The thermal wraps will heat up when exposed to air and stay warm for up to eight hours at a time. Make sure the thermal wrap is not too warm for your guinea pig or too tight on them.You can also wrap a water bottle in a towel and place it at one end of their cage for warmth.
Guinea pigs with respiratory issues and digestive disorders should be kept clean, warm, and well rested during their recovery.

, You should note if your guinea pig’s symptoms get worse while on the prescribed medication, especially if they is on antibiotics. Many antibiotics can cause diarrhea and upset the balance of bacteria in your pig’s intestines. If you note any symptoms of a negative reaction to antibiotics in your pig, you should take them to the vet right away.The vet will likely stop the antibiotic treatment and prescribe another medication.

, If your guinea pig has an illness that causes them to lose their appetite, you will need to use hand feeding to try to get them to eat. Many ill guinea pigs will also stop urinating or eliminating due to malnourishment. It is essential that your guinea pig consumes food and water to help them recover.Adult guinea pigs should consume about 6 grams of dry feed/100 grams of body weight and 10 to 40 ml water per 100 grams of body weight. You should try to hand feed your guinea pig plain food pellets softened in water with minced parsley, vegetables, and carrots. You can also combine pet slurry with wheat grass juice or natural cranberry juice to make it more appetizing.
To hand feed your pig, make sure they are standing upright on a flat surface or flat on their stomach. Do not rest them on their back as this can be a choking hazard. You can also place your pet in a little pouch or wrapped in a towel. It may help to position your pig facing away from you.
Put food in your hand and place it in front of your pig. Feed them slowly so they have time to chew and swallow.

, You should monitor your guinea pig’s weight by using a kitchen scale to weigh your pig one or twice a day. This will help you to determine if the hand feeding is working effectively and if your guinea pig is starting to gain healthy weight, despite their illness.You can also use a chart to write down your pet’s weight each day and determine if their weight is improving.

, If your guinea pig’s symptoms do not improve despite medication and home care, you should bring them to the vet for further treatment.

Check its eating patterns.,
Identify activity changes.,
Do not wait to seek help.,
Practice prevention.,
Weigh your guinea pig at least weekly.,
Watch for hair loss and skin irritation.,
Check for tumors.,
Keep an eye out for infections.,
Watch for malocclusion.,
Be wary of pneumonia.,
Don’t ignore the droppings.",How to Know if a Pet Guinea Pig Is Ill," It is not far from the truth to say that healthy guinea pigs eat constantly, so any changes in eating patterns or frequency should always be cause for concern. Sometimes, not eating or eating less than usual may be the only observable sign of a serious condition.Guinea pigs cannot go more than a few hours without eating before causing potential damage. If your pet has not eaten at all (or very little) in the past 16-20 hours, seek immediate veterinary attention.
Make sure your guinea pig is also drinking water as normal.;
, If your guinea pig is normally active and friendly, but has begun acting agitated, anxious, or afraid, assume that there is a medical problem involved. You know your pet’s personality and normal activities better than anyone, so use your judgment in determining things out of the ordinary, then involve the vet as warranted.While the list could be endless, and will be particular to your guinea pig, common signs of trouble can include: avoiding favorite foods; hiding all the time; lethargy; a change in posture or walking style; or any other change from established behavior patterns.

, With some pets, a wait-and-see approach is sensible when it comes to deciding whether to seek medical assistance. Because guinea pigs can go from seemingly healthy to critically ill in a matter of hours, however, it is essential to quickly identify and act upon any possible signs of sickness or injury. The potential embarrassment of taking a healthy guinea pig to the vet’s office is nothing compared to the pain you will feel if you wait too long to seek treatment for an illness that could have easily been addressed.


Guinea pigs, for instance, are more susceptible to having adverse reactions to certain antibiotics than many other pets. This means that you need to seek out an exotic pets veterinarian with ample experience with guinea pigs, and that you need to keep a close eye on your pet’s behavior even after antibiotic treatment has begun., Your vigilance in watching for potential signs of illness needs to be matched by your vigilance in ensuring healthy conditions for your guinea pig. This combination of prevention and close observation offers your best bet for enjoying years of health and happiness with your pet.


Provide your guinea pig with an appropriate, consistent diet (mainly hay and leafy vegetables — see How to Care for Guinea Pigs for details) and ample fresh water. Keep its bedding and enclosure clean, and offer it a low-stress living environment and regular exercise.Guinea pigs often do better in pairs or groups than alone, but always quarantine a new arrival for two to three weeks before introducing it to the group., Because healthy guinea pigs eat so consistently, they also tend to keep a fairly consistent weight. Unexplained, rapid weight gain or (especially) loss is always a cause for concern.A weight fluctuation of one ounce (up or down) in a week is not cause for concern on its own.
A weekly fluctuation of two ounces should raise your alert to any other signs of illness.
A gain or drop of three ounces in a week is a “red alert” — contact your veterinarian.
If the fluctuation is four ounces or more, seek immediate veterinary attention.

, Healthy guinea pigs should not normally have bald patches or skin that appears raw, cracked, or inflamed. Examine your pet daily for changes in hair coverage or skin condition.Infestation by mites or lice is unfortunately not uncommon for guinea pigs. Watch for signs of hair loss and itching, as well as skin inflammation, especially near your pet’s rear end.
Ringworm (a skin infection) also often affects guinea pigs. Watch for bald patches that often appear first on or near the head, and which reveal red, flaky skin.
Any evidence of unusual hair loss or skin irritation / inflammation warrants a call to the vet.

, The older your guinea pig gets, the more likely it is to develop tumors. Often these are benign in nature, but they can also be a sign of cancer or another serious illness. Regularly look and feel (gently) for any new bumps or protrusions, and contact the vet if you find any.Between one-sixth and one-third of all guinea pigs over age five will develop some sort of tumor. Benign tumors can often be removed or ignored, while little can be done for most cancers.

, Changes in the condition or appearance of a guinea pig’s eyes are often an indication of infection. Conjunctivitis (pink eye), for instance, which is a bacterial eye infection, tends to cause redness and inflammation on the eyelid and surrounding the eye, and can cause oozing or dripping of fluid from the eye.While ear infections are less common than eye infections in guinea pigs, check the ears for pus or other discharge. Also, if your guinea pig appears to be going deaf, is constantly scratching its ears, is walking with a tilt or imbalance, or is walking in circles or rolling, you may be dealing with an ear infection.

, Guinea pig teeth grow constantly, and are meant to be kept worn down to the proper length by the roughage they eat. Due to heredity, improper diet, or another cause, some guinea pigs will end up with teeth that are too long and/or misaligned, which is known as malocclusion. Malocclusion in turn can make eating difficult or even impossible, leading to a host of problems, or cause bleeding and possibly infections.If your guinea pig starts eating less than normal, starts drooling far more than usual (sometimes called “the slobbers”), or is bleeding from the mouth, have it checked for malocclusion. Most cases can be treated by filing or cutting down the teeth.

, Pneumonia is the most common cause of death in pet guinea pigs, and is usually caused by a bacterial infection. Treatment can be a challenge due to guinea pigs’ intolerance for certain antibiotics, but early detection is the best way to increase the likelihood of recovery.Watch for unusual oozing or discharge from the nose; sneezing; difficulty breathing or wheezing; fever; weight loss; loss of appetite; change in attitude (depression); inflamed, crusty, or dull and sunken eyes; or lethargy. Generally speaking, pneumonia should be ruled out any time your guinea pig displays common signs of illness.

, Your guinea pig’s waste can tell you a good deal about its overall health. A lack of frequent urine or stool production is an immediate cause for concern, as is evidence of blood in either. Alternatively, excessive urination or diarrhea also often indicate a problem and should be addressed without delay.While cleaning your guinea pig’s living space, familiarize yourself with the typical output and appearance of its waste. Healthy guinea pigs are well-oiled machines when it comes to eating food and producing waste, so take deviations from the norm at either end as evidence of a possible illness.

Add soft fruits and veggies to your pet's diet.,
Provide a water bottle.,
Give your guinea pig a probiotic.,
Avoid forcing your guinea pig to eat.",How to Help a Constipated Guinea Pig1," These foods can help loosen the bowels. Fiber-rich fruits and vegetables will help your guinea pig’s digestive tract healthy.Add greens to your pet's diet slowly. An abundance can lead to diarrhea.
Do not feed your guinea pig cabbage, cauliflower, or raw beans (excluding green beans). These can produce gas and bloating in your guinea pig.;
, Fresh, clean water is crucial if you want your guinea pig to have good digestive health. Change the water in the bottle daily, and test it with a few taps to ensure the water flows properly from the mouthpiece.


If your guinea pig is in truly dire straits, you may need to encourage it to drink by offering it a syringe filled with water.

, Probiotics contain microorganisms which restore balance to the gut bacteria. These will help jump-start your guinea pig’s digestive tract. Several options are available to you:


Probiotic supplements specially designed for guinea pigs can be obtained from most pet stores. These are administered orally when mixed with water, or rectally as an enema (a fluid mixture injected into the rectum).Be aware that the bacteria in a guinea pig's gut is very different from in a human gut. Do not give a guinea pig dairy products or yogurt drinks designed for human use. Instead, speak to your veterinarian about a probiotic that is suitable for herbivores.
Mix half of a fresh dropping from a healthy guinea pig with a small amount of water. Known colloquially as “poop soup,” this mixture functions as an effective probiotic. Use it to soften food pellets or administer it orally via syringe.Don't worry if this seems strange. Guinea pigs consume cecal pellets, the greenish droppings which contain important nutritional compounds, as part of their normal behavior., If your guinea pig is constipated, it will not have much of an appetite. Insisting that it eats, or hand-feeding it, could further complicate its situation.


If you suspect your guinea pig is constipated because he is not passing pellets regularly, then your guinea pig may not be eating well. If your guinea pig is not eating well, then take him to see a vet immediately. Not eating can indicate that there is a serious problem.

",How to Have a Productive Vet Visit With a Guinea Pig,";
, This is in the general article as well, but in guinea pigs, take specific notice of (and record if possible):


Weight loss. It can indicate any number of problems.
Anorexia (refusal to eat). Weight loss may be accompanied by this, but if you take note of whether the weight loss is related to anorexia, it can help with diagnosis.
Scratching and hair loss.
Cold/flu-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, crusty eyes, labored breathing or cough.
Bleeding from any opening.
Lethargy (general disinterest in life, lying down a lot).
Swollen body.
Limping, head tilt or loss of balance.(1)

, The adrenaline of the vet visit may cause the guinea pig to temporarily hide their symptoms, so make a record to help you remember.

,, If you have other guinea pigs and they have not been separated due to quarantine, bring them as well. They will provide companionship and a healthy example for the vet to compare to your sick pig.


Keep the guinea pig away from dogs and cats in the waiting room. The presence of these animals will cause additional stress.

, Refer to your written record.

Check for anal blockage.,
Wash your hands.,
Put gloves on.,
Apply lubricant to your guinea pig's anal area.,
Gently squeeze the blockage out.,
Repeat the process as needed.",How to Help a Constipated Guinea Pig2," The fecal mass is brown and located in the guinea pig's anus. If present, it will be quite visibly lodged halfway out of the anus, stretching it open. Depending on the severity, the anus may be enlarged and protruding from the guinea pig’s hindquarters. If you see a fecal mass blocking the anus and don‘t mind getting hands-on, you can take direct action to solve the guinea pig’s constipation.

, Scrub thoroughly with an antibacterial soap. This will reduce the chances of any infectious germs being transmitted to your guinea pig.

, Digital evacuation of feces is a messy business. Vinyl gloves will keep your hands clean and stink-free.

, Smear petroleum jelly, mineral oil, or Vaseline around the outer anal wall to ease the passage of the fecal mass.You can also try immersing the guinea pig’s hindquarters in water for a minute to soften the stool.


Placing a towel beneath the guinea pig will give it a soft surface to lay or stand on, and make cleanup easier for you.

, Place your thumb and pointer finger on either side of the fecal mass at the base of the anus. Apply pressure, increasing slowly. Carefully move the mass out of the guinea pig’s body. This process is known as digital evacuation.


Enlist the aid of a partner to hold the guinea pig while you remove the blockage if you find it too difficult to do alone.
Be cognizant of your guinea pig’s needs. If he or she is squealing or indicating pain, you might be squeezing too hard.
Do not employ any sharp instruments in an attempt to scoop the anal blockage out. The possibility of accidentally harming your guinea pig is not worth it.
If you feel uncomfortable performing a digital evacuation, take your guinea pig to the vet and have him or her perform the procedure.

, In the case of impaction, you may need to repeat the process for several days until the guinea pig's muscles recover enough to resume normal bowel movements.


As guinea pigs age, impaction often becomes a chronic issue. This is because the rectal muscles which govern the pig’s ability to pass excrement grow weak. An older guinea pig will require digital evacuation on a regular basis.

Look for signs your pet may be constipated.,
Monitor the situation carefully.,
Consult a veterinarian.,
Follow your vet's instructions carefully.,
Schedule a follow-up visit.",How to Help a Constipated Guinea Pig3," You should take your guinea pig to see a veterinarian if you notice any signs of constipation because constipation is rare in guinea pigs. Signs of constipation include:A distended stomach
Lack of droppings in pet's cage
Lethargy
Straining during a bowel movement

, Make a note of exactly how long your pet has been constipated. Weigh him or her regularly, and be attentive to changes in weight. Note when your pet last pooped, how much it is eating, and how much it drinks. You will need all this information when you take your pet to the vet.

, If you don't have a veterinarian already, find one that has experience with guinea pigs. Your best bet is to consult an AEMV (Association of Exotic Mammal Veterinarians) member.


You can find an AEMV member by visiting aemv.org/index.php/members/vet-locator.
If your local vet doesn't treat guinea pigs, ask for a referral to a vet that does.

, If you have any questions, give him or her a call. Don't be afraid to ask your vet about specific instructions, and let them know any details (such as prior bouts of constipation or illness) that might affect their diagnosis.

, Even if your guinea pig seems to recover after receiving medical attention, it's always a good idea to ensure that whatever caused the constipation won't return.

Keep your guinea pig in a smooth-bottomed cage.,
Use soft bedding in the cage.,
Clean your guinea pig’s cage.,
Don’t let your guinea pig’s cage get humid.",How to Prevent Skin Problems in Guinea Pigs1," Guinea pigs can develop a skin problem called bumblefoot. Bumblefoot occurs when the skin on the bottom of a guinea pig’s feet gets scratched and develops open wounds. Bacteria can enter the wounds and cause infections. A smooth-bottomed cage will help protect your guinea pig’s feet and prevent bumblefoot.If your guinea pig’s current cage has a wire mesh bottom, and replacing the cage isn’t an option, cover the cage bottom with a lot of soft bedding.;
, Soft bedding will protect your guinea pig’s feet and help prevent bumblefoot. Examples of soft bedding are Yesterday's News (shredded recycled newspaper) and CareFRESH®.Do not use corn cob bedding or wood shavings (cedar, pine). These bedding types can damage your guinea pig’s feet., A dirty cage can increase the chances of skin problems for a guinea pig. Keeping your guinea pig’s cage clean will help prevent skin problems and keep your guinea pig healthy overall. Below are some cleaning tips:


Change the cage bedding each day.Leave a little bit of the old bedding in the cage so your guinea pig has something with its scent on it in the cage.Clean the whole cage at least once a week. Cleaning the whole cage involves washing the cage, food bowl, water bottle, and plastic toys with soap and warm water.
Put your guinea pig in a separate cage while cleaning the dirty cage.
Wait until the cleaned cage is completely dry before putting everything back in the cage.

, In the wild, guinea pigs live in a dry climate. Unfortunately, a cage environment can get humid. This extra humidity increases the risk of skin problems in guinea pigs.To prevent humidity, make sure the cage gets plenty of air circulation. Wire cages have good air circulation.If your guinea pig is in a glass aquarium, use a wire mesh cage top. This type of top will allow for good air circulation.
Regularly cleaning the cage will also help lessen cage humidity.

Wear gloves if you have to handle your hamster before he's properly trained.,
Avoid picking up your hamster for about a week.,
Train your hamster at his own pace.,
Schedule training sessions for the evening.,
Speak to your hamster softly through his cage.,
Introduce your scent to your hamster.,
Give your hamster treats.,
Pet your hamster gently.,
Pick your hamster up.,
Keep interacting with your hamster regularly.,
Use slow movements whenever approaching your hamster.,
Put your hamster down if he starts struggling.,
Leave your hamster alone if he doesn't approach you.,
Avoid touching your hamster if he's sleeping.",How to Train a Hamster Not to Bite," There could be several situations, like if your hamster is injured, that will require you to handle your hamster prematurely. Make sure you wear gloves if you do this, because your hamster will probably try to bite you. Be as gentle as possible as well. Before your hamster is used to you, he'll probably struggle when you pick him up. Make sure to apply only light pressure or you risk injuring him., Hamsters are prey animals, meaning that they're naturally used to bigger animals hunting them for food. Therefore your hamster will probably perceive you as a threat until he knows better. If you try to handle him before this period is up, he'll probably bite out of fear. For the first week you own the hamster, just let him explore his cage without touching him. In the meantime, there are exercises you can do throughout that week that will get him used to your presence and gradually make him comfortable enough to handle., Your hamster must be comfortable at each stage of training before you move on to another. Make sure he is receptive to everything before you progress, or you risk scaring him and setting back the training process.

, Hamsters are nocturnal animals, and will be more active in the evening and at night.Take advantage of this by waiting until the evening to start any training. Your hamster will be more awake and receptive to new experiences.


Also stick to a regular schedule. Hold training sessions every evening. This repetition will help your hamster get used to you more quickly.

, Hamsters have sensitive hearing and can pick up on slight sounds. Loud or harsh noises will scare them, while a soft voice will attract them. Before handling your hamster, spend some time talking in a soft voice. If your hamster learns that you produce soft sounds and not loud ones, he'll be more willing to come over to you., Like most animals, hamsters rely heavily on their sense of smell. When your hamster is used to your scent, he'll be willing to trust you.Start by washing your hands. This will prevent you from spreading germs from your hamster, and also ensure that there are no other scents on your hand besides your own. If you smell like food, the hamster might bite because he thinks he can eat you.Slowly insert your hand into the cage and leave it there. For the first day or two, your hamster will probably just run away. It is important to not chase after him, as this will frighten him more. Simply leave your hand motionless and wait for him to approach you. It may take a few days before your hamster is comfortable enough to approach.
When your hamster does approach you, remain still. He's only investigating, and a sudden movement will scare him off again. He'll probably cautiously sniff you a few times. Wait until he gets very close and starts sniffing all over your hand before progressing further.

, When your hamster has grown comfortable enough to approach you, start giving him treats like broccoli or cauliflower.Again, always make sure you open the cage and put your hand in slowly to avoid startling your hamster. Also make sure the hamster can see the treat and that it's not hidden in your hand. Otherwise, he might think your hand is the food and bite you.Don't try to pick him up when he takes the treat. He's still getting used to you and touching him will still probably startle him. Repeat this process for a few more days until your hamster eagerly runs over when you put your hand in the cage.

, When your hamster has grown comfortable enough to approach you, then you can start petting him. When he comes over, slowly lift your hand and pet him. Start with just a finger, and then if he is comfortable use the rest of your hand., After your hamster is comfortable with being touched, then you can try picking him up. This will probably be a week or two after you first get him. Hold out your hand and let your hamster climb in. When he does so, you can lift him up and start playing with him., After your hamster is trained, it will require regular interaction to keep him that way. Try to pick him up every day so he stays acclimated to your scent and is eager to interact with you. If you neglect him, you may have to train him all over again., Even after your hamster is used to you, he can still get startled by sudden movements. Hamsters have poor eyesight and usually interpret any sudden movements as a threat. To avoid bites, always approach your hamster with gradual movements to avoid scaring him., Hamsters bite when they're scared or stressed. If yours starts struggling or trying to get away while you're holding him, that means he's gotten uncomfortable. Pay attention to this non-verbal cue and put your hamster down. Otherwise, he may resort to biting to make sure you get the message., Even when your hamster is used to you, there may be times he just isn't in the mood to be handled. If your hamster doesn't approach you when you reach into the cage, leave him alone. If you grab him when he isn't in the mood, he might bite you., Hamsters are naturally nocturnal creatures, meaning they're more active at night. That means that there's a good chance your hamster will sleep for a portion of the day. Don't disturb him if he's asleep. He'll probably interpret being suddenly awoken as an attack and naturally bite. If your hamster is asleep, let him stay that way."

Check your guinea pig’s skin frequently.,
Have your vet trim your guinea pig’s nails.,
Look for hair chewing behavior.,
Take your guinea pig for regular vet exams.",How to Prevent Skin Problems in Guinea Pigs2," Keeping a close eye on your guinea pig’s skin will help you see when the skin is healthy and when there might be a problem. When your guinea pig’s skin is healthy, it will look smooth and pink. With a skin problem, the skin will have lumps, scabs, dandruff (white flakes), or hair loss.Examine your guinea pig’s skin when you hold it. Guinea pigs like to groom themselves and their cage mates, so your guinea pig won’t mind you looking at its skin.
If your guinea pig’s skin looks abnormal, take it to your vet for treatment. Your vet will be able to diagnose and treat the skin problem.

, Long nails can curve under a guinea pig’s feet and damage the skin, causing bumblefoot. To prevent bumblefoot due to long nails, have your vet trim your guinea pig’s nails. Your vet can let you know how often your guinea pig will need nail trims.


You could also trim your guinea pig’s nails yourself. However, if you are not comfortable doing this, or your guinea pig is really squirmy, have your vet trim the nails.

, Sometimes, guinea pigs will engage in a behavior called barbering, which is chewing the hair. Guinea pigs will do this to themselves or other guinea pigs. Barbering leads to hair loss. If you see barbering behavior between multiple guinea pigs, put them in separate cages.If your guinea pig is barbering itself, this may signal stress.

, Regular vet exams can help prevent skin problems and keep your guinea pig healthy overall. Take your guinea pig to your vet once or twice a year for a health checkup."

Add vitamin C to your guinea pig’s diet.,
Feed your guinea pig hay.,
Minimize your guinea pig’s stress.",How to Prevent Skin Problems in Guinea Pigs3," Vitamin C is a very important nutrient for guinea pigs. Without enough vitamin C, guinea pigs can develop skin problems. Because guinea pigs cannot make their own vitamin C, they must get it from their diet.Feed your guinea pig vitamin C-rich foods, like vitamin C-fortified guinea pig pellets and leafy greens (spinach, romaine lettuce, parsley).After about three months of storage, guinea pig pellets start losing their vitamin C. To make sure your guinea pig gets enough vitamin C, consider giving it a vitamin C supplement.Talk with your vet before giving your guinea pig a vitamin C supplement.

, Not only is hay very healthy for a guinea pig, it can help prevent barbering.If your guinea pig is chewing its own hair, feeding it hay will give it something else to chew on.This will prevent further barbering.


If you have multiple guinea pigs in one cage, placing hay in the cage may prevent barbering. If it doesn’t, then separating the fighting guinea pigs will be the best way to stop the barbering.

, Keeping your guinea pig stress-free will help prevent skin problems.One way to minimize stress is to avoid overcrowding your guinea pig’s cage. The website http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/guinea_pigs/tips/guinea_pig_housing.html has guidelines to help you determine how many guinea pigs can fit comfortably in a cage, according to cage size.


You can also minimize stress by giving your guinea pig plenty of toys. Guinea pigs like cardboard toys, like empty toilet paper or paper towel rolls.
Guinea pigs like routine. To keep your guinea pig from feeling stressed, keep its daily routine as steady as possible.For example, keep its diet the same and handle it at about the same time each day.

Determine the species of your hamsters.,
Find out the gender of your hamsters.,
Put the hamsters in separate cages side by side.,
Watch your hamsters play and interact in their cage.,
Be prepared for normal squabbling between your hamsters.,
Look for signs of fighting between your hamsters.,
Move a bullied hamster to a different cage.,
Do not let the hamsters socialize once they are separated.",How to Get Hamsters to Stop Fighting1," Certain hamster species should be kept alone, in separate cages, and away from other species. Certain species can also only socialize if they are of the same gender. Take your hamster to the vet to confirm her species, or ask the pet store where you purchased your hamster about her species.Syrian hamsters, also called Golden hamsters, are the most common species, and the largest of the species. They come in a variety of colors, though the most common is a golden, light brown coat with black spots and a white underbelly. They also have beady eyes, large ears, and short tails.Syrian hamsters should never be kept together as they are territorial and solitary creatures. These aggressive tendencies start to develop when Syrian hamsters are between 6 and 8 weeks old. Once they reach 8 weeks, they should be housed on their own in separate cages.Dwarf hamsters are the second most common species and are smaller than Syrian hamsters. Dwarf hamsters have a dark strip of fur running from their head down to their tail and are often brown in color, unless they are albino, then they will be all white.Dwarf hamsters usually prefer to live socially, in pairs or groups. But their sociability varies, and some dwarf hamsters prefer to live alone.
Chinese Dwarf hamsters are the third most common species. They are small, about 4-5 inches long, with silky gray-brown fur and black stripes down their backs. These hamsters are sometimes mistaken for mice, as they have longer tails than other hamster species. Their long tails make them great jumpers and climbers. They enjoy human interaction, but don't usually play well with other hamsters, so keep only one per a cage. They are also nocturnal, so they will run around and make noise at night.Please note that there is no such thing as hamster breeds. There are only hamster species and colorings.;
, The best rule of thumb is to keep hamsters of the same gender together and separate hamsters of different genders in separate cages. Hamsters of the same gender tend to fight and squabble less than hamsters of different genders.If you want to try to keep hamsters of different genders in the same cage, introduce them when they are young., This initial set up allows the hamsters to get used to each other's scent without physical contact. Let them smell and interact with each other through the bars of their separate cages. Once they appear to be tolerating each other, try putting them in the same cage.


Before you put them in the same cage, make sure the cage is neutral and does not contain the scent of either hamster. The cage should be clean or new, have clean bedding, and clean toys. This will give the hamsters fewer things to fight over and dissuade them from fighting over territory.

, Once you place the hamsters together in one cage, pay attention to how they interact with each other. Do they play with each other at least once a day or ignore each other? Does one hamster seem more forward or aggressive than the other hamster? This will help you get a sense of their dynamic and if they are starting to become aggressive with each other.


Do not leave your hamsters alone in their cage until you are satisfied that they are tolerating each other. You should feel they are not physically dangerous to one another or likely to harm each other. If you are not sure if they are getting along, remove them from the same cage and place them back in separate cages. Try placing them together again the following day and watch them interact for signs they are getting along.

, Normal squabbling between your hamsters is about dominance, where one hamster puts the other in her place and asserts herself as a dominant one. If your hamsters are chasing and squeaking, this is considered normal squabbling. It can be loud and distressing to watch, but as long it is brief bursts of chasing, sniffing, and squealing, it is considered normal dominance behavior. You should let the hamsters squabble and not interfere, as this is their natural way of asserting dominance.One hamster may jump on top of the other hamster until the bottom hamster squeaks in submission. The hamster on top, now confirmed dominant, should then release the bottom hamster.
These displays of dominance can happen over and over, and as long as the hamsters get up and resume their activities, it’s normal. Normal squabbling can occur for a few weeks when the hamsters are first placed in a cage together, and may happen over the course of the hamsters’ lives.Avoid interfering with your hamster when they are squabbling or removing one hamster from the cage and then putting her back in the cage again. As long as the hamsters are squabbling, you should let them respond to each other on their own. Pulling one hamster out of the cage can create confusion and stress out your hamsters., Fighting is characterized as biting, chasing, and one hamster cornering another hamster to prevent escape. These are not normal dominance displays, they are signs of bullying and fighting between your hamsters.One hamster may cause injury to the other hamster and prevent the bullied hamster from eating, drinking, or sleeping.
A bullied hamster may become withdrawn, lose or gain weight and stop playing with the other hamster or with you. She may also even become aggressive towards you when you hold her or touch her. These are all signs of severe distress, and you will likely need to adjust the bullied hamster’s living space or separate her from the other hamster., Some hamsters, even if they are the same gender, may end up fighting despite your best efforts to keep them both happy. If the bullied hamster is displaying stress signs like lack of appetite, fearful hiding, or injuries from biting by the dominant hamster, its time to move the bullied hamster to a separate cage. Separate hamsters are better than aggressive and stressed out hamsters together in the same cage.Once you move the bullied hamster to a new cage, try to keep the new cage as close to her old cage as possible. This will allow her to transition more easily to the new cage and reduce her stress levels., It’s important that once you separate the hamsters, you do not take them out of their cages at the same time, place them together in a cage, or play with them together. They may start fighting again or act aggressively towards each other if they are socializing at the same time."
"
Get a larger cage for both hamsters.,
Set up the cage so there are no blind corners or blocked off areas.,
Provide two beds, two water bottles, two food dishes and two wheels.,
Stick to the same daily routine for both hamsters.,
Handle both hamsters together before returning them to their cage.",How to Get Hamsters to Stop Fighting2," Your hamsters might be aggressive with each other because they have limited space to live and play. This can trigger your hamsters’ natural tendency to fight for territory. One hamster should have at least 360 square inches of floor space, so two hamsters should have at least double this size.Talk to a sales associate at your local pet store to find a cage that is large enough to keep both hamsters happy and stress free.

, It's important to lay out your hamsters’ home so neither can trap the other. Avoid long expanses of tube and any blind corners. Make sure any boxes or houses in the cage have at least two exits, so both hamsters cannot be trapped together at once.There should also be no narrow corners or sections in the cage to prevent the hamsters from getting stuck or blocked in.

, Have two sets of accessories for each hamster so they don’t have to share or fight over a bottle or a bed.Having two beds is important, as most hamsters do not like sharing beds. If possible, you should also provide two sets of toys, like two wheels or two boxes with two entrances.
You should also provide two large food dishes for the hamsters, large enough to fit one hamster in the dish. Most hamsters like to sit in their food dish and don’t like to fight for space in the same dish.

, Show the hamsters equal treatment and care by feeding, playing, and grooming them at the same time every day. This will cut down on any tension between them and bond them together. Once the pair spends significant amounts of time together, they should treat each other like companions and have less aggression towards each other., Try to always take both hamsters out of their cage at the same time and handle them together in your hands so they have the same scent on them. This will reduce chasing in their cage and any stress between the hamsters."
"
Understand that hamsters are crepuscular.,
Play with your hamster during the early evening.,
Feed your hamster in the early evening.,
Take out all the toys at night and replace them in the day.,
Be sensitive to your breed of hamster.",How to Get a Hamster to Sleep1," This means that, while hamsters are not technically nocturnal (awake only at night), they are most active during dawn and dusk periods, and will be more active at night than during the day.If you have a hamster in your room, they will naturally want to play at night.;
, If your hamster wants to sleep, let it, but as soon as it’s awake again, continue playing with it. This may incline your hamster to stay up more during the day, since it will enjoy the play and attention, and the hamster may then be tired out and sleep better at night.


Do this for several days or even weeks until your hamster starts to wake up earlier in the evenings to play. Your hamster will still be active at night, but you can teach it to expect some activity during the day, too.

, Even if your hamster isn’t inclined to wake up until later in the evening, you can try feeding them slightly earlier.Chances are, your hamster won’t be able to resist the smell and will get up to eat, then may stay awake to play.


If you do this routinely, your hamster will associate getting up earlier with getting fed, and it will begin to get up earlier naturally.

, This way, your hamster will not have anything to play with during the day, which may make them more inclined to sleep and rest.


Give your hamster a new toy or a treat every day to keep him up and active.

, You should be able to find out what breed of hamster you own, either by checking with the pet-store clerk (before or after you buy the pet) or by looking up your hamster’s physical description online. The three most common types of hamster are Dwarf, Syrian, and Chinese.Syrian hamsters have relatively inflexible sleep schedules. They need to sleep during the day and have their activity times during evening and night.
Dwarf and Chinese hamsters, on the other hand, have more flexible sleep schedules. They may get used to activities during the day, and begin to wake up naturally for play."
"
Let the hamster sleep.,
Play with your hamster in the mornings and evenings.,
Locate your hamster’s cage away from your bed.,
Keep the cage in a room that’s quiet during the day.,
Give your hamster total darkness at night.",How to Get a Hamster to Sleep2," It can be harmful to your hamster to disrupt their sleep schedule. Sleep-deprived hamsters may become irritable and even bite their owners, or they may develop stress-induced illnesses.Do not force your hamster to be awake at a time when it normally wouldn’t be.


Since hamsters are not strictly nocturnal, they will naturally have periods of activity during the day. Don’t expect a healthy hamster to sleep through the whole day without stirring., Since these are the times that your hamster will naturally be most awake and hence most playful, plan on daily playtimes with your hamster, especially in the evening.Regular play with your hamster will also help tire it out, so it will sleep more soundly during the day.


If can encourage your hamster to run on its wheel before you’re in bed and asleep, it may result in your hamster being more relaxed and quiet while you’re asleep.

, This issue is important for both you and your hamster. If you don’t want to be kept awake at night by your hamster as it eats, runs about its cage, and is generally active, put its cage somewhere out of earshot. For example, you could keep your hamster’s cage:On the floor in your bathroom.
In a spare room or guest room in your house.
In your living room, if it will be quiet and dark at night.

, It’s important to give your hamster a quiet space to sleep in, so it can fully rest during the day and not become sick or stressed. For example, if your living room is often loud and crowded during the day, that would not be a good location to keep your hamster’s cage.
If you recently bought your hamster from a bright, crowded pet store, it may take time for them to settle into a regular sleeping routine. To help them along, keep their cage for a quiet room for as much of the day as possible., Your hamster’s cage should be located in a room that is not lit at night, either by streetlights or by internal lights in the room. Hamsters need to be in a fully dark setting at night, just like they would be in nature. If you have a night light in your room, or keep your hamster in a room that stays bright at night, you’ll need to move the cage location.Darkness at night will make your hamster feel energized and comfortable. If it’s light at night, your hamster may become confused & uncertain how it should behave.
Be consistent with the amount of light and darkness your hamster receives every day. In general, hamsters should have 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark a day."

Build up trust with your hamster.,
Hold your hamster.,
Carry your hamster when it’s tired.",How to Get a Hamster to Sleep3," Although hamsters love human interaction and thrive on getting gently petted, played with, and picked up, they will need time to learn to trust you.For the first week that you own your hamster, avoid making quick movements around it. Let the hamster sniff you before you touch it or pick it up.


After about a week, your hamster will develop trust and you can start to pick it up more regularly.

, The more comfortable your hamster feels being touched and held by you, the sooner it will be willing to sleep in your hand. Once your hamster is comfortable being stroked and picked up, you can begin to carry the hamster for longer periods of time.Cup the hamster loosely in your hand when you hold it. Never squeeze or trap the hamster with your hands. If it seems agitated or uncomfortable, put the hamster back in its cage.
Never wake your hamster up to play. When they’re sleeping during the day, let your hamster rest. If you wake it up and attempt to play, the hamster may bite you., To let your hamster sleep in your hand, you’ll have to spend time carrying it when it’s sleepy. This should be in the early evening (when it’s just waking up) or late morning (when it’s going to bed). Try sitting down or remaining still when you’re holding your sleepy hamster, and soon you’ll find it sleeping in your hand.


Don’t pick your hamster up once it’s already asleep.

Look for signs of illness.,
Call your veterinarian.,
Take your hamster to the vet to be euthanized.",How to Get a Hamster to Sleep4," Since hamsters are such small animals, it can be difficult to tell if your hamster is sick. However, hamsters often hide their illness as long as possible, and any illness can quickly become serious. To see if your hamster is sick, look for signals like:Inactivity and loss of appetite.
Sneezing or wheezing.
Discharge from eyes or nose.
Diarrhea or wetness around the tail.
Hair loss.

, Hamsters are prone to certain illnesses, including respiratory infections and pneumonia. Hamsters can also contract skin diseases, including ringworm and various infections.If you suspect your hamster may have an illness, call your veterinarian and schedule an appointment for your hamster.


Many of these diseases are induced by stress and rapid diet changes.

, If your hamster is seriously ill and cannot be saved by medication or surgery, it may need to be humanely euthanized. This will also be the case for very old hamsters, whose quality of life has begun to decline. Euthanasia is inexpensive, and vets may be willing to perform the procedure for free if your hamster is suffering.


DO NOT attempt to put your hamster to sleep at home. Although they are small and delicate animals, hamsters, like any other animal, should only be euthanized by professional veterinarians."

Swab the guinea pig's ears gently.",How to Do a Health Check on a Guinea Pig," Are they eating their regular pellets and treats at the normal rate? If not, this can indicate a variety of digestive problems.If the guinea pig has not eaten anything for more than 8 hours you should see a veterinarian immediately.
Otherwise, you might cut back some on fresh vegetable and fruit treats if you've been feeding them a lot to the pet. This can cause diarrhea. Usually a couple days of just feeding the guinea pig its normal pellet food and hay will help. You can then resume gradually introducing fresh fruits and vegetables on a smaller scale.
If the lack of eating persists for any reason then you need to take the guinea pig into the veterinarian within 24 hours.;
, Does the guinea pig sound like they are breathing heavy or gasping for air? Respiratory problems are extremely common for guinea pigs.If the guinea pig is breathing very heavily then seek immediate attention by a veterinarian.
Notice if the guinea pig is sneezing, has discharge around the eyes, and/or has a runny nose. These are all signs of a respiratory infection and require quick attention by a veterinarian within 24 hours.

, Is the guinea pig more lethargic, dragging itself around, and/or refusing to leave its hideaway? This could indicate several problems.If the guinea pig appears to barely be able to move or even stand then seek immediate attention by a veterinarian.
Guinea pigs do like their quiet time to nap, but should also be fairly active the rest of the time. If you see the pet unable to walk without dragging itself around, unwilling to move around to eat, or too infrequently leaving its hiding house then this could be more serious.
There could be a physical ailment like pododermatitis (""bumblefoot""). This is an infection of the guinea pig's feet that can cause lameness and pain. Usually this is quite visible as a swollen area on the feet of the pet, and it can bleed. See a veterinarian within 24 hours to begin treatment.
Other problems could be indicated by lethargy including circulatory, digestive, respiratory, and parasitic. Seeking veterinary advice quickly is crucial to a timely diagnosis and treatment.

, If the guinea pig is ""wheeking"" too often, especially during normal functions like urination, this could indicate a particular problem.Guinea pigs can make noises for food or communication frequently, but if they are doing it during normal bodily functions it could indicate a problem.
If they are crying out when they are urinating, leaving droppings, or you touch a particular area then this might be a problem with that function or area. See a veterinarian with 24 hours.
If they made the sound when you touched a particular area then you might inspect the area of the body in accordance with the later method to see if you can find more information on what might be wrong.

, There is no substitute for being observant to other changes in your guinea pig's behavior. And each guinea pig has different personality quirks that you will be more familiar with than others.It's difficult to predict all behaviors your guinea pig may normally have before a problem changes things.
Use your judgment to notice if the pet is behaving differently, but defer to your veterinarian if you are the least bit unsure.

, This could be in patches on the guinea pig's body or oozing out of different areas like the mouth or rectum.Bleeding is usually the sign of an infection or sometimes in the case of excessive scratching can leave the guinea pig vulnerable to infection.
Guinea pigs cannot fight infections on their own, and require medical assistance to do so.
Infections rarely cross species, but you do not want to be careless. Clean any exposed surfaces thoroughly with a disinfecting product like Lysol and use medical gloves to handle the guinea pig.
See the veterinarian immediately.

, This can signify several problems not the least of which are digestive in nature.If the guinea pig is not urinating at all then you should see a veterinarian immediately.
If you notice discoloration in the guinea pig's urine, softness or infrequent release of droppings, or a combination of these then see the veterinarian in the next few days.
Sometimes the guinea pig may be suffering a vitamin deficiency, or suffer a problem with the effectiveness of the digestive tract itself.

, Check for hair loss, patches of missing fur, and/or irritated skin.Hair loss could indicate a number of problems such as skin irritations, malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, toxins, parasites, infections, or other problems not readily apparent.
If hair loss is the only symptom then you should try to see the veterinarian within the next few days.
Increase bathing efforts and cleanliness around the cage.

, Don't touch the eye itself, but also look for redness or dullness that could hint at other problems.Any discoloration on or around the eye can be a sign of infection. If the guinea pig doesn't seem too bothered by it then see the veterinarian in 24 hours.
You can try using a cotton swab to gently rub off some of the crust to see if cleaning it off is sufficient to alleviate the guinea pig's discomfort.
If the guinea pig is scratching or crying out from the eye irritation then see the veterinarian immediately.

, Mites and infections can get in the ears too.Check the ears for a build-up of wax or a grey-black colored substance.
Either of these in significant amounts may be indications of an infection or presence of mites.
Any of these conditions can be treated by your veterinarian.

Clean your hands.,
Give your hamster something to chew on.,
Find a place to keep your hamster when cleaning.,
Check to see if your hamster is injured.",How to Care for a Hamster That Bites1," Hamsters don’t have great eyesight, which means they will navigate by smell. If your hands smell like something, especially something tasty, your hamster may bite your hand thinking it is food. If you are going to reach into the cage for any reason, make sure your hands are clean so your hamster can recognize your scent and know you are safe and friendly., Hamster teeth will grow for their whole lives. To keep them from getting too long or too sharp, make sure you give your hamster something to gnaw on like wood or twigs. This is healthier for your hamster, and will make bites less painful., You don’t want your hamster running around while you are trying to clean the cage. It will probably get startled, and may bite as you move around the cage. Make sure you take it out and put somewhere that it can’t get loose. A small animal carrier is a good place for a temporary stay.A hamster ball is not a good idea. If you put your hamster in a ball, you need to keep an eye on it at all times to make sure it doesn’t get overheated, or roll the ball down the stairs or to another place it can get hurt. That’s pretty hard to do when your concentration is on cleaning the cage.

, Hamsters that are hurt may become more aggressive, and bite to show their discomfort from a serious injury. When you pick up your hamster to take it to the vet, make sure you wear gloves as a precaution.Some other signs that suggest your hamster is injured include refusing to eat, bleeding, swelling, limping, labored breathing, squeaks or cries of pain, or sleeping more than usual.
Keep an eye out for wet tail, a serious disease. If your hamster’s rear area gets wet and stays that way, you’ll need to take it to the vet. Wet tail comes from unclean cages, so make sure you clean out the cage regularly.

They love to play and need frequent exercise.Heatstroke, however, can make a guinea pig feel very weak. If your guinea pig has heatstroke, his legs will become weak. He will be unable or unwilling to move.If your guinea pig is able to walk, he may stagger around. In addition, his muscles may start to tremor.With heatstroke, your guinea will stop playing and running around.;
, When healthy, your guinea pig will quietly breathe about 80 times a minute.This sounds fast, but it is normal. If he has heatstroke, you will see him panting and struggling to breathe.His panting will get faster as his heatstroke worsens.He may start breathing very heavily—you may see his whole body move as he tries to breathe., Heatstroke can cause guinea pigs to drool, which is not normal guinea pig behavior. Also, his saliva may look thick or feel sticky, rather than feel fairly thin. If your guinea pig will let you, look in his mouth—his tongue will be bright red.His tongue should be pink.


His gums, which should also be pink, may look very pale or red., Normally, if you touch your guinea pig, you will feel his natural body heat. However, if he’s suffering from heatstroke, he may actually feel hot to the touch. Gently touch your guinea pig to see how warm he is. His ears, in particular, will feel very hot.An increased heart rate is common in guinea pigs with heatstroke.Be aware, though, that the heart of a healthy guinea pig beats over 200 times a minute.You can try to touch his chest to feel his heart beat, but it will probably be hard to tell that it’s beating faster than usual.

, Heatstroke can make your guinea pig physically ill. He may start vomiting or have diarrhea.As long as he is healthy and eating a normal diet, he should not vomit or have diarrhea.


Normal feces look like soft, dark pellets. If your guinea pig has diarrhea, his feces may be watery and less formed.

, Guinea pigs, despite being very active, are usually not restless. On a normal day, your guinea pig will keep himself busy by moving from one activity to another, enjoying each activity. If he has heatstroke, though, he may be restless and agitated.It will look like he just can’t make up his mind with what he wants to do.

, Heatstroke can cause seizures in guinea pigs. During a seizure, your guinea pig would fall to one side and experience muscle spasms and fast eye twitching.The eye twitching may last for several minutes. You may hear your guinea pig squeal or screech during the seizure.Seizures are not very common in guinea pigs., With handling and quality time together, your guinea pig will recognize your voice and respond to you. If he has severe heatstroke, though, he may fall into a coma, lose consciousness, and not respond to you.Try touching him and speaking to him. Even if he is weak and feeling really sick, he may still be alert enough to respond to you.

, When your guinea pig is suffering from heat stroke, act quickly! The sooner you help him, the better his chances of recovering. Move him out of the heat and take him inside to a cool area. Call your vet right away to let them know your guinea pig needs immediate help.The shade can get hot, so do not simply move your guinea pig to a shaded area outside.

, Before going to your vet’s office, start cooling down your guinea pig at home. Fill a bowl or sink with about 4 cm of lukewarm water and gently place your guinea pig in the water. Scoop some water up in your hands and gently get him wet. Do not use cold water—the cold water would lower his body temperature too quickly and cause him to go into shock.Along with his fur and feet, make sure you get his ears wet.If your guinea pig cannot stand on his own, gently hold him upright in the water.
Rather than put your guinea pig in water, you could spray his fur with tepid water, then fan him., When your guinea pig’s body doesn’t feel so hot to the touch, place him on a clean, damp towel and take him to your vet. Turn on the car’s air conditioning to keep him cool. Rolling down the windows is also an option, but may let a lot of hot air into the car. Once you get to your vet’s office, your vet will take immediate action to cool your guinea pig. They will:Hydrate him
Give him extra oxygen
Give him medication, if needed
Monitor him for other conditions, like kidney failure, shock, and heart problems

Condition your hamster.,
Make sure your hamster is awake.,
Give your hamster some exercise.,
Wear gloves.",How to Care for a Hamster That Bites2," Hamsters don’t like being touched or handled by unfamiliar people. When you get a new hamster, slowly ease into putting your hands near it. This will condition him to your presence, and prevent nervous biting.When you first introduce a hamster to its new cage, leave it alone for a few days to get accommodated to these new surroundings without you.
After a few days, slowly place your hand in the cage when the hamster is awake. Don’t go near it. Instead, let the hamster come to you. Treats can be a good way to encourage your hamster to check out your hand.
Once your hamster is comfortable with your hand, you can move to petting, then picking up. Make sure you cup your hands under the belly to scoop it up gently, but securely.

, Hamsters can get very grumpy when they sleep, and can bite once they wake up. While you may want to pick up and play with your pet, it is better for you both to let it sleep.Hamsters are nocturnal creatures, so they are less active and awake during the day. Your hamster will probably most active and willing to be touched in the early evening., One reason hamsters may bite is because they are bored or restless. Make sure your hamster has an outlet for his energy. You can take it out of the cage to let it run around freely in a carefully watched setting, or maybe even in an exercise ball. In the cage, you can consider plastic tubes to explore, or a solid exercise wheel., If you have a particularly aggressive or sick hamster, it’s probably a good idea to wear gloves when putting your hands into the cage. Thick gardening gloves should be enough to let you keep a grip on your hamster while not letting its teeth get into your skin."

Remain calm.,
Clean the wound.,
Bandage the cut.,
Watch for symptoms of other diseases.",How to Care for a Hamster That Bites3," If you are bitten, don’t overreact, and avoid doing things to excite the hamster. Don’t shake or shout at your hamster. This will only scare it, and make it more likely that it'll bite again. If you are holding the hamster when it bites you, slowly lower it back into the cage. This should cause the hamster to release its grip. If that isn’t enough, slowly pry its jaws open to get your skin out of its mouth.

, Hamster bites can break the skin if their teeth are particularly long, but for the most part should be treated as a minor wound. Wash with soap and water to clean off any blood and pat the wound dry with a clean cloth.If the bite does create a deep puncture wound, and your skin is badly torn with lots of bleeding, apply pressure with a clean, dry cloth, and get to a doctor as soon as possible.

, After cleaning up the bite area, you’ll want to make sure you prevent an infection. Apply an antibiotic cream to the cut, then cover with a clean bandage. Make sure the bandage covers the entire wound., Like other animals, hamster bites can transfer bacteria and other disease to humans, including Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis, rabies, and tularemia.If you are bitten, keep an eye out for additional signs like fever, pain, and failure to heal around the bite area, which could be signs of a more serious problem. If you do notice more serious signs following a hamster bite, contact a doctor immediately.


Rabies is extremely rare in hamsters. Unless the hamster is sick and acting unusual, and rabies is widespread in your area, you are probably not in danger.If you suspect the hamster may be rabid, go to your doctor immediately.

Sounds of troubled breathing include wheezing and clicking noises.Normal breathing in a guinea pig should be easy and quiet.


If your guinea pig has allergies, he may breathe more loudly, but probably won’t have trouble breathing.;
, Respiratory problems, whether an allergy or infection, can affect your guinea pig’s eyes. For example, you may notice discharge coming from his eyes.This discharge may be yellow or green if he has an infection. Your guinea pig’s eyes may look crusty from the discharge.His eyes may also look red.Conjunctivitis, which is inflammation of the inner eyelid, can make eyes look red. It is usually seen with respiratory infections., Look for discharge coming from your guinea pig’s nose. Since respiratory infections can cause sneezing, you may see the discharge when your guinea pig sneezes.The discharge may be yellow or green if your guinea pig has an infection.


Allergies can produce a sore nose if the nose becomes itchy.A sore nose will look red from constant rubbing or scratching.

, A respiratory infection can make your guinea pig feel pretty sick. His physical appearance will worsen. His fur will start to look ruffled from a lack of grooming. He may also look a little smaller from weight loss., If your guinea pig is feeling sick, he probably won’t feel like eating much. Pay close attention to how much food you put in his cage and how much he eats. You may notice your guinea pig eating less, or not eating anything at all., Guinea pigs are usually very active and playful. Respiratory problems can make your guinea pig feel tired. He may move around more slowly in his cage. If your guinea pig has a cage mate, he might be less playful and social with him.Your guinea pig might want to just be alone and not play very much.

, Events that are stressful to your guinea pig could weaken his immune system and increase his chances of getting a respiratory problem. These events could cause changes in behavior. Examples of stressors for your guinea pig are pregnancy and a change in routine (e.g., cleaning, feeding).Other potential stressors are:Cage crowding
A new cage mate
Bedding (pine, cedar) that can irritate the respiratory tract
Too much attention from people

, Respiratory problems in guinea pigs can go from mild to severe in a matter of days.When you first notice signs of respiratory problems in your guinea pig, take him to your vet for a diagnosis. The sooner your vet can determine what’s going on, the sooner your guinea pig can get the treatment he needs.


If possible, take your guinea pig to a small animal exotic veterinarian.They will have experience working with small animals like guinea pigs.

, Providing detailed information about your guinea pig (e.g., overall health, previous diseases or injuries, when the respiratory symptoms started) will help your vet diagnose and treat your guinea pig.Your vet might ask you specific questions about your guinea pig’s history, such as if he has a new cage mate and if he’s been bred recently.Since a lack of vitamin C can cause respiratory problems in guinea pigs, your vet may also ask about your guinea pig’s diet., Your vet will do a thorough physical exam of your guinea pig. They will look for the same things you may have observed at home, such as nasal discharge and labored breathing. Your vet may also touch your guinea pig’s lymph nodes, which may have gotten bigger if your guinea pig has an infection.Lymph nodes are part of your guinea pig’s immune system and are located throughout his body.


In addition, your vet will look in your guinea pig’s mouth for signs of dental disease, which can sometimes cause respiratory problems.Signs of dental disease in guinea pigs are misaligned teeth and swellings.The swelling are pockets of infection.
Your vet will also listen to your guinea pig’s lungs., Your vet can take several different types of x-rays, depending on what they think is causing your guinea pig’s respiratory problems. For example, if your guinea pig has dental disease, your vet will want to take skull x-rays to get a better look at the teeth and jaw bones. If your vet suspects pneumonia, then chest x-rays will allow them to view your guinea pig’s lungs.X-rays can help your vet to determine the extent of your guinea pig’s respiratory problem, as well as his likelihood of recovery after treatment., Respiratory infections in guinea pigs are usually caused by bacteria — Bordatella bronchiseptica or Streptococcus pneumoniae.To test for bacteria, your vet will take small samples from your guinea pig’s body. For example, your vet may use a q-tip to take a swab from the inside of your guinea pig’s nose. A small sample of your guinea pig’s conjunctiva may also be helpful in identifying bacteria.Nasal swabs may not be ideal, since bacteria from the environment can easily enter the nose. A tracheal wash, during which your vet would take a fluid sample from your guinea pig’s trachea, would allow your vet to identify the bacteria more accurately.Your guinea pig may need to be sedated so your vet can take the samples.
Your vet will look at the samples under the microscope to identify the specific type of bacteria and see the cells (‘neutrophils’) that are present with bacterial infections.

Allow a new hamster to settle in the cage.,
Wash your hands before handling.,
Cup your hand beneath the hamster’s stomach.,
Set up a playpen area.,
Give them treats in your hand.,
Hold them for five to fifteen minutes daily.,
Avoid waking your hamster up.",How to Deal With a Mean Hamster1," If your brand new hamster is biting, it may mean that the hamster has not adapted to their new settings. Give the hamster a week or two to become used to their new cage, smells, and surroundings. This adjustment period will make the hamster feel more secure and less threatened.


You can try sitting next to the cage and talking to your hamster so that it becomes used to your presence.
Do not touch the hamster or put your hand in their cage during this time.;
, Hamsters are more likely to bite you if they smell food on your hands. Try to use a soap that has no perfume or scent. Hand-washing is also a good habit to prevent the spread of disease.


If it makes you feel safer, you can wear gloves while training your hamster. That said, gloves will do little to stop the biting. They only protect you., Grabbing a hamster around their back or body may startle them. Instead, lower your hand into the cage, and scoop under the hamster. Gently raise the hamster out of the cage, using your other hand to catch the hamster if it falls.If your hamster does not like to be lifted, you can place a bowl with sunflower seeds inside the cage. Wait for your hamster to crawl into the bowl before lifting the bowl out of the cage., Block off an area where your hamster can safely play. Exercising outside of their cage will improve the hamster's mood, and it will teach them that you are not a threat. You can use books, wire pet fences, or pillows. Make sure that all doors are closed in the room, just in case the hamster does slip out of their play area. Allow the hamster to wander over the floor and around your hands.


Supervise your hamster carefully, and remember that hamsters like to climb.

, This will show them that you are friendly, and it will reward them for being around you. The hamster may realize that you will not hurt them. Good treats include:


A small piece of cauliflower
An apple slice
Raisins
Green, leafy vegetables, Daily handling sessions will quickly familiarize your hamster with your scent and presence. Hamsters do not have good sight, so allowing them to sniff around you will help them become comfortable with you. Biting should end after a few weeks of such sessions., Hamsters are nocturnal creatures, and it may be tempting to wake them up in middle of the day when you want to play with them. If you do this, however, they may bite you. It is best to only handle hamsters when they are already awake."

Search for veterinarians, then make a list of veterinarians who specialize in ""exotics."" Call a few nearby offices, have a conversation, and make an appointment for your pet with the vet you feel is most qualified.


Vets who do not work with ""exotics"" work mostly with cats and dogs. They are unlikely to have the specialty knowledge that would allow them to care for your guinea pig.;
, Look online for The Association of Exotic Mammal Veterinarians. They maintain a directory of veterinarians who specialize in guinea pigs and other unusual pets. Search your area code in the AEMV directory, or zoom in on their world map.Search the Small Animal Channel. If you're lucky, you can find a vet near you who not only works with exotics, but works frequently with guinea pigs., If you live in a rural or sparsely populated area, you may have trouble locating a vet who works with guinea pigs. However, veterinarians in such areas are often experienced at working with rabbits. Many guinea pig owners recommend finding a good rabbit specialist, and coming armed with information.If you find a good vet who hasn't worked with guinea pigs, research your guinea pig's health, and come in with questions and theories to share with your vet.Keep your guinea pig far from rabbits in the office, and try to confine your pet to sterilized surfaces. There are illnesses that guinea pigs and rabbits can communicate., Call the vets listed in the yellow pages who do not treat exotics. Ask them what vet they would refer you to if you were a customer who had a guinea pig. If you know a vet personally, ask him or her who the best exotics vet in the area is. If several vets tell you the same answer, call the vet they recommend., If you know anyone who owns a guinea pig, ask that person what veterinarian they have experience with. If you don't know anyone, find someone who does. You might try asking an elementary school teacher or administrator. Guinea pigs are popular classroom pets.


Teachers may also be able to put you in touch with parents of students who are guinea pig owners.

, Check listings of vets who have been recommended by other guinea pig owners. Make sure the reviews are current. Check sites that list vets by recommendation, such as the Guinea Lynx list, and CavyInfo International. Search review sites such as Vet Ratingz, Yelp, and Google Reviews.


Not every good vet is reviewed online, but the really bad ones usually are.If several customers have had disappointing experiences with a vet you're considering, they've probably posted about it.

, Ask to speak to the veterinarian between patients. If you are having trouble getting through, politely explain to the staff that you are a potential customer who has a few specific questions that only a vet can answer.

, Some excellent questions include: how many guinea pigs do you see and treat each month? What is your medical training as pertains to guinea pigs? Who would you recommend for a late night guinea pig medical emergency?Ask politely, and explain that you are looking for someone who specializes in your pet's unique needs.

, For instance, ask what antibiotic the vet recommends for adult guinea pigs with a URI (upper respiratory infection)? They should answer Baytril, Doxycycline, and Chloramphenicol, or other drugs not containing penicillin. If they recommend Amoxicillin, or other penicillin-based drugs, they don't know enough to treat your guinea pig., If you have a pregnant guinea pig, ask if the vet has dealt with pregnant guinea pigs. If she or he has, ask how he or she recommends treating a guinea pig during and after pregnancy. If your guinea pig has tooth issues, such as impacted molars, ask if he or she has dealt with guinea pig dental needs. If you have your choice of vet, opt for the most experienced.

Separate hamsters into different cages.,
Make sure that your cage is big enough.,
Provide your hamster with a cave to sleep in.,
Give your hamster toys.,
Place chew toys in the cage.",How to Deal With a Mean Hamster2," Syrian hamsters are territorial, and they like to live alone. If you keep two or more in a cage together, they may fight each other. This will cause injury to many of them, and it may make them more aggressive towards you.Dwarf hamsters live in pairs, so you may keep two together in the same cage. Choose two hamsters of the same sex to prevent breeding., Hamsters need plenty of room to exercise and move around in. If you don’t give them the proper space, they may become cranky. A cage should be at least 22 x 14 x 8 inches., Hamsters like to sleep in small, enclosed spaces. They will often create dens in boxes or tunnels in their cage.This makes them feel safer in their cage, and it will help improve the quality of their sleep, making them happier animals. You may be able to give them a more secure space by providing them with a cave in their cage, such as a:


Flowerpot
Coconut shell
Small box
Dome

, Active hamsters are happy hamsters. Hamsters need plenty of exercise, or they may become grumpy. Hamsters like to run, climb, and burrow. Small toys that satisfy these needs include:Plastic wheel (wire wheels may injure their legs)
Ladders to climb on
Wooden balls
Tunnels and mazes

, Hamsters are natural chewers, and if they bite frequently, it may be because they have nothing to chew on in their cage. You can give them walnut shells, unpainted oak or Cherrywood squares, wooden balls, paper towel tubes, and rolled oats.Once a week, put a small, hard dog biscuit in the cage. They will think it is delicious, and it will help satisfy their urge to chew."

This will distract the hamster from biting while not harming them. It will also encourage them to let go of you., Lower the hamster into the cage. Remember not to grab your hamster around the sides as you do so. The hamster will need time to cool off before you handle them again. If the hamster is still biting your skin, you can gently pry them off of you., Wash the bite with warm water. Use antibacterial soap. You can also apply an antibacterial ointment on the wound. If you are bleeding or skin was broken, put a bandage or light dressing on the wound. Watch the wound for swelling. If swelling does not go away after three days, visit a doctor.If a child or pregnant woman has been bitten, watch for flu-like symptoms following the bite such as nausea, muscle pain, or fever. This could be a sign that they have contracted lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) from the hamster., Constant biting may be a sign of health problems. Visiting the vet will also ensure that it does not have any health problems or diseases that it could pass onto you."

However, guinea pigs can hide signs of illness efficiently. Usually, when symptoms arise it means that your guinea pig is in the late and most critical stages of their illness. So act fast when you spot the symptoms. A list of signs include;

Loss of appetite or disinterest in food.
Coughing, wheezing or sneezing.
Dull appearance.
Fever and lethargy.
Weight loss.
Inflammation of the ear/ear drum.
Respiratory distress.;
, A temperature that exceeds 110 F is a dangerous sign. An abnormally high temperature or fever is one of many signs of Pneumonia. Check the temperature with a thermometer on your guinea pigs ears. Additionally, you can feel the ears with your fingers if you can pick up on changes easily. You can purchase a thermometer suitable for guinea pigs from your vet clinic or pet shop.

A healthy temperature for your guinea pig should be about 99-103.1 F., A rapid and sudden weight loss is another a sign of pneumonia which is a common result from lack of eating. If you don't know your guinea pig's original weight you can check from the guidelines of what a healthy guinea pig should weigh.

Boars should weigh around 900-1200 grams whilst females should weigh a healthy 700-900 grams. The weight guideline is different to baby or growing guinea pigs.It's important to weigh your guinea pig weekly nether-the-less to spot symptoms of illness early so that you can treat them early., A guinea pig that refuses to eat or drink anything is a dangerous sign of an illness. Guinea pigs cannot go long without eating and they are in risk of their digestive tract shutting down on them. You will need veterinary assistance as soon as possible or at least begin to syringe-feed your guinea pig., If symptoms persist, it's time for a vet check. Look for a reliable exotic vet that specialises in guinea pigs with experience. Remember, only a professional vet can assist with diagnosis and treatment. Don't rely on 'home-remedies' to cure your guinea pigs illness all together.

Pneumonia is a serious illness. Don't hesitate to contact a vet. Holding it off could result in your guinea pig's life.

, Some veterinarians aren't knowledgeable with guinea pigs. It may sound odd but there have been numerous reports of vets with the improper study of guinea pigs that end up giving out the wrong information. If a clinic doesn't have a vet specialised in guinea pig's then they may just turn you away. However, most small animal clinics should have employed vets available to treat guinea pigs. But not all will have a specific exotic vet.

In a critical situation where there is no exotic vet available near-by, ignore this step.

, The difference between a general veterinarian and a specialised exotic vet is huge. An exotic vet specialises in dealing with guinea pigs and studies for a completely different range of animals. Their knowledge should be greater specifically on guinea pigs, they should have more experience and of course know how to diagnose and treat a problem better that is to do with your cavy., The vet you're looking for should have plenty of experience and good feedback to guarantee that they'll give your guinea pig the best possible treatment and ensure a successful vet visit and outcome., Sometimes the most reliable and trustworthy way to find a good vet is to ask for suggestions from others who keep guinea pigs. If you know someone who has guinea pigs then ask them. If not then you can always find a reliable guinea pig forum or group online.

, Pneumonia is a contagious illness that will spread to other guinea pigs in the cage if they come in contact with the sick guinea pig. You should keep your guinea pig in 'incubation' mode where they are separated off from any other cavies and kept out of contact to prevent spreading of the illness., Your vet should prescribe you with medication or antibiotics to raise your guinea pig back to health. Or you can purchase most antibiotics at your nearest vet clinic. Antibiotics should be syringe fed to guinea pigs as they may refuse to eat or drink if you apply it to their food or water.

Baytril is a recommended antibiotic to use for bacterial infections. The antibiotic can be syringe fed to your guinea pig with fruit juice to coat the flavour.Feed your guinea pig antibiotics three or more times a day unless said otherwise by a vet.Pain killers (or medication) should only be administered to your guinea pig under the supervision of a vet., If not prescribed to you by a vet, but they're advised to be used, you can find specific antibiotics for guinea pigs in pet shops or vet clinics. You should be looking for an antibiotic that kills off the infection of streptococci bacteria. As much as they are said to be unnecessary, they can drastically help your guinea pig in a critical situation. As mentioned above, Baytril is a recommended antibiotic as is Bio-Lapis, Avipro Plus and Pro-C as a probiotic.

Some antibiotics can be dangerous or inaccurate so get them signed off by your vet. Additionally they can clarify what antibiotics should be used and where you can buy them.

, If no signs of eating (or drinking) persist it is important that you step in and hand-feed your guinea pig via a syringe. Guinea pigs cannot go 24 hours without digesting anything so it's critical that you act fast. You can purchase critical care from a vet clinic or pet store. Additionally you can grind pellets down with water to make a mash.

You should be feeding your guinea pig 4-5 times a day or every 2-3 hours with 10ml at a time.Syringe feeding can be time consuming and difficult to do when your guinea pig has laboured breathing. Ask your vet for advice and remember to apply the food slowly.
Baby food can also be mixed with the critical care or pellets. Look for an all natural food that is low in sugar. Pumpkin, carrot, squash, apple and kale are all good ones to try.
Oat mash will help your guinea pig gain weight and should be available at your nearest super market.

, Keep track of your guinea pig's weight to notice any improvements or sudden weight loss. A sudden loss of a lot of weight isn't good and you should see the vet. If no improvements persist then inquire with your veterinarian., It's critical that your guinea pig has time to rest and improve in a safe environment where they can live without disturbance. It's important for the cage placement to be indoors at this critical time. The temperature should be stabilised and between 65-75 degrees F.

Keep them away from doors and windows - there should be no drafts!
Don't house your guinea pig in an area with temperature that fluctuates such as outdoors. The temperature needs to be stabilised.

, Cedar, pine and sawdust are the main causes of respiratory problems in guinea pigs. Switch these three bedding's permanently to something more suitable for your guinea pig such as fleece or hay. While your guinea pig is in their critical incubation period, keep them on old white towels to keep track of their droppings.

A sick guinea pig may have trouble moving on loose bedding. Switching to folded towels should make it easier for your guinea pig to manoeuvre around the cage and monitor urine and stool output., A sick guinea pig will benefit with an extra boost in temperature - but not not over-heated. Wrap a hot water bottle in a towel and place it in a corner of the cage. Always allow your guinea pig space to move away from the heat source if they get too hot or uncomfortable., Eliminate other pets, younger children and noisy objects in the household from your guinea pigs room. It is important that your guinea pig is given the time to improve their physical health in a calming environment., Guinea pigs are very messy animals. A deep clean should be performed at least every 3-4 days and spot cleaned daily. Disinfect the full cage monthly with a pet-friendly disinfectant spray. Remove all the faeces, urine and dirt build up to prevent the growth of bacteria.

An easy home-made remedy that will eliminate urine odour is by using a vinegar-based spray made of 1 part water and 1 part white vinegar. The acid should kill off any dirt and bacteria.
Make sure to thoroughly rinse the cage with clean water afterwards to eliminate the chemicals left behind.
Wear disposable gloves when you clean out the cage. Humans can catch the illness just as much as guinea pig can. Protect yourself when dealing with dirt and bacteria., These two animals are known to harbour the bacterial infection and can pass it onto your guinea pig. It is wise to keep guinea pigs and rabbits/rats separated to lessen the risks of your cavy catching some sort of sickness., These type of bedding have toxins in them that are poisonous to guinea pigs and cause respiratory diseases. Cedar should definitely not be used. Pine can be used but only if the label specifically says the bedding has been kiln-dried., Guinea pigs are very messy animals. A deep clean should be performed at least every 3-4 days and spot cleaned daily. Disinfect the full cage monthly with a pet-friendly disinfectant spray.

They are the body’s attempt to ‘wall off’ an infection and keep it from spreading. Abscesses can form either after a bite from another guinea pig, or if something rough and sharp (e.g., straw) goes through the skin.They can form anywhere on a guinea pig’s body, but the most common locations are the head and neck.An abscess in the neck could be a swelling of the lymph node in that area.Lymph nodes are small glands that help the body fight infection.
An abscess can feel firm or soft.;
, Abscesses can also form in the mouth or jaw of a guinea pig. Abscesses in these areas can become large very quickly.Your guinea pig may look fine on one day, then have a large abscess the next day.


When you handle your guinea pig, gently open its mouth to see the abscess. If the abscess is in the jaw, you will see a large bump along your guinea pig’s jawline.

, Guinea pigs can get several types of cysts, with the most common being a sebaceous cyst. Sebaceous cysts contain oil from the skin glands that produce oil (sebaceous glands). Sebaceous cysts are typically located on a guinea pig’s back and near the rump, but can form in other places as well. Although they can become very large, cysts are usually about the size of a pea.Cysts become a problem if they become large.

, Tumors can also form lumps. For example, a lump on your guinea pig’s tail could indicate a skin tumor called trichofolliculoma.A lump on the chest could indicate another type of cancer called lymphosarcoma.A female guinea pig can develop a mammary tumor, which you would see as a lump on the belly.Lipomas are tumors made up of fat cells. There are no specific places where you would look for a lipoma on your guinea pig. Your guinea pig may have several lipomas at one time., Sometimes, a lump can make a guinea pig feel so bad that it doesn’t want to eat. For example, if your guinea pig is not eating its meals and doesn’t want any tasty treats, check its mouth for an abscess.Even if your guinea pig wants to eat, the size of the abscess in its mouth or jaw could make it difficult to chew food.


Sometimes, a guinea pig will stop eating right before an abscess ruptures (an abscess can sometimes rupture on its own)., When you hold your guinea pig, take a quick sniff of its breath. If your guinea pig has a mouth abscess, its breath will probably smell quite unpleasant. The unpleasant smell would be due to infection. Along with bad breath, you may also notice drooling., An abscess can be very uncomfortable for a guinea pig. If your guinea pig squeals with pain when you pick it up, seems really tired, or doesn’t want to play with you, it could have an abscess. You may also notice your guinea pig heavily grooming the area of the abscess., If you see a lump on your guinea pig’s body, schedule an appointment with your vet. Your vet will perform different tests to determine the cause of the lump. Do not delay in taking your guinea pig to your vet—if the lump is an abscess, it could make your guinea pig very sick by overwhelming your guinea pig’s natural defenses against bad bacteria., During your appointment, give your vet as much information as you can about your guinea pig. For example, talk about your guinea pig’s overall health and when you first noticed the lump.In addition, provide information about your guinea pig’s diet, living environment, and if it has cagemates.


Your vet will use the information you provide to come up with a diagnosis. Therefore, the more information you provide, the better.

, A physical examination will give your vet important clues about what caused the lump to form.Your vet will weigh your guinea pig, look it over from head to toe, and listen to its heart and lungs. Your vet will pay special attention to the area of the lump.

, A blood sample can indicate if your guinea pig has an infection, which would be important in diagnosing an abscess. Your vet will look at the white blood cell (WBC) count. WBCs are part of the immune system and help fight infection. A high WBC count indicates an infection. A low WBC count can also indicate infection if it has been present for so long that most WBCs have been depleted.Blood work is useful in diagnosing tumors like lymphosarcoma.Blood work can also provide a good picture of your guinea pig’s overall health.

, Your vet may want to run some extra tests to confirm the diagnosis of the lump. One type of test is called fine needle aspiration (FNA), during which your vet will use a small needle to withdraw a fluid sample from the lump. Your vet will look at this fluid under the microscope to detect different cell types (e.g., fat cells, white blood cells). Another type of test is a biopsy, which would help your vet diagnose a tumor.Your vet would need to sedate or anesthetize your guinea for FNA or a biopsy.
A fluid sample from the lump can be useful for identifying bacteria. The test to identify bacteria is called a ‘culture.’"

However, there are no behavioral cues that 100% guarantee that your guinea pig is dying; some may give no warning whatsoever, while others may appear to be on their deathbeds but live for quite some time after. Some potential signs include:Loss of appetite
Slow movement or lack of activity
Incontinence
Less playful behavior
Labored breathing;
, Unless you have had your guinea pig since he was born (or got him from someone who did), chances are you don't know exactly how old he is. Signs of aging show up at roughly predictable points in a guinea pig's life and can be used to estimate their age (and thus how close to death they may be). This is best done by a veterinarian. Signs of aging include:Thickened, twisted toes
Cataracts (cloudy eyes)
Tumors/growths on the body or head
Stiffness in the joints/hobbling

, As your guinea pig ages (and especially in his last few weeks of life), he may become less agile and slower in his movements. Once he becomes unable to climb ramps or stand or walk around much, this is a sign that his body may be failing him.You should always note your pet's energy level relative to his younger, healthier self. Some guinea pigs may have always been lazy; if yours is this way, then his slowness may not be a sign that he is nearing the end of his life.
If your pet is overweight, his fatigue may be a result of this. Keep your pet healthy by monitoring his food and treats and keeping his intake at a normal level.

, If you suspect your guinea pig may be sick or injured, or if you think he may be approaching the end of his life, seek medical attention for him. In addition to providing potentially life-saving treatment for your sick guinea pig, a vet can provide her professional opinion regarding your pet's wellbeing and whether anything can be done to save him.


In some cases, an aging or terminally ill guinea pig may be in a great deal of pain (depending on the nature of his malady); if your vet tells you that this is the case for your pet, consider whether euthanasia is the most humane option., Guinea pigs are social creatures, so if you have more than one, you should avoid separating them when one is dying. Doing so could make both animals anxious or sad, and this is the last thing you want to do as your guinea pig makes his grand exit.It might be a good idea to separate your ailing guinea pig from his friends if he is in pain or the other guinea pig tries to rough-house with him. You will need to make this judgment yourself based on the situation.

, Placing a small, light-weight blanket or piece of soft cloth on top of or around your guinea pig will keep him from getting cold and will help him relax. Your guinea pig may become incontinent as his bodily systems begin to shut down, so change out the blanket every so often to keep your pet reasonably clean and comfortable.Many animals (and people) are much more sensitive to cold as they age and begin to die, so keeping your older guinea pig's cage environment slightly warmer than you used to can improve his comfort substantially.
Use a material or cloth that your guinea pig is familiar with to enhance his comfort with the situation.

, A dying guinea pig will become very weak and unable to feed or water himself as his death approaches. You can make his passing less uncomfortable by offering him water from a spoon, syringe, or water bottle. Blend or mix a guinea pig ""smoothie"" that contains hay, water and ground up pellets and feed it to him.


Don't force your guinea pig to eat or drink if he doesn't want to. You simply want to make these things accessible to him if he can't get them himself.
Make sure anything you feed your guinea pig is well-blended so he doesn't have to use up precious energy chewing (which he might not be able to do, anyway).

, You can gently cuddle or stroke your guinea pig to comfort him and express affection. This will help your guinea pig know that he is not alone and should reduce any fear or anxiety he may be experiencing. If you hold him, do so in a way you know he likes and that won't cause him any unnecessary pain or discomfort.


Many guinea pigs like to have their foreheads gently stroked. If you know your pet enjoys this, do this as he passes away.
Take note of any body language or noises your guinea pig may be making and adjust your physical contact with him accordingly; don't do anything that causes your pet pain.

, Your guinea pig will be most comfortable in warm, quiet space with lighting that is neither too bright nor too dark. Soft, pleasant, natural sounds (such as birds singing or the babbling of a brook) may be comforting to your pet. It may also be best to give him some space toward the end so he can slip away peacefully. Check on him often to offer food and water.


If there is a specific toy or other item you know your guinea pig is fond of, place this object next to him. The simple presence of items he enjoys may provide your pet a sense of calm.
Treat your dying guinea pig as you would a sleeping baby; anything that is likely to wake a snoozing infant will probably also be unpleasant for your pet.

, You will need to choose a method for disposing of the remains of your guinea pig once he has died. You can deal with your pet's remains however you wish, so long as it is sanitary and the remains are kept away from children and other pets.It may help the grieving process to incorporate your guinea pig's body disposal into a memorial or burial ritual.
Be sure your treatment of your guinea pig's remains do not violate any laws or health/safety regulations. For example, don't dig a grave on someone else's property or set a fire where prohibited.

, If your guinea pig had a companion (such as a rabbit or another guinea pig), you should allow his body to be viewed by the surviving pet(s). Many animals are able to recognize when another animal is dead, and this sometimes seems to help them cope with the situation.


If you take your dying guinea pig out of his cage and never return him, your other pet may become anxious or mournful as a result of having been ""abandoned"" by his companion.
It is not necessary to leave the deceased guinea pig's corpse alone with the remaining animal; simply showing him the body of his companion and letting him sniff around for a moment should suffice.

, This can take on many forms; a pet memorial of some kind serves to acknowledge your pet's death while celebrating his life. These rituals can be isolated events or can be something you do every now and then to pay tribute to your guinea pig. Whatever you choose to do, it should be something that brings you some peace of mind. Some suggestions include:


Hold a pet burial.
Share funny stories about your pet with friends and family.
Look through old photos of your guinea pig.
Plant a flower or tree in tribute.

, It is entirely healthy to grieve the loss of a beloved pet. You will handle the loss of your guinea pig much more easily if you let yourself experience the natural feelings that accompany the loss of a loved one. This process is really no different from coping with the loss of a human relative or friend.


Seek support from friends, family members, or groups of individuals who are going through a similar situation. Avoid individuals who can't understand your grief or who make light of your feelings in any way.
Allow yourself to be sad and avoid thinking that your feelings are ""silly"" or ""unjustified.""

Recognize the signs of heatstroke.,
Call your veterinarian.,
Remove your guinea pig from the hot area.,
Cool down your guinea pig.,
Do not give fluids to your guinea pig.,
Take your guinea pig to your veterinarian.,
Give your guinea pig plenty of water.,
Turn up the AC.,
Keep your guinea pig cool when he is outside.,
Groom your guinea pig.",How to Take Care of an Overheated Guinea Pig," Your guinea pig’s small size increases his risk of heatstroke. When the outside temperature reaches at least 82°F (28°C) and the humidity is high, he may be at even higher risk of overheating.Knowing what your guinea pig will look like when he is overheating will help you jump into action and get him the care he needs.


Guinea pigs suffering from heatstroke will have trouble breathing, have a bright red tongue, and start slobbering (‘wet chin’). They will also become very weak, look depressed, and maybe even start convulsing.An overheated guinea pig can die if not treated quickly, so you need to be quick with noticing when he needs to cool down.;
, Your veterinarian should know when your guinea pig is overheating.When you call, give the veterinary team as much information as you can about your guinea pig, such as how long he was outside, when you noticed he was overheating, and how he looks now. Calling your veterinarian will also let them know that you will be coming in with an emergency case.

, Take your guinea pig to a cool part of your house and start giving him first aid.Guinea pigs are not able to cool off by sweating or panting,so your guinea pig will not be able to cool off on his own.

, You may be scared at how sick your guinea pig looks, but you will need to stay calm and act quickly to help him feel better. Get a bowl and fill it with about an 1 1/2 inch (4 centimeters) of lukewarm water. Place your guinea pig’s feet in the water for about 10 minutes, letting him stand if he is strong enough to do so.Continue to hold him if he is not able to stand on his own.
If you do not have a bowl nearby, put the same amount of water in a sink and place your guinea pig's feet in the sink.
It is very important that the water is lukewarm. Cold water could cool your guinea pig down too rapidly and cause him to go into shock.Slowly dampen the rest of your guinea pig’s body (e.g., ears, abdomen) with the water. Do not submerse him completely in the water — this could also cause him to go into shock., Heatstroke plus dehydration equals a very sick guinea pig and trying to rehydrate him on your own could make him even sicker.For example, if he is having trouble breathing, he could accidentally inhale the liquid into his lungs. However, if the guinea pig is conscious offer him water to drink.


Leave the task of rehydrating your guinea pig to your veterinarian.

, Your guinea pig will be very sick from overheating, so he will need treatment from your veterinarian as soon as possible. To keep him cool on your way to the veterinarian’s office, place him on a cool, damp towel.Dampen the towel with the same lukewarm water from the bowl or sink. You can also wrap your guinea pig in the towel.Turn on the air conditioning (AC) in your car. You could roll down the windows if the AC isn’t working, but this may not let in enough cool to air to keep your guinea pig cooled down.Your veterinarian will continue to give your guinea pig first aid by keeping him cool and rehydrating him with intravenous fluids. Your veterinarian will also give your guinea pig extra oxygen if he is having trouble breathing.Your veterinarian will monitor your guinea pig intensively for signs of organ damage or failure due to heatstroke. This involves taking blood samples.Your guinea pig will recover in a cool, quiet, and dark area of your veterinarian’s office. Put him in the same type of area when you bring him home.

, Your guinea pig needs water regardless of the temperature outside, but it will be even more important to keep him well hydrated in the spring and summer. Fill his water bottle with fresh, cool water. If you are not home during the day, use a large water bottle that will not run too low when you are away.


Consider placing the water bottle on the outside of his cage, leaving only the tip of the water bottle’s snout inside the cage. This would keep your guinea pig from chewing on and possibly damaging the sipper tube.Refill the water bottle whenever the water level gets low.
When you have your guinea pig outside, place the water bottle in the shaded part of his run or cage. The area of shade will change according to the position of the sun, so you will need to move the water bottle periodically., When it gets hot outside, it is best to keep your guinea pig inside. The ideal temperature for your guinea pig is 64 to 68°F (18 to 20°C). Depending on the temperature inside your house, you may have to crank up your AC to keep your guinea pig cool and comfortable.


If you are using a portable air conditioner, make sure the air is not blowing directly into your guinea pig’s cage. The direct airflow could lead to an upper respiratory infection. If you turned down the thermostat, make sure his cage is not in the direct path of the room’s vents.
Fans are good for evaporating sweat. However, since guinea pigs do not sweat, fans are not that useful., Having outside time is important for guinea pigs. You will need to take special precautions when you take him outside in the spring and summer. For example, take him outside when it is a little cooler—early in the mornings or late in the evening.If you have your guinea pig in a cage outside, cover his cage with cool, damp towels to create a cool, shaded area for him. Reposition the towels depending on the angle of the sun.
Place ice packs or frozen water bottles in your guinea pig’s run or cage. He can lie up against them to cool himself off. Wrap them in towels first so he does not get too cold or damage the skin on his paw pads.
Put a ceramic tile or brick in his run or cage (whichever is most convenient for you to obtain). They repel heat and give your guinea pig something cool on which to lie.
You can also fill a large bowl with ice cubes, cover it, and place it in his run or cage. He can lie against this to keep him cool. Covering it will keep him from falling in.Consider spritzing your guinea pig occasionally with cool (not cold) water.Check on your guinea pig at least every 20 minutes when he is outside., Taking care of your guinea pig’s coat can help keep him cool in the spring and summer. For example, combing and brushing his coat can remove excess fur and matts that could trap heat and cause your guinea pig to overheat.Combs and brushes suitable for guinea pigs are available at your local pet store.


Use a soft-bristled brush and brush in the direction of the fur, making sure not to pull the fur.For the matts, you can try to comb them out or cut them out with a pair of small scissors. Have another person wrap the guinea pig in a towel and hold him if you want to use scissors. If the matts are large, try to comb them out over several grooming sessions.Groom your guinea pig every day,especially if he has long hair.
Take your guinea pig to a groomer if you are not comfortable grooming your guinea pig yourself.

, Your female guinea pig will need to eat a healthy diet to have enough energy and nutrients to meet the demands of pregnancy and nursing. Components of a healthy, balanced diet are fresh vegetables (e.g. turnip greens, cucumbers); small amounts of fresh fruits (e.g. kiwi, papaya, strawberries); and vitamin C-fortified guinea pig pellets.Vitamin C is important to prevent a pregnancy complication called pregnancy toxemia.

, Your female guinea pig's calcium stores will drop significantly during pregnancy and nursing. Provide her with a supply of alfalfa hay,which is an excellent source of calcium.Alfalfa hay is high in calories and calcium. Supplement her her regular hay with alfalfa hay to give her an energy boost.


Timothy hay is also a good choice for female guinea pigs, but is lower in calcium than alfalfa hay.Alfalfa hay should not replace her regular food — it should be provided in a limited amount as a supplement.

, Now that your female guinea pig has pups to care for, her cage will probably get messier than usual; however, she may be too exhausted to take care of all of her motherly duties after she has given birth. Initially, remove the contaminated bedding where the births took place.Then, change out the bedding once a day.Wood shavings are a good bedding option, but you must make sure the shavings are free of aromatic oils — these oils can cause severe respiratory illness in guinea pigs. Also, the shavings should not be made of sawdust or cedar.
HySorb wood shavings are one of the best types of wood shavings available, but they are expensive.
Newspaper is a less expensive option, but is not absorbent and does not absorb odor. If you choose to use newspaper, you should use it in conjunction with a more absorbent bedding that is better at controlling odors.
Other bedding options include cotton cloth, cotton fleece, and towels. Each option is very absorbent, but may need to changed and cleaned on a daily basis., Guinea pig pups are essentially born ready to go: their eyes are open, they have hair and a full set of teeth, and they can run around on their own.They will still need to nurse, though, for three weeks before they are ready to be removed from their mother.


It is okay for you to handle the pups during the nursing period. Their mother will not reject them if they are handled by humans.During the nursing period, the mother guinea pig will clean her pups’ bottoms to stimulate their urination and defecation., Other than nursing, a female guinea pig is usually not very ‘motherly’ toward her pups. Even before she gives birth, you will notice that she does not prepare a nesting area in the cage. After birth, do not be surprised if she doesn’t pay much attention to her pups.Adult female guinea pigs are typically not very protective of their young.Rather than stepping in to raise the pups on your own, allow the mother to nurse her pups, even if it seems like she doesn’t care for them very much.

, Since baby guinea pigs are born fully furred and ready to go, the mother guinea pig is at increased risk of experiencing health problems during and after pregnancy. For example, the mother guinea pig may experience a difficult birth and end up with a prolapsed uterus. You will see the uterus protruding out of her vaginal area.She may also experience circulatory problems because of the extra weight she’s carrying before birth.If her blood is not circulating properly, she may seem overly exhausted and thus unable to care for her pups.
Take the mother guinea pig to your veterinarian right away if she is experiencing complications after birth. She may need intensive veterinary care.

, Mastitis (inflammation of the mammary glands) is common in guinea pigs and can occur after birth. If the mother guinea pig’s mammary glands feel hard or painful to the touch, or look bluish, she probably has mastitis.Check the milk as well. Off-colored or clumped milk are often associated with mastitis.Mastitis is a bacterial infection.If left untreated, it can spread through the mother’s guinea pigs bloodstream. Take her to your veterinarian immediately for treatment (e.g. antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medications)., Although your mother guinea pig may feel exhausted after giving birth, her body will already be ready to become pregnant again. If you have adult male guinea pigs, keep them away from her to prevent back-to-back pregnancies. Since guinea pigs don’t take long to reach sexual maturity,you will also have to keep the male pups away from her as well. Immediately after nursing, you will need to move the male pups to their own cage to prevent them from trying to impregnate their own mother., Both the mother guinea pig and her pups will need to stay well hydrated. Since the pups are so small, you will need to give them their own water bottle that will be low enough for them to sip from easily.The pups’ water bottle will probably be too low for their mother to sip from, so you should purchase another water bottle and position it at a higher height for her.


You may have to go through a trial and error period to determine the ideal water bottle positions for the mother and her pups.

, It is okay to start handling the pups soon after they are born — as long as you don’t interfere with the mother guinea pig’s motherly duties (e.g. licking the pups, eating the placenta, etc). Use two hands to handle the pups: one to support the front end, and one to support the back end. Hold the pup close to your chest and talk to it in a soothing voice.The pups may be a bit squirmy the first time you pick them up. It isn’t used to being held, and may miss mommy. Gently lower the pup back into the cage when it starts to squirm.Early and frequent handling will help socialize the pups and get them comfortable with the human touch.
Handle the pups only when they are awake and not nursing.

, Record each pup's weight soon after they are born, and then daily for their few weeks of life. Healthy pups will gain weight steadily. If a pup is not gaining weight like the rest, it may not be nursing well. For this pup, you should try to give it extra private time with the mom so it can have a better chance to nurse.It is common for pups to lose a little weight in the first few days after birth, then start gaining weight., This is particularly important for white guinea pigs, which are susceptible to a syndrome called Lethal White Syndrome. Signs of this syndrome include small or missing eyes, crooked teeth, and blindness and/or deafness. If you have white guinea pigs pups and notice any of these clinical signs, take them to your veterinarian for treatment.The fact that your guinea pig pups are white does not automatically mean they will develop the syndrome.In general, guinea pigs are hardy,so the pups will probably be just fine after birth.

, Although the pups are tiny, there is an easy way tell which ones are female and which ones are male. Check the anal area of each pup: female pups will have ‘Y’-shaped skin flaps on top of their anuses, and male pups will have slender openings instead of the flaps.If you are uncomfortable with doing this, take the pups to your veterinarian for the sex determination.

, Not only does the mother guinea pig need to be protected from the male pups, but the female pups need protection as well — the male pups could even try to impregnate their sisters! Male pups should be separated from the mother and female pups at three weeks of age (right after nursing). The female pups can stay with the mother until four weeks age, then be moved to their own cage., As much as you love the pups, it may not be feasible for you keep them all. It is ideal to adopt pups out in single-sex pairs. If you have an odd number of pups, then you can try to find someone who already owns a guinea pig that is the same sex as the ‘odd number’ pup you would like to give away.Although tempting, it is not a good idea to offer the pups as ‘free to a good home.’ This can actually devalue them, and cause them to be seen as unimportant and disposable to the prospective owner.Do not give the pups to a pet store. It is likely that the pet store does not screen potential buyers, so someone who does not know how to care for them, and may care for them improperly, could purchase the pups. In addition, the pups could be used as food for the reptiles.If you are unable to rehome the pups on your own, consider contacting a reputable guinea pig rescue organization in your area. Your veterinarian or local pet store may be able to recommend who to contact.

GI stasis can cause a guinea pig’s GI tract to fill up with gas and become visibly enlarged. A bloated abdomen requires immediate veterinary treatment.


If something has blocked normal food movement, such as a hairball, the abdomen can fill up with gas. A bloated abdomen can develop very suddenly.;
, Dental problems, especially overgrown incisors or molars, are a frequent cause of GI problems in guinea pigs. A guinea pig’s teeth grow throughout its life. If these teeth overgrow, they can cause pain in the mouth and make it very hard for a guinea pig to eat. Without being able to eat, a guinea pig can develop GI stasis.


Incisors are the two large, curved teeth in the center of your guinea pig’s mouth. The molars are located in the back of the mouth.
If your guinea pig’s mouth is painful, your guinea pig may not let you examine the inside of its mouth.

, Guinea pigs can develop diarrhea. If your guinea pig has diarrhea, the fur on its hind end may contain fecal material.If your guinea pig is feeling pretty lousy, consider looking at its hind end while it’s in the cage, rather than picking it up.

, A guinea pig with GI problems may hunch its body over because it’s so uncomfortable.If you see your guinea pig hunched over and not moving around much, it may have a GI problem.

, If your guinea pig has a GI problem, it probably won’t feel well enough to groom itself. Because of this, your guinea pig’s fur might look a little ruffled., GI problems cause abnormal pooping behavior in guinea pigs. A guinea pig may develop diarrhea. Or, it may start pooping less, then completely stop pooping.When you clean your guinea pig’s cage, look for its fecal pellets. You may see fewer than usual, no pellets at all, or very loose stools (indicating diarrhea).


If you see fecal pellets, they will be small and hard.If something is blocking your guinea pig’s rectum, the fecal pellets will be soft and have a bad odor. A blocked rectum usually occurs in older guinea pigs.When a guinea pig produces little to no fecal pellets, this does not indicate constipation. Rather it indicates the guinea pig is eating less., A guinea pig with a GI problem will initially eat less, then eat nothing at all. Your guinea may stop eating its pellets and eat only treats, and then stop eating the treats.When your guinea pig refuses the tasty treats it normally loves, you will know it’s not feeling well.


With a decreased appetite, your guinea pig will lose weight., A healthy guinea pig is playful and energetic. A sick guinea pig, though, won’t have much energy or strength. This is especially true with bloating, which can cause major weakness.If your guinea pig feels weak, it won’t move around its cage very much.


If your guinea pig doesn’t want to move, this could also indicate pain., When a guinea pig is in pain, it may grind its teeth. If your guinea pig is in pain due to a GI problem, don’t be surprised if it grinds its teeth.This teeth grinding could cause even more pain if your guinea pig’s teeth are overgrown and cutting into its gums.

, When you first notice symptoms of GI problems in your guinea pig, do not wait and see if the symptoms go away on their own. They won’t. Your guinea pig will need to be diagnosed and treated by your vet as soon as possible.


Not eating for 12 to 24 hours can be fatal for a guinea pig.

, Your vet will do a physical examination of your guinea pig. They will pay special attention to its abdomen. If your guinea pig’s abdomen is bloated, your vet may be able to detect gas in the abdomen, as well as decreased gut sounds.Gut sounds indicate food moving through the GI tract.


Because a bloated abdomen is often painful, your guinea pig may be very sensitive to its abdomen being touched.Your vet may be able to feel fecal pellets in the large intestine.During the physical exam, your vet will take your guinea pig’s temperature. GI problems can lower a guinea pig’s body temperature.Give your vet a detailed history of your guinea pig’s GI symptoms. For example, explain when you first noticed the symptoms, what the fecal pellets looks like, and if your guinea pig has stopped eating.

, Blood and urine samples may help your vet determine the underlying cause of your guinea pig’s GI problem. For example, blood work may indicate liver problems or inflammation in the intestine. Oftentimes, though, blood and urine samples are normal in guinea pigs with GI problems., X-rays would allow your vet to see your guinea pig’s GI tract. X-ray findings that indicate GI problems are listed below:Gas-filled stomach, intestine, and cecum (a pouch connected to the intestines)
Small fecal balls, or no fecal balls, in the large intestine

Feeling the abdomen needs to be done by a professional because it is easy to mistake the bladder, kidney, or even an enlarged ovary for a foetus. Rough handling may cause miscarriage.
The ultrasound, is a non-invasive procedure and can confirm the pregnancy. The ultrasound will also be able to confirm how many pups there are, and how many of them are alive.

, Either the sow was already pregnant when you purchased her or one of the other guinea pigs she has had contact with was a boar.


Pet shops are notoriously bad for sexing guinea pigs and may have mis-sexed one of your guinea pigs. Get an experienced vet to check the sex of all your other guinea pigs.
Pet stores also often house both genders together, and some breeders do not separate the genders early enough so it is possible the sow was already pregnant when you bought her.

, Sows should be over four months old, and under seven months old for their first pregnancy. If they have been pregnant before, they should be under two years old.


If your pregnant guinea pig does not meet the age requirements, talk to your vet about a pregnancy plan. For young guinea pigs, this may include supplementing her diet with Critical Care of a similar product. For older guinea pigs, this may include her carrying out her pregnancy and birth housed at the vets, as she is more likely to need intervention.

This is because sows who are too young are at a greater risk of vitamin deficiencies during pregnancy.
Sows who are too old are at a greater risk of the pelvis not being 'elastic' enough to expand during the birthing process



, Sows who are overweight are at higher risk of toxemia. If your sow was overweight before she became pregnant, discuss with your vet what her diet should be during pregnancy as this is obviously a bad time to restrict her diet.

, Dalmatian and Roan guinea pigs carry a lethal gene recessively. If one parent is of these breeds, for each pup there is a 25% chance it will be born lethal. There are other hereditary diseases that can affect guinea pigs, so where possible check the parentage of the pregnant sow and the boar who fathered the pups.


If there is a likelihood any of the pups are born with this condition you must decide what action you will take. If you are not prepared to care for them yourself, a more experienced guinea pig owner may be willing to take them or you may make the decision to have them put down.
Lethal guinea pigs are white in colour (not albino) are born blind, usually in both eyes, have crooked or deformed teeth, are often also deaf and often suffer from internal deformities particularly to the digestive organs. These pups may die within a few days of birth, or may live for several years. If they do survive the first week they have a shorter than normal life expectancy and will require large amounts of medical care throughout their lives.

, It can be a trigger for diseases such as toxemia, or can scare the sow so she doesn’t want to eat or drink. For these reasons stress should be minimized as much as possible.


Reduce exposure to loud noises or bright lights.
Keep her away from direct sunlight.
Establish a daily routine with set times and stick to it, to provide consistency
Make any changes as early as possible in the pregnancy, when the stress will have less of an effect on the sow.
Reduce handling to minimal levels.

During the last two weeks of pregnancy, do not handle the sow. Instead, coax her onto a towel or into a box.



, It's very important to check on your guinea pig several times a day, ideally every three to four hours. Each time you check, make a mental note of how much water she has drunk and how much food she has eaten.


This allows you to gauge what is normal, so that if she becomes unwell and stops eating, or becomes very thirsty, you will pick up clues early on.
If the sow becomes uninterested in food contact your veterinarian immediately. The vet will assess the guinea pig’s condition. They may prescribe treatment that includes injections of dextrose solutions, steroids and calcium, which may or may not be effective. Loss of appetite can also be a symptom of pregnancy toxemia.

, Check her for signs of illness (e.g. crusty eyes/nose/ears or a thinning/patchy coat) and weigh her. In the last two to three weeks of pregnancy, do not handle the sow. Instead, coax her onto a towel or into a box.


The sow should gradually put on weight. How much depends on the size of the litter, but her weight should never begin fall.
If you have any concerns, do not hesitate to get to a vet.

, Grooming usually requires a lot of handling, so reduce to minimal levels during pregnancy. If the sow is long haired, cut all of her hair short (especially around her rear end) towards the end of the pregnancy as the sow will find it harder to clean herself and the hair may become knotted or dirty.


Do not bath the sow during pregnancy. It will be too stressful for her.

, Continue to allow her ‘floor time’ or to graze outside. Reduce handling by coaxing her into a box or onto a towel to move her. It is important to keep her active to prevent obesity and keep a healthy blood flow, but do not chase her or force her to exercise as pregnancy, particularly large litters, puts pressure on the circulation in guinea pigs and they are prone to heart attacks.

, See Care for Guinea Pigs for what kind of housing is suitable. Ensure the temperature is consistent and do not use multi-level housing.


The temperature outside or in a garage/shed usually becomes too cold at night for a pregnant guinea pig. Pregnant guinea pigs should be kept inside.
Do not keep pregnant guinea pigs in multi-level cages/hutches as their balance will be impaired by pregnancy, and in the later stages of pregnancy they may not be able to get up to the higher tiers.

, If you have multiple sows, remove the boar immediately to prevent others from becoming pregnant as well. If this is the only sow you own, the boar must be removed before the sow reaches 50 days in her pregnancy.


The boar must be removed by 50 days as he may continue to mount her which can be stressful or painful in later pregnancy, and she could become pregnant again as early as two hours after the birth.

, The pregnant sow can be kept with other companions of the same sex if she gets on with them. Guinea pigs are social animals and should be kept in groups even whilst pregnant.


If there are any signs that the pregnant sow is not getting on with another guinea pig, do not hesitate to remove the other guinea pig, but leave the pregnant sow in the hutch/cage she is in.
Remove any other pregnant sows. The placenta contains hormones which can trigger contractions. If the other sow eats it, their own pregnancy may be induced.

, Clean out soiled or damp patches every day, and the whole hutch twice a week or every three days. Only use an anti-bacterial spray if it has been specifically made for use on guinea pig housing.


Keeping a clean hutch will prevent a build-up of ammonia from urine. Ammonia irritates the lungs of pigs and will predispose the pregnant mother to lung infections.

, Spread at least 3 to 4 inches of bedding over the floor of your pet's hutch. The bedding should be soft fleece or grass hay. Alfalfa hay or straw will not be soft enough as bedding.


You should also provide a box, like a small shoe box on its side. Place it in a sheltered part of the hutch, away from draughts. Note that she may chew the cardboard, so have extra boxes or use a wicker or thick-plastic box. Having somewhere to hide will reduce stress.

, In a pellet feed, each chunk of kibble is identical. Choosing pellets over muesli (where you can identify individual peas, corn, wheat etc.) prevents selective feeding. Do not over-feed pellets as too much can cause the guinea pig to become overweight. Read the packet for how much, but it should be no more than a few teaspoons or a dessert spoon a day.


Selective feeding is where the guinea pig chooses the tastier bits of food over less tasty – but often more nutritious – foods. This causes mineral deficiency.
If you are changing the feed, make a gradual change providing a bit of both to start with as otherwise she may not eat the feed at all.

, All guinea pigs should always have access to clean water, but this is even more important when they are pregnant. Empty the water bottle and re-fill daily, to ensure the water is clean.


If the water bottle is usually placed high-up, provide a second water bottle lower down so that the sow does not have to stretch if she does not want to.
Clean the water bottle weekly to prevent the build-up of algae and bacteria. Wash out the water bottle with a gentle dish soap every few days.

, Provide grass hay (timothy or orchard) with a green tinge. Supplement this with a daily dose of alfalfa hay which is higher in protein and calcium. Make sure hay is freely available at all times, and provide in a large ball the guinea pig can burrow in.


Alfalfa hay is great for pregnant, nursing and young guinea pigs but the calcium content is too high for normal guinea pigs as a build-up of calcium can cause bladder stones.

, All guinea pigs should be given at least one cup of fresh vegetables a day, but as the pregnant sow begins to eat more you can increase this to 1½ to 2 cups a day. For which vegetables are suitable, see Care for Guinea Pigs.


Never offer the same vegetable two days running. This prevents an excess of one particular mineral that might be contained in that vegetable. For example, carrots contain lots of oxalate. If your pet has too much of this, it can build up in urine and cause bladder stones.

, Pregnant guinea pigs are vulnerable to vitamin C deficiency and calcium deficiency. Ensure you are providing enough of these by using a supplement such as Oxbow Natural Science Vitamin C or a similar product.


Never provide a multi-vitamin. Excess vitamin C is passed in the urine so can’t be over-dosed, but other vitamins can build up and create problems.
Do not rely on foods that list added Vitamin C as an ingredient. Vitamin C is highly unstable and breaks down within 8 weeks of the manufacturing date. If the food has been stored for a while at the retail outlet, the chances are the vitamin C content is already negligible by the time you open the bag.
Never use a water soluble tablet. They become ineffective quickly and may put the sow off the water, leading to dehydration which could be fatal during pregnancy.

, Give a small cube of fruit such as apple, strawberry or seedless grape every 3 days.


Fruits should usually be given sparingly to guinea pigs because the acid can give them mouth ulcers. However, toxemia is in part a lack of sugar, so keeping sugar levels high is important.

, Use a veterinarian familiar with guinea pigs, and not just your regular cat and dog vet.


Emergency phone number for the vet.

Post the number on a piece of paper next to the guinea pig’s hutch/cage. If you need it, you don’t want to have to hunt around for it.


Phone number for the out-of-hours vet.

If there is not an out-of-hours vet in your area, discuss this with your vet to come up with a plan. They may be willing to attend themselves, or you may have to contact an experienced breeder.


Critical Care or a similar product as it is likely you will need it for at least one pup.
A clean towel.

, Even if your vet has given you a due date, she may give birth several days either side of this. You may notice a slight widening of the pelvic bones in the sow, this indicates that she will probably birth within the next week.

, It is a lot safer if someone oversees the birth. Ideally, check on her every 2-3 hours. Whilst most births occur during the day they can happen at night so check on the sow during the night as well.


If you cannot check on the sow because of work etc. ask a friend or neighbour to check on her. A local breeder may also be willing to help.

, Both of these are fatal without treatment so be on constant look out for: loss of appetite, changes to drinking levels, drowsiness or weakness and more obvious signs of illness such as muscle spasms or drooling.

, When you are checking on your guinea pig, listen for any groaning. Your guinea pig will give a distinctive groan when she is going into labour. Even if you've never heard it before, chances are you’ll know it when you hear it.

, It should be under an hour and there should be about 5 minutes between pups. The sow will sit up with her head between her legs and make small ‘hiccups’, these are contractions.


Do not hold the mother.
Do not crowd the mother — have only one person in the room, but another on standby to make calls if necessary.
Do not intervene or touch the pups unless you need to.
There is no need to remove other sows, they may even help with the pups.

, If any sign of complication or distress does arise, do not hesitate and contact the vet immediately. Signs of complication are:


Mother strains for 15 minutes without producing a pup.
Total labor is over one hour.
Mother starts making ""extreme"" stress calls
Mother seems to give in, appearing exhausted
Mother salivates/foams at mouth
Excessive bleeding (more than a tablespoon)
The vet may try to manipulate the piglet into a position where the mother can pass it. However, a caesarean surgery may be required.

, Occasionally, with large litters, if the pups emerge too quickly, the mother will not have time to break the amniotic sac herself. In these cases, and only if you are sure the mother will not do it herself, carefully pick up the pup with a clean towel and remove the sac yourself, clearing any fluid from the face. Do not use your fingers or nails as you could accidentally scratch the pup’s eyes.


Whilst a pup becoming stuck in the birth canal or born breech is common, never intervene yourself. Only a skilled and experienced veterinarian should attempt to manipulate the position of pups before they are born.

, If a pup is not, carefully lift it up and hold it at arm’s length. Its head should be away from you. Spin around once. The force should free any blockages from its throat and help it to start breathing. If this does not work, gently rub its back forwards and backwards which should achieve the same thing.

, She will eat the afterbirth and should clean each pup. She will also eat any bedding etc. with blood on it.


When you are sure the birth is over, you can assist the sow in cleaning by removing any stained bedding.

, If the sow runs away from the pups, carefully place her and the pups together in a small box and her maternal instincts should kick-in.

, Their eyes should be open and they should have fur, they should be able to hear and they should be able to walk and eat immediately.


If any of the pups is definitely alive, but is not alert or able to see or walk then contact your vet immediately.
The pups do not require a heat lamp or heating pad. They should be kept at the same comfortable temperature as the adults.

, It’s best to give the mother and pups some uninterrupted rest if they seem to be doing fine.


If you are concerned about the mother or have serious health worries about one of the pups contact a vet immediately, however.

, Guinea pig pups and new mothers can decline quickly and the only real way to tell is from their weight. You should be able to handle the pups from birth, the mother won’t mind.


At birth the pups should weigh roughly 2½ to 3½ oz.

, It is likely that all of the pups will have lost a little weight, but if one of the pups is significantly lighter than the others or has lost more weight, provide some hand-feed mix from a spoon and give them 15 minutes of one-on-one with their mother three times a day.


Wait 24 hours after the birth to give additional feeding for one of the pups as it takes this long for some pups to begin feeding at all.

, Use this to determine if any pups require any additional feed and if the mother is doing well or becoming ill. Toxemia and calcium deficiency are still a threat for the first week after birth, so look out for signs of illness in the mother and continued weight loss. Daily weighing should continue for the first three weeks.


The pups will likely lose weight for the first three days, but after this it should pick up again. If the weight does not pick up, or a pup does not improve with additional feeding, consult the vet.
The mother’s weight will vary for a few days whilst she re-adjusts but should settle within five days. If it declines every day or continues to change after 5 days, consult the vet.

, If the mother and all of the pups appear to be doing well there is no need for an immediate trip to the vet, but they should be seen in the first week in case there is something you have not picked up on.

, Use alfalfa hay as well as grass hay for both the mother and her pups, and vitamin supplements for the mother. Provide additional vegetables and increase the amount of these over the next few weeks as the pups begin to grow and eat more. Continue to provide fruit for the mother, but not for the pups as the acid will be too much for them.


The pups will be able to eat solid food from day one, and the mother will introduce them to new food herself.

, Have a vet sex the pups to avoid any accidents. The female pups should be kept with their mother and the males removed.


Introduce the male pups to the father and any other boars you have.

Make the introductions gradual as the adults will be a lot larger and could do them serious harm. Whilst brothers will be fine to be housed together throughout their lives, they may never get on well enough will other boars to be permanently housed with them.



, Some pups will be weaned a few days before or after, but this is the average. The pups should weigh 5½ to 8 oz.


Once the pups are weaned, the mother should not require vitamin supplements anymore, unless you gave them to her as part of her regular diet anyway.
If you are not certain that the pups are weaned at 21 days, the males should be removed anyway to prevent pregnancy. They will have been eating solids from a few days old so will cope without their mother’s milk at this age.

, Gradually introduce the other females and carefully monitor the situation. It may take several days for them to begin living together.


Just because they are the pups of a familiar guinea pig, this does not mean that they will be accepted immediately.

, Male guinea pigs (boars) can become sexually mature as early as three weeks of age. Female guinea pigs (sows) can become sexually mature as early as four weeks of age.


It is entirely possible for a male pup to impregnate its mother or sisters.
Pet stores often keep both genders together, resulting in many people being sold sows which are already pregnant.

, The easiest way to prevent pregnancy is to keep the two genders apart.


Guinea pigs should be split into same-sex groups at 3 weeks old.
Remember guinea pigs are social animals and should be kept in groups, so if you own both a boar and a sow make sure to provide company of the same gender for both of them.

, Another way to prevent pregnancy in guinea pigs is to have the boars neutered. It is also possible to have sows spayed, but this is a more complex and risky process. Always have an exotics or cavy savvy vet for guinea pig surgery.


Neutered boars should be kept separate from sows for four weeks after surgery. This is because sperm can survive in his tubes for this length of time. So, while neutering means he cannot produce more sperm, he could still theoretically sire offspring for a short time after castration
As a general rule, guinea pigs do not respond well to anaesthetic so if it is possible, separating the genders is a safer option.

, Pregnancy in guinea pigs carried as 1 in 5 chance of death, and there is also a high risk of stillbirth. If you would like another guinea pig, your local rescue center will have many pigs in need of caring and loving homes.

"
Do not examine cavies who are younger than three weeks old.,
Wear medical gloves.,
Perform the exam on a low, stable service.,
Hold the guinea pig gently but firmly.,
Check the distance between the guinea pig’s anus and genitals.,
Examine the shape of the cavy’s genital opening.,
Press just above the genital opening to check for a penis.,
Have a licensed vet confirm the guinea pig’s sex if you are unsure.",How to Determine the Sex of a Guinea Pig," Newborn cavies can be rejected by their mothers if they are handled by humans, as your smell will end up on their coats. Newborn cavies can also become easily distressed when away from their mothers, leading to a very difficult time trying to examine their genital area.Many baby guinea pigs can get cold quickly and may become too cold during the examination. If you feel you need to examine a baby guinea pig that is three weeks or younger, you should try to do it quickly and gently.;
, It’s a good idea to wear medical gloves when handling your guinea pig. Guinea pigs can carry a range of diseases that can affect humans and other guinea pigs.You should also wear medical gloves if you know your guinea pig has medical issues such as scaly skin, skin sores, hair loss, respiratory disease, or diarrhea. Wear medical gloves if the cavy is under three weeks old as this can prevent your smell from getting on the cavy.

, Cavies are often squeamish about being picked up and held in place for a long period of time. Put a soft clean towel on a low, stable service, like a low table or the floor in preparation for the exam so your guinea pig is protected and comfortable.

, Guinea pigs are easily scared and will often struggle when frightened. Avoid freaking out your cavy by holding the cavy firmly but gently around the chest and shoulders. Place the guinea pig on the back or the rump, so the stomach and genital area are facing you and cradle the cavy’s back with one hand. This will make it easier for you to examine the cavy’s genitalia.Cavies dislike being on their backs for a long period of time. Try to do the examination quickly and efficiently. You may want to ask someone to help you hold the cavy while you conduct the examination to speed up the process.

, Start by looking for the cavy’s anus, which is a vertical opening that is often gray or brown colored. The anus will be located underneath the cavy’s genitalia.Once you have distinguished between the cavy’s anus and the cavy’s genitals, you can look at the distance between the cavy’s anus and the cavy’s genitals. Female guinea pigs have a shorter amount of space between their vulva and their anus. Often, the vulva sits right above the anus in female cavies. Male guinea pigs have a larger amount of space between their penis and their anus, about 2-3 inches of space between the penis and the anus.

, Look closely at the cavy’s genital opening. Female guinea pigs usually have a smooth swelling over their genital area. Use your fingers to part the genital opening gently. If the genital area forms a “Y” shape, this means the cavy is female.Male cavies have a genital opening that is shaped like a small circular dot with a penis raised above the level of the surrounding skin.
Male guinea pigs have a bulge to their genital and anal areas. The bulge appears due to the presence of the guinea pig’s testicles, which are just under the skin along the anus and the penis. You should also check if there is a donut shape around the cavy’s anus, as this is where a male cavy’s testicles will sit.

, Sometimes it can be difficult to see the penis, especially in heavy older male cavies. To make the penis protrude, use your finger to gently press just about the guinea pig’s genital area. The penis should show itself.You can also use your finger to gently press and rub just over the genital area. If you feel a “ridge” just over the genital area, you are feeling the inner part of cavy’s shaft. This is a clear sign the cavy is male.

, It is notoriously difficult to confirm the sex of guinea pigs, even with a careful and thorough examination at home. If you are not 100 percent certain of your guinea pig’s sex, you may want to bring your guinea pig to the vet for an examination. Go to a vet you trust and/or a vet who has examined your guinea pig before, as even knowledgeable vets can missex a guinea pig.You may also want to bring your guinea pig to the vet if your guinea pig appears distressed during the examination or reacts poorly to the exam. It may be difficult to get an accurate reading of the cavy’s sex if the cavy is stressed out or moving around a lot during the home exam.

Rinse your guinea pig.,
Dry off your guinea pig completely.,
Use towels to dry off your guinea pig.,
Dry your guinea pig off with a hair dryer.",How to Bathe a Pregnant Guinea Pig," There are all types of shampoos for pets. For your guinea pig, make sure the shampoo is made specifically for small animals (it should say so on the bottle). A small animal-specific shampoo will keep your guinea pig’s skin from drying out or becoming irritated.Since your guinea pig is pregnant, the shampoo should also be non-medicated to prevent ingredients absorbing through her skin that could harm her unborn babies.Anti-fungal and anti-parasitic shampoos are medicated.Look for shampoos that are soap free and made of natural ingredients.Do not use human shampoos on your guinea pig. They have chemicals that would be harsh on her skin.Do not purchase small animal shampoos with essential oils.Shampoos are available at your local pet store. Your veterinarian may also sell shampoos.;
, In addition to the shampoo, you will need a few other items to bathe your pregnant guinea pig, including towels and a soft-bristled brush. If you would rather not bathe your guinea pig in a sink, you will need a small plastic tub. Also, a plastic jug or large plastic cup will be useful for pouring water on your guinea pig during the bath.A non-slip mat is essential, because it will prevent your pregnant guinea pig from slipping in the water.You would not want her falling on her belly in the water.
If you have a hair dryer, you could use that to dry off your pregnant guinea pig. However, the noise of the dryer can be bothersome to guinea pigs,so you may want to stick with drying her off with some towels.

, You should have everything organized and in place before you bring your pregnant guinea pig to the bathing area. First, run some lukewarm water in either the sink or plastic tub. Fill the area with just enough water to come up to her stomach (or a little below, if that makes you more comfortable). She should be able to keep her head comfortably out of the water.If you are using a non-slip mat, place it in the sink or tub before adding water.
Place some towels near the sink or tub.
The brush does not need to be near the bathing area, unless you plan to dry off her in that location.

, You will need to be very careful with how you handle your pregnant guinea pig. The safest way to move her is in a box. Place a small cardboard box with one side folded down in her cage so she can easily walk into it.When she is in the box, raise the side that is folded down and gently lift the box out of the cage.Walk slowly to the bathing area and place her carefully in the sink or tub, without putting much pressure on her belly.
Allow her to adjust to being in the water. You may need to keep your hands on her so she doesn’t try to jump out.

, To get her wet, fill the plastic jug or cup with lukewarm water and gently pour the water over her. You should still use the jug or cup if you have your guinea pig in the sink, since getting wet by being held under a running tap could be frightening for her.You do not want her experiencing any additional stress when she is pregnant—this could put her unborn babies at risk.


Avoid getting any water on her face or in her ears.Use a gentle, circular motion with your fingers to work the shampoo into your guinea pig’s fur.Be extra careful when you wash her belly.
Try to avoid lifting your guinea pig as you bathe her, to avoid putting any extra pressure on her belly.
Talk to her in a soothing voice throughout the bathing process.Pay special attention to her back end. Because of her increased size, she may have trouble grooming herself, which could lead to feces getting stuck in her fur.If you see feces in her fur, try to break them up with the water and shampoo. It would be a good idea to wear gloves to do this.

, After shampooing your pregnant guinea pig, gently lift her up and place her on the dry set of towels that you already placed by the sink or tub. Pour out the dirty bath water and refill the sink or tub with clean, lukewarm water. Gently place her back in the sink or tub and pour lukewarm water over her to rinse her off.Use your fingers again to work through her fur and get all of the shampoo out. Residual shampoo could make your guinea pig’s skin feel itchy.

, After your guinea pig’s bath, she should be completely dry before you move her back to her cage. This is to prevent her from getting chills from being wet.This may take some time, depending on how long her hair is.

, Lift her gently and wrap her in a towel, being sure not to hold her in a way that puts any pressure on her belly. Dry her off with the same gentle motions as you did when bathing her. Also, be extra gentle when drying her belly.


If you’d like, you can sit on the couch and watch TV while you are drying her off. There is no need to rush the process.
When the first towel gets damp, wrap her in a new, dry towel and continue drying her off.If she is feeling really relaxed after her bath, you may hear her start to purr with contentment!Brush her with the soft-bristled brush after she is completely dried off. This will remove any loose or excess fur.If you noticed crusted feces in her fur during the bath, check the area again when you are drying her off. If the feces are still there, use a pair of small scissors to cut out the crusty fur., If you would rather use a hair dryer than a towel to dry off your guinea pig, you will need to be very careful with how you use it. First, set the hair dryer to the lowest possible heat setting.Hold the hair dryer about 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 centimeters) away from your guinea pig and turn it on.If you are unsure if the hair dryer temperature is too hot, test it against your own skin. From 20 to 30 centimeters back, if the heat from the dryer is too hot for your skin, then it is also too hot for your guinea pig.Use your soft-bristled brush to brush the fur as you are drying.Brush in the direction of hair growth.
If you notice your guinea pig becoming uncomfortable with the dryer, stop using it. You do not want to add any extra stress to your pregnant guinea pig.

Never breed guinea pigs for fun. Breeding guinea pigs is risky and can harm or kill your beloved pet.Guinea pig sows have a high mortality rate associated with pregnancy ketosis, which is a metabolic problem where the sow slowly poisons herself and dies of blood poisoning. The piglets are also large, which can cause problems when giving birth (but toxaemia is the main cause of death).If you are considering breeding your sow, stick to the breeding age suggestions to help minimize the risk of complications.If you sow needs a caesarian section because of birth complications, the survival rate is very low.Unless you have designated homes for pups or animals you don’t want to keep after breeding, don’t breed them. Many people who say they’ll take pups conveniently disappear once they’re born.;
, If you are planning on breeding guinea pigs, the animal population in your home will likely increase. Ensure that you have sufficient supplies to care for breeding animals and their pups.You will need enough cage space to house all of the animals. Keep in mind that you will also have to separate males and females to keep them from breeding.The cage space will require proper bedding and hay, so consider purchasing extra and keeping a reserve for when you clean the guinea pigs’ area.Also consider purchasing more accessories such as toys or hiding holes for your guinea pigs to enjoy.
Make sure you have enough food pellets and water bottles to help keep you guinea pigs healthy.Allot enough time to properly clean the guinea pig cages on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis to help keep your pigs healthy., You want to find the best quality breeding stock of guinea pigs. Choosing the right guinea pigs can help ensure their health and continuation of quality breeding stock.The breeding plan “best to the best” is often employed by professionals when considering mates. This means that only outstanding sows, or female guinea pigs, are bred with outstanding boars, or male guinea pigs.Where possible, check the parentage of both guinea pigs. There are several hereditary diseases that could affect the guinea pigs and their pups or cause a so-called “lethal,” or a pup with severe deformities.Ensure that the boar and sow are an appropriate age to breed.If you are unsure of the sex of your guinea pig, you can check directly above the anus while gently holding the guinea pig on its back. A male will have what appears to be a slit or visible testes. A female will have a skin fold that is in a Y shape above the anus., Part of breeding the right pair of guinea pigs is choosing a boar, or male guinea pig, to mate. Selecting the best quality boar can help ensure that a sow bears good quality and healthy pups.A good boar will have a broad head and a bold eye.The average age for most boars to mate for the first time is 5 months.Most guinea pigs reach sexual maturity at 10 weeks, however., Just as boar selection is important, it is also important to find a good quality sow, or female guinea pig. Choosing the right sow can help ensure the quality and health of her litter.The sow should have good head shape, a bold eye, and a good muzzle. Most guinea pigs reach sexual maturity at 10 weeks, however.A sow can mate at anywhere from 4-7 months for the first time.It is important that the sow is under 7months for a first pregnancy to prevent the conditions symphysis and dystocia.
Consider selecting a sow that has had time to rest in between litters to help ensure the quality of subsequent litters., You cannot introduce a boar and sow unless you are sure they are both healthy. Take each animal to a vet to minimize the risk of either animal being unhealthy.


If you regularly treat your guinea pigs for mites, this should be done at least 2 weeks before you breed them to prevent the Ivermectin having any effect on the pups., If you decide to mate your guinea pig with a guinea pig from another home, quarantine the new guinea pig for two weeks. This will help ensure that neither animal is ill or has parasites.You can quarantine new guinea pigs simply by keeping their cages in separate rooms. Also make sure to wash your hands whenever you touch animals and their feed or bedding.Do not allow the guinea pigs to interact during the quarantine.If you are breeding guinea pigs you own, there is no need for quarantine., Once you are sure each guinea pig is healthy, you can introduce the pair. It may take a few days for the guinea pigs to get used to one another.


Keep the pair in the sow's normal cage to reduce stress to her and help increase the chance of pregnancy. If she is not ready to breed, she may reject the male by spraying him or showing her teeth.Never allow more than one boar contact with the sow as this can lead to serious fights between the males.If you own multiple sows that usually live together, remove the sows you are not breeding to a different cage to prevent unnecessary stress. Maintain the companionship between sows by allowing them 'floor time' together while keeping the breeding pair together the majority of the time.

, A sow’s heat cycle can last from 15 to 17 days. The breeding pair should be kept together the entire cycle to increase the chance of pregnancy.


The pair may try to mate throughout this period, but the sow can only get pregnant during a small 24 – 48 hour window per cycle..
Check the breeding couple often enough to help ensure their health and happiness and reassure the guinea pigs that you are caring for them.

, After at least 18 days, check if the sow is pregnant. You can do this yourself - see How to Tell if Your Guinea Pig Is Pregnant - but only a vet will be able to say for sure.


A pregnant female may exhibits several symptoms of pregnancy including distended abdomen and increased food and water consumption.A sow may eat 2-3 times her normal amount when pregnant.A vet may also determine an estimated delivery date.
It may take several heat cycles for the sow to become pregnant. Be patient so that you do not stress your guinea pigs.

, Once you’re sow becomes pregnant, the gestation period will 63-70 days.During this time it is important to prevent stress as much as possible.


Do not make any changes to the sow’s cage and reduce exposure to anything that may cause stress, such as loud noises.Handle the sow minimally during the pregnancy and not at all during the last two weeks. You can coax her on to a towel or box for the delivery.You can leave the boar in the cage with the sow to comfort her.It’s advisable to remove other guinea pigs from the sow’s space and allow her to litter alone., The amount of food and water a sow consumes will increase during pregnancy. Give her more food to help ensure she gets much needed nutrients to support the developing pups.


Increase the amount of fresh vegetables on offer to 1½ to 2 cups per day., Pregnancy is very risk for sows because pups are large. Check the sow thoroughly daily by looking for any signs of illness and weighing the sow.


The signs of illness may include crusty eyes, nose, or ears; and a thinning or patchy coat.The sow should gradually put on weight, though how much depends on the individual and size of the litter.
Check she is eating. An early warning sign of pregnancy toxaemia is lack of appetite. Any pregnant sow that doesn't eat for more than 12 hours should see a veterinarian.
If you notice any problems with your guinea pig, including lack of movement of her unborn pups, consult a vet.

, You should be prepared for your sow to give birth at around nine weeks. Making sure you’re prepared for the birth with medical supplies can help you handle any complications that may arise.


Guinea pigs don’t show any outward signs of impending birth and don’t make any specific preparations for labor so it may be hard to tell exactly when the sow will give birth.You may notice a slight widening of the pelvic bones in the sow right before she gives birth.Stock up on a syringe, which you may need to clean out a newborn pups mouth.It is a good idea to alert a vet when the sow reaches nine weeks so they are aware that they may need to intervene and can be on hand to attend to the sow immediately if a complication does arise.

, It takes guinea pigs 10-30 minutes to give birth if a sow has no complications. If the labor takes longer than an hour, call your vet or take the sow for medical treatment.Do not crowd the female while she is laboring. Have only one person with her to oversee the birth and do not touch her.A sow should give birth every 5-10 minutes.A sow will usually have between 1-5 pups.The sow will give birth by sitting up and hunching over or by squatting.Get your guinea pig to a doctor if the labor becomes complicated. For example, if it takes longer than one hour, there more than 15 minutes between pups, if she exhibits excessive bleeding, or making extreme stress calls., Once your sow has given birth, let her clean the pups on her own. This can help minimize the risk of transmitting bacteria to the new pups or the mother rejecting them.The mother or other cage mates will eat the placenta and membranes., When pups are born, they should appear fully functional and like miniature adults.In the case that a pup doesn’t appear normal, consult your vet.Newborn pups should have hair, wide open eyes, a full set of teeth and be able to run around like other guinea pigs.The pups do not require a heat lamp or heating pad as long as the room is warm. They should be kept at the same comfortable temperature as the parents.The mother may reject one of the pups, often the runt of the litter. There may be nothing wrong with this pup however, so hand-feed and continue to place with the mother. Try some one-on-one between the pup and mother., Guinea pigs are not especially protective or proactive with their young, but give the mother and pups a full day after birth before you handle them. After this, you can handle them as much as you like.


It is encouraged to handle the pups to help socialize them., Continue to provide alfalfa hay and extra food pellets while the mother nurses. This will help ensure the sow stays healthy as she feeds her pups and minimize the risk that her milk quality is poor.The sow may begin to wean her pups at 14-21 days of age.However piglets can eat solid food from as soon as five days (because they are born so well developed) so if the mother rejects a piglet, make sure solid food is available and he may well start to eat for himself., One day following the birth and occasionally thereafter, examine the mother and pups. This will help you identify “lethals” and any other conditions. Consult a vet if you notice any medical issues or have questions.


The pups' size will vary though should be around 2½ to 3½ oz and be 3-4 inches.For the first 2 days the pups' weight may fall but on the third day it should start to pick up again.
A smaller pup may benefit from 15minutes of one-on-one time with its mother once or twice a day."

Look for signs of distress.",How to Safely Transport Your Guinea Pigs in the Car," It should be made of cloth or plastic and not of metal or thick mesh. This carrier doesn't need to be made specifically for guinea pigs. Any small animal carrier that is big enough should work. Choose a carrier that is big enough for your pet to turn around, lie down, stand up, and a little extra room to move around in it.


While the carrier shouldn't be made of metal or thick mesh, it can have a wire mesh door.;
, Use a thickness of 20 sheets or more. Newspaper will not make a mess like bedding. You can cover it with fleece to make it more cozy.


You can also add shredded paper towels to the bottom of the cage, as the guinea pig may use them to create a safe place to hide.Just as with your guinea pig's cage at home, your guinea pig's travel cage should not have a wire mesh bottom. This is hard on the pig's feet., Hay is an essential food for guinea pigs. They like to sleep in the hay and munch on it for comfort, and they should never be without it.


Guinea pigs should have an unlimited supply of timothy hay at all times. This includes when they are traveling., Soak the fruits and vegetables in water and then place them in a food bowl. This is important moisture for the guinea pig, as your pet will not have water on it's trip.


Do not put a ceramic food dish in the carrier, as it might slide and harm your guinea pig.

, If you are going for a very long car trip, for instance more than a couple hours, your guinea pig will need access to water. In cases such as this, you will need to attach a water bottle to your guinea pig's carrier and clean up any spilled water on a regular basis.


For instance, clean up any water covered bedding every time you stop the car for a break.

, Make sure that the car is at an appropriate temperature before you bring you guinea pig in the car. In the winter, this may mean heating the car up for awhile. In the summer, this probably means cooling the car down before you put the guinea pig in it.


Guinea pigs like to be at a temperature between 65 and 75 degrees. Try to get your car's temperature in this range before putting the guinea pig in it., If your guinea pig is docile, you can simply pick it up and place it in the carrier. Usually, you put one hand under the guinea pig's belly and one under the guinea pig's hind legs.


If the guinea pig is skittish, you may need to have a stronger grip on the guinea pig. Corner it in its cage and get ahold of it as you would with a more docile guinea pig, but hold on a little tighter. Make sure the carrier is very close by, so you can quickly move the guinea pig straight into the carrier.
Once the guinea pig is inside of the carrier, close it properly. Make sure the carrier is secure and your guinea pig is as comfortable as possible.
You can put two guinea pigs in the same carrier. If you are travelling with more than one guinea pig, it is perfectly fine to put them both together in one carrier. However, you must keep checking on them both to see if they are getting along.

, Good locations include on a persons lap, in a foot well (it may be warmer here than the rest of the car), or on a seat with the seat belt fastened. Bad locations include places where the carrier will slide around and jolt when you stop, near the heating and air-conditioning (because it could be too hot or too cold), or in the trunk.


Also make sure that your guinea pig's cage will not be in the sun while you drive. This can quickly lead to the guinea pig getting overheated.
You should also avoid putting your guinea pig's cage next to your stereo speakers, if you are planning on playing your stereo. Guinea pigs are sensitive to sound, so they should not be exposed to loud sounds from your car stereo., Begin to drive slowly and then pick up speed as if not to startle the guinea pig. Take turns slowly and try to make all driving adjustments, such as braking, gradually.


The goal should be to give the guinea pig a calm ride in the car. Abrupt movements and aggressive driving will move your guinea pig around in its cage involuntarily. This will most likely agitate the pig.

, If you are taking a long drive, for instance if you are moving cross country, you need to check in on your pet regularly. Make sure it is doing ok and that its food and water are still secure.


For example, take a five minute break about halfway through your journey if you are travelling for over thirty minutes. Take this time to check their food and hay supply, as they need an unlimited supply of these.
If you are on a long drive and your guinea pig's food or water spills all over its cage, clean it up. You don't want your pet sitting in a dirty cage for hours while you drive.

, Guinea pigs may naturally hide and be fearful during a car ride, so this is not necessarily a sign of true distress. However, there are some signs that the guinea pig is in real distress and needs attention. These can include repeated loud squeals, pacing, cowering in fear, and staying crouched over.If you have had your guinea pig for awhile, you should know if it is acting normally. However, remember that a guinea pig being transported is likely to exhibit some unusual behavior.
Talk to the guinea pig during the ride. It may be comforting to the pig to know that you're there with it.
Never leave your guinea pig in the car alone! It can get overheated very quickly in a closed up car."

Simply put, guinea pigs need to be with other guinea pigs! However, having a cage mate won’t relieve your guinea pig’s anxiety very much if the cage is too small. The ideal cage size for two guinea pigs is 30 by 51 inches (75 cm by 130 cm).For three guinea pigs, the cage should be at least 30 by 62 inches (76 by 160 cm). Four guinea pigs should be housed in a cage that is at least 30 by 76 inches (76 by 193 cm).If the cages in your local pet store are not large enough, you may need to build your own cage. Visit your local home improvement store to purchase the supplies and get some additional guidance on building the cage.
A larger cage will not only give the guinea pigs more room to play and exercise, but will also be easier to clean and less smelly than a smaller cage.Without a cage mate, your guinea pig will feel anxious and frustrated, and might even stop eating.;
, Guinea pigs generally do better when they live with the same sex. Make sure you know the sexes of your current guinea pig and the one(s) you are thinking about purchasing: female guinea pigs have a Y-shaped opening in their genital area and males have a visible scrotum that contains the testicles.If you are unsure of the sexes, take the guinea pigs to the veterinarian. Do not rely on what a pet store employee tells you.A male and female guinea pig can live together only if the male is neutered.Putting males together can be tricky and possibly dangerous if they do not know each other. Males do best as cage mates if they have been together since birth.If you plan to house males together, make sure that each one has his own hiding places and food and water bowls.Same-sex pairings are not 100% guaranteed.If the guinea pigs’ personalities don’t match, they should not be housed together.

, Finding a cage mate for your guinea pig is not as simple as just choosing the same sex—they also need to be able to get along. There are a few things you can do to prepare the guinea pigs for the introduction. For example, you can bathe each guinea pig to hide some of their natural scents.You can also rub some hay from your guinea pig’s cage on the new guinea pig. This could help the new guinea pig blend in more easily.If you will be using the cage you already have, clean it with vinegar to remove your guinea pig’s scent. You could also rearrange the cage accessories (make sure you clean them as well).Keep the new guinea pig isolated from your current guinea pig., Prepare a neutral area outside of the cage where the guinea pigs can meet each other. This area (e.g., bathroom, kitchen) should be new to both guinea pigs. Put hay and fresh veggies in the area, along with some towels (in case they get aggressive).Let them interact for a few hours. During this time, they’ll display normal ‘get to know you’ behaviors for guinea pigs, such as teeth chattering and chasing each other around. If they seem to be comfortable with each other (no aggressive behavior), put them in the same cage together and continue to observe them.If they don’t get along in the same cage, that’s ok. You can put them in separate cages, but make sure they can see each other. This set-up can still provide your guinea pig with another guinea pig, which would help relieve his anxiety.If they get aggressive in the neutral area or the cage, throw a towel at the most aggressive one and move the other one away quickly., Your guinea pig may feel anxious because he does not have enough to keep him busy inside of his cage. Guinea pigs are curious,active animals. Without toys, your guinea pig might not know what to do with himself. There are many types of fun guinea pig toys, such as cardboard boxes, tunnels, and sheets of newspaper.Empty toilet paper or paper towel rolls also make great toys. Your guinea pig could stuck in the middle of them, though, so cut a lengthwise slit in them so he can move through more easily.Tennis balls and ping-pong balls are also good toys. Your guinea pig would have fun pushing them around his cage.Sheets of newspaper are especially fun for guinea pigs to play tug-of-war with. Your guinea pig can also shred the newspaper, or even crawl under it as a place to hide.Keep a variety of toys in your guinea pig’s cage and rotate them out frequently so he doesn’t get bored.Replace them as they start to show signs of damage.

, Guinea pigs like to chew on things. Providing him with a chewing outlet could help relieve some of his anxiety. The branch of a fruit tree, such as an apple tree, is something good for your guinea pig to chew on.Pesticides can make your guinea pig sick, though, so do not use a branch from your yard if you have used pesticides.


Untreated wooden blocks are good for your guinea pig to chew on., Your guinea pig’s may be chock full of toys, but he should still have time outside of cage to play. Playing outside of his cage is a great way for your guinea pig to exercise, which would make him feel less anxious. Whichever area you to choose to play with him in must be ‘guinea-proofed’ to keep him safe.Keep all electrical cords out of reach of your guinea pig.If you can, hide them until playtime is over.
Remove all mats and rugs.Your guinea pig could start chewing on them before you know it.
Cover all furniture and hide any small trinkets or toys.Keep other pets out of the room.Try to give your guinea pig playtime outside of his cage at least a few days a week. You don’t want him getting anxious and stir crazy in his cage!

, Being handled is not always the most relaxing thing for guinea pigs, especially if they are not used to it. If you are just starting out with handling your guinea pig, he may be very anxious about being held. To help him feel less anxious, talk to him in a soothing voice when you pick him up and hold him.Your tone of voice is much more important what you are actually saying. A calm and reassuring voice will go a long way in lessening your guinea pig’s anxiety.
As your guinea pig starts to feel less anxious, he may even start chattering back to you., When you are holding him, don’t forget to gently stroke his body. This will help him calm down and settle into your hands. Guinea pigs especially like to be stroked behind their ears., As much as you try to soothe your guinea pig when you are holding him, he may still feel a little anxious. When you place him back in his cage, give him some alone time to relax.This is especially important if children have been handling him.


Children may handle small pets roughly without even realizing it. This could make your guinea pig very anxious.

Take things slow. Talk to the guinea pig from outside his cage and let him come to you willingly. Never pull a guinea pig out of the cage against his will. This can make him feel threatened and increase his sense of isolation.Allow your guinea pig to sniff your hand. Simply place your hand inside his cage and allow him to come and inspect you. You should allow him to familiarize himself with your scent before attempting to handle him or pick him up.;
, Your guinea pig should associate your voice, which he'll hear a lot from his cage, with comfort and security.

If you live with family, roommates, or a significant other, you can try asking them to spend time with the guinea pig if they're able.

, A guinea pig without a cage mate will need a lot of stimulation due to the large amount of time spent alone. Make sure to provide your guinea pig with plenty of toys so he won't grow bored in his cage.


Ping pong balls provide a lot of entertainment as guinea pigs enjoy chewing and chasing. You can also find balls specifically made for guinea pigs at Petco or a local pet store. Be careful, however. If you notice your guinea pig chewing excessively, you might want to take the ball away.Wooden structures, sometimes called hidey houses, are great if your guinea pig likes to hide or run. They can be made at home from cardboard boxes or purchased from local pet stores.As guinea pigs love to chew, shredded paper, cardboard, old socks, pine cones, and twigs can be great. However, do not give a guinea pig materials like wool or cotton that tear thin. There's a risk that, when ingested, such materials will tangle inside a guinea pig's intestines., If you have a garden, or a backyard, planting and maintaining foliage can be a great activity for you and your guinea pig.


Guinea pigs enjoy being outside. If your garden is fenced in, you could take him out in the garden with you while you work. Keep a close eye on him, however, so he doesn't find a way through the gate.If you do not have a fence, or if you're nervous at the idea of your guinea pig running around unsupervised, you can buy a guinea friendly harness and leash at a pet store.

Health problems can result due to the stress of loneliness. Keep an eye on your guinea pig's weight, as this is generally one of the first warnings of poor health.


Guinea pigs often help keep one another active via playing and wrestling. A lone guinea pig may become sedentary and put on weight. Make sure your guinea pig gets adequate exercise and does not put on too much weight.Conversely, guinea pigs can lose interest in food if feeling stressed and isolated. Make sure your guinea pig is eating enough food and that he does not lose weight rapidly., Guinea pigs often rely on cage mates for warmth as they huddle together in the cold. As guinea pigs are prone to upper respiratory problems, pay particularly close attention to maintaining a warm environment.


Keep the cage off the floor and away from areas prone to drafts. The temperature should be stable and around 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit.Make sure your provide warm bedding for your guinea pig so he can crawl into a warm space if he gets cold.

Before you introduce them, you must determine their sex. Pet shop employees often make mistakes, and if you're buying a guinea pig from a pet store the chance of error is even higher.You should examine your guinea pig on the floor or a very low table. This way, if they get away they will not injure themselves falling. Handle your guinea pig gently, but keep a firm hold around their chest and shoulders. Spread their back legs apart to examine their genitals.The distance between the genitals and anus is greater in males than females.The genital opening of male guinea pigs is shaped like a circular dot, while the genital opening of females forms a Y-shape.The genital region of male guinea pigs appears to bulge outward slightly, while it appears flat in females.;
, Certain pairs work better than others when it comes to guinea pigs. Two baby guinea pigs of the same sex get along the easiest. They start off on a more or less blank slate and then grow and change together.If you already have an older guinea pig, getting a baby of the same sex is a good choice. The adult will not feel as threatened by a baby and its dominance will not be challenged.Its best to neuter males before introducing them to females; however, neutered or not, never place more than one male in a group with females. They will fight over the female's attention.Adult females tend to get along more readily than adult males.Understand that if you house two unneutered guinea pigs of a different sex (one male and one female) together, you will end up with babies. Guinea pigs are rapid breeders.

, Male guinea pigs are very territorial, and if you're introducing two adult males take certain precautions.


A spacious cage is key to males living in harmony. Provide them with their own space to eat, hide, sleep, and play — provide two of everything. Ensure that hiding houses have two entrances so that one guinea pig cannot trap the other. , You should keep your guinea pigs separate from one another for the first two to three weeks. You will need to have the new guinea checked out by a vet during this time to ensure they are healthy. Do not let them have physical contact until this time period is up.


Placing the new guinea directly in the cage with a new pig can cause undue stress as they must be eased into a new environment, and their presence may cause the current pig to become territorial.
In addition to the emotional concerns, many guinea pig illnesses, which are easily spread at pet and department stores, can incubate for long periods. You need to make sure your new guinea shows no signs of sickness before introducing them to your old guinea.Put the guinea pigs in separate cages next to each other. Position the cages in such a way that the guinea pigs cannot see each other but can smell and hear one another., Once the two to three week quarantine period has passed, it's time to introduce the guinea pigs. However, do not place the new guinea pig in the cage right away as it's best to introduce them on neutral ground so neither guinea pig feels their territory is being threatened.


Find a new territory where neither guinea pig has been before, but that is a secluded and quiet place where both guinea pigs will feel safe. On the floor of a closed off and small room, such as a bathroom, is a good option.Put veggies, treats, and hay in the center of the area to distract the guinea pigs from fighting as they get accustomed to one another's presence. In case the guinea pigs get physically aggressive, you should have old towels on hand. You can use towels to restrain the guinea pigs while avoiding getting scratched yourself.If it goes well, and the guinea pigs have not fought for over two hours, you will be able to introduce them to the same cage. Ensure that the cage has been thoroughly cleaned, and all the toys re-arranged to make it seem like a new cage.

, After the guinea pigs have been introduced, there are steps you can take to smoothen the transition before placing them in the same cage.


Make adjustments to the cage. Guinea pigs are territorial, so make sure your cage has enough space. As a general rule, a cage between 7.5 and 10.5 square feet is recommended for two guinea pigs. More room is preferred, and if you're housing three or more guinea pigs aim for at least 13 square feet.Rearrange and wash the cage so it will smell new and feel more like neutral territory for both guinea pigs.Gently rub hay from the old cage on the new guinea pig so he smells more like the rest of the herd., The first few weeks for guinea pig cohabitation can be rough, and you should expect some tension between your pets. Know what the signs of aggression are and what body language is a signal for you to intervene.


Mounting or jumping over one another can lead to aggression if one guinea pig resists or retaliates. Keep an eye on this behavior, but do not intervene unless it leads to fighting.Squealing, chasing, and teeth chattering are common in the first few weeks. Guinea pigs may also gently nip one another if annoyed, and such behaviors are necessary to establish boundaries between the guinea pigs. Only intervene if the guinea pigs are biting hard enough to inflict wounds.If one guinea pig is constantly chattering his teeth, this is a sign of aggression that could grow serious. Watch carefully, but do not separate unless blood is drawn.Raised hair, especially around the neck, and feet stamping are signs guinea pigs are preparing to fight. This can occur, but watch carefully. Do not separate unless blood is drawn. , Again, do not separate unless blood is drawn. , Not all body language is a bad sign. There are certain behaviors that are normal, especially early on, and you should be able to recognize these gestures so you do not intervene unnecessarily.


Bottom sniffing and nudging is a guinea pig's way of greeting a new companion. This is normal and non-threatening behavior. Your guinea pigs may also want to establish their territory by dragging their bottoms across the ground or raising their heads up on occasion to expression dominance, behaviors that are normal during the first few weeks.Guinea pigs sometimes engage in a behavior called rumblestrutting. This is when they walk past each other waving their hips from side to side with their fur puffed out while making a rumbling sound. This is an expression of dominance and unless it's followed up by aggressive gestures it's usually a normal component of establishing the pecking order., If fights start to get bloody, you need to intervene. Know how to do so safely to diminish harm for yourself and your pets.


Act quickly. Guinea pigs have sharp teeth and are capable of inflicting serious harm on one another. If you notice aggressive fighting, separate them immediately. Guinea pigs can cause permanent injury and disabilities to one another if left unchecked.Do not intervene with your bare hands. An irate guinea pig can cause injuries to you that are serious enough to warrant medical attention. Cover the animal with an old towel or rag or use heavy gloves while separating them.Separate the guinea pigs after the fight. Keep them in different cages, but in the same room so that they can see, smell, hear, and talk to each other. Continue handling them with gloves or a towel for a few hours after the fight, as they can remain skittish and aggressive for awhile after a confrontation.Reintroduce them slowly, once again introducing them on a neutral ground with treats and food as distractions. Depending on the severity of the fight, wait a few hours to a few days. Keep protective gear on hand in case the fight resumes., Some guinea pigs may simply not get along, even after you follow the proper protocol introducing them. You need to be prepared for this. It's a risk when introducing a new guinea pig to your pack.


Do not feel as if this is your fault. Nature simply works this way, and guinea pigs have different personalities. Some may be more independent and aggressive and therefore harder to introduce to a companion. Even when you do all the right things, guinea pigs are sometimes simply not compatible with one another.If the first introduction leads to an excess of fighting, you can restart the introduction process, beginning again with the quarantine period. This gives the guinea pigs time to cool off and forget any previous hostilities.
If guinea pigs are simply not getting along, you can always keep them in separate cages where they can smell, see, and hear one another but cannot physically interact. They get the benefits of some social interaction but without the stress of a hostile environment."

Be aware that, when the guinea pig squeals loudly with a ""wheek"" sound, he or she is happy.,
Know that, if they are really happy to see you, guinea pigs will also squeal in delight to show their appreciation for you.",How to Understand Guinea Pig Language1," It will sound really loud and positive, and the pig will be staying in one spot and looking up at you with their eyes wide open. It's a repetitive sounds that shows excitement.


They will usually do this when they know they are being fed. Owners usually condition their pigs by the shaking of small objects in a jar or the rustling of plastic bags. They will squeal extremely loudly at the mere sound of it.;
, This occurs when you meet with the piggies after neglecting to see them for a really long time, such as a vacation, or when they meet you after a bad experience with something else.

When you first bring them home, don't rush anything.,
Try to get your guinea pig used to you.,
Holding your guinea pig.",How to Help Your Guinea Pig Adjust to You1," Make sure the cage of your new guinea pig is in a place that at least a few people go into several times a day.

, Feed them vegetables, talk to them, and after about four days of them being at your house, try to pet them. Your guinea pig will eventually get you used to you petting him/her.

, You may want to wait about a week before you get into this, as guinea pigs are prey animals and it takes them a while to adjust to things that are bigger than them. After a while of petting your guinea pig, try to hold them. Put one hand on their back, and one hand under his/her stomach. Then gently, but firmly, hold your guinea pig and bring him/her up to your chest.

After that, you can move on to introducing yourself., Don't grab your guinea pig out of the cage the first day you take the cover off. Instead, take a few days to let her get to know you. Put your hand in the cage, and let her smell you. Softly stroke your animal so she learns to trust you., If you're worried about your clothes, have a towel available to put under the guinea pig while holding her. Your guinea pig may not go to the bathroom while on you, but you should be prepared., If you're nervous, your guinea pig will pick up on it. Make sure you are calm and collected before you try to hold your guinea pig.When approaching the cage, do so slowly and calmly. Don't rush towards the cage and yank it open. Instead, walk up slowly, and let the guinea pig smell you through the cage. Gently open the door.
Take a moment to take a few calming breaths before approaching the cage.
Also, keep the environment calm. You should limit loud noises and sudden movements while your guinea pig is out. You don't want to startle her.For instance, turn off the television and the radio. Turn off your phone so it doesn't go off while you have her out.

, To catch your guinea pig, you need to gently trap her in the cage. One easy way to catch her is to trap her in one of the cage's pipes, if yours has pipes, and then pull her out. Put your hand out to encourage the guinea pig into the pipe, making sure to block the other side.If your cage doesn't have pipes, try guiding your guinea pig into her house, and then lifting one edge to pick up the guinea pig.
If your guinea pig seems very upset or tries to bite you, you should wait until another day to try picking your guinea pig up.

, Using one hand, slide it under the belly of your guinea pig. Gently start lifting her.Put a finger around the front of one of the guinea pig's legs. That hold will help keep her in your hands., Your guinea pig will feel more secure if you use both hands to pick her up. She may feel like she's falling if you only pick her up with one hand.Use your second hand to support the guinea pig's back end., Make sure you have a solid grip on your guinea pig. Otherwise, she may jump from your hands. However, don't squeeze too hard, as you can hurt your guinea pig.Though you can move around while holding your guinea pig, it's best to sit down while holding her. That way, she won't be confused by your movement, and you're less likely to drop her.

, Your towel should be on your chest. Hold her against your chest with her feet towards your body., You can use blueberries, lettuce, or carrots, for instance. If you feed her a treat while you hold her, she'll come to associate your cuddles with good things., Use a soothing voice to talk to your guinea pig while you're holding her. It doesn't really matter what you say, as long as you use a soothing voice., For instance, you can go into the bathroom with your guinea pig. Make sure there is nothing she can get into that she shouldn't (such as cleaning supplies). Also, make sure you cover any potential dangers, such as floor vents.Close the door. Place her on the floor, and let her run around. She'll enjoy exploring, and she'll also take some time getting to know you, too. If you want, sit on the floor with her., If you put her down every time she struggles, she learns that all she has to do is wiggle to get back in her cage. If you continue to hold her, she'll learn to stay calm., As your guinea pig sees the cage, she may want to jump, so keep a firm hold on her with both hands when placing her back in the cage.In fact, you can turn her around, bottom first, when setting her back in the cage if she's particularly prone to jumping.Wait to release her from your hand until she stops struggling. That way, she learns that she shouldn't squirm while you're holding her., Get your guinea pig out of her cage everyday. That way, she'll slowly grow used to your attention over time and will eventually enjoy the cuddle time., Children can harm guinea pigs without meaning to. If the child is under 4 years of age, don't allow her to hold the pet. Hold the guinea pig for her, and allow her to pet the animal.That is, practice safe holding practices, and let your child come up and gently pet the guinea pig while you have her against your chest. If you allow your child to hold the guinea pig, tell him how to hold her, and make sure he is not holding her too tightly or too loosely.

, Children over four may be tempted to carry guinea pigs from room to room. However, if they're not careful, guinea pigs can jump from their hands and hurt themselves., The safest way for a child to hold a guinea pig is to be sitting on the ground. That way, the child can't carry the guinea pig around, and the animal isn't too far from the ground if your child happens to drop it.For best results, ask your child to sit down, and then hand the guinea pig to him or her to hold.

, That is, only let one person hold the guinea pig each time you get her out of the cage, especially if that person is a child. Guinea pigs are overly sensitive to being held, so limiting their exposure will keep them happier.You can hand the guinea pig to a child, but only let one child hold it. If another child wants to hold her, wait until another day.

, Children may be tempted to pull a guinea pig out when you're not around, resulting in the guinea pig being unintentionally hurt. Keep the cage locked so that children don't have access to the pet when you're not in the room.You can use a combination lock or a key lock, but close up the main gate with a lock if possible.

Get down to guinea pig level.,
Pick up shoes, jackets and any other clothing items strewn around the place.,
Put the bin (trash can) away.,
Keep telephone cords out of reach.,
Remove house plants.,
Put away delicate and valuable items.,
Stop your guinea pig from playing hide and seek.,
Provide distractions.,
Lock away poisons.",How to Guinea Pig Proof Your Home," Consider which areas of the house you are likely to let your guinea pig roam around in. Look around for the things that are easy for your guinea pig to get access to. For example, cords that are dangling or loose will be an invitation to chewing, as will any dangling items such as ribbons or cords off curtains or a blind. Tie these cords and other dangling elements up and put loose electrical cords away or cover them properly.;
, Shoes with laces should definitely be put away. Also pick up children's toys and any human food containers.

, If your guinea pig will be allowed free run of a room where there is a bin, either move it out of the room or fit a tight lid over it. If there is food in the bin, it will raise curiosity.

, Again, anything dangling attracts the guinea pig's attention. And don't forget the recharge cords for cordless or cellphones. They're still attractive cords!

, Many house plants are potentially fatal if chewed by a pet. A guinea pig may be tempted to try a nibble here and there; it is wise to remove plants from any free-roaming space.

, There is no need to risk something delicate or valuable being chewed. Put it away before your pet roams around. This includes such items as remote controls and books, which can be as inviting as anything else. Watch out for tassels hanging off cushions and other soft furnishings as well.

, When you look around, try to spot potential hiding places that could be used by your guinea pig. This is especially important if they are crevices that might cause your pet to get stuck or lost in.

, Add things that the guinea pig is allowed to play with. These will distract the guinea pig from things that should not be chewed and your pet will still get a good workout.

, As with any good household practice, all poisonous substances should be locked away and out of reach of guinea pigs. In addition, don't let guinea pigs get near bathroom products such as shampoo, toothpaste, shaving cream etc. Make sure the guinea pig cannot gain access to storage areas containing these substances.

Be aware that purring is another sound guinea pigs produce when they are relaxed and comfortable through touching.,
The more you touch them in a way it makes them comfortable, the more purring you hear.",How to Understand Guinea Pig Language2," It can range from stroking their hair, petting them, tickling them in sensitive spots, or as a way to bond with other piggies or you.

, Their body will also ""vibrate"" or make sudden soft movements as body language to show their comfort from being touched.

"
"
Be aware that guinea pigs enjoy doing two things - eating and exploring.,
Know that guinea pigs move their bodies to explore the new discovery.,
Know that, eventually, the guinea pigs will stop squeaking, but the movements will continue.",How to Understand Guinea Pig Language3," When investigating a new object, food, or environment, they will make these type of squeaks. They are very short in time frequency and have a neutral tone but may sound positive.

, Common movements range from shaking their noses up and down to smell, shaking their heads to see, and using their teeth and claws to touch and feel it. The squeaks will accompany these movements.

, Until they investigate everything, it will continue. When the curiosity stops, they just go back to their old routines and activities.

"
"
Know that, whether it be feeling violated, needing to release waste, or sad, the guinea pigs will squeal.,
Be aware that guinea pigs naturally potty train themselves conditionally.",How to Understand Guinea Pig Language4," These squeals are similar to the curious squeals, except they are a negative tone and have a larger time frequency than before. The pitch of their voice also goes from low to high quickly to express their annoyance.


If this happens, be sure to calm them down to make them happy. Stop whatever is bothering them; stop touching them in certain areas, separate it with other piggies, pet its body, or let it release its waste.

, That condition is that they will never pee or poop on their owners no matter how badly they need to go. Once they are far away from their owner, then they will release it wherever they feel like.

"
"
Know that this is the exact opposite of happiness, in which the squeals are of negative tone and high pitch.",How to Understand Guinea Pig Language5," They will open their mouths wide to show this. It can be a result of being injured, abused, neglected, bullied, and so on and is usually a temporary thing. Stop or isolate the piggie from the source of sadness to remove it from the situation and make it happy again.

"
"
Know that this one is most likely the least obvious as they don't make any noises like before.",How to Understand Guinea Pig Language6," Instead, they just chatter their teeth as if they're really cold.


When they get yelled at, physically disciplined or assaulted, or just plain angry at you, they will chatter their teeth in response. Guinea pigs may also do this when they're cold or uncomfortable, so make sure you keep note of that as well!

, To soothe your guinea pig, I recommend singing or speaking in a soft voice. They will eventually grow to trust you, and you will be able to do more with them.

, Guinea pigs are fragile creatures, and they do not forget easily. Eventually, they will trust you and be easier to train and love.

House your guinea pigs in a solid enclosure.,
Establish specific areas where each pet is allowed to be.,
Allow both pets to become comfortable in their home environments independently.,
Emphasize the other pet’s presence.",How to Keep Guinea Pigs when You Have Cats1," When a cat enters kill mode, a flimsy cage won’t stop it. While there are steps to follow that will reduce the likelihood of your cat becoming unnecessarily aggressive, it is still worthwhile to have a cage for your guinea pigs that guarantees their safety from demise by tooth and claw.


Recognize that your cat is also capable of seriously harming your guinea pig without intending to do so.As such, your guinea pig needs an area where they are completely safe, even if only from some overzealous rough-housing.;
, If possible, you’ll want to keep your guinea pigs in a safe room where your cats are not regularly allowed. If you do not have sufficient space to allow this arrangement, choose a location for the cage that will prevent your cats from hanging out on or around the guinea pig enclosure.Always keep all cat toys and guinea pig toys separated in your house. If you have a guinea pig area, keep all of their worldly possessions in that area, and do not store or allow any cat stuff in that area.
Disallow your cat from sitting beside or resting on top of your guinea pig’s enclosure at any time.

, Especially if one arrives after you’ve already had the other for a while, allow the new arrival to acclimate to your home before introducing them to each other. They will already be able to smell one another’s presence. Let the suspense build a bit.


Wait at least a week before introducing a cat and a guinea pig. Technically, you just need to make sure they are not able to touch one another or make eye contact. To be safe, don’t allow them to see one another at all., Before actually introducing your pets, acclimate your cat to the guinea pig’s scent. There are several ways to do this. The intent is to associate things your cat likes, such as food, with the guinea pig. This may seem counterintuitive, but the cat will not think of the guinea pig as food – instead, it will think the guinea pig smell indicates that other (and more appropriate) food is nearby.Place the cat’s food just outside the door of the room in which your guinea pig lives.
If your cat gets amped up outside the guinea pig’s room, remove them. Do so in a jovial, relaxed manner – you don’t want to indicate punishment, you just want to distract the cat from its overzealousness.Place a wash cloth that you rubbed the guinea pig with near the cat’s food bowl. Once your cat is entirely comfortable with the wash cloth (no longer nervously or excitedly sniffing it from time to time), use the washcloth to stroke the cat as well.
Use the same cloth to go back and forth between your pets, stroking each right after you stroked the other. As you do so, be relaxed and high spirited. Send the vibe to each pet that everything is awesome!

Pick up your piggy.,
You can also carry your piggy on your lap (when sitting!),
Relax, your pet can feel your tension and this will make him/her scared or stressed.,
Piggies love quite soothing music (classical is best) in order to calm them down.,
Brushing your pet may build up a bond and your local pet store will stock a small animal brush for sure.,
Get some small treats or cut up veg to give your piggy.,
Let them lick the sweat off your fingers.,
If you are bringing a piggy home for the first time, give them about a week before handling.",How to Build up a Close Bond With Your Guinea Pig," Scoop one hand under his or her chest, And with your other hand hold the piggy in between his or her legs. Pick your piggy up slowly!;
, For small children an old cushion or a towel may help with confidence, and stop the claws (remember to clip them!) from digging into their lap.

, This can be bad for your piggy

, Quiet and soothing music, not the latest heavy metal tracks.

, If there are no brushes available, a toothbrush will do. Do not use a used toothbrush. It is unsanitary. Most say you can if you wash it thoroughly, but it is still gross. Buy a new toothbrush, they're not that expensive.

, Veggies are preferred because they are more healthy for the piggy, and your piggy will still enjoy it.

, This may sound a bit weird but piggies love the salty taste of the sweat (but don't give them salt). This may also seem gross to you, but if you want your piggy to be happy you better try. But be careful. Some piggies don't do this, and they'd rather give you a nibble. So first try, like the picture says, with your finger nail.

, After 3-5 days, you may pet them, though. Just don't remove from cage for a week. They need to get used to the surroundings, and piggies are naturally afraid of big giants, like we are.

Guinea pigs are social animals and love companionship, but this works best when the guinea pigs have grown up together so it can really understand you. If you have more than one, keep them in same sex groups to avoid breeding, and make sure there is a hiding place for each so they can have solitude when they wise; otherwise they may try to fight each other to assert dominance (male-male), or reproduce (male-female).Good features to look for in a guinea pig cage include:Large size (a minimum of eight square feet of floor space)Wooden construction with solid flooring (no wire bottoms or any other strings like hair)
Separate running and sleeping areas
Protection from the weather (if outdoors)
Bedding: straw or hay is best, and fluffy materials should be avoided for safety reasons, as guinea pigs may eat their bedding.
Earthenware or stainless steel bowls that clip to the cage or hutch (for food and water)
A door that can be opened so that the guinea pig can enter the run area without being picked up (optional);
, Keeping things especially quiet for the first few days that your guinea pig is home might help it adjust.


You can also cover your guinea pig’s cage or hutch with a light cloth for the first few days.This may help it feel more secure and peaceful.

, On the first day you bring your guinea pig home, don’t bother it by trying to play or cuddle—just silently check on it now and then to make sure that it is okay.Guinea pigs have to build trust in you, as they are prey animals in nature.Giving yours some time alone at first will help it get used to its new home.


If you have young children, make sure they understand that the guinea pig needs some alone time at first.

, If you feed it regularly (try doing so twice a day), it will associate your sounds with food and comfort. You should ask your vet or pet supply store for food suggestions, but generally your guinea pig should eat:Hay
Guinea pig mix
Fruits and vegetables (for vitamin C): melons, oranges, spinach, broccoli, kale, and cabbage; no lettuce.

, At first, guinea pigs are unlikely to eat in front of you.To make sure that yours is eating and healthy, just check its food and water dishes in the morning. If your guinea pig has eaten, you will see that these supplies have been depleted.


Some guinea pigs might not eat or drink much or at all during the first day or two in a new home. If it has been several days and you are sure that yours is not eating, however, contact your veterinarian.

, When you stop in to check on your guinea pig, talk to it softly and calmly, while still keeping your distance at first.This will help to get your guinea pig slowly used to the sound of your voice and presence.

, After a few visits, you can try sticking your hand in your guinea pig’s cage. If your guinea pig is feeling adventurous, it might come and sniff your hand.Don’t try to pick your guinea pig up just yet; but rather keep your hand still.


Be patient if your guinea pig won’t sniff your hand yet. It can take some time to build trust.

, Once it seems more used to your presence, entice it into a corner of its cage. Placing one hand under its belly, and your other hand under its rear end, gently pick it up.Alternatively, wrap one hand around its shoulders, and place your other hand under its rear end.Hold it against your chest and talk softly to it.


If your guinea pig seems calm, you can sit with it in a chair and pet it. If it is not calm, put it back in its cage and try again later.
You can also try wrapping your guinea pig in a towel as you pick it up. Hold it to your chest, as this seems to make some feel safer.
Try picking your guinea pig up on a daily basis for the first few weeks. Even if yours seems a little nervous or frightened, you will eventually become friends if you are consistently calm and patient with it.
If your guinea pig starts to make a purring sound (like a cat), this may actually mean that it feels nervous.Guinea pigs are generally gentle, but can bite or scratch if they are frightened., Especially during the first few weeks, when you are trying to get your guinea pig used to you, treats can reward it and help it feel comfortable.Whenever you try to get near your guinea pig or pick it up, offer it a treat. However, don’t try to “trick” it into being picked up by offering it a treat, as this can cause it to distrust you.Good choices for snacks include:


Leafy green vegetables
Bits of food that are rich in vitamin C, like melon and broccoli
Guinea pig pellets

, Outdoor guinea pigs may have larger cages and more space to run around. If your guinea pig stays indoors and is well-tamed, then you can periodically let it have some free time, too. Look for a room that is free from holes or openings (so your guinea pig won’t accidentally escape), and where your guinea pig will be safe from harm (there are no cords or plastic that can be chewed, for instance).As long as you supervise, your guinea pig will benefit from the chance to run around the room and get some exercise.


Indoor playpens with tubes, ladders, boxes, and other devices to amuse guinea pigs are another option.You can build one of these on your own, but supplies for them can also be found at pet stores.
You can try to teach your guinea pig tricks, such as jumping on a box or running through a tube to get a treat from your hand.

, Once your guinea pig is used to you and to being picked up, spend some time each day bonding with it. Hold it in your lap and pet it while you watch your favorite television show, listen to music, or just talk (guinea pigs are very very very vocal).

In addition to hay and pellets, hand feed veggies, and fruits on occasion as well. Doing this at regular intervals will cause your guinea pig to associate you and your scent with his favorite things to eat.Fruit and sweeter vegetables are an ideal snack to give your guinea pig. Try feeding him a slice of banana or apple once a day, or a piece of bell pepper. Guinea pigs have different food preferences, just like people. Try different types of fruit and vegetables until you find the one that seems to make your pet the happiest. All should be fed by hand. Doing this at regular intervals will cause your guinea pig to associate you with food and caring.;
, You'll want to give your guinea pig plenty of attention, which means you should be very comfortable holding him. You'll want to give your guinea pig plenty of attention, which means you should be very comfortable holding him. A supportive but gentle hold is best. Pick him up with one hand under his belly, and one supporting his bottom. Hold him close to your body, especially when moving around.The key to a successful hold is to make sure your guinea pig feels secure. He will have a harder time trusting you if he is afraid of falling. Hold him securely, but loosely enough that he is still comfortable. This includes supporting his rump to get rid of that 'falling' feeling.

, It's not enough simply to be in the same room with your guinea pig while they are in their cage. To effectively bond with your guinea pig, make sure to spend time with them by removing them from their confined area. Take some time each day to pay attention to your guinea pig while they have the freedom to move around.Guinea pigs love to play hide and seek. When you are playing with your pig out of the cage, place several empty paper sacks around the room. Place treats in some of them, and watch your pet have fun exploring!Make sure to keep a close eye on your pet when they're on the move. They could easily search out several good hiding places, and you don't want to lose them.
When approaching your guinea pig for play time, offer them a small treat. They will begin to associate positive incentives with spending time with you.

, Talking to your guinea pig is a great way to bond with them. Guinea pigs are social creatures, and they love attention. Place your pet's cage in a room where you spend a lot of time--maybe your living room or home office. Talk to your guinea pig throughout the day. It may seem strange at first, but you will probably come to enjoy having somebody to talk to who will never disagree with your opinions. Guinea pigs make great listeners!Use your guinea pig's name frequently. By using their name, your pet will learn when you are specifically talking to them. They'll learn to look forward to the special attention.

, To earn your guinea pig's trust, you should spend some time learning to understand the characteristics of these pets. Typically, they are smart, sensitive, and have a lot of energy. Pay attention to your pet's habits, so that you can learn their likes and dislikes. For example, learning the specific spots they like to have scratched will go a long way towards earning their trust.Guinea pigs are highly social and they love company. Consider getting a companion for your pet. It's not much harder to care for two guinea pigs instead of one. And it can make it easier on them when you aren't constantly there to give them the attention and socialization they require.
Don't worry if your guinea pig does not immediately respond to your affections. As with any animal, it can take time to earn a guinea pig's trust.

, Before you bring your guinea pig to your house for the first time, make sure that you have everything you need. Take care to have a comfortable home created for them. You should also have plenty of food on hand for your new companion.A good water bottle is one of the most important items you will need for your new pet. Ask the pet store to recommend a brand. A good water bottle will provide your guinea pig with the supply of fresh and clean water they need without any leaks., Most cages that are marketed for guinea pigs are actually too small. You should look for a larger cage that is at least 7.5 square feet. This might mean that you purchase a cage that is intended for another animal. That's okay, don't worry about the name of the product. If you can't find an appropriate cage, you can make your own. A good suggestion could be a C&C cage, which is spacious and affordable. Plus, you can customise the cage!
Make it interesting. Guinea pigs like to move around, so try to find a cage that includes ramps and different levels.
Include bedding. Guinea pigs like to nest and burrow, so make sure that they have the material to do so. Pine and cedar shavings, though widely sold, are not actually good for small animals, because of chemicals. Instead, ask the pet store for a paper-based bedding product, or use fleece with some type of absorbent liner underneath.

, Feed this as the number one constituent of the diet. In addition, you can offer a small amount (no more than they can eat in 20 minutes) of a good quality extruded food. The latter is a pellet that is milled so that each nugget looks identical which stops the guinea pig from selectively eating the tasty bits and leaving the healthier parts. Feeding a diet of entirely pellets leads either to obesity or to the guinea pig's teeth overgrowing.


Your guinea pig should be eating a few servings of vegetables and fruits each day. Guinea pigs cannot produce Vitamin C so it is important that you supplement their diet, as pellets are not enough. Some pig-safe vegetables are: kale, romaine lettuce, carrot, celery (strings removed) spinach, parsley, and cilantro. Keep in mind that some different vegetables will have different limitations on how much you can feed them per week. Fruits are sugary, but can be fed once every week. Apples (seeds removed), blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, banana, oranges, peaches (pits removed) and cherry (pits removed) are fruits that you can try. You can look online for more safe veggies and fruits. Remember to feed organic if you can, and always, always, always wash your vegetables and fruits thoroughly with water before feeding. Remove any food remains after 4 hours to prevent bacteria buildup. , Generally, your guinea pig will be able to bathe itself. But every three months (or if she gets particularly dirty), you can give it a bath. Place her in the bathroom sink, on top of a washcloth. Gently scoop room temperature water over the guinea pig and rub it in.Use a small amount of shampoo and work it into a lather in your guinea pig's fur. Then gently but thoroughly rinse.
Just bathe your guinea pig's body, not her head. You don't want to get water in her eyes.Gently pat your pet dry with a clean, soft towel.

, Your guinea pig should see his vet once every year. Your vet can make sure that he is at a healthy weight and is not showing any signs of illness. Make sure to use a vet who thoroughly and patiently answers all of your questions.Take your guinea pig to the vet anytime they show signs of illness or significant changes in behavior.

, Before you bring home a guinea pig (or two) make sure that you have factored the financial costs into your budget. You'll need to purchase food, a cage, bedding, and a water bottle. Don't forget to add in occasional trips to the vet. Annual guinea pig care costs between $500-$800., Animals can read moods. So if you want your guinea pig to trust you and value you, you should reciprocate. Make sure to think about the value that having a pet adds to your life. Isn't it nice to have company when no one else is around? The more you appreciate your guinea pig, the more it will show.

, Pets are a great way to help your kids learn responsibility. Guinea pigs are an ideal first pet for your children to be around. Have your kids help you feed the guinea pig, and teach them to clean the cage. You, your children, and the guinea pig will all benefit from this arrangement.

, People who have pets are known to be healthier than non-pet owners, in some respects. Guinea pigs provide the same perks as having a cat or dog. Owning a guinea pig can help prevent symptoms of depression and can also lower your blood pressure."

Be sure the cage is the right size.,
Get the right bedding.,
Put in the right accessories.,
Place a ceramic food bowl in the cage.,
Put in a water bowl or bottle.,
Add hay.,
Set up a separate cage for the new guinea pig.,
Switch the new member to community items.,
Get the new guinea pig used to the other guinea pigs' scent.,
Place the new guinea pig in the community cage.",How to Introduce a New Guinea Pig to a Community Cage," The cage needs to be large enough to handle the animals and equipment. This includes the guinea pigs, hideaways, food bowls, water bottles or bowls, bedding, treats, and any extra items for the pigs to play with. This also includes accounting for the right dimensions for the cage to fit in the room or on the platform you plan on setting up with.Have a tape measure and ways to mark off measurements such as tape or a sharpie handy.
Measure height, width, and depth. Double check all your measurements.
For a single pig, a cage should be at minimum 24 inches long by 12 inches deep by 12 inches wide or around 7.5 square feet. More space would be better such as cages 30 inches wide by 36 inches long varying on depth.
For multiple pigs you need larger dimensions. Larger cages are more expensive. Cages can range from in the $50 range to as high as several hundreds of dollars for more elaborate multi-level dwellings.
Two guinea pigs need at least a 30” x 50” cage (10.5 square feet).
Three guinea pigs need at least a 30” x 62” cage (13 square feet).
Four guinea pigs need at least a 30” x 76” cage (16 square feet).;
, This is a choice you want to consider early on. This bedding as to be soft enough to not injure the guinea pigs' feet, but absorb the waste of multiple animals.Use aspen, pine, or recycled paper for the bedding material. Most of this is sold prepackaged in pet stores, department store pet aisles, and some supermarkets.
Layer approximately 4” – 5” of bedding on the floor of the cage.
Plan on cleaning the bedding of the guinea pigs' waste, leftover treats, food, and other items on the spot at least once a week. But change out the shavings completely once a month.
With multiple pigs you might want to step up your cleaning efforts and do spot cleanings more often.

, Guinea pigs need a variety of items in the cage including their food bowls, water, hideaways, and a few extras that are optional but help with their well-being.Hideaways or hide houses are important as guinea pigs like to have a place they feel they can be safe and quiet. There are usually wood varieties, edible ones, and plastic ones.
Get a hideaway that is easy to clean, the guinea pig(s) won't easily toss aside when they run, and is safe for them to chew.
The edible hideaways have the added benefit of giving the guinea pigs more safe chewing material for the health of their teeth. These hideaways are usually covered in vegetable-based dyes.
Some hideaways are large enough for multiple pigs, but put in two or three if you have the cage room and need to offer the shelter for more than one guinea pig. These hideaways are usually inexpensive.

, It should be wide and shallow. This will prevent the guinea pigs from tipping it.For two or three guinea pigs a single bowl should be enough as each pig needs about 1/8th of a cup of guinea pig pellet food per day.
Check the food bowl periodically for shavings and other objects scattered in by the guinea pigs that need to be cleaned out.

, Water is a choice usually between a ceramic bowl and a water bottle clipped to the side.The water bottle is a bit cleaner as the guinea pigs cannot accidentally scatter cage material into the water like they could with the bowl. However, the bottle tends to drip and get wet whatever part of the cage is under it including any bedding. Also, guinea pigs tend to pull at the bottle and can bang it against the cage sides making quite a lot of noise.
If you opt for the water in a ceramic bowl option you will need to spot check it for cleanliness more often.
If you opt for the water bottle try a plastic or glass version (plastic is more common) in a 32 ounce size. Make sure it has an angled stainless steel tube with a ball bearing to plug up the spout.
For the water bowl or bottle you should change the water once a day and clean the container.

, This can be the usual timothy hay easily found in most pet stores and some department stores and supermarkets. But as you add more guinea pigs this will become more crucial for their well being.You can leave as much as you want either in a pile on the bedding or on a ""rack"" accessory that can be added to the cage.
Hay normally helps with digestion and dental health of guinea pigs. Sometimes the hay can be too hard or coarse. If you notice your guinea pigs getting cut by the timothy hay stems you can opt for softer varieties like alfalfa. Consult a veterinarian if you are unsure.
Replace the hay daily.

, Once you have the community cage set up with the guinea pigs you already own you will need to keep the new member separate to make sure they are safe to add.Follow the steps in the earlier method for setting up a cage for a single guinea pig.
Keep the new guinea pig in the separate cage for approximately two weeks.
Make sure the new guinea pig eats, drinks, and otherwise behaves normally. There should be no signs of poor appetite, lethargy, or visible injury.
Have your veterinarian check the new guinea pig to ensure it won't carry any diseases into the community cage.

, The new guinea pig may be used to the food, treats, chew toys, and similar items from the store instead of what you have in the community cage.Use the same bedding, food, water delivery method, and hideaways from the community cage in the new member's quarantine cage to get them used to it.
Consider draping the quarantine cage with a light cloth to give the new guinea pig extra privacy with which to get used to the community cage items.
Every 10-15 minutes you can try to get the new guinea pig used to your handling.

, One way to do this is at play time.Guinea pigs are social animals normally, and like to be in each other's company.
Set up a safe penned off room free of cords or other hazards to let the new guinea pig meet the others.
Never let the guinea pigs roam unsupervised outside their cage.
Don't let un-neutered males play with females.
Generally, it's best to have guinea pigs of the same gender stay together.

, Watch this stage closely for signs of fighting or rejection.Observe the behavior of the guinea pigs to see if there is any trouble with them eating, drinking, and otherwise acting normally once the new member is added.
If you step away and come back to notice any injury to one then there may have been fighting. Consult your veterinarian in this case.
Watch for signs that the new guinea pig is not eating, staying in one of the hideaways too much, dragging its body, or making complaining noises during ordinary functions like urination. See your veterinarian if any of these behaviors occur.
Otherwise, if there is difficulty, you can simply try taking the newer guinea pig out and re-introducing it more gradually again. Allow the guinea pigs more attempts to learn the other's scent following the playtime steps from earlier.
Once all of the community guinea pigs are eating, active, and alert you should consider the introduction successful.

Introduce your cats and guinea pigs early.,
Recognize that the peace process may not be without initial conflict.,
Start with a single, brief dose of eye contact.,
Turn the tables.,
Try some cross petting.",How to Keep Guinea Pigs when You Have Cats2," The younger they both are the better. If you get both your guinea pig and cat when they are each very young and allow them to grow up together, they are especially likely to become friends.Try to introduce your cat to your guinea pig before the cat is ten weeks old. Cats this young are undergoing the critical socialization period of their development, and will be especially susceptible to information indicating that the guinea pig is a friend and fellow housemate.

, If you don’t get your cat and guinea pig when they’re both young, introducing them to each other may not go entirely smoothly. We’re talking weeks of hardened stare-downs and weird, carnal noisemaking.


Don’t push either one of them. Trying to expedite the process will likely add stress to the situation and make it harder for them to calm down around one another.

, Once they’ve acclimated to one another’s scent, allow quick eye contact sessions from a distance. These are the best way to handle visual introductions. Place the cat inside a kennel.
Let the cat watch as you praise the guinea pig and feed the guinea pig treats for being calm and relaxed. The guinea pig will likely play its part because guinea pigs tend not to overthink things.
Stop the eye contact session after a minute or two, or if either of the animals become overly energetic or nervous. The goal here is to instill calmness in their relationship.

, On another early visit, bring the cat into the room where your guinea pig is kept (but never into the guinea pig’s actual enclosure). Double check that your guinea pig is secure in their housing area and that the cat cannot reach them.Bring the cat into the room, in your own or another human’s arms.
Whichever human you have assist you should already have a good relationship with each pet.
Hold one of your pets and have another human hold the other one.
Each human should pet the animal they’re holding.
If each pet remains calm, allow them to watch as the other animal is treated fondly by the other human.
Decrease the physical distance between them incrementally. Move closer by a foot each time you have a petting session.

, Take a small amount of time each day to repeat this process. Talk to your guinea pig during these sessions so your cat becomes aware that they are a part of the family.


Once the two humans holding the pets are close enough to touch the pet that the other human is holding, hold the distance.
If you can sit next to one another with both animals remaining calm, you’re at a good distance to start cross petting.
Reach towards the other person and pet the animal that they’re holding. Take turns petting the pet the other person is holding. This will show both the cat and the guinea pig that everyone is calm with everybody else.
Reward calm, relaxed demeanors with treats and affection.

Let your guinea pig roam.,
Allow the cat and guinea pig to get to know one another.,
When you aren't in the house, keep the guinea pigs and cats separate.",How to Keep Guinea Pigs when You Have Cats3," Hold your cat on your lap in the room where you keep the guinea pig. Have the room to the door closed, and allow the guinea pig to roam around the room outside of its enclosure.


Wait until the guinea pig approaches, and assure the cat with affectionate petting if it remains calm.
It they are able to noses one another and remain calm, they are likely ready for supervised play time.

, The room with the guinea pig enclosure is best, as the guinea pig can return to its own space if it wants to do so. Always maintain active and vigilant supervision.Don’t ever allow the cat to enter the guinea pig’s enclosure.
Interrupt your pets’ interactions if the cat begins to stalk the guinea pig or either animal begins to get agitated or aggressive. Try again another day.
If aggressive behavior continues, spend time holding the cat in your lap while the guinea pig roams.

, Make sure they are both in the respective zones where the other is never allowed. This will allow each to feel most comfortable while you’re away, and minimize the risk of coming home to blood-speckled walls.


Even if they become great friends, don’t ever leave them alone together.

, Cheetahs are narrower, while leopards are fatter.

, Cheetahs have longer, thinner tails, while leopards have shorter, fatter tails. A cheetah can make sudden, sharp turns in midair when chasing prey, so its long tail help it balance when doing so.

, If you're in a zoo (or somewhere else with other people who know about big cats) and you've forgotten how to tell a leopard and cheetah apart, you can always ask somebody!

, Make sure that you are not mistaking something like a leopard who has gotten something on its face that looks like tear marks to you for a cheetah!

, Cheetahs and leopard both have spots, but a cheetah has thinner spots that are just black, while a leopard has fatter, black spots with light brown in the middle.

, A cheetah has slightly smaller ears while leopards have larger ears.

Look for small legs.",How to Identify a Siberian Tiger1," Because Siberian tigers live in colder climates than other tiger subspecies, they have considerably thicker coats. Most other tigers will have a very thin layer of fur close to their body. Siberian tigers, in contrast, will look a bit puffy because of their longer fur.Because of their colder environment, Siberian tigers will even have thick fur on their paws.Because the other differences between tigers are subtle, the fur length is often the best way to distinguish a Siberian tiger from other subspecies.;
, Siberian tigers unique in that they have manes. Their manes are not as long or as distinctive as those of a lion; however, to keep themselves warm, they do have slightly longer fur around their neck. This might give the appearance that their necks are larger and puffier than those of other tigers., Each individual tiger has its own unique pattern of stripes, but there are also differences between subspecies. Siberian tigers have brown, dark, and vertical stripes covering their body, including their legs. They have fewer, more narrow, and lighter stripes than many other subspecies. Whereas other types of tigers have black stripes, Siberian tigers have dark brown stripes.Although stripes differ from one subspecies to another, these are sometimes too subtle for anything but well-trained eye to recognize. The fact that each individual tiger has different stripe patterns also complicates the matter.
Tigers are the only wild cats with stripes. Their stripes act as camouflage allowing them to closely stalk their prey within being seen.

, Although the differences can be subtle, Siberian tigers tend to have a slightly less vibrant orange fur. It will be a lighter color than that of other subspecies. Similarly, the stripes of Siberian tigers are dark brown, rather than jet black., Siberian tigers are the largest of all the tiger subspecies. The average Siberian tiger is about 11 feet long, with a tail about 3 feet long. They can weigh as much as 700 lb.Living in northern regions calls for colder climates and thus a demand for a larger body which is easier to keep warm. Large animals lose body heat slower than smaller ones. As the mean temperature of an environment decreases, the body size of warm-blooded animal species or subspecies tends to increase (this concept is known as Bergmann's rule).

, Despite a larger body, Siberian tigers tend to have somewhat shorter legs than those of other subspecies. The contrast between the larger body and shorter legs can make the tigers look somewhat short and stubby by comparison."

Be in charge of a tigress.,
Wait for the tigress to be the right age.,
Look for the signs of the tigress coming into heat:


She will start rubbing up against things as domestic female cats do.,
Expect mating if a mate can be found.",How to Know if a Female Tiger Is in Heat," Likely you will be working in a zoo, a safari park, or working as part of a volunteer program looking after abandoned tigers in India or similar place. You might be a zookeeper, a zoo or safari volunteer, a guide explaining this to visitors, or a vet. If you are a vet, please improve this article. You can skip this step if you are just writing a biology paper at university.;
, Female tigers are not sexually mature until they are around 3 or 4 years of age, but usually come into season around 2 1/2 years of age., She is leaving her scent marks via strong pheromones in her urine so that male tigers know that she has gone into oestrus.
The tigress will become vocal. She will roar (which tigers do not do that often) in order to attract a mate. Tigers live far away from one another, so roaring is a signal to come nearer. ""Vocalisations can be persistent and one female was recorded as roaring 69 times in only 15 minutes.""She will not be averse to visiting male tigers. Although usually loners, tigers drop such reserve at mating time. A male tiger's territory usually covers that of several females and although the initial meeting might result in a fight, once they have checked each other out, the mating begins.

, Given the sad reality that there are fewer and fewer tigers in the world yearly, oestrus may come and go before the female finds a male to mate with. If she does find one, and all going well they get along, the female tiger will adopt the lordosis position for mating and the male tiger will mount her, bite the back of her neck and mate. This process causes pain to the female tiger, which stimulates ovulation.

Ask yourself if it is cold enough for a Siberian tiger.,
Consider whether you are far enough north for a Siberian tiger.,
Look for mountainous woodlands.,
Look at the mating pattern.",How to Identify a Siberian Tiger2," If you have encountered a tiger in the wild, then you can use your location to help determine whether the cat is Siberian tiger. Most tigers prefer warm weather climates. Siberian tigers, however live in the cold. This rule, however, does not apply to tigers in captivity. Zoos will import animals from all of the world, even when the local climate is very different from the animals natural habitat., One of the defining features of the Siberian subspecies is its habitat. Siberian tigers live principally in Eastern Russia. Some do, however, venture into North Korea and northern regions of China. By contrast, the second largest tiger, the Bengal tiger, lives in Indian and South East Asia., Today, Siberian tigers predominately live in remote mountainous areas. They typically prefer birch forests. In contrast, the Bengal tiger, which is of a similar size, lives in wet, tropical climates., Unlike some other large cats, tigers are solitary. The only exception is for mating. Male and female Siberian tigers will spend a few days together when they mate. The female will then bear the cubs for approximately 103 days. After birth, the mother will care for the bus for about 18 months.


There is no set time of year that Siberian tigers mate. A female, however, will generally try to mate when she is around four years old.On average, a mother Siberian tiger will birth a litter of 6 cubs. They will venture off on their own when they are old enough. Daughters will usually find territory near their mother, whereas sons will venture off further.

Recognize the signs of a pending attack.,
Back away slowly.,
Make some noise.,
Make yourself larger.,
Have a weapon to defend yourself.,
Protect your neck, throat, and head.,
Report the sighting.",How to Fend off a Mountain Lion1," If a mountain lion is less than 25 yards away from you and is staring directly at you, it is preparing to attack you. It will be positioned low to the ground with its tail twitching back and forth.;
, Conventional wisdom has suggested you should never run away from a mountain lion because this will trigger its instinct to chase its prey and attack you by biting your neck. However, recent studies have shown that freezing in your current position in front of the mountain lion leaves you at a greater risk for serious or fatal injury than backing away slowly or even running away quickly. Slowly backing away from the lion has been shown to have the lowest levels of fatality. If you choose to run (which is unrecommended), check your terrain and make sure if you can get a strong, flat spring. If you have to run up jagged or hilly terrain, the mountain lion might think you are injured and thus, even better prey.

, If you decide to stand your ground in front of the mountain lion, don't do it silently. Speak very loudly and firmly to the mountain lion; you can even try yelling at it to intimidate it. Do not scream or shriek as if you are terrified; rather, yell very forcefully.

, Stand tall and raise your arms overhead and open your coat so you make yourself seem as big and intimidating as possible. If small children are with you, pick them up. (By doing so, you are making yourself look bigger and protecting the child at the same time.) Puff up your chest and throw your shoulders back. Do not bend down before the mountain lion as they will take this as a sign of weakness.

, If you have any kind of walking stick, a hunting knife, rocks or another large weapon to deter the mountain lion, you should use it at the moment of attack. Pepper spray might also be a successful deterrent.If the mountain lion acts aggressively, throw stones at or near it; convince it that you could be dangerous.
You can also use a hunting rifle or pistol to fire at the lion if it makes a charge at you. You should first attempt to fire a warning shot to scare off the lion before it attacks.

, The mountain lion will most likely attempt to tackle you and crush your skull or bite your throat. Try to block the mountain lion from your eyes and face as you strike it. Do everything you can to fight it off.

An average adult should be able to ward off an attack by fighting back since mountain lions are rather small. Aim for the head, mouth, and eyes.







, As soon as you are able, report your encounter to authorities."

Follow up with your doctor.",How to Survive a Cheetah Attack," Cheetahs can be extremely stealthy, and you may not notice one approach until it is too late. Dogs, however, with their keener sense of smell, can detect cheetahs before they attack. Going out on safari with a dog is a good idea. Your barking canine friend will act like an early-warning system, letting you know that danger is near while simultaneously scaring the cheetah away.


Anatolian Shepard and Kangal dogs are the preferred breeds to deter cheetah attacks.;
, Don’t leave on your safari adventure without bringing a first-aid kit. If you are attacked by a cheetah, you’ll be glad you took the time to pack it. If you’re going out with a safari tour guide, he or she should have a well-stocked kit which includes:


bandages of varying sizes
disinfectant
medical gloves
antibiotic ointment
sterile gauze pads
hand sanitizer
a first aid manual
an eye shield
a thermometer
tweezers
finger splints
scissors

, Many big cat attacks occur when tourists roll their windows down or open their doors.Staying safely in your vehicle ensures no cheetah will attack you.


A young cheetah might test your vehicle, jumping on it or gnawing its fenders. Let the cheetah do so undisturbed. It will eventually grow bored and leave.

, Always follow your guide’s directions. They are experts with many years of experience dealing with African wildlife, and their first priority is your safety.


If you are on a walking tour, stay close to your guide or a member of your group. Cheetahs tend to attack individuals who are isolated from the rest of their group.Never wander off the trail or follow a cheetah if you see one nearby.

, Cheetahs are known to avoid areas frequented by hyenas and lions. Bringing along a recorded hyena or lion call will dissuade any nearby cheetah from engaging you or your party.This behavioral pattern is known as predator avoidance and is effective no matter the cheetah’s sex or age.
Lions are perceived as a bigger threat to cheetahs than hyenas. The lion’s roar should be the preferred audio recording you utilize to dissuade cheetah attacks.

, However, if the cheetah believes you are a predator in pursuit, it will turn to stand its ground and attack. This could result in serious injury to you. Keep your distance when you spot a cheetah and let it leave without pursuing it. That great photo you think you can capture won’t be worth anything if you aren’t around to share it.

, If the Cheetah spots you, maintain eye contact. Whilst maintaining eye contact, back away slowly. Do not run.If you run, the cheetah will instinctively chase you.And cheetahs are fast – the fastest land animals on earth, clocking in at up to 60 miles per hour.Unless you’re a gazelle, running away won’t do you much good.


Don’t make any sudden movements or show any sign of fear.
Get somewhere safe.Get back in your car or find other shelter. Don’t bother climbing a tree – cheetahs cannot climb as high as other big cats, but can still scale any tree you can at a much faster speed.

, If the cheetah continues to aggressively approach or pursue you, you will have to stand your ground. Make yourself appear as large as possible. Wave your arms above your head and start yelling at it. Clap or whistle loudly. If you have noise making devices available such as bells or pots and pans, use them to scare the cheetah off.

, While cheetahs are stronger and faster than you, you still have a fighting chance if you’re being attacked.


If you are armed, utilize your weapon. Pepper spray should be your first line of defense since cheetahs are an endangered species. Do not kill the cheetah unless it is actively attacking you or a member of your group.
Kick the cat firmly in the chest just before it makes contact with you. This will knock it back and, hopefully, make it think twice about attacking you.If using a knife, strike the cheetah in the eyes or neck. If unarmed, go for the eyes, plunging your thumbs into its eye sockets and gripping it around the back of its head. Punch the cheetah in its head and nose., If you’ve already been pounced on, do not struggle or scream.Slow your breathing and close your eyes. Assume the fetal position by bringing your knees up to your head and covering your neck with your hands. The cheetah will think itself victorious and slink away or turn its attention to something else. In either case, you will then have an opportunity to escape or get help from your companions.


Protect your neck while on the ground. Cheetahs kill their prey by clamping down on their victim’s neck with their powerful jaws, suffocating it., If your companions are nearby, yell and attract their attention. You might not be able to fend off a wild cheetah on your own.Individuals attacked by cheetahs are often saved due to the timely intervention of a friend or other member of their group. For this reason, always stay close to your party when venturing into cheetah territory.


If you are not the immediate object of the cheetah attack, you should do everything you can to remove the cheetah from the other member of your party. Cheetahs are scared by large groups and an attacking cheetah will likely break off its attack when it sees it is outnumbered.

Strike the cheetah in its head or side to remove it from your friend.
Take the cat’s tail firmly in your hand and pull hard.
Reach your hand over the back of its head and plug its nostrils. Unable to breathe, the cheetah will abandon its attack.
Spray water on its face.Do not use firearms against a cheetah who has a friend pinned. The risk of inadvertently hitting the victim is too great.



, Immediate, gentle rinsing of the wound with water or a solution of water and povidone-iodine will decrease your risk of bacterial infection. Remove any teeth, dirt, or hair if possible. If the wound is shallow, pad it dry and apply an antibacterial agent. Wrap it with a clean bandage.Cut away any clothing to clean the wound if necessary.
If the bite severed a body part such as a finger, wash it in clean water, wrap it in tissue, and place it in a plastic bag. Pack the bag in ice. It may be possible to reattach it later.
If jewelry is present, remove it to prevent the constriction of blood vessels in the event of swelling.
Pay attention to your condition. If you feel lightheaded, weak, or dizzy, you may pass out due to blood loss or shock. Don’t move too suddenly following your attack unless it is to extricate yourself from immediate danger.

, If vinyl medical gloves are available in your first aid kit, wear them. If not, use clean plastic bags or layers of rags or cloth to keep a barrier between your hand and the wound. To prevent infection, use your bare hands only as a last resort.


You will need to staunch the bleeding with a clean, dry cloth.
Elevate the wound and apply even pressure for 15 minutes. Time your application of pressure with a clock.
If blood soaks through the first cloth, apply another without removing the first. After 15 minutes, check to see if the wound has stopped enough for bandaging. If it has not, continue to press the wound in 15-minute intervals until bleeding has slowed enough to apply a bandage.

, You will likely need stitches to heal properly. Depending on the extent of damage, surgery may be necessary. Your doctor will probably prescribe you with an antibiotic and run bloodwork to check for infection.


An X-ray might be called for to check for broken bones.
If the animal’s rabies immunization status is unknown, your doctor will need to check for evidence of rabies by killing the cheetah in question and studying its brain. If the cheetah was rabid, you are in serious danger and must receive a full battery of vaccines immediately. Once symptoms start, your chances of survival are limited.

, Besides rabies, bite wounds can lead to nerve or tendon laceration and infection.Signs of nerve or tendon damage include the inability to move the wounded limb properly, or a loss of feeling around the site of the bite wound.Infections can be fatal if not treated quickly and properly. Signs of infection include swelling, redness, pain, or oozing.Be on the lookout for irritation to the wound or changes in your condition which may indicate infection.

Try to remain calm and back away slowly.,
Make yourself big.,
Repel an attacking tiger with noise.,
Do whatever you can to survive.",How to Survive a Tiger Attack1," In the event that a tiger is tracking you or has begun to snarl at you and seems ready to attack, try to stay calm. Do not look the tiger in the eye, but do turn towards the tiger. Back away slowly while fighting the urge to turn your back and run.Keep walking backwards until the tiger is well out of sight, then turn and move quickly away from the location of the tiger.;
, Try to look and feel brave. Whatever you do, do not run. Running away from a tiger is all but inviting it to attack you. Inciting a chase can literally prompt an uncertain tiger into attacking. While slowly backing away, stand up as tall as possible.Make yourself look like less of a helpless prey animal by standing up straight.
Crouched down, you look weaker and smaller – both of which will increase the chances that a tiger will attack.

, Even simple sounds may frighten a tiger off if they are not accustomed to the noise. Make noise with anything you have, especially if it makes a loud or unnatural sound.If you have a firearm, shoot it into the air.
If you have a signal flare, light it and hold it in front of you.
Jingle or shake any metal or glass items against one another.
If you attempt to shout at the tiger, do so with full confidence. Any nervousness that is betrayed by your voice may incite the tiger to attack.

, If the tiger begins to physically attack, it is unlikely to stop. Continue making as much noise as possible, and use whatever you have to shield yourself and strike back in self defense. Avoid playing dead; if the tiger is attacking out of an interest in eating you, it will simply proceed unencumbered. Remember that your best chance of survival is convincing the tiger to flee, which will require you to frighten or injure the tiger.If you are lucky enough to survive an attack, work to stop any bleeding and get medical attention as quickly as possible.

, You could choose newspaper, old towels, or anything else that you won't mind getting soiled. This layer of absorbency will keep your floor clean in case of an accident, and give your pigs somewhere to sit in between photos.

, Try having your guinea pigs pose with some stuffed animals, or put up a colorful background. Whatever you're using, be sure to set it all up before you bring in the pigs.

, It's a good idea to keep some treats in the photo-taking area, so you don't have to run and grab them later. Avoid treats bought at pet stores, as often commercial treats and pellets are full of sugar, alfalfa, or choking hazards such as nuts or seeds. Instead, opt for some healthy fresh fruit or veggies.

, Carefully carry them into your photography location or studio one at a time. carefully, and carry them into the room one at a time. Try to be gentle so as not to startle them. To pick up your guinea pig, use one hand to hold them under the chest and your remaining hand to support their rump.

, The goal is to keep them as calm as possible so they don't squirm, so be sure to let them chill in the shade every once in a while. You may wish to bring in their travel cage so they're better contained while you prepare for the next photo.

, You may think that you can keep an eye on them and prevent them from mating, but they can do so in the blink of an eye, and you might not be able to stop it. Play it safe, and keep sexes separate unless they're neutered.


The exception to this rule is if you're photographing baby guinea pigs. Pups can reach sexual maturity at as young as 4 weeks, so you can keep both sexes together if they're 3 weeks or younger.

, Be careful with the costumes, so as not to hurt your guinea pigs or choke them. Keep an eye out for chewing of costumes or other supplies.

, Guinea pigs are easily overwhelmed, so it's a good idea to let them have some food and relax every so often.

, You may need to bribe the pigs with treats in order to get them in the right place or face the right way.

, These types of pictures tend to add a personal touch. Additionally, since you have more control over the pigs, these photos are easier to take, and are well-suited to beginners.

, Let the pigs wander around, take a nap, interact with one another or the camera, and just be themselves. They are curious animals, and it's always fun to take a picture of them exploring the area or sniffing the camera.

, Don't be afraid to try out new ideas, props, or settings. Experiment with taking photos outside as well, allowing your pets to play in the grass (in an enclosed area, of course), or include them in family photos. Don't forget to show off your amazing new photos!

Look out for tracks.,
Watch out for mountain lion scat.,
Be aware of claw rakings.,
Respect the mountain lion's space.",How to Fend off a Mountain Lion2," The best way to avoid a mountain lion is to leave the area at the first sign of its presence. If you are hiking or camping, be on the lookout for mountain lion tracks. Its paw prints will have a the imprint of slightly triangular heel surrounded by four toes. The top of the heel will have two lobe bumps while the bottom of the heel will have three. The toes are slightly elongated, so they will look like extended ovals; they generally will not have claw marks.Mountain lions move at a much slower pace than dogs or coyotes, so the tracks will be further spread apart and also directly behind each other. Be sure not to dismiss paw prints for those of a dog or coyote.

, This will be a telltale sign a mountain lion has been nearby! The scat is broken into segments that are about 1""-1 1/2"" in diameter (or roughly the same size as a dog's poop). If you dare to look closer, it might also contain bones, teeth and hair from its latest kill., These are scratches that male mountain lions will often leave on tree trunks to announce their presence and also to mark their territory. They will generally fall between four and eight feet up on the tree. If mountain lions are common in your area, it might be a sign that you are in a mountain lion's favorite path.


Mountain lions are not the only animals that make these kinds of markings; bears will often make similar markings, but there will be larger chunks of bark missing. Elk will sometimes scrape their antlers on tree trunks, but these will be smaller, more horizontal markings., If you see a mountain lion off in the distance (more than 100 yards away), do not run after it, especially if it is moving away from you. If you have children with you, do not let them go after the mountain lion. Unlike lions or other big cats, mountain lions have not been socialized around human communities; they are therefore much more likely to avoid you than to attack you."
"
Hike and camp in groups.,
Avoid hiking at dusk or dawn.,
Deer-proof your home.,
Keep your domestic pets indoors.",How to Fend off a Mountain Lion3," Mountain lions are solitary creatures: they do not hunt in packs. Therefore, if you are hiking or camping in a group of people, they will be far less likely to attack you than if you are just by yourself., Mountain lions are most active between twilight and dawn; they have superior vision at night and they prefer to use this advantage when they hunt. If you are in an area known to have mountain lions, avoid walking alone at night, early morning, or in the early evening.

, Mountain lions love to eat deer; therefore, you should attempt to deter deer from your property if you live in an area with mountain lions. Deer, in turn, love to eat vegetation such as roses, chrysanthemums, and berries, so you should avoid planting these items or keep them in an enclosed planter. Installing outdoor lighting and automated sprinklers will also help detract deer and mountain lions., Generally, a mountain lion will always prefer to eat deer, elk, or porcupines, but in an area where food is scarce, they will also attack livestock and your household pets. Make sure you keep your dogs and cats indoors or on a leash if they are outside so they do not attract a mountain lion. Livestock should be kept in fenced or sheltered areas (like a barn of stables) for protection. "

Avoid approaching an escaped tiger.,
Attempt to distract the tiger and hide.,
Do not antagonize a tiger in any way.,
Give old or injured tigers a wide berth.,
Leave cubs alone.",How to Survive a Tiger Attack2," If you see a tiger that may have escaped captivity, do not assume it is docile or friendly towards humans. Tigers that have been captive will be agitated in unfamiliar environments, and are especially likely to attack., Leave your possessions behind as you walk away, as these may momentarily distract a curious tiger. If you cannot vacate the area entirely, attempt to hide. Tigers are not as capable of climbing as are some other jungle cats, so climb a tree until you can escape.Once you've hidden, you may attempt to distract the tiger by throwing things away from you to lead them in that direction. However, use extreme caution in doing so, as you're probably more likely to attract attention to your hiding spot. As such, it is better to throw stuff off of your path before you hide.

, Never antagonize a tiger or large animal of any type. Tigers in particular respond to aggression with aggression and will defend themselves by attacking.Do not throw anything at a tiger or attempt to hit it with something.


In the event that you are attacking a tiger in order to distract it from mauling someone else, use whatever you have to strike the tiger as hard as you can.
Keep shouting at the tiger, both to intimidate it and to distract it from its victim.

, While an old or injured tiger may seem feeble or in need of your help, they may actually be especially dangerous. Even if a tiger is in poor health, it should be treated with extreme caution.In the wild, you’re actually more likely to see a tiger in poor health, as tigers that are unable to hunt as well as they are when healthy will seek out easily accessible prey, such as livestock.
This will bring them into closer proximity to humans than tigers are usually comfortable with.

, No matter how tempting it may be or how cute they may look, you should never interact with a young tiger. Tiger mothers are ferociously protective of their young and will readily come to their defense if they feel they are threatened in any way. Do not approach or attempt to interact with a cub in any way if you see one.In the wild, it is very rare to spot cubs because they are fiercely protected by their mothers. With that said, just because you see a cub all by themselves wondering around aimlessly doesn't mean that the mother isn't somewhere nearby.

Travel with a guide if outdoors in tiger territory.,
Be silent and still if you spot a tiger before is sees you.,
Avoid inadvertently challenging a tiger’s mark.,
Wear a two-faced mask.",How to Survive a Tiger Attack3," Though there are only a few places in the world where you can see tigers in the wild, these places are sometimes open to travelers. If you’re visiting a place in which tigers freely roam, hire a guide to help ensure a safe journey.Often, organizations interested in the well-being of wild animals will provide you with information to inform you of how to behave safely in certain areas and avoid dangerous situations.

, If a tiger has not noticed your presence, try to get away before it sees you. You are more likely to attract attention by moving, so simply wait until the tiger has moved on of its own accord. Once it has, move safely but deliberately towards safety, ideally in the opposite direction., Stated otherwise, don’t pee in a tiger’s domain. An innocent bathroom break may be interpreted by a tiger as an act of aggression, and they may perceive you as a threat if you urinate in their territory. As a general rule of thumb, always ensure that you are well hydrated and have visited the bathroom before you walk into Tiger territory. , If you’re somewhere – such as the Ganges Delta in India – where people are regularly attacked and killed by tigers, consider wearing a backwards-facing mask. Rear-facing masks trick tigers, which prefer to sneak up on potential prey.By fooling the tiger into thinking you have eyes in the back of your head, you may prevent yourself from becoming its next meal.
Even when tigers have been observed stalking humans, they do not attack people wearing a two-faced mask.

Look at the fur.,
Check out the animal's proportion.,
Find out its height.,
Consider the area.,
Observe the animal's behaviour.",How to Identify a Snow Leopard," A Snow Leopard's fur, which provides protection from the extreme cold of its mountainous habitat, is a soft grayish color with yellow-brown fur along its flank and a lighter white fur on its belly, chest, and chin. Look for a dark strip which runs along its back. The rest of its coat is spotted with solid circles and rosettes. Its fur provides excellent camouflage it its natural environment making these solitary creatures incredibly hard to spot in the wild.;
, The forelimbs of the snow leopard are relatively small compared to the rest of its body. See if the leopard also has a long, thick tail, which helps it balance while walking through the snowy terrain, jumping across rocky areas, and climbing in trees.

, This cat can reach about two feet at the shoulder and weigh between 55 and 150 pounds, making them the sixth largest wild cat. They have large paws for walking on snow unlike many other big cat species.

, Check for snow leopards in Central Asia, high up in the mountains. Unfortunately, these beautiful cats are hard to come by out of zoos; on the 2009 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the snow leopard was listed as endangered.

, Like most big cats, Snow Leopards are solitary. If you see several of the same sized cats together, they are probably not Snow Leopards as the only observable groups are mothers with young cubs. Snow Leopards are most active at dawn and dusk. If you see a feline hunting in central Asia in the dead of night, it's unlikely to be a Snow Leopard."

Make sure your guinea pig is healthy.,
Ensure that your guinea pig's cage is large enough.,
Make sure the cage is in an ideal location.,
Organize the cage appropriately.,
Feed your guinea pig well.,
Make sure the bedding in the cage is soft.,
Clean the cage regularly.",How to Make Sure Your Guinea Pig Is Happy1," Lethargy and inactivity can be a sign of illness, as can the refusal to eat or drink. It's important to confirm that your guinea pig is simply bored and mildly depressed - which can be treated with increased stimulation and socialization - and not seriously ill.Lethargy for example often accompanies misaligned teeth, infection, and obesity, all of which are dangerous for guinea pigs.Assess whether your guinea pig is suffering from other signs of illness, such as loss of appetite, weight loss or gain, rough hair, and loss of elasticity in the skin. If you notice any of these symptoms, you should consult a veterinarian who has experience with guinea pigs. If you don't notice these other signs, then consider the following steps to make life happier and more exciting for your guinea pig.;
, The Humane Society of the United States has noted that most commercial cages available for guinea pigs are too small. Guinea pigs are animals that love to move around. The happiest guinea pigs have ample space in their cages to run, exercise, and play. Guinea pigs need a minimum of eight square feet of floor space in their cages, but more space is even better. If you have one guinea pig, aim for a cage about 30"" x 36""; if you have two guinea pigs, try to get a cage that is 30"" x 50"". As a general tip, there should always be room in any cage for exercise space, a food bowl, a tunnel or box for your pig to hide in or under and a place for him go to the bathroom.

, Guinea pigs like to be near other beings, so consider putting the cage in a living room or family room, where your guinea pig can be part of the family and can be seen and heard. Do keep in mind, however, that guinea pigs have sensitive ears and that they do not like loud noises. Keep the cage away from stereos, televisions and anything else that emits loud sounds.In addition, place the cage in an area that is neither too warm nor too cool. Guinea pigs don't like extreme temperatures; moreover, extreme cold or heat can cause the animals to become ill. Aim for an area that is about 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit and away from any heat sources or drafty spaces.

, Try to keep food dishes, water bottles, houses, and toys away from the walls of the cage so that your guinea pig has lots of space to run and play. Place all cage accessories in the centre of the cage to create a perimeter around the cage that is free of obstructions for your pig to run around.Always change up toys, houses and their locations in the cage in order to keep them interesting for your guinea pig., To make sure your guinea pig has a well-balanced and nutritious diet, provide him with ample hay. Fresh hay provides the fiber the guinea pig's digestive tract needs and grinds the teeth down to keep them in good shape. Guinea pigs can run and play in and also eat the hay so this is key to keeping them healthy and happy. It is important to provide an unlimited source of grass hay because food pellets don't contain enough fiber to help the digestive system fully function properly.In addition to hay, provide your guinea pig with 1/8 of a cup of food pellets, and about 1 cup of vegetables per day. Veggies are a key source of vitamin C for guinea pigs; good choices include leafy greens like kale, spinach, and romaine lettuce.Try to vary your pet's meal choice to make eating more exciting. Experiment to see what your pig likes. Other veggie options include bell peppers, brussel sprouts, carrots, cucumbers, peas, and tomatoes.Add fruit to your pigs diet. Guinea pigs love fruit! Try to choose fruits high in vitamin C, such as cantaloupe, strawberries, and kiwi. However, make sure that you are only giving fruit as a special treat not more than a few times a week because of its high sugar content.Make the food fun! You can cut up your guinea pig's favorite veggies and thread them together with twine, making a kabob you can hang on the side of his cage. You can also buy a little metal pole for the kabob from pet stores.Keep the food fresh. Checking the cage constantly and remove anything that is uneaten and will wilt or decompose. In general, avoid giving your guinea pig spoiled or wilted vegetables; don't feed them anything you yourself wouldn't eat.

, Guinea pigs have very delicate feet so it's important that they have soft and abundant bedding. Make sure to provide about 2-3 inches worth of bedding, so that there is sufficient padding and absorption. The ideal bedding material is hay, since it's warm and absorbent. Make sure the hay is of a high quality and soft nature. Straw-like hay can injure guinea pigs' eyes. Be sure to change bedding if it ever becomes wet or sodden. Spot clean every day by removing wet patches and replacing with clean straw. Damp hay can cause health problems and is also greatly disliked by the guinea pigs themselves. In general, guinea pigs prefer clean, dry bedding and will feel more comfortable in cages that provide this comfort.
Do not use cedar and pine shavings as bedding, even though these are widely available as bedding for small pets. These materials have phenols, which can be harmful to guinea pigs.

, In general, cages should be cleaned quickly every day (spot-cleaning) and thoroughly washed and cleaned once a week.At the end of every day, remove any uneaten food from the cage and droppings.
At least once a week, replace and/or clean the bedding in the cage and remove everything from inside the cage so you can give it a good scrub with warm water. Because guinea pigs like dry surfaces, make sure the cage is fully dry before putting the bedding back in.

"
Give your guinea pig ""toys"".,
Avoid certain toys.,
Create ""hidey houses"" for your guinea pig.,
Let your guinea pig out.",How to Make Sure Your Guinea Pig Is Happy2," Remember that safety should be your top concern and that many commercial toys can fall apart and leave small pieces behind that your pig could choke on. You'll need to experiment to decide which toys your guinea pig likes, as they don't always enjoy the same thing. A good rule of thumb is that the simpler the toy, the better.Make sure to only add large toys into the cage that cannot be swallowed by your guinea pig to ensure that there are no choking hazards.
Wooden blocks or dowels are good choices because guinea pigs like to and should chew on things. This is because guinea pigs' teeth never stop growing, and chew toys can help gnaw the teeth down to comfortable length. Make sure with any wooden toys you purchase that the wood is untreated and unpainted.A good toy to include is a tunnel (or even more than one). Guinea pigs love running through and sleeping in tunnels in their cage. You could purchase a tube or tunnel at a major pet store, but you can also make one really easily at home using an empty Quaker Oats container. Be sure to remove the plastic and metal lips from both ends and all labels.

, Do not give your guinea pig exercise balls or wheels. These toys can cause crippling injuries to guinea pigs' feet, back, and toes. Stick to the toy options listed above.

, Guinea pigs can be very shy and they love to hide under things and get a little privacy. Hidey houses and tunnels also make them feel safe, secure, and comforted. Again, these are things that you can either purchase at any main pet supply retailer or make inexpensively at home.As a general rule, a guinea pig should have at least one wooden structure in their cage, whether that be a wooden little house or a tunnel. Wooden structures give the guinea pig something to chew on, which help ground down his teeth and keep the them safe.
If you have more than one pig, you should have one extra house beyond the number of pigs in the cage. For instance, if you have 3 pigs, you'll want to have 4 hidey houses. Having one seemingly ""neutral"" house not designated for any particular guinea pig helps maintain peace in the group.To make a little DIY-house where your pig can hide, use an old, plain (i.e., no dyes) shoebox. Your pig will love the little house and it's totally safe for chewing. You could also use paper bags that you lay on their sides to create a kind of cave for your guinea pig. To make it extra fun, you could also stuff some hay in the bag - toy and hay all-in-one! You can also make towel tents for your pig to hide under. Cut up or fold old bath towels (make sure to remove any tags or loose threads) and drape over a corner of the cage. You can loop the towel through the wires of the cage or use pins or other clips to secure the towels in place. This is a great alternative for a hiding spot because you can wash and reuse the ""tent"" as needed., Even if you have a large cage, and especially if you don't, give your guinea pig some floor time each day. Give him some additional exercise by letting him run around a small room or other enclosed space; this should be part of your pig's daily routine to help keep him happy and healthy.Make sure to only let your guinea pig out in rooms that have no small openings through which the guinea pig could escape or become lost. In addition, make sure to avoid areas where there is furniture or appliances that your guinea pig could get stuck in, such as in sofas, behind ovens or refrigerators, etc.You'll also need to keep a close eye on your pig because guinea pigs will chew on anything they can, including dangerous items like electrical wires and cords. Make sure any wires are not just unplugged but are totally inaccessible to your pig when he is let out of the cage.Do not let your guinea pig outside, where he could become easily lost or considered as prey by larger animals."

Get another guinea pig.,
Interact and bond with your guinea pig regularly.,
Handle your guinea properly and with care.,
Teach your guinea pig tricks.",How to Make Sure Your Guinea Pig Is Happy3," Guinea pigs are social herd animals who are happier in the presence of other guinea pigs.Consider getting a second guinea pig (or more!) and you'll see the benefits, including higher levels of activity and increased exercise.


In some countries, it is even illegal to buy single guinea pigs; you have to buy them in pairs.
If you do get another guinea pig, make sure it is of the same sex as the guinea pig you currently have OR that it is neutered or spayed if it is of the opposite sex. This is important because if a male guinea pig and a female guinea pig are housed together, they will likely mate and the female pig will become pregnant, which is quite dangerous., Guinea pigs love to interact with humans as well as other pigs. Socializing with your guinea pig is one way to keep him happy and healthy. Talk to your guinea pig, cuddle him, carry him in your hands, and pet his fur as often as you can. Show him that you love him!It's important that you give your guinea pig special attention on a daily basis, handling, cuddling, and touching him as often as you can manage.

, Always make sure to support the entire body since guinea pigs are small animals with delicate bones. Some pigs also tend to jump, especially when they are being returned to their cages. Such falls can result in broken bones, serious injuries, and even death. To handle your pig properly, wrap one hand around his chest and use the other to support his hind feet and bottom. Hold him against your chest for extra security.Talk to your guinea pig gently as you pick him up and handle him and make sure to approach him from the front so as not to frighten him.If you have a jumpy guinea pig that likes to squirm around, you can train your pig to not struggle when being held or put back in his cage. Hold your guinea pig firmly but gently, when you move to put him back in the cage, hold him a few inches above the floor. Do not put him down as long as he continues to squirm while in your hands. Be careful not to squeeze him too tight or you could damage his back and cause paralysis. Only place your guinea pig onto the cage floor once your he stops squirming and struggling against you but don't let go since he will probably try to run away. Hold him yet again until he stops moving. After several training sessions, your guinea pig will learn that he can be free once he stops squirming.
Young children should not be permitted to carry a guinea pig in their hands because they may inadvertently squeeze the pig too hard or drop him., Guinea pigs are very smart. You can teach them to stand on their hind legs, spin, run in a circle, stand on a pedestal, jump, and respond to his own name. In general, guinea pigs aren't as easy to train as other rodents, but you can be successful with a bit of patience!Younger guinea pigs tend to be more receptive to training and learning tricks than older ones.To teach your guinea pig tricks, you'll need to rely on a method known as operant conditioning, which means that you have to reward your guinea pig each time he successfully completes a task. You start off rewarding small movements and then put the whole trick together.
For example, if you want your pig to run in a circle on command, you'll need a pocket full of treats (such as little bits of carrot) and something that makes noise, like a clicker. Issue the command ""turn"" and if your guinea pig even turns his head the littlest bit, click the clicker and give him a reward. This will help him learn that when he hears the clicking sound he has done something right and that there will be a reward. Repeat the signal until he has it mastered and then make it more difficult to earn the reward (e.g., only give him the carrot bit if he does a quarter-turn and then a half-turn and then so on, until he does the full action). You should train with your guinea everyday for results."
"
Schedule regular, inside playtime with your guinea pig.,
Let your guinea pig play outside of his cage.,
Provide your guinea pig with a variety of toys.",How to Play with a Guinea Pig1," Consistent, daily interaction with your guinea pig is very important for his overall wellbeing. If you forget to play with him or are not able to play with him until much later in the day (maybe you had to work late), he might become depressed or withdrawn because of the change in routine., Because guinea pigs are so active, keeping them in cages all the time can leave them feeling frustrated with lots of pent up energy. Letting your guinea pig roam outside of his cage will give him an opportunity to burn off excess energy.Before you let your guinea pig out of his cage, you will need to ‘guinea pig-proof’ the room where you plan to let him out. Guinea pigs like to chew on things, so make sure to put away or hide anything that he could chew on–electrical cords, mats, rugs, trinkets, etc.It would also be helpful to cover any accessible areas of furniture that he could chew on, such as the corners of couches, tables, or chairs.Place different toys and objects (eg, toilet paper rolls) in the room to give your guinea pig things to explore and play with while he is out of his cage.You can even put some treats on the floor for him to munch on while he’s playing.
If you have any other pets, put them in another room until after you place your guinea pig back in his cage.Supervise your guinea pig closely while he is outside of his cage to make sure that he doesn't run away or start chewing on something that he's not supposed to chew on.

, Toys are an important aspect of keeping your guinea pig happy. There are many types of toys that you can give your guinea pig, including nibblers, chew toys, and toy balls. In addition, you can make homemade toys out of toilet paper rolls, empty shoeboxes, and empty milk cartons.Although you may not interact directly with him when he’s playing with his toys, you can still spend time with him while he’s playing with them.


Nibblers and chew toys are usually made of a sturdy natural material, such as wood. Not only will these toys keep your guinea pig busy, they will help him keep his teeth filed down. Your guinea pig’s teeth can become dangerously long, so providing him with toys that he can nibble on will help maintain his good dental hygiene.Toy balls are also typically made of natural material and can easily be pushed around by your guinea pig.Ramps and stairs are fun toys if your guinea pig is in a multi-level cage. Make sure that the ramps and stairs are solid. Your guinea pig’s legs are short and could get stuck in the wires of wire ramps or stairs, causing injury.Exercise balls and wheels are not suitable toys for your guinea pig. His back does not bend like the backs of other pocket pets (mice, hamsters), so exercise balls and wheels can very easily lead to back injuries in guinea pigs.Clean his toys on a regular basis. Plastic toys can go in the dishwasher. Wooden toys should be washed by hand with a towel and allowed to dry completely before being placed back in his cage.Put only a few toys in his cage at a time so that he still has room to run around his cage. Switch out those toys when you clean his cage so that he has a new set of toys to play with."

Save a day in your schedule.,
Set up an area.,
Make the floor space comfortable and safe.,
Spend a lot of time with your guinea pig.,
Make a time for a pamper.,
Feed the guinea pig little pieces of its favorite food.,
Make a special time for you to exercise your guinea pig.,
Place the guinea pig back in its usual home when it gets tired.",How to Pamper Your Guinea Pig," Set some time aside just for you and your guinea pig to spend quality time together.;
, Choose somewhere that is neither too large nor too small. Ensure that there are no small objects or electrical wires that could cause injury to the guinea pig (chewing, tripping, etc.) Make it so that your guinea pig will not be able to escape; for example, set up a fence using books or a child's playpen. If it is in an open area, which is not recommended, keep the guinea pig on a harness and leash and watch it like a hawk.

, On the floor, place down soft fleece or bedding. Set up various areas for different needs, such as a hay area, a drinking area, a toilet area, a sleeping area, and a play area with tunnels, jumps, ramps etc.

, Hug it, stroke it, brush its fur, let it sleep in your lap, etc. However, be aware that all guinea pigs need alone time: If your guinea pig seems to become a bit tired or bored, give it time to rest.

, Bathe your guinea pig. Brush it thoroughly and clip its nails. Dress it up in safe articles of clothing if you please. But as tempting as it may be, don't paint its nails!

, Know beforehand what the guinea pig can or cannot eat and do not over feed it. Making a salad is ideal, as pellets and some of the other treats can be more fattening and wreak havoc in your piggy's stomach., Use food to tempt it through obstacles and praise your guinea pig when it gets to the other side., Don't overdo the pamper time––your guinea pig should feel relaxed, not hassled."
"
Prepare an outdoor enclosure.,
Take your guinea pig outside when it is warm.,
Keep a close eye on your guinea pig.",How to Play with a Guinea Pig2," Allowing your guinea pig outside is good for his health and well-being.Guinea pig runs are popular enclosures that will allow your guinea pig to play safely outdoors. Runs are relatively easy to put together and can be made of different materials, such as wood, PVC, nylon and mesh.Whichever type of run that you choose, there are few important things to keep in mind. For example, cover the run to keep predators out and provide your guinea pig with some protection from the sun and breeze.Place some things in the run that your guinea pig can hide and rest in, such as a guinea pig-size igloo and paper bags. Plastic tunnels or toilet paper tubes are also good items that he can rest in.Make sure that you place plenty of water and good-quality hay in the run as well.If the grass is still damp, place several large towels on the ground so that your guinea has somewhere dry to go when he is outside.Alternatively, you could wait until the grass is completely dry before taking your guinea pig outside.
Remove any weeds, and debris from inside the enclosure area., Guinea pigs are very sensitive to hot weather (80 degrees Farenheit or more), so it is important to take him outside only when the temperature is not too hot. Temperatures will not be extremely high in the springtime, so this would be the perfect time to take your guinea pig outside.

, Because guinea pigs are sensitive to extremes in temperature, watch your guinea pig when he is outside to make sure that he looks okay. If your guinea pig is starting to suffer from heatstroke, he may exhibit signs such as reluctance to move, weakness, and panting. If you notice any of these signs, bring your guinea pig inside immediately and contact your veterinarian.You can administer some first aid to your guinea pig before taking him to your veterinarian. Wet his ears, feet, and fur with cold water. Do not use a lot of cold water, because cooling his body temperature down too quickly and/or too much can also cause serious medical issues.On your way to your veterinarian’s office, keep your guinea pig on a cool, wet towel. Putting on the air conditioning (not too high) or keeping the windows down will also help to keep your guinea pig without lowering his body temperature too much."
"
Clean your guinea pigs’ cage at least once every week.,
Spot-clean the guinea pigs’ cage daily.,
Litter-train your guinea pigs.,
Use a cage cleaning spray.,
Use an odor control bedding.",How to Keep Your Guinea Pigs Smelling Good1," A complete cleaning involves discarding all of the used bedding, not merely ""spot cleaning"" the dirty spots. After removing the old bedding, wash the bottom and sides of the cage with soap and water, rinse thoroughly, then place fresh, new bedding in the cage.After washing with soap and water, you can use a 10% white vinegar and water solution (1 part vinegar to 9 parts water) as a rinse before drying the cage bottom. Using the vinegar solution once a week (each time you fully clean the cage) may help eliminate odors.;
, Particularly if you have multiple guinea pigs in one cage, you should clean out parts of the cage daily in addition to the once-a-week deep cleaning.To spot-clean, remove and discard any areas of soiled bedding at the end of the day.


Most guinea pigs will use one part of their cage as a toilet area; cleaning the toilet area daily will help with odor and cleanliness.

, Spot cleaning will become easier if you can train your guinea pigs to use a litter box. Identify the area that your guinea pigs tend to use as a toilet area. Then place a litter box made for small mammals in that corner of the cage.


To enable your guinea pigs to adjust to the new litter box, add soiled bedding that includes their fecal pellets to the litter box so that they understand that it is a toilet area.
If the guinea pigs use the litter box as a toilet, reward them with treats. If they change the area in which they use the toilet, try moving the litter box to the new area.
Clean out the litter box daily. Sprinkle some baking soda in the bottom of the clean litter box to help eliminate odors.
Never place clumping cat litter in a guinea pig's litter box. Guinea pig-safe bedding material is the most appropriate option.

, Cleaning sprays specifically formulated for small animal cages can help minimize cage odors. Check your local pet store for products that are safe and effective for guinea pigs.To use a cage-cleaning spray, remove all used bedding from the cage. Spray the tray of the cage liberally with the cage cleaner.
Allow the cage cleaner to soak in to the cage for 3-5 minutes.
Use a rough towel to wipe away cage cleaner and loosened debris from the bottom of the cage.
Allow the cage to dry completely (in the sun if possible), place fresh bedding in the bottom of the cage, and return your guinea pigs to their home.
You may want to continue using soap and water to clean the cage in addition to the cage cleaner.

, Bedding formulated to block odors, such as CareFRESH Advanced Odor Control Small Animal Bedding, can keep the cage smelling fresh longer.


Place 1-3 inches of bedding in the bottom of your guinea pigs' cage. Be sure to scoop out wet or soiled bedding daily.Though odor blocking bedding can make the guinea pigs’ cage smell better, you should still clean the cage well and completely replace the bedding at least once every week.

Avoid exercise wheels and balls.",How to Get Your Guinea Pig to Lose Weight," Guinea pigs are naturally on the larger side and chubby. They're constantly eating to keep their guts working and forever growing teeth filed down. If you want an accurate opinion on whether your guinea pig needs exercise, book an appointment with an exotic vet.

If you think you won't be able to see a vet, you can also get a second opinion from many guinea pig owners on an online cavy forum such as Guinea Pig Lynx which is a popular forum with helpful guinea pig experts on hand.
If your guinea pig lives outdoors in a colder climate, it will naturally try to gain weight to keep warm in the winter months. This is actually good for your guinea pigs health and comfort.;
, Stick to a correct dietary guide which can be found with research online. Guinea pigs should only have 1 cup of vegetables per day whilst hay should be kept unlimited. Pellets can be made available whenever, but consider cutting back if you're concerned about your pet's obesity. , Weigh your guinea pigs weekly and keep track of how much they have gained and how much they have lost. An average mature boar weighs about 900-1200 grams whilst an average mature sow weighs 700-900 grams. Boars are naturally 20-25% bigger than sows.Keeping track of your guinea pigs weight can also be handy to indicate any sudden weight loss which is a sign of illness. By detecting sickness early you lessen any serious risks.

, Floor time encourages your guinea pig to explore, exercise and mental stimulation. The smaller the cage the more important the floor time. You should introduce floor time more often to help your guinea pig to lose weight. A few hours of floor time a week should suffice, but the more the better.

However, avoid stressing your guinea pig out when it comes to introducing your guinea pig to a new area. Make sure all pets are locked away from the same room as your guinea pig and make sure your guinea pig cannot escape.
Your guinea pig may hide away when first being introduced to floor time. This is normal and the behavior is expected. She/he should soon get used to the concept of floor time with it primarily being a way for your guinea pig to run around and exercise.

, By incorporating obstacles inside of the cage it can help achieve more exercise from your guinea pigs. Add bricks/blocks for your guinea pig to hop onto in order to get to one area to another or some tunnels. Add toys that actually stimulate your guinea pig to play and use its energy.

However, avoid adding too many toys that crowd the cage. As much as toys are stimulating and can encourage exercise, they can also become discouraging obstacles. Your guinea pig needs room to run around too.
Only use toys and accessories specifically designed for use within a hamster or guinea pig cage. Many plastics contain harmful toxins such as BPA that make their way into your pig when ingested. Similarly, some products are painted with lead-based paints, another fatal substance when ingested.

, Commercial treats contain way too much sugar to be fed to guinea pigs and aren't beneficial at all. Vegetables are a healthier alternative., Fruit can, in some cases, be just as bad as commercial treats as they contain a lot of sugar. Guinea pigs don't need fruit in their diet, so you should avoid giving it to them. Vegetables, hay, and pellets are the only three things they require., Pellets can be a primary cause of weight gain in guinea pigs. Limit the amount you give them whilst still making sure they're getting enough. They do still need the vitamin C intake!, Sometimes obesity has to do with the cage size. If you have a small cage, or one stuffed with too many obstacles, it will limit your guinea pigs exercise space. Expand your cage to ensure you're preventing any weight gain from occurring again., These aren't designed for guinea pigs and can seriously harm their backs. Please restrain from using these at all costs as they don't benefit your guinea pig in any way.

Leashes and harnesses should also be avoided as guinea pigs have fragile necks and spines that shouldn't be tugged at.

Add a few toys.,
Provide a balanced diet.,
Introduce a new friend.,
Do not allow females to become pregnant.,
Play regularly with your pet.,
Find a veterinarian.,
Constantly check for injuries.,
Be on the look-out for worrying symptoms.",How to Help Your Guinea Pig Live a Long Life," Provide at least 10 square feet of living space for two guinea pigs. This space prevents conflicts between males, fighting between guinea pigs, and reduces the risks of bloat, obesity, and gas build-up by providing adequate room to exercise.


Test a few cages and look for one that you can clean easily. Can your hand enter the cage easily? Can you use a brush inside it?
Make sure that the cage is light enough to keep your guinea pig happy. The cage should also have a dark corner, or a mini-house, where your animal can hide or sleep when it doesn’t want to interact with the outside world. There should be one hide per guinea pig.
Place the cage in a room with stable temperature. Guinea pigs can't stand high temperatures, drops or increases.
Bed the floor of the cage with guinea-pig bedding bought at the pet shop. Change it regularly so your guinea pig doesn’t live in its own feces.;
, Food and water dispensers for guinea pigs are widely available online and in pet shops. Look for a sturdy model and make sure that it’s big enough to feed the number of animals you own. Place them in an accessible place.Give them something to chew on. Guinea pigs need to keep their teeth down. If you leave a piece of wood from an apple tree or any other orchard wood, your animal will be able to use its teeth safely.
You might not see your guinea pig drinking often. It’s perfectly normal as they also extract water from vegetable matter.
Don’t use anything else than orchard wood or a chewing threat from a pet-shop. Other types of wood can be toxic and could kill your pet.

, Guinea pigs are playful animal and welcome intellectual stimulation. You should be able to find ready-made toys, such as balls or tunnels, in most pet shops. You can also try to make your own. Here are a few ideas:


Try putting fruits and vegetables on a string and hang them from the cage.
Build a little cardboard house where your guinea pig can play.
Make an obstacle course with various objects. Just make sure that your guinea pig doesn’t eat the objects.

, The foundation of your guinea pig’s diet should be grass hay. It’s a good source of fibres and keeps teeth down. It’s important to let the animal have constant access to the grass hay and to other sources of food. Guinea pig food as sold in pet shops is heavily debated. Avoid food with large concentration of calcium, a potential cause of urinary infection. Also avoid muesliThere are several types of grass hay. You can find them in pet shops or at equestrian centers. Put the hay apart from the bedding. You don’t want your animal to eat and go to the toilets at the same place.
Fresh, preferably organic, well washed (you can use a commercial vegetable wash or water and vinegar mix, rinse well after) leafy greens are a treat for guinea pigs. These include green leaf lettuce, escarole, red leaf lettuce, cilantro, and curly endive. You can give a few strawberries and pieces of apple but don't exaggerate. Guinea pigs are prone to obesity!
Look for food enhanced with C, as Guinea pigs can't produce it themselves. They also need high levels of vitamin A, which can be found in carrots.Change the water daily to avoid bacterial infection.
Avoid potatoes, rhubarb, tomato leaves and flowers. They are poisonous to guinea pigs., Guinea pigs are very sociable and will love company. Keep guinea pigs of the same sex or already spayed/neutered pairs. Guinea pigs are social animals but they aren’t above fights.


Introduce a new guinea pig slowly. If you find that your guinea pigs are fighting, separate them with a wire shelf, which allows them to see and smell each other, but prevents them from fighting.

, Pregnancy and especially birthing is hard on females. One in five females that is bred will die as a result of complications during pregnancy or birth, or as a result of toxaemia after birth.


If you wish to have baby guinea pigs, make sure to talk with your veterinary surgeon beforehand. You should have room for the babies and enough money to feed them in the future.

, Guinea pigs love action and will welcome a good playing session with you. Making them run is a good way to keep them fit and intellectually stimulated. There are a few things to look for:


If you take them in the garden, make sure that they cannot escape. Also make sure that there is no predator such as cats.
Let your guinea pig eat a bit of grass outside. It's very good for them but don't let them eat too much at first. Rich grass might trigger diarrhea.
Make sure that the temperature is right. It should be between 60-70°F or 15-21°C.
Don’t forget to wash your hands after playing to avoid bacteria contamination.

, Don’t wait for a problem to happen to bring your guinea pig to a specialist. These tiny animals require a regular check-up to detect potential health issues.


Most veterinarians will take care of your pet but a few specialise only in guinea pigs. Look for them on the internet or in the phone book.
Bring your guinea pig for a check-up at least twice a year.
Your veterinarian will probably recommend to neuter your male guinea pig during the first visit. This might cost a bit of money but will make your guinea pig quieter and happier in an enclosed environment.The veterinarian will also treat the animal for external and internal parasites such as worms.

, Older guinea pigs sometimes have feet wounds. If this happens, see a veterinary surgeon and get softer bedding or spread out a soft cloth at the bottom of the cage. Observe your guinea pig actions. If anything seems wrong, don't take too long to act. A small infection can be lethal.Don’t forget to cut the nails of your guinea pigs as they might be a cause of injury. Remember to be gentle.
Don't give them medicine unless prescribed by a veterinarian. You might kill your guinea pig.

, If you notice crusty or swollen eyes, dandruff, inflamed ears or nose or irregular breathing, call immediately your veterinarian. You should also bring your guinea pig if it’s behaving erratically or if you notice anything uncommon.Check their front teeth. Only veterinarians should take care of overgrown teeth.
Their life expectancy can vary a lot. They can live between four and eight years.
If you notice something unusual, separate your guinea pig immediately. You don’t want to spread a contagious disease.
Weight your animals regularly to monitor their health. This will tell you if they are well and if you are feeding them enough or too much. An adult guinea pig should weight around 700 to 1200 grams.
If your animal smells bad, go to the veterinarian. Guinea pigs are clean animals and shouldn’t be washed, except if they are really dirty.

Choose a safe, snug harness.,
Opt for a lightweight cord or leash.,
Favor indoor walks.,
Walk your hamster slowly.,
Do not abuse your hamster.,
Use treats to motivate your hamster.,
Keep walks short.",How to Walk Your Hamster1," There are plenty of small animal harnesses available at your local pet store or online. It may be worth visiting the store first to familiarize yourself with the different options and sizes that are available. You’ll likely need the smallest harness you can find, as animals the size of hamsters are not commonly walked.Go with a harness that fits snugly, without impeding the hamster's breathing or movement.
Velcro is the best type of clasping mechanism. Velcro is secure enough to contain even the strongest of hamsters and is much safer than buckles or other clasping mechanisms.
Never use a collar on a hamster.;
, Most leashes that are made for walking a pet are dangerously heavy for use with hamsters. Many also have heavy clasps at the end that will also endanger your hamster. Unless you can find an extremely light leash with a simple, light clasp, opt for a simple cord instead. Para/Military cord or “paracord” is perfect, as its light and strong.Simply tie the cord to your hamster’s harness.
Never tie a cord or anything else directly around your hamster’s neck.

, Walks outside will vastly increase the risks your hamster faces. Other people’s pets and many types of birds will likely attempt to kill your hamster. Further, since hamsters are so small and fragile, they could easily be accidentally injured by someone who doesn’t see it.The best place to walk your hamster is in a sparsely populated, well-confined area, like a hallway.
If you do walk them outdoors, stay away from areas where other pets might be walked, such as sidewalks. A lap around your yard is probably safest and will be quite the adventure for your hamster.

, Your hamster’s walking pace is much, much slower than your own. While hamsters can quickly dart around for short distances, it will not be able to keep a steady pace with you at your regular walking speed. According, walk very slowly beside your hamster. Moving too quickly also increases the chances that you will accidently injure your hamster., Hamsters are extremely light creatures. Never jerk, yank, or pull too heavily on the leash. Do not attempt to drag your hamster along if they don’t want to proceed with a walk. Finally, do not swing the hamster around in its harness. Though it looks fun, this terrifying for your hamster and risks breaking its neck and back., While formal training is an unproven practice in hamster rearing, treats can definitely help keep your hamster walking. Positively reinforce the behavior you want the hamster to continue by giving them treats. This will let them know they should keep walking, for instance.Opt for healthy treats. Favor celery, carrots, apples, or broccoli.
Avoid pitted or citrus fruits and spinach.
Do not feed your hamster more than a bouncy-ball-sized portion of greens per day.

, Think about the size of a hamster step versus one of your own steps. They’re taking dozens of steps for each step you take! Accordingly, keep walks short. Further, let your hamster rest whenever they wish to stop walking. If they simple stop, conclude the walk by picking up your hamster and returning them to their enclosure.Bring your hamster’s water bottle with you on walks. Make it available to them whenever they stop by holding it for them to drink from.
While wild hamsters get most of their water from fruits and veggies, your hamster is likely used to drinking from a bottle.

Bathe your guinea pigs only as needed to keep them clean.,
Use an appropriate shampoo.,
Check your guinea pigs’ ears.,
Provide your guinea pigs with a long-stemmed fiber like timothy hay.,
Avoid feeding your guinea pigs improper foods.",How to Keep Your Guinea Pigs Smelling Good2," Most guinea pigs should be able to keep themselves clean, but some long-haired guinea pigs may need to be bathed more often.Bathing guinea pigs may increase their risks to becoming ill, as they become chilled easily. Minimize this risk by keeping guinea pigs in warm towels until their fur is completely dry.Attentive grooming and brushing can minimize your need to fully bathe your long-haired guinea pig. You can brush your guinea pig with a soft-bristled baby brush. You may also want to trim the hair around long-haired guinea pigs’ bottoms to minimize how dirty the hair gets while the pigs use the toilet.If you feel that your guinea pig needs frequent baths, talk to your vet about weighing the risks of frequent bathing against the benefits of a cleaner guinea pig.

, Be sure to use only shampoo that is specifically labeled as safe for guinea pigs.Avoid using human shampoo or dish detergent, as these may be too harsh and can cause skin irritation.


Some specific shampoos that are safe to use are Scentsations Premium Small Animal Shampoo and Posh ‘n Go Protein Shampoo., Guinea pigs produce a gray colored earwax that should be mostly odor free. If your guinea pigs’ ears smell bad or are red, schedule an exam with your veterinarian; they may have ear infections.

, Guinea pigs need the hay to keep their teeth ground down and keep their digestive tracts in balance.Adding mint, dandelion greens, parsley, or cilantro to the hay may help the cage smell fresh and will continue to provide the guinea pigs with a healthy diet.

, Some foods give guinea pigs gas and upset their stomachs. Some specific foods to avoid include iceberg lettuce, broccoli and Brussels sprouts.


Some good snack substitutes to offer are kiwifruit, orange slices, and bell peppers.All of these are high in Vitamin C, which guinea pigs need to thrive. Leafy greens such as kale, parsley, romaine lettuce, and turnip greens are also great options.

Weigh the risk of walking.,
Get a hamster ball!,
Place toys inside your hamster’s enclosure.",How to Walk Your Hamster2," Even with a properly fitting harness and lightweight leash, hamsters can very easily be injured during a walk together. Hamsters are extremely light and fragile. You may simply accidentally pull too hard or move your hand without thinking and seriously injure your hamster. Furthermore, you cannot control the environment outside of your home. Even in a seemingly safe hallway, a dog might unexpectedly appear and make quick work of your pet.You may even accidentally step on your hamster during a walk. A hamster may unknowingly scurry right beneath your foot before you put your weight down.
Outside, there are innumerable dangers to your hamster. You may come across a predatory bird who will never get an easier meal if it decides to attack.
Further, your hamster may put themselves at risk by eating something dangerous off of the ground.

, Hamsters can safely and easily roll around in a hamster ball. Hamster balls are quite literally designed to allow your hamster to safely roam outside of their cage. You can use a hamster ball inside, or in a protected outside area like a patio. Only allow your hamster to run in its ball on carpeted ground, as they may roll dangerously quickly on harder ground.Never leave your hamster in its ball for more than twenty minutes. Only put your hamster in a ball once a day.
Always monitor your hamster when it’s in a hamster ball. Keep other pets away from the hamster ball.

, Your hamster will get plenty of exercise inside its cage. To get them running around, provide your hamster with toys. Aside from running, hamsters also love to climb and chew. Choose climbing structures and chew toys meant for hamsters from your local pet store or online.A hamster wheel is a great mandatory feature for your hamster cage, providing both amusement and exercise.
Many climbing structures will have similar moving features that will safely entertain your hamster for hours on end.

Take time to bond with your guinea pig.",How to Introduce Your Guinea Pig to Floor Time," The purpose of floor time is to provide your guinea pig with exercise, fun and a time to explore new objects and toys all in one. Floor time is also beneficial to your guinea pig's mental health, as it gives them a special time to interact with new objects.


Floor time is an increasingly popular and effective method to keep guinea pigs fit and encourage them to exercise. During floor time, your guinea pig is promoted to move around more and manoeuvre their body to get through obstacles.
Floor time also allows you to play and bond with your guinea pig. The open space allows the both of you to interact better and connect with each other.
During floor time, the purpose is to provide your guinea pig with plenty of toys, huts, tunnels and obstacles to explore and play with on the open floor. This is something your guinea pig probably wouldn't be able to do just as well in their confined cage.;
, It might seem odd reading about floor time as an exercise method and then seeing your guinea pig inactively huddle in the corner of the room. This is normal and every guinea pig starts out like this. The new surroundings takes a toll; your guinea pig will need some time getting use to the concept of floor time just as much as you do.


The open space will scare your guinea pig at first. You can help ease your guinea pig by providing an adequate amount of hidies (or pigloos).

, Floor time should be a weekly activity for you and your guinea pig. However, the smaller the cage your guinea pig lives in, the more floor time you should introduce. A guinea pig can live comfortably in a smaller cage if they get plenty of floor time; which allows them to get the proper exercise and stimulation they need.


Make a schedule of how many days a week, when and for how long you want your floor time to be. Such as every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday for an hour of floor time. Guinea pigs thrive on consistency and schedules., Considering that you will be using an open floor space, setting up a border will help construct a safer and more secure enviroment to play in. However, this is an optional decision. If you are not worried about your guinea pig wondering off around the room then skip this step.


A border should be assembled if your room isn't safe or secure for your cavy to roam around in.
C & C cubes are a cheap and easy material you could use to make a DIY play pen for your guinea pigs.

, There are no limits on where you can go to introduce floor time. Consider arranging floor time directly outside of your guinea pigs cage. This assures that you don't have to go through the hassle of transporting your guinea pig from one room to another.


Of course, some rooms are safer than others. Don't hold back from choosing a safer and more secure room over a room of which is closer to your guinea pig's cage.
No room is off limits. If you feel that a kitchen or bathroom would be a safer place to hold floor time then go ahead! However, take into account of the tiles during the colder months.
Try to select a room that has low traffic where you and your guinea pig are less likely to be disturbed. On top of that, it is suggested to choose a room that is well-lit and well-ventilated (but no drafts)., It is important to ensure that the room you choose for floor time is safe and secure for your guinea pig to play and roam around in. It is your duty to provide a safe environment for your guinea pig. This includes;


Packing away wires sprawled around the room. You can temporarily put these into a box secured away from your guinea pig or put them up somewhere. If your guinea pig chews into the wire it will cause an electric shock. This includes phone chargers too.
Blocking off areas where your guinea pig shouldn't go. Guinea pigs are notorious for getting into places where they shouldn't be. Usually out of fright they will scamper to the first hiding spot they see, which could be anything from under a large wardrobe to hiding behind a sofa. You can block these off with something as simple as a flattened, cardboard box.
Removing pets from the room. Other animals, such as dogs or cats, are seen as predators to guinea pigs. If you have both animals in the same room, your guinea pig might feel threatened and therefore discouraged to come out and play.
Closing the door to the room.
Remove any house plants that are poisonous to your guinea pig. If unsure about a specific plant; remove it. Don't put your guinea pig at risk.

, Fleece is highly recommended to lay down before you start floor time with your guinea pigs. The material should pick up all the droppings and urine; making clean-up easier and quicker for you.


Puppy pads can be expensive whilst fleece is reusable. It would be much more convenient opting for fleece instead.

, Toys are the fun part of floor time. You can place as many toys as you would like, as the space is unlimited. However, do not get sucked into thinking that any toy is safe for your guinea pig. There are a few toys that should be steered away from.


Exercise wheels and balls are a big no! These objects are commonly targeted for guinea pigs in pet shops, when they aren't actually any good. Unlike mice and hamsters, guinea pigs do not possess a flexible spine. Using these balls/wheels on your guinea pig will result in harming their back.
Check for splintering wood. Before you add a wooden toy to the floor time area, examine the wood to check for splinters or splintering which can harm your guinea pig when/if they chew it.
Avoid wire treat toys. Guinea pigs are known to get their head stuck in these. Go for a safer alternative such as a plastic ball treat dispenser.

, When you first introduce your guinea pig to play time, it is common that they feel frightened and may want to hide away. Huts aren't only a great object for your guinea pig to explore, but they serve the purpose of providing a safe place for your guinea pig to retreat to when scared, thus reducing stress levels.

, Guinea pigs are burrowing animals in the wild; they love hiding in tunnels and climbing ramps! You can purchase a safe tunnel from a pet shop or recycle a cardboard tube. Ramps can be made out of almost anything.

, With obstacles, your guinea pig is promoted to do more exercise and manoeuvre around the objects. Obstacles can be anything from toys to tunnels and ramps. Anything lying around the house (and is of course pet-safe) can be used as an obstacle such as blocks, wood, logs, pillows, etc.


You could even construct a maze with the obstacles.

, During floor time, guinea pigs should still be allowed to have access to food whenever they would like. Add a bundle of hay, some plain pellets, water and vegetables.


A water bottle is preferred during playtime to reduce leakage and mess.
It isn't important to provide your guinea pigs with vegetables or pellets during floor time. However, they should continue to have access to fresh water and hay.

, Hay can become a fun toy for your guinea pigs too - place a compacted bundle in the centre of the floor and watch your guinea pigs explore and walk around in it. Alternatively you can collect a bundle of untreated, fresh grass and place it in the centre of the floor. Guinea pigs love grass just as much as they love hay.

, During floor time, it is important that you have full supervision of your guinea pigs whilst they are playing and exploring. Something can easily go wrong in an unconfined, open space where there is no supervision.


Use your time up effectively and wisely. Bond with your guinea pigs. Talk to them or even play with them.

, It's understandable that your guinea pig might be shy at first with the new space and surroundings of floor time. You can try your best to encourage your guinea pig to walk around and explore through the use of treats. Guinea pigs love fresh vegetables, or consider a forage mix.


Fruits make a great alternative to commercial treats which are far too sugary. Fruits are just as sweet but contain less sugar and preservatives.

, Floor time should be a special time for not just your guinea pig but you as well. In the space you are provided you should use your time up effectively. Socialise and play with your guinea pig. Be in the space with them and explore each object along their side.

Take this opportunity to clean the cage.",How to Supervise Hamsters Outside of the Cage1," Hamsters are really fast and are often hard to catch, so be sure you have a good grip on it before you lift it out of its cage. Move the hamster quickly to the area where you want it to spend its time out of its cage.


When handling hamsters, don’t be shocked (and don’t drop them) if they nibble or bite you.;
, While you have the hamster out of its cage, you need to make sure that the hamster does not run off. If your hamster is trying to explore areas outside of the area you have established for it, then you will need to pick it up and put it back in its pen.


Keep the hamster out of harm's way by nudging it out of areas it shouldn't be in and directing it towards toys or snacks that you have supplied.

, Place some toys and treats around the area for the hamster to play with. This will make the time more exciting for the hamster, and it will give them more exercise.


You can place a variety of items in the hamster's area. In addition to giving it store bought toys, you can try giving it paper tubes to tunnel through.

, Many dogs or cats would love to get a hamster as a small treat. With this in mind, keep all pets out of the room when you take your hamster out of its cage.Even if your other pet doesn't want to eat your hamster, its presence can scare the hamster. This in turn can cause the hamster to run away, bite you out of fear, or go into shock.

, While you have your pet out of its cage, you should never leave it alone. Keep an eye on it constantly, as a hamster can run away and hide very, very quickly.Even if your hamster is in a ball, you should keep an eye on it. A hamster in a ball can get into areas it shouldn't and can get injured if it accidentally rolls down an incline or down stairs.

, While your hamster is out of its cage, take the time to clean its cage thoroughly. Throw all the soiled bedding away, clean all surfaces, and then replace the bedding.You will need another person to supervise the hamster while you do this task.

However, you should give some consideration to the type of cage you choose as this will be the primary habitat for your new pet. Some cages are better than others, and certain cage designs may be downright unsafe for hamsters.Wire siding allows hamsters to climb up the walls, which can help satisfy their curiosity and burn off some energy.
Consider getting a multi-level cage. That way your hamster can have more room to explore and play.
If there are any gaps in the bars, your hamster could get stuck.
A cage with a deep plastic base will allow your hamster to burrow and roam. Aim for a large cage with a base that's at least 1 to 2 inches (3 to 5 centimeters) deep.
Make sure there are no hazards, like sharp edges or bits of metal that might poke your hamster.;
, Your hamster will need a small shelter or nesting box within its cage. This structure is to allow your pet a place to hide when it wants to sleep or anytime it feels frightened.The shelter or nesting box should be big enough for your hamster to move around inside with relative ease.
Your hamster should also have enough room to store some food inside the shelter.
Make sure the shelter is dark inside. Your hamster should be able to retreat inside and feel safe and protected.

, In the wild, hamsters live in warm, dry climates, so they'll need a similar atmosphere in your home. Try to create as conducive a habitat as possible that will allow your hamster to be comfortable and safe.Make sure the room where you keep your hamster is free from drafts. Keep the cage away from any open windows or air conditioning vents.
Make sure the environment is as dry and free from humidity as possible.

, Hamsters are sensitive to bright lights, but they can't live in total darkness. The idea for a hamster would be to have limited exposure to ambient light during the day and total darkness at night.Avoid putting the cage in direct sunlight, though ambient sunlight in the room is okay.
Try to keep the lights in your home on a regular schedule so that your hamster can be in the dark around the same time every night. This will help your hamster stay on a regular schedule.

, Hamsters need a complete, balanced diet in order to remain healthy and active. They typically need a somewhat broad variety of foods, including seeds, fruits, and vegetables. Some hamster owners also give their pets occasional forms of protein like insects to supplement their diet.If using pellet food, choose a product with 18 to 22 percent protein content. You should be able to find this information on the packaging.
Some hamsters prefer seed mixes instead of pellets. If using a seed mix, make sure the mix contains a variety of other foods like dried fruits/vegetables and a limited quantity of sunflower seeds.

, In addition to food, your hamster will need a steady supply of fresh, cool drinking water. You can use a water dish, but this is likely to spill. A water bottle is ideal for most hamster cages, but make sure you get the right kind for a hamster.Choose a water bottle with a sipper tube that does not have a valve. Hamsters cannot create suction very well, and consequently, they may struggle with a ball-valve bottle design.

, Hamsters need a comfortable substrate in their cages. The bedding material you choose should be clean, absorbent, and safe for hamsters. Avoid any materials that produce a lot of dust.Good bedding material choices include hardwood shavings, corncob litter, or shredded white paper or facial tissues.
Make sure your hamster's bedding is deep enough that it can dig and burrow through it. Aim for a depth of at least two inches of bedding spread uniformly across the cage.

, Hamsters tend to cycle between periods of inactivity and periods of high energy. They'll need toys that allow them to exercise and explore, as well as chewable objects to help keep their teeth trimmed.A hamster wheel with a solid floor and an exercise ball are both excellent choices for hamsters.
Look for hamster toys that involve tunnels and/or tubes, as hamsters enjoy burrowing and exploring.
Give your hamster things to chew on like blocks of untreated wood or fresh, pesticide-free tree branches.

, If at all possible, try to use the same food and accessories that your hamster used in its previous home. This can make the transition a little smoother for your new pet, as it will still have familiar things in its environment.Do not use the same food if it is not nutritious. Likewise, avoid using the same accessories if they are unsafe or otherwise not ideal for a hamster's environment.

, One way to help ease the transition into your home is to cover the cage for the first one to two days. This allows the hamster to adjust to its new cage in a calm, relatively dark environment.If you decide to cover the cage, choose a light cloth that breathes well. Something made of mesh or a loosely-knit cotton should work well.
Do not keep the cage covered indefinitely. Your hamster should only need a day or two to adjust.

, If your hamster is still adjusting to your home, it may not be ready to be handled. Some experts recommend waiting at least a few days before attempting to pet or handle your hamster. You may need to wait even longer before allowing other visitors to handle the hamster, as they're even less familiar to your new pet., Before you take home any pet, you should check to see that it is healthy and in good care. Some hamsters (like any other pet) are raised in inhumane conditions that cause health problems and other issues.Some warning signs to look for include:


listless behavior
tilted head
poor balance
scabs on the ears, face, or feet
sneezing or a runny nose
watery eyes
diarrhea

, There are several different types of hamsters that are commercially available. Which breed you choose will depend on your needs and your desired personality traits.Common hamster species include:


Syrian hamsters - these hamsters are slightly larger than many other breeds, and they are smart enough to learn some simple tricks. They tend to be somewhat approachable and easy-going when it comes to handling and being played with.
Campbells dwarf hamsters - this breed of hamster is quite fast and can easily slip away if you're not careful. They are rather friendly, especially when handled from an early age.
Roborovski dwarf hamsters - these hamsters are very low maintenance and are very friendly. Of all the hamster breeds, Roborovski dwarf hamsters are the least-likely to bite.

, Before you take home your new hamster, you should arrange for your pet to see a veterinarian. Many hamsters are raised in poor conditions before they're adopted, while even healthy hamsters are susceptible to infections and diseases.Hamsters are often prone to abscesses in their cheeks, which can quickly lead to infection.
Any change in appearance or activity should prompt a visit to your vet.
Schedule regular checkups to ensure that your hamster remains happy and healthy.

Pick a spot on the ground.,
Consider using a hamster ball.,
Pen off an area.",How to Supervise Hamsters Outside of the Cage2," Don't place your hamster on a high surface when you are letting it out of its cage. Often the hamster will be scared when you take it out of its cage, and its first instinct may be to run away. If your hamster gets free from you, it could run and fall off a high surface, injuring or even killing it.When you have a hamster on the ground, it may still try to run away but it will not injure itself when it does.

, Hamsters often move much quicker than you and this can make them hard to catch. Some owners use hamster balls as a solution to this problem. You can put your hamster in one of these balls and let it roam around a large area without the risk that it will hide away and get lost.Since a hamster will not have food or water while it is in a ball, only keep it in the ball for about 15 minutes at a time.

, In order to have your hamster out of its cage safely, you should pen off an area for it to be in. Define the area by putting up barriers that the hamster cannot easily cross, such as stacks of books, boxes, or other solid barriers.


You can use a box as a play pen if you like. A large box will give the hamster room to run around in and explore, but it will keep the animal contained.

"
Make sure any exposed outlets are covered up and cords are removed.,
Tell everyone in your home that the hamster is out.,
Be cautious about any gaps in the walls or doors.,
Be sure to remove items from reach.",How to Supervise Hamsters Outside of the Cage3," Hamsters have a tendency to chew on almost everything around them. If the holes are exposed or a wire is hanging out, your hamster may chew on it and get electrocuted.In order to protect your hamster from the dangers of electrical outlets, put child-proofing covers on outlets that are in the area you are keeping your hamster in.

, A common mistake owners can make is to forget to notify others that the rodent is out of its cage. This means that someone may open a door and allow the hamster to run away accidentally. They may even open the door and accidentally step on it.

, Closed doors don't always keep hamsters inside. Be sure to keep a blanket stuffed under any tight spaces, since hamsters have a tendency to try to escape.


Never give your hamster access to cracks or holes. Sense they love to escape and explore, they will run towards these places. If they get into tight spaces they are likely to get trapped, injured, or lost.

, Hamsters will go to the bathroom and chew on anything they come into contact with. If you are letting your hamster out of its cage, it is safer to remove things, such as sofas or rugs, you wouldn't want to get ruined. Pick up all clothing and other items that might be spoiled as well.


Hamsters love chewing on wooden items, so it is best to remove any you may have lying around.

Determine your hamsters gender and breed.,
Try not to use popular names such as 'Hammy'.,
Observe it's behavior.,
Don't make its name longer than 3 syllables.,
If you have more than one hamster, make sure that their names aren't that similar.,
If you have problem choosing, try a book of baby names that will help you try to discover what would suit your hamster best.

,
Find adjectives to describe your hamster.,
Name it after someone you like.,
After you decided a name, call your hamster by name with a treat.",How to Name Your Hamster,";
, Come up with something new.

, If it likes to stuff things in its cheeks, name it, for example, 'Cheeks'.

, It can get annoying to say the long name every time you refer to your hamster!

, Tic and Tac are fine. Tic and Tick are not.

,, Try saying them until you find one you like. (Ex. Fluffy, Fuzzy, Tiny, Chubby, Bony)

, For example, if you like books by Charles Dickens, name him Charley.

, If it comes to you multiple times for the treat, wash your hands and try it without a treat. If your hamster likes his or her name it will come for the treat then eventually come without one. Some suggestions for male names can come with personalities such as munchkin, Caramel, Dash, Licorice, Spice, Cheddar or if he's really smart you can name it Einstein.

Try to make toys as much as possible.,
Don't buy the plastic platform, unless it comes with the cage.,
Skip the expensive chew toys.,
Put that hideout back on the shelf!,
Be creative.",How to Save Money when Having a Hamster," A simple toilet roll inner cardboard tube is just as good as any commercial toy, maybe even better as the hamster can chew on them, which helps their teeth. If you want, cut a hole in one toilet paper tube, and stuff the other one in that hole to create a maze of tunnels.
, Use one of those cardboard flaps in a box. Just cut it out, and slide it through the bars if you have a wire cage. If not, use non-toxic glue to secure it. If you want the platform to be more secure, glue together two cardboard pieces., A simple stick from an apple tree will be just as good. Wash it, and if you want to, boil it. If there's any lichen on it, don't use it. Bake the stick. Place it on a cookie sheet or tinfoil, and bake it for an hour at 150-200 degrees. If you don't want to do that, just use one of those play blocks that are intended for babies., Paper cups, paper plates, or paper bowls will be just as good. Paper bowls are especially good as your hamster still has room to turn around and move a little while in its hideout., You can use any non-toxic suitably sized toys, or make your own toys out of cardboard, paper cups, wire, and non-toxic glue. If you want, make a small obstacle course by hanging hamster-safe materials from wire!"

Meet your hamster’s basic needs.,
Provide your hamster with a large cage.,
Outfit your hamster enclosure with all of the necessary trappings.,
Put the cage in a quiet room.,
Get your hamster a wheel.,
Setup a tube system in your cage, if you have space.,
Provide a variety of other hamster toys.,
Handle your hamster often.,
Handle your hamster carefully.,
Allow your hamster to run around a secure location.,
Setup a play date for your hamster.",How to Make Your Hamster Happy," The foundation of a happy hamster is a hamster whose basic needs are met. Without basic needs like food, healthcare, and a good home, your hamster will not be happy. Make sure to:


Provide good and fresh food. Consider making your own fresh hamster food out of leafy greens, carrots, and other vegetables.
Take your hamster to the vet if he or she is ill.
Make sure your hamster’s cage is located in a space that is heated, cooled, and has a constant temperature. An optimal temperature for hamsters range between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Avoid temperatures below 60 and above 90 degrees.;
, Since your hamster will spend most of his or her life in your cage or container, make sure that the cage is spacious enough so your hamster can move around, exercise, and explore as much as he or she wants. Ultimately, if you coup your hamster up in a tiny enclosure, he or she won’t be happy.


Your cage should be a minimum of 2 square feet. Ultimately, though, an enclosure twice this size would be good.
Avoid small glass aquariums.
The more hamsters you have co-habituating, the larger your enclosure should be. , Ultimately, a happy hamster needs a happy and interesting environment. If your hamster is wanting for basic items, he or she will not be happy. Make sure to include:


Wood shavings or a similar substance to blanket the floor of the cage. Hamsters like to burrow, so make sure there are some areas where the shavings are deep. Avoid cedar or pine wood shavings, as they might be toxic to hamsters.
Soft bedding. Make sure there are a couple of areas where you provide your hamster with soft bedding. This could be an old towel, part of an old t-shirt or something similar.
A water bottle.
A food dish., Make sure to put your hamster’s cage in a safe and quiet area. Hamsters, like people or other animals, need a safe and quiet area so they can live without anxiety or danger. Make finding a safe and quiet area a priority.


Avoid putting your hamster in a place like the kitchen or a family room. A place where the TV is constantly running or people are talking may disturb your hamster and make him or her irritable.
Avoid putting your hamster in a place where the family dog or cat can get next to or near the cage. Your cat or dog might stop at nothing to get to your little friend.
Avoid putting your hamster where small children can access the cage without supervision. The big danger here is that a small child will allow the hamster to escape., Hamster wheels are one of the most popular toys that people get for their hamsters to play with. The best thing about hamster wheels is that it not only provides your hamster with entertainment, but it will also help your hamster exercise and keep fit.


Provide one hamster wheel per hamster.
Make sure your hamster wheel is the appropriate size for your hamster. As there are different varieties of hamsters, you will want to make sure your hamster does not have a wheel that is too large or too small.
Make sure your hamster wheel is properly maintained. Take it out of the cage from time to time. Clean it and service it. If your wheel is rusty, discard it and purchase a new one., One great way to promote hamster happiness is to setup a hamster tube system in your hamster’s cage. A hamster tube system will provide a lot of opportunity for your hamster to play and explore new areas. This will stimulate your hamster’s brain and keep him or her active.


Provide an appropriate sized tube system for your cage. Don’t take up the majority of the space with a tube system. You need to leave plenty of room for a hamster wheel, other toys, and more.
Change the tube system around every so often. Provide your little friend with opportunities to explore new areas by changing the tube system around.
Try to make it so there are cozy places to rest and sleep in the tube system. , While a hamster wheel and a tube system will provide a lot of fun, entertainment, and exercise for your hamster, you should also consider a number of other hamster toys. A variety of toys will keep your hamster busy and entertained. Consider:


Cardboard boxes. Boxes are a great place for your friend to hide or play in. Consider constructing a two story hamster house out of tissue boxes.
Popsicle sticks. You can fashion a number of hamster toys, like ladders for them to climb, and bridges for them to cross, out of popsicle sticks.
Empty toilet paper rolls. These are great for your hamster to crawl through or for them to chew., While many hamsters (like Syrians) are solitary animals, they do like companionship, too. Provide your hamster a friend (in yourself) and handle your hamster every couple of days.


Handling your hamster often does not have to be a strenuous activity. You can do this simply by holding your hamster gently, allowing him or her to rest in your hand, or allowing them to crawl all over you.
Make sure to handle your hamster every day or two. Neglecting your hamster will hurt his or her socialization and affect his or her happiness.
If there are days you are unable to handle your hamster, recruit a friend or family member to fill in for you.

, When handling your hamster, you need to be gentle and handle your friend with care. Being rough with your hamster could injure your friend or cause him or her to be wary of interaction with humans.


Do not be rough.
Do not handle your hamster in a place where you might drop him or her. Hamsters are very fragile animals and you can easily hurt or kill your friend.
Start handling your hamster by introducing your scent to it by putting your hand in his or her cage and cleaning or repositioning toys.
Move on to petting your hamster without picking him or her up.
When your hamster seems comfortable and does not run away from you, pick him or her up.
Always wash your hands before and after you handle your hamster., Your hamster will probably enjoy getting out of his or her cage every so often and explore new places. If you’re careful, this can be a fun activity for you and your friend. However, consider:


Make sure you secure a location in advance so your friend can’t escape. Pay specific attention to making sure your hamster can’t slip under a door, into a vent, or any other opening in the room.
Remove all other animals from the room.
Remove all poisons or anything that could hurt your little friend.
Don’t leave your friend unattended and watch him or her at all times.
Note that your hamster might pee or poop in the room. Be prepared to clean it up. , While your hamster might enjoy interacting with you, he or she will probably also enjoy playing with other hamsters. Even if you have two or three of your own, you might consider finding someone else who has hamsters and setting up a play date so the hamsters can play together. Consider:


Make sure they play in a neutral location. A good place might be an old and unused cage that is big enough for everyone to play in. Make sure to put toys in the cage.
Talk to the owner of the other hamster about health issues. You don’t want your hamster playing with another hamster who might be sick or contagious.
If you have a Syrian hamster, don’t set up a play date. Syrians are very territorial.
Never leave your hamster unattended with a new hamster.
Female hamsters may be more aggressive than males. As a result, you should be careful when allowing females to interact with each other."
"
Talk to him softly.,
Offer him a treat.,
Blow in his face.,
Avoid poking him.,
Move slowly.",How to Wake up Your Hamster Without Scaring It1," Try waking your hamster with the sound of your voice. Go near his cage and begin speaking softly. You may even try humming or singing until he is awake., Another way to rouse your hamster is to offer him a treat. Try holding a treat out where he is sleeping (close enough for him to smell it) and allow this to draw him from his sleep.You may use a small piece of a vegetable (like carrot or broccoli), or a store-bought hamster treat.

, If your hamster is sleeping out in the open, another option is to gently blow in his face. Of course, you do not want to startle your hamster, so begin with a mellow release of air, and increase in intensity until your hamster begins to wake., Whatever you do, avoid jabbing or poking at your hamster. This is not an effective way to wake him up because he will immediately become defensive. If he is roused in this way, he will not want to be held or to play.

, Remember, the point is to wake him without scaring him, so avoid swift or jarring movements. Instead, whenever you approach your sleeping hamster, move slowly. This allows him to wake gently and in a good mood."
"
Make the room dark.,
Change the temperature.,
Jiggle his food bowl.,
Lift up his hut.,
Tap lightly on his cage.",How to Wake up Your Hamster Without Scaring It2," Hamsters begin to wake up and move around at dusk and dawn (or twilight). Thus, you may be able to wake your hamster by dimming the lights in your room. If you can make it dark enough, your hamster should rouse in response to the change in light., Another idea is to alter the temperature of your hamster’s environment. Hamsters sleep more when it is cold, and wake when it is warm. You can try warming up the whole room (by turning up your heat or using a space heater), or warming only your hamster’s cage (by using a heat lamp or heating pad)., You can appeal to you hamster’s sense of hearing and desire for food at the same time by reaching into his cage and jiggling his food bowl. Place a little bit of fresh food into his dish and move it around (making a subtle noise) until he wakes., Often hamsters will sleep inside of a hut (or enclosure) within the cage. One method for rousing your hamster is to simply lift up his hut. You may to choose to lift up the hut and move it to another location in the cage (exposing the hamster), or simply lift it up and put back down (which may rustle him enough to wake him up).

, You can use soft noises in conjunction with vibration by tapping lightly on your hamster’s cage. Using your finger, gently rap on his cage (near where he is sleeping) until your hamster is awake."
"
Understand that hamsters are “crepuscular.” Hamsters are commonly (though mistakenly) called “nocturnal,” when in fact they are “crepuscular.” Whereas nocturnal animals are most active at night, your hamster will be most active during twilight hours (dusk and dawn).,
Track your hamster’s schedule.,
Feed him at the same time each day.,
Begin moving your feeding time back.,
Be patient.",How to Wake up Your Hamster Without Scaring It3," Understanding this about your hamster will help you better understand and cope with his sleep patterns., If you would like to train you hamster to wake up a bit earlier (so that you can spend time with him), the first step is to track his schedule. Spend 3-5 days writing down precisely when he is asleep and awake. , Once you know your hamster’s schedule (specifically what time he wakes in the evening), begin feeding him at this time each day. For example, if your hamster wakes each night at 8:30pm, begin feeding him at 8:30 on the dot. Do this for at least one week before moving on to the next step., Begin moving the feeding time back in 15-minute increments. For example, after the first week, you’ll begin waking your hamster up a bit earlier by feeding him at 8:15pm. Continue this until he begins waking at 8:15 on his own (this should take about one week). Then, begin feeding your hamster at 8:00pm, and so on., This technique needs to be done subtly, over time, in order for it to work. So be patient through this process. Once again, understand that it is your hamster’s innate nature that causes him to wake at dusk and dawn. You are not going to alter that overnight. Furthermore, you’re never going to change it completely. At best, you may be able to train your hamster to wake one hour earlier than he did before.

Tell them what food your hamster eats, what foods it likes and dislikes, or any medication it might need.
,

Explain that they need to clean the cage weekly and change the food and water everyday.,

Show them how to properly hold the hamster and tell them that they need to play with it everyday and let it out!
,

Make sure they know all the rules about other household pets.
,

If you have rules about what your hamster can and can't do when your friends are around, make sure that they know those rules.
,

Make sure it is someone you absolutely trust and that they have a lot of time to make sure they don't forget your hamster (don't ask someone who doesn't have a very good memory)!
,

Give them a way to contact you if something happens.",How to Make Sure Your Hamster (or Any Other Pet) Is Taken Care of While You Are Gone,", Make sure they know that they cannot give the hamster a bath!,,,,, Make sure you can also contact them if you forgot something. Like if he's allergic to mushrooms and you didn't tell them that before."
"
Have play sessions with it.,
Replenish its food and water.,
Groom your hamster.,
Talk to your hamster.,
Maintain a cozy environment in its cage.,
Keep its cage clean.,
Exercise your hamster.",How to Keep Hamsters Happy," You should spend time with it on a daily basis, which prevents your hamster from becoming bored and allows it to bond with you. Swapping the toys in its cage is a good way to freshen up its routine and allow it to participate in different activities. You could also place it in its wheel and help push it, encouraging it to exercise. To give it some time out of the cage, gently pick it up and allow it to climb over you, but make sure you are in an enclosed area that prevents it from escaping.;
, On a daily basis, make sure to change the water in its bottle to prevent bacteria from forming or the nozzle from clogging. You should also empty out its bowl of old food and replace it, as it could be spoiled. Be sure that you give your hamster a variety of grains or seeds to choose from, as they'll be able to tell which ones their body needs. Fresh vegetables rinsed with water - such as romaine lettuce and carrots - are also good ways to keep it full and happy. Occasional treats are also recommended, as they'll excite your hamster and give it something new to enjoy. Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet will boost your hamster's health and ensure that it's receiving the proper nutrients. You should keep an eye on its weight to make sure you aren't feeding it too much or too little.

, While your pet may keep itself clean, it still requires some help in maintaining its soft fur. You should brush it once every two to four weeks, using either a pet comb or a clean toothbrush. This is a good chance to bond with your hamster and show that you care for it. You can reward it with a treat during or after the session to encourage good behavior.

, Even if it may not understand your words, it finds the sound of your voice reassuring and will help it grow closer to you. By speaking to it in a soft, soothing tone, you can help it feel at ease with you. Spend some time telling it about your day or talking about different topics. To please your hamster even more and encourage it to relax, you can pet it during your quiet moments with it. If you have no time to sit quietly with it, you can still speak to it as you go about your routine.

, To boost your hamster's happiness, it's best to make its home as comfortable as possible. A large cage - perhaps with plastic tubes - is ideal, as it allows your hamster plenty of space to run around. You should line the floor with soft, absorbent bedding and give your pet places to hide (ex: a small hutch or box) so that it can have privacy or rest. Make sure to provide a running wheel so that your pet can exercise and work off energy. To make it even happier, you can also give your hamster chew toys and extra accessories, such as a hammock. All of this will help keep your pet occupied throughout the day or night.

, Hamsters love to remain clean, as they keep their sleeping and toilet area separate and do their best to groom themselves. However, understand that cleaning their cage too frequently or rarely can cause your pet's happiness to deteriorate. It's best to keep a regular cleaning schedule so that your hamster can become accustomed to it. Every day, you can remove soiled bedding and old food from the cage. Once a week, you should scrub the cage and change the bedding. This helps maintain a clean environment and allows your hamster to remain happy and healthy.

Note that hamsters have a tendency to remove food from their bowls and hoard it. You should check for any food that it might be hiding, as it could be spoiled and potentially harm your pet.

, This is extremely important and will help boost your hamster's health, as well as keep its weight in check. You should encourage your hamster to use its running wheel every day, but letting it out of the cage is also a good idea. You can place it in a hamster ball and allow it to roam throughout the house, but make sure to follow it so that it doesn't get into trouble. Giving your pet toys to interact with is also good because it can exercise its body and mind. Hamster tubes are also an excellent way to encourage your hamster to move around.

Make sure you carry your hamster in either a travel cage, a bucket that's safe, or anything else that your hamster could fit in and breathe if you are going outdoors.
Try to avoid people walking dogs outdoors because the dog could try to bite the hamster or eat it, or even play with it which could suffocate your hamster if the dog steps on it.
It is not recommended to let your hamster roam around indoors(unless you hamster-proofed your house) while you try to take pictures of it.;
, Maybe in the morning? Might be good, but really cute hamster pictures have the hamsters in a soothing light source. Noon and afternoon would be also great, but it would usually be the sunniest and warmest which could harm hamsters as they cannot go in direct sunlight. The best time would be before noon, around 11:00 AM. Usually, the sun isn't so direct, and the light is perfect outdoors. Now for indoor pictures, noon would be the perfect time for you (unless your apartment/house window is facing the sun directly, then afternoon would do). Open up those curtains, let the sun shine across to the building in front of your house and the lighting wouldn't hurt your hamster nor be too dark.

, Is it raining? Is it snowing? Is it cloudy? Is it sunny? If it is sunny(not too much sun), then you can skip this step right away.

,


If your hamster is excited and extremely active, wait for it to settle down before you continue.
Feed your hamster some treats before and during the photo shoot, to keep them in a happy mood. Award the model, not the photographer.

, Might be your brand new iPhone 6, might be your good old trusty iPhone 4S, might be your fantastical Samsung Galaxy Note 3, or it might be a digital camera which works extremely well and is excellent for you. Get any camera supply, the better it is the more realistic and cute it will be. Use a tripod if you are taking a picture of your hamster on a high stool or chair, something high.


Get this ready before you take the picture, as it's very important to prepare before you're ready.

, Prepare the model, setup your supplies, get the perfect angle ready by checking your camera, making sure you have time, etc.

, It might be curious, but try to keep it still the best you could.

, Talk to it or make noises so your hamster gets curious and stays still.

, Staring into the horizon, looking straight at the camera, standing up, smelling something, leaning forward, anything you think would be cute.


Your hamster may be distracted by your hands by doing this, so it's better to let it do the pose itself.

, Before it turns away, snap a picture when its in the perfect pose! Be fast!

, Repeat step 3 and step 4 and try again. If you did succeed, congrats! Look at your final best cutest picture, and think about is it good enough and/or cute enough.

, Not too much because you want it to look natural and realistic for the cuteness.

, Maybe your hamster is screaming, “WHAT IN THE HAMMIES IS THAT?!"", and in a pose where it's standing up and facing something. Suit the text to the surroundings and the angle and the hamster's pose. Think of something funny, or something cute for your hamsters to say. If it's an exclamation, consider using words like hammies or hamsters, or use your hamster's favourite things.

Get to know your hamster.,
Begin handling him slowly.,
Develop your bond.,
Consider setting up a play area outside his cage.",How to Keep a Happy Hamster1," Spend some time watching your hamster and getting to know his personality and mannerisms. All hamsters will have their own personalities, so you should try to get know your hamster's and respond to it accordingly. Some hamsters will be more shy and reclusive, and you should respect this and not disturb him unduly if this is the case.


For example, your hamster might lower himself to the ground and flatten out when you approach or attempt to pick him up. This is an indication that he does not want to be handled at the moment.If your hamster is squeaking it could indicate that he is agitated or anxious.This can occur especially when a hamster is introduced to a new environment. Allow him time to adjust.;
, If you want to handle your hamster it's important that you are slow and patient, and don't try to handle him too frequently. You can start by giving your hamster a treat from your hand. Lay your hand flat on the ground and let your hamster get used to it. Do not lift your hand yet. Once your hamster is running around your hand like it is just another toy, you should stop for the day. Give your hamster a treat.


If your hamster gets scared, take your hand away slowly. Be patient, some hamsters are more nervous than others.
Over time you will find that he becomes more comfortable and walks onto your hand with no hesitation., Continue doing a similar routine of spending time together and allowing him to get used to your presence. Start putting treats on your hand and trying to get your hamster to eat them while sat on your hand. Once your hamster is very comfortable doing that, start slowly lifting your hand slightly above the floor. If your hamster gets too afraid, go back to just putting treats on your hand.


Always do this close to the floor, or another safe surface, so if he jumps off your hand he won't be hurt.
If he is distressed or bites you, just put him down and give him a treat.Whenever you try to pick up your hamster you should scoop him up from below.
Never disturb him while he is asleep.

, One way to give your hamster the chance to get out of his cage, and get used to spending time with you, is to set up a secure play pen somewhere in your house. To do this, find a flat and clean area of the floor and ensure it is closed in so the hamster can't escape. Place some toys and items like cardboard tubes inside the play pen.


You can move your hamster over to the play pen by hand, or by using the hamster ball. He will enjoy running around a more open space, but be sure to keep a very close eye on him. Be patient and let him explore the area at his own pace.
Once he is more comfortable with you, you can get in the pen with him and play together. You will become another thing to climb on.
A play box is a good way to provide an area to play in outside of the cage.

For example, hamsters are very inquisitive animals.If given the chance, a hamster will explore everything in his environment. It is likely that your hamster wasn’t trying to escape—he just saw something that piqued his interest.


Hamsters love food. Your hamster may have made his way into your kitchen because he smelled the food.Hamsters are nocturnal. You probably will not have much luck finding your hamster during the day. You may have more success if you start your search late at night.Hamsters are timid animals. Even though your hamster probably found a dark and warm place to hide, he would much rather get back to a familiar place, like his cage.;
, When your hamster escaped, he may have found a crack or crevice in which to squeeze. Use a flashlight to look for any possible opening in a wall or door that your hamster could have gotten through.Cracks and crevices are more common in older apartments or houses.Your hamster may have gotten himself stuck when he squeezed through the crack or crevice.If you are unable to get him out, consider calling an animal removal service for assistance.
You can try listening for scratching noises in the wall or door to locate where your hamster is hiding., You will probably need to look underneath, inside, in between, behind, and beside everything in your home. If you think this sounds like a daunting task, then you are right. Hamsters are small animals and will squeeze into just about any small space that offers them a dark, warm, and safe place to hide.It may help to first look where you last saw him.Consider searching one room at a time to make your search more methodical and efficient.
In the kitchen, pay special attention to looking inside, underneath, and behind all appliances.Do not forget to check bags, shoes, and boxes (including tissue and shoe boxes).Laundry bags or baskets may be particularly appealing to your hamster, since they provide a dark and warm place to hide.Bookshelves, couch cushions, beds, and chairs are other potential hamster hiding places.Because your hamster could have gone anywhere, the list of items and places to check could feel like it is endless. Check every possible place where your hamster could hide, and then think of even more places where he could be.

, You certainly do not want your cat or dog finding your hamster before you do.When you are finished searching every nook and cranny of one room and are pretty sure that your hamster is not in there, put your other pets in that room.Your other pets may not enjoy being restricted to one room, but it may help your search go a little more smoothly.


As you search more rooms and determine that your hamster is not in those rooms, you can give your cat or dog less restricted access.

, Given his nocturnal nature, your hamster will be most active during the night. Keeping the doors closed will prevent him from running from room to room while you are sleeping.Leaving the doors closed may not be as helpful in areas of your home that are more open, such as the kitchen or family room.

, If looking through everything that you can think of has not been successful, try leaving out treats to entice him out of his hiding place. Select hamster-appropriate treats, such as fresh fruit, nuts, and seeds.Your hamster may be a little thirsty, depending on how long he’s been hiding. Leave out treats with a high moisture content, such as seedless grapes, cucumbers, and apples.Peanuts and raisins are also good treats to leave out for your hamster.Cut up the treats into small bits to make it easier for your hamster to eat them.

, You have different options with how to leave the treats out. One option is to put the treats in a saucer or small bowl.You could also put the treats on some newspaper or tinfoil, which would both make noise when your hamster eats the treats.Place the treats in areas where you think your hamster is hiding.
If you decide to stay up late, you could sit quietly near where you placed the newspaper or tinfoil. The noise may help confirm the general area where your hamster is hiding.If possible, tie a long string or strand of thread to some of the treats.If your hamster takes the treat back to his hiding place, you may be able to see the string or thread sticking out.Count the number of treats you leave out so you can determine if your hamster ate any.
Be mindful that leaving treats out in multiple areas at the same time could make it more challenging to narrow your search. Your hamster could have moved from one area to the next eating treats.

, Similar to footprints in the snow, your hamster’s prints in the flour could direct you to where he is hiding.Make sure not to sprinkle too much flour or cornstarch on the floor—if it’s too deep, you may not be able to see your hamster’s footprints.


The further away from the treats that you sprinkle the flour or cornstarch, the better you will be able to track your hamster’s movements.

, Your hamster probably wants to get back to a familiar place. Place the cage where you think your hamster is hiding. Putting some treats in his cage may entice him out of his hiding place and back into his cage.Placing the cage sideways on the floor would make it easier for your hamster to climb in.Keep in mind, however, that he could easily walk back out of the cage if he wants to continue exploring.

, If catching your hamster is his cage did not work, then try trapping him (humanely, of course). Place the pail or pan on the floor where you think your hamster is hiding. Put some tasty treats at the bottom to entice your hamster.The shallow pail or pan should be shallow enough to lessen the likelihood of your hamster injuring himself, but not so shallow that he could easily climb back out.
Use books to create a stairwell up to the top of the pail or pan.The books should be fairly small so that your hamster will not struggle with climbing them.
Once your hamster climbs into the pail or pan to get to the treats, he will not be able to grip the sides to get back out., You may be pleasantly surprised to find your hamster sleeping in his cage the morning after you left his cage out.If you set out the trap, you may find him sleeping in the pail or pan.


If he is not in either the cage or trap, consider moving them to a different potential hiding place and trying again.

, The bars of a wire cage can become bent or disconnected over time.With enough persistence, your hamster could squeeze through any widened spaces between the bars. Inspect the bars at least as frequently as you clean your hamster’s cage (once a week).You can try to manually correct the irregularities in the bars. If this is not practical for you, you can purchase an external wire grid and attach it to the outside of the cage., This is especially important for wire cages. To keep himself busy, your hamster may try everything he can to open the door latch.Visit your local pet store to purchase a locking device to keep the door latch securely closed.

, Your hamster could use his nose to push open the mesh lid of an aquarium cage. Rather than putting weights on each corner of the lid, which could compromise the cage’s air circulation, consider purchasing locking clips at your local pet store.You would place the locking clips on each corner of the lid to keep it in place., If you like to place your hamster in a plastic ball so that he can roll around outside his cage, you may to need to reinforce the ball’s lid. Lids on plastic balls are typically just pegs that fit into slots. Your hamster may entertain himself by gnawing on the pegs from time to time.Over time, the pegs would become so loose that the lid may just flip open when your hamster is in his ball.Use a generous amount of tape on the ball’s lid, especially where it connects to the ball.You may need to apply the tape each time you put your hamster in his ball.

, If your hamster does get out of his cage, sealing the cracks and crevices would give him fewer places to hide.Your hamster can still hide in plenty of places, but you could minimize the number of areas where he could crawl into and potentially get stuck.

Provide a healthy diet.,
Give him occasional treats.,
Ensure there is constant clean fresh water.",How to Keep a Happy Hamster2," Take care to ensure your hamster is getting enough of the right food to keep him healthy and happy. Although your hamster will be very active and have a quick metabolism, he can still become overweight if you overfeed him. Generally you should provide around a tablespoon of pellets or seed mix daily as the core of his diet. You can supplement this with occasional treats., You can provide some nice treats to add variety to your hamster's diet. You can add a small amount of greens, a slice of apple (or a few raisins), and a floret of cauliflower to his daily pellets. This is plenty to keep him well fed. Keep an eye on how much he is eating and tend to give treats in small quantities. You don't want uneaten greens to go bad in his cage, so remove uneaten treats.


You can also provide some hard treats, such as small dog biscuits, branches from fruit trees, or commercially produced treats that help wear down his teeth.
Only provide hard treats such as these once a week.
Remember that hamsters stash their food in hidden stores, so an empty bowl doesn't necessarily mean he has run out of food., An important part of keeping your hamster healthy and happy is ensuring that he has access to a constant supply of fresh clean water to drink from. Make sure you give him fresh water every day and check his bottle for leaks. Be sure to clean the bottle and nozzle regularly to avoid potential contamination."

Give your hamster plenty of space.,
Ensure there are things to play with.,
Get a hamster wheel.",How to Keep a Happy Hamster3," Although they might seem to be asleep a lot of the time, hamsters are very active at night and need plenty of space to run around to keep them stimulated and happy.You should try to provide as much space in your hamster's cage as you can. Your hamster will use different areas of his cage for different things, so having enough space to spread out is important.


The recommended minimum size for the cage is 12 inches (width) x 12 inches (height) x 18 inches (length).But the general rule is the bigger the better.Wire cages, plastic moulded cages, and converted fish tanks are all good homes for hamsters. There are advantages and disadvantages to each. A wire cage gives your hamster more things to climb on, and a tank will require more thorough cleaning.Ensure your cage has a solid base which is at least 3-5cms deep and covered with dust free wood shaving or another safe nesting material, or substrate.
Try to provide substrate that is around 6cms deep so your hamster can dig into it., Hamsters like to play and need things in their cage to keep them stimulated and occupied. A wheel is one way to get exercise and run, but you need to provide more varied stimuli to keep your hamster happy. Wooden chew toys offer a fun activity and also help keep his teeth in shape. Be sure you only use wood that is safe for pets.You can also make toys at home. For example, put empty cardboard tubes in for him to chew on and tunnel through.Plain brown cardboard boxes can be chewed up and hidden in. You can fill a small box with substrate to make a good burrowing and digging place for your hamster.
Be wary of using cardboard that has glue or ink. Stick to plain cardboard to avoid any potentially harmful chemicals.

, Hamsters like to get a lot of exercise, but in a relatively small cage the amount they can run around is limited. One good way to enable a hamster to run for longer periods is to get a hamster wheel. Ensure you have a solid wheel not a mesh one which your hamster could catch his foot in, and get a wheel with a large diameter. If your hamster is running with an arched back, you need to get a bigger wheel.Wheels intended for rats have a large diameter and are a good choice for your hamster.As well as a hamster wheel, getting a hamster ball can enable him to run around for longer periods.
This is also a fun way to get him out of his cage. Be sure you keep a close eye on him and that there are no potential dangers, such as another pet, in the room with you."

Keep the cage away from extremes of hot and cold.,
Keep him away from sources of light and sound.,
Clean the cage regularly.",How to Keep a Happy Hamster4," Where you position the cage in your house is an important factor in the health and happiness of your hamster. Don't put the cage anywhere that he will be exposed to a lot of heat, such as next to a radiator. You should also avoid placing the cage anywhere that gets direct sunlight.


It is equally important to make sure that the cage is not somewhere especially cold or draughty.
If it is somewhere that gets a little cold, be sure to provide extra bedding for warmth.

, Hamsters are exceptionally sensitive to high frequency sound and light, and he can become distressed if exposed to these. For this reason you should take care when finding a place for his cage. Don't put his cage in a room where the lights are going on and off through the night. Nocturnal animals need the darkness at night.


Keep the cage away from sources of ultrasound such as televisions and computer screens.
Also keep it away from sources of running water and loud appliances such as vaccum cleaners, which can be highly distressing for hamsters., It's important to regularly clean out the cage to ensure it remains a healthy environment for your hamster. You should take a few minutes every day to remove any substrate that is wet from urine, and spot clean the cage to remove hamster poo in order to prevent wet-tail.


Try to clean out the cage more thoroughly once a week.If possible, you should try to keep to a basic cleaning schedule for this.
If you clean the cage too frequently or infrequently it could cause distress for your hamster."

Clean your helmet regularly.,
Maintain the hygiene of your helmet's lining.,
Check for static build up in your helmet.,
Wear a do rag, skull cap, or bandana under your helmet.,
Carry replacement liners when traveling.",How to Stop Helmet Itch1," If your scalp is itching or you notice a smell, it's time to wash your helmet. You may wish to wash it on a regular schedule, such as every two weeks, or after a long ride. If your helmet does not have a liner, it may be a good idea to get a helmet pad to put inside the helmet, as this can make cleaning easier.

To wash the inside of your helmet, fill a bucket with warm water and a mild shampoo. Agitate the water until it is sudsy. If there is any dirt or grime on your helmet, rinse that off with water before submerging it in the bucket of soapy water. Allow the helmet to soak for a few minutes.Use your fingers to gently scrub the liner inside the helmet. Then rinse the helmet in your shower or sink until you have rinsed out all the soap.
After cleaning your helmet with shampoo, let it air dry instead of blow drying, which can damage the liner. If can, however, place the helmet in front of a fan to speed up the process.
You can also use a spray cleaner to eliminate odors, though this will not replace a proper cleaning.;
, Helmet lining should be cleaned on a regular basis; after all, you’re likely sweating into your helmet lining regularly when you wear it.Your helmet liner should be removable. If it’s not removable, you should still be able to clean it while in the helmet.
The best way to clean a helmet liner is to get helmet interior spray. You can let this spray sit overnight on the liner and it should improve the cleanliness (and smell) of the liner.

, Static build up is common in helmets, since your hair and the material of the helmet liner are conductive to static electricity. If static is a problem for your helmet, there are a few ways to combat static buildup.The material of your helmet liner may be causing static build up. If you use materials like cotton or cashmere, they are less likely to have static buildup than synthetic materials.You can also change the shampoo you are using with your hair. Leave in conditioners can fight against static due to dry hair, while hair styling sheets can be rubbed over the helmet’s interior to smooth over any static cling.

, If you find your scalp is even irritated by the helmet lining, it may be a good idea to wear something to protect your scalp from the helmet itself. There are a lot of options of coverings for your head that will differ based on the type of helmet you are wearing.

Do rags or skull caps may be best to wear if your helmet has a tight fit. These coverings are relatively tight and should fit easily under your helmet.
Bandanas usually fit looser and are bulkier. If your helmet is roomier, a bandana may be a better option for a covering under your helmet.
When purchasing any physical barriers for your helmet, make sure to buy products that are of high quality. If possible, products designed to wear under helmets may be the best to prevent helmet itch.

, If you are traveling for a long distance, such as a cross-country motorcycle ride, it's a good idea to bring additional replacement liners. When one gets dirty and causes itching of your scalp, you can replace it with another liner.

Replacement liners can be purchased at many motorcycle or biking shops. You can also get additional helmet pads if your helmet does not come with a liner.
You can wash your liners when you stop for the evening on your trip. This will enable you to have clean liners to use for each new day.

Identify the underlying cause of helmet itch.,
Consider that it may be contact dermatitis.,
Check for ringworm.,
Check for lice.,
Consider static as the cause of helmet itch.,
Think about the length of your hair.,
Note the hair products you are using.",How to Stop Helmet Itch2," Helmet itch can be caused by a variety of things. While some causes may be due to your helmet or helmet lining, your itchy scalp may be due to a medical condition, such as contact dermatitis or even lice or ringworm. You'll wan to check with your doctor if you have an on-going issue with helmet itch so that you can be properly diagnosed. Other things can also cause helmet itch, from static to hair length to hair products.


The causes of helmet itch may be due to potential issues with your scalp rather than the helmet. If this is the case, simply cleaning your helmet may not alleviate helmet itch.
When you are trying to figure out the cause of helmet itch, try different tactics until one works. Even though one issue may be solved, another may be the one causing helmet itch.

, This is a condition in which your skin is exposed to an irritating foreign substance or an allergen, leading to itching, redness, and discomfort. You may be reacting to the material in your helmet or possibly a chemical used to treat the inside of your helmet. Make an appointment to see your doctor for a proper diagnosis., Your itchy scalp may be caused by more than just sweat or irritation — you may have dermatophytosis, or ringworm, which is a fungal infection of the skin (don't worry, there's no actual ""worm"" in ringworm). Ringworm commonly affects the scalp and can cause itching. Look also for raised, red, scaly patches; patches that resemble a ring; blisters that begin to ooze.See your doctor for a diagnosis of ringworm. If ringworm is confirmed, then your doctor can prescribe you medication and discuss treatment.
If you have a ringworm infection, you will need to thoroughly clean your helmet, as you could reinfect yourself. Discuss this with your doctor.

, Another common cause of an itchy scalp is a lice infestation. Lice are parasites whose bites can cause itching. If you have lice, you may notice a tickling sensation on your scalp; red, itchy bumps; difficulty sleeping; or tiny white objects in your hair, which are lice eggs, or nits.Get someone to check your hair for lice or visit your doctor for diagnosis and treatment. You'll need to thoroughly disinfect your helmet (as well as your bedding, clothes, and other items that might harbor lice) to ensure you don't become reinfested.

, In most cases, helmet itch caused by static occurs pretty quickly after putting on the helmet. If static is the issue, you can try to wet your hair and scalp before putting on your helmet.


For helmet itch caused by static, the best tactic is to have wet hair when putting on your helmet. Wet hair is heavier and is less inclined to produce static electricity.Static electricity can also be dangerous. If you are riding a motorcycle, static electricity could potentially spark a fire when you're filling up your bike., Hair length can be a factor and may also contribute to increased itchiness. If you have long hair, you’re more likely to experience moderate to severe itch more frequently, since your helmet will be more humid.


If your hair is especially long, it may be a good idea to braid it or put it in a bun. This can keep your hair out of your face, but also keep it isolated to avoid helmet itch.Very short hair can also cause itchiness. If you have very short hair, try wearing a protecting covering to keep your hair protected from the helmet., If possible, avoid using hair products that dry out your hair, which can cause scalp irritation when placed on the skin. These products can be especially itchy in humid conditions.


Switching to hair products that moisturize your hair can help prevent itchy scalp. In particular, try to avoid products that contain sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) since these can dry out your scalp.Additionally, eating healthy fats such as nuts and avocado can provide your hair with plenty of natural oils. These can make your hair less dry and make you less prone to itchy scalp.

Get a new helmet.",How to Stop Helmet Itch3," If you have been diagnosed with contact dermatitis, ringworm, lice, or another medical condition that is causing your helmet itch, you will need to carefully follow your doctor's orders. You may be required to take oral medication, use topical creams, and it may even be necessary to replace your helmet. Consider holding off on riding (and, therefore, wearing your helmet) until your condition has resolved completely.

, This can help to prevent and treat itch while you're wearing your helmet. Though it can be annoying, it's important to never try to reach an itch beneath your helmet while you're on the go.


Topical scalp stimulants work by cooling your scalp. They also relieve any irritants and sooth your scalp from helmet itch.These stimulants are good short-term solutions when you're on the go; however, you may need something more intensive to prevent helmet itch long term.

, Low irritant shampoos leave your scalp's lipid barrier intact. The lipid barrier protects the scalp from infection and keeps it healthy.Additionally, dying your hair can irritate your scalp and damage its lipid barrier. In its more natural state, your hair will grow a healthy protective layer to prevent itch.
If your shampoo still irritates your scalp, you can use moisturizing products as well. These products can help to replenish your scalp's natural barriers.

, Scratching can often make your helmet itch worse, especially using fingernails or other sharp objects. This can cause lesions in your scalp's surface, allowing bacteria in the lining to infect your scalp.


Scalp infections can make helmet itch worse. They can also lead to hair loss if left untreated.If you are actively suffering from helmet itch, wetting your hair can provide some relief. Additionally, using a topical scalp stimulant will provide temporary relief.

, Some hair products have been developed specifically for helmet wearers. These products may be the best type to get to avoid helmet itch.


You should be able to purchase these products at most bike and cyclist shops. It may also be a good idea to ask other cyclists or your hair stylist.
Many of these products may focus on ""helmet hair."" While some of these products may be useful, make sure they do not dry out your hair, which will irritate any existing helmet itch you have., If your helmet itch is especially bad, it may be a good idea to get an entirely new helmet. Bacteria can build up in a helmet, even if it is cleaned on a regular basis.


When you have cleaned your helmet, helmet lining or physical barrier, and your scalp, you may still have helmet itch. At that point, it may be better to start over with a brand new helmet entirely.
Reaction to helmet lining is less likely, but possible with new headgear. If the problem persists, continue to try working with your helmet, lining, and scalp to keep away helmet itch.

Partially dry your polo shirt.,
Set up your iron and ironing board.,
Iron the collar.,
Turn the shirt inside out and starch it.,
Iron the top of the shirt.,
Iron the middle and bottom of the shirt.,
Turn the shirt right-side out.",How to Iron a Polo Shirt," You can purchase spray starch online or at your local supermarket. There are several types, including traditional aerosol cans and eco-friendly spray bottles. Another option is to make your own cornstarch spray at home.;
, The tag is usually located inside the collar of the shirt. If not, check the sides of the shirt on the inside. The back of the tag should tell you what material it was made of, how to wash it and any other special care you should take.


The specific instructions on the tag of the shirt come from its manufacturer, and should trump any care instructions you read elsewhere if they contradict what’s on the tag.

, Make sure you treat any stains (for example, ink stains or underarm stains) before you wash the shirt, since ironing can set the stains permanently. Use a quality, non-bleach detergent and choose a cold-water machine wash. Don’t add any fabric softenersor bleach.Wash your polo shirts alone or along with other knitted clothing. You should wash dark colors separately from light colors.
Wash your shirts inside-out to reduce fading.

, You can start out the drying process in a dryer machine on a low tumble-dry setting.Alternately, hang the shirt up to line dry. Either way, don’t dry the shirt completely unless you plan to use a steam iron or spray bottle of water. It’s best to iron the shirt while it’s still a bit damp.If line drying, put the shirt on a hanger and button the placket. The collar should be folded down. Smooth it with your hands.
If the shirt is cotton, you may want to dry it on a drying rack so that it doesn’t shrink., Make sure your iron is clean. If your shirt is 100% cotton, set it to high heat. If your shirt is a blend, use low heat.If the fabric is cotton or polyester and your shirt isn’t still damp from washing, put your iron on a steam setting or have a spray bottle of water ready to dampen the shirt. Don’t use steam if the fabric is silk.
Test iron a small piece of fabric on the inside bottom hem before you fully iron your polo shirt. If the high temperature seems too much for the fabric, lower the iron’s temperature.

, Lay the shirt on the ironing board. Fold the collar down as you would like it to appear. Make sure the collar is damp, then iron it gently. Turn the shirt over and iron the other side of the collar. Spray the collar lightly with starch and iron the collar again. Then turn the collar inside-out, spray starch again, and iron again. This will prevent the collar from curling.Use the point of the iron for the point of the collars and any corners.

, Use your hands to smooth the shirt down. Also smooth the collar down from the inside. You don’t need to use starch on the body of the shirt. However, you can if you want it to appear stiff, like a button down dress shirt. Lightly spray starch all over both sides of the shirt.


Starch can leave white marks on clothes, which is one of the reasons for ironing the shirt inside-out. The other reason is that some fabrics are sensitive to ironing, and this will guard the exterior of your shirt from getting shiny or singed from the iron., Iron the sleeves first, one at a time, by pressing the iron down and smoothing the fabric from the shoulder towards the cuff. Avoid ironing over the edge on the shoulders, or it will form a crease. Next, go over the placket and shoulders with your iron. Iron the chest of the shirt by moving from the center placket towards the shoulders.Your motions should be continuous. Don’t leave the iron too long in one place.
If there are any patches or silk-screened logos on the shirt, avoid ironing those areas., When you’re finished with the top front of the shirt, set the iron to rest on its bottom feet. Move the shirt up so that the front middle is laid out on your ironing board. Begin at the uppermost part of the shirt and move your way downwards with the iron. Repeat this process for the front bottom of the shirt, working downwards towards the hem.


Turn the shirt over. It should be on its back and remain inside out. Smooth out the wrinkles, then repeat the process on the entire back of the shirt.

, Check for wrinkles. Store it on a hanger until it is time to wear it. If you don’t have the closet space, you can fold the shirt.

If it is your first ever lesson, don't worry about buying jodhpurs and a hat.,
If you need a hat, go to a reputable saddlers or tack shop.,
Get the right boots for your type of riding.,
Buy some jodhpurs.,
If you want, you can also buy a body protector or a safety vest.These are good for jumping, cross country and riding unpredictable horses.,
The next thing to buy is gloves!",How to Dress for Horse Riding," Dress in sensible shoes (not trainers), and comfortable trousers (leggings or tight fitting jogging bottoms are best.) Don't worry about a hat, most riding schools will let you borrow one for your first lesson, but you will need to buy your own.;
, Hats come in different shoes and sizes, so you will need to ask a person to fit one for you. The person will measure across your head, and then find a hat to fit your head type. Don't be tricked into buying a cheaper one, as these will have less safety kite marks and standards than expensive ones. Make sure you wear your hat at all times when on a horse, as they will keep your head safe!

, The next most important thing are boots. These are easy to fit as they are your shoe size. You can buy long boots (which tend to be more expensive) or short boots and half chaps. Half chaps will protect your leg from pinching from the stirrup leather. You can buy boots which are steel toe capped, which protect your toes from your horse's feet!

, These come in a variety of colours, but cream is traditional. These will either come in dress sizes (e.g: 6, 8) or sizes in inches. To find out your jodhpur size, you need to measure you waist with a tape measure. You can also buy breeches, which are best for long boots, as they don't create a bulge inside your boots.

, Most saddlers will have them, and will fit them for you. However, body protectors do cost a lot, so you don't really need one until you start jumping.

, Special riding gloves will protect your hands from chafing and being pulled through the reins or a lead rope. You can get cotton ones or leather ones, and they vary in price. They all have reinforced pads where the reins sit in between your fingers. They usually come in x-small, small, medium, large and x-large.

However, there are benefits and drawbacks to each to consider before selecting a food for your cat.If you're on a budget, dry food is generally a more economical option. It also does not spoil as easily. However, it's more calorie dense than wet food and may not be great for a cat with a weight issue.

If your Maine Coon has any specific health concerns, talk to a vet before selecting a cat food.

, Maine Coons do have a tendency to overeat if free fed.A male Maine Coon should weigh between 15 and 25 pounds while a female should weigh between 10 and 15.It's a good idea to establish a feeding schedule for your Maine Coon cat.A feeding schedule can involve portion controlled feeding. This means giving your cat a specific amount of food once or twice a day. If your Maine Coon tends to overeat, this is the best option.

One pound equals roughly 0.45 kilograms.

, Like all breeds, Maine Coons need regular vet visits. However, they are prone to breed specific health problems. Watch for signs and symptoms of such problems and have them promptly treated by a vet.Maine Coons are prone to hip dysplasia, which can cause lameness.
Maine Coons are prone to kidney disease, which can include symptoms such as bloody urine or stools, a lack of appetite, and a lack of energy.You also may want to have Maine Coons tested for genetic diseases, such as certain heart conditions, that are difficult to detect based on symptoms.

, Dark clothes tend to trap more heat, making you feel hotter. Lighter clothing reflects more of the heat, helping you to feel cooler.

,, The list below features good fabrics to wear if you can’t afford to buy moisture wicking clothes. Good fabrics include:


Cotton
Linen
Flannel
Hemp
Leather
Silk
Seersucker
Velvet
Denim
Corduroy
Mesh––although this isn’t a natural fabric, it is good to wear in hot weather.

, Tank tops work well, also. Mesh tank tops are good to wear. Be sure to use sunscreen on all uncovered areas of skin.

, These can be expensive, but are worth it if you need to wear jeans in the summer.

, You can't wear shorts while riding, but you can while working. Mesh pants work best.

, Your shirts, pants or shorts should not be tight.

, If you can't use moisture wicking socks, then use thin socks, and not thick ones.

, Hats can help keep the sun off your face, and out of your eyes.

, Heavy shoes, and working boots normally are insulated. This will make your feet sweat, and your feet will become very sticky and hot.

, The less layers, the cooler you will be.

, While you are working, spray yourself every 15 minutes or so. Once the water on your skin gets warm, dry it off, or else it will just cause you to feel hotter, and will turn to sweat.

, Every 30 minuets or so (or shorter) so, sit in an air conditioned room, or in the shade. Drink some water, and take time to cool down.

, Know your limit, and how long, and how hard you should be working. Don’t work too quickly, either. Take your time, and go slow.

Watermelon (you can give the rinds to the horses)
Apples (give the core to the horses)
Oranges
Chips
Pineapples
Granola bars.

, Spray your face, hair, and body with the hose. After enjoying the cool water, dry off with a towel, to prevent the water from sticking and turning to sweat.

Wear a helmet.,
Pick a suitable shirt.,
Buy a jacket.,
Buy gloves.,
Buy supporters (preferred for males).,
Pick out breeches.,
Buy socks made specifically for riding.,
Buy boots.",How to Dress for an English Horse Show if You Are a Male," For virtually all English shows (excluding dressage) a helmet is required. There are a couple types of helmets to choose from. The all-velvet helmet. It is the traditional helmet of the sport and has a low profile. The velvet and strip. This is becoming the most popular helmet for shows. It is all velvet except for a ventilation strip going down the front. The dark helmet. This can be any helmet that is dark enough to pass for velvet. You can also buy velvet covers for helmets to convert a schooling helmet into a show one. You can buy a helmet at most tack shops. They should fit you there. The helmet should be tight enough not to move around on your head, but not tight enough to cut off circulation.;
, The standard shirt is a white button down shirt with a collar, although most light colors are allowed. In some shows, a polo shirt is allowed due to the heat or casualness of the show and host barn. With the shirt, you will need a tie that does one of the following: Matches your breeches and/or the braids of your horse. Goes nicely with your jacket. You can purchase a Shirt and Tie at any clothing outlet.

, Unless otherwise stated, you are expected to wear a show jacket in the ring. The jackets you wear can be many different colors, but the safest (most preferred and popular with judges) colors would be black, gray, or navy blue. Please heed this advice: if you are amazingly wealthy, you might want to buy a specially-made men's show coat. However, since they cost more than $500, go to a normal clothing store and buying a jacket that fits nice and does not go over $130.


You almost always wear a number on the outside of your jacket so loop the string around one of the buttons and then push the button through the hole. Then tie the two ends of the string together and this will secure your number. Also, make sure the jacket has some sort of flap in the back so it looks like a show jacket.

, Gloves are preferred by the judge and can help protect your hands if your horse is a little up at a show. You have a fairly wide range to choose from. The best color to go with is black unless riding dressage or sidesaddle. You can find gloves all over the place. Just Google ""riding gloves"".


Synthetic: Synthetic gloves are cheaper, more durable and washable, and are generally cooler in the summer. They can look like leather, but most do not. These are good if you are on a tight budget or just getting into showing.
Leather: Leather gloves are more expensive, but they look nicer and can be very light and durable depending on the price and brand. These are what the most traditional riders wear and have a very comfortable grip.
Hybrids: These gloves are the best of both worlds: they are a mix of leather (which gives them a nice, traditional appearance) and synthetic materials (which make them lighter, cheaper, and gives them a better grip). They also usually come with ventilation strips on the back of them.

, The main disadvantage of being a male rider is that we have to protect more of our bodies than females have to. So, you have to wear a supporter, even in a show. The best ones are the ones that you can find in an athletic department. Make sure that the supporter is not designed to hold a cup because that means there is too much space for your testicles to fall. It must be tight and hold them up and close to your body. You can buy them at many clothes stores. Do not use a cup.

, There is an ongoing debate on which color of breeches should be worn at shows. You should only wear light colors in the range of rust, beige, tan, and light khaki (white for dressage). They should fit tightly and be durable. You can find breeches at any tack store. You should find a belt that matches your coat. The belt must be narrow enough to fit through the small belt loops on your breeches.

, Cotton socks are fine for barn work and schooling, but for shows, riding socks will help you maintain greater control of your feet. They also wick away the sweat from your feet, which is good because dress boots are extremely hot.

, This is a large topic, especially with men's boots. There are 3 basic options for boots; lace/zip, dress/field, and leather/synthetic.


Lace/Zip- It is extremely difficult to find pull-up boots for men anymore. Many prefer pull-ons because they fit your leg better and do not break as easily. If you can find a pair that fits and you can afford them, do yourself a favor and buy them (you'll have to buy a boot jack also). Otherwise buy a zip-up pair. Make sure the zipper is not made of plastic, as they will break easier.
Dress/field- The only difference between them is that dress boots do not have a lace while the field boots do (it can be real or fake). If you buy a field pair, make sure the laces are in good shape so they don't break on you (it has happened to me).
Leather/synthetic- The same general rules apply with boots as they do with gloves. Synthetic is cheaper, washable, etc. Make sure you are truly happy with your boots before you buy them; they are a large investment and should make you feel happy about buying them. Make sure you break your boots in at least 1 month before a show. Especially with zipper boots. Otherwise, you will be in pain and, as a result, your equitation and control will suffer greatly.

Keep your cat indoors.,
Make sure you maintain a clean litter box.,
Give your Maine Coon plenty of attention.,
Monitor your Maine Coon's interaction with children.",How to Take Care of Your Long Haired Maine Coon2," Maine Coons are susceptible to many dangers, like cars or predators, when they go outdoors. In addition to this, Maine Coons are a large and beautiful breed that are expensive to purchase. While it's rare, people do steal Maine Coons they see outdoors. For your cat's safety, keep it as an indoor cat only., A clean litter box is important to any cat. Maine Coons in particular, due to their long hair, require a clean litter box. Debris from litter can easily get caught in their fur, so clean your litter box daily.Each day, scoop any feces or clumps of urine out of the litter box and add a small amount of fresh litter.Swap the litter out completely once every two to three weeks. When you do so, make sure to scrub out the inside of the box and let it dry before replacing the litter.

, Maine Coons are one of the most social cat breeds. They do not do well without daily attention. Make sure to give your Maine Coon plenty of love to keep it happy.Maine Coons may follow you around. You can pet them on occasion, but if you're busy they're generally happy to observe you. It's a good idea to pet them and snuggle at the end of the day, when you have time.
In addition to keeping your cat active, playing can help you bond with your Maine Coon.

, Maine Coons, due to their friendly demeanor, generally do well with young children. However, interaction should be supervised. Maine Coons are tolerant of children, as long as kids are taught to handle them gently.Encourage your kids to treat your cat with respect. Let them know they should only handle your cat when it comes to them and should not attempt to grab or restrain a Maine Coon.
Young children may sometimes try to dress up an animal, or place it in a toy like a toy high chair or stroller. Maine Coons are more tolerant of this behavior than many house cats, but you should still keep an eye on your kids when they play with your Maine Coon. Make sure the cat does not seem aggressive or frightened during play.

Brush your Maine Coon's coat daily.,
Brush your Maine Coon carefully.,
Deal with knots carefully.,
Check for injuries when grooming.,
Minimize hairballs.",How to Take Care of Your Long Haired Maine Coon3," A Maine Coon's long coat requires daily care. While many house cats can get by with weekly or no brushing, a Maine Coon requires daily brushing for its health and comfort. Make time to give your cat a daily brushing., Strive to start brushing a Maine Coon when it is relaxed. This way, the experience will be calm for both of you.Start by brushing your cat's abdomen and legs. From there, you can brush the neck, chin, and tail. With a longhaired cat, you want to brush upward.
Reward your Maine Coon with a treat or praise for behaving during a grooming session. You want your cat to come to look forward to being brushed, as brushing will occur each day.

, You may see knots or mats in your Maine Coon's fur. This is common with long-haired cats. If you see a mat or knot, it can easily be addressed with talcum powder.Sprinkle a small amount of talcum powder on a brush or mat.
Then, use your fingers to gently separate the fur.

, Grooming is an excellent time to check for any unusual changes in your cat's body. When brushing your Maine Coon, run your hands along your Maine Coon's body to check for injuries or unusual bumps or lumps. You should also look for common pests, like fleas and ticks.If you notice any unusual changes in your Maine Coon's coat, see a veterinarian for evaluation.

, Most long-haired cats are vulnerable to hairballs. Hairballs are rarely a serious medical concern, but you can take measure to reduce their severity for your Maine Coon's comfort.Look for a cat food formula designed to reduce hairballs.
Make sure your Maine Coon drinks plenty of water. Keeping the water bowl away from the food bowl can help, as cats are hesitant to drink water near their food due to instincts. In the wild, an animal would not eat near water because they fear contamination.
Keep your Maine Coon active. A healthy cat has a smoother coat, which can cut down on hairballs.

Also, make sure your cat is up-to-date with its shots and vaccinations.If your cat exhibits pain or stiffness in its tail or legs, then you should take your cat to the veterinarian. These are signs of a health issue common to Scottish folds called osteochondrodystrophy.To optimize your cat’s health, ask your veterinarian about the Scottish fold’s nutritional, grooming, and health needs.;
, If you have a shorthaired Scottish fold, then brush it once or twice a week using a metal comb. If you have a longhaired Scottish fold, then you will need to brush it daily. Use a wire slicker brush to comb your longhaired Scottish fold.Brush in the direction of its hair growth and make sure to brush its whole body, including its chest and abdomen.

, If you decide to clip your cat’s nails yourself, then you will need to acclimate it to having its paws and nails handled. You can do this by:Rubbing or massaging your cat’s paws and toes for two to three seconds a day.
Pressing the pad to expose the nail for trimming. If your cat pulls away, wait until it is calm before handling its paws again. Reward it with treats and praise for good behavior.
Using the nail clippers to clip a piece of macaroni near your cat’s ears as you handle its paws. The sound of the macaroni will familiarize your cat with the sound of its nails being clipped. Reward your cat with a treat and praise for good behavior.

, Clip the white part of the nail only. Do not clip near the pink part of your cat’s nails, also known as the quick. Because the quick contains nerves and blood vessels, it will bleed if you clip it. Keep a styptic stick or powder nearby just in case you clip the quick.Trim only two or three nails at a time. Do this until your cat is comfortable with having its nails clipped. Remember to reward your cat with praise and treats for good behavior.
Trim its nails every 10 to 14 days.

, If you cannot brush its teeth daily, then once or twice a week will suffice. Do not use human toothpaste or toothbrushes to clean your cat’s teeth. Purchase specially formulated toothpastes and toothbrushes from your local pet store. Clean your cat’s teeth by:

Pushing its lips back gently and touching the toothbrush to its teeth and gums. This will introduce the toothbrush to your cat. Practice this for a couple days. Reward your cat with praise and treats for good behavior.
Gently scrubbing your cat’s teeth in a downward motion. You want to use a downward motion so you can remove plaque and tartar away from its teeth and gums. Do this once your cat is used to the toothpaste and toothbrush.

, Check the outside of its ears for bald spots, and make sure the inner surfaces of its ears are light pink and clean. Check its ear canals by gently folding its ears back.

Select a pair of skinny jeans.,
Consider the color and wash. A traditional blue denim works great with riding boots of all shades and styles, but you can also have a little fun by playing with skinny jeans in different colors.,
Create a Western look with the right blouse.If you have brown riding boots, you can use them in a country-Western inspired outfit.,
Go for an equestrian style.Riding boots are worn when riding horses, so adding a hint of equestrian flair to your style pays homage to this fashion fad's origins.,
Attempt a casual look.",How to Wear Riding Boots1," The jeans you wear need to hug your leg in order to fit beneath your riding boots without bunching up. For this reason, skinny jeans are the best option.


If you do not have skinny jeans, you can fold another pair of jeans into your riding boots. Select the snuggest pair of jeans your own to accomplish this.
Create a clean, even cuff by folding the bottom of each leg up. Roll up enough of the material to reveal your ankle.
Pull the extra material at the back of each leg out and fold it over, creating a crease.
Roll the leg of your jean up once more to create another cuff that can secure the cuff in place.;
,

Other neutrals, like black and gray, can create a flattering and mature look.






White skinny jeans have a clean yet daring appearance.






Nowadays, jeans come in a variety of bright and pastel hues, as well. You can add a fun shock of color to an otherwise plain outfit simply by exchanging your standard blue jeans for a magenta jean or light orange jean.







, While riding boots and cowboy boots are two very different beasts, brown riding boots are reminiscent enough of cowboy boots to make the look work.

Wear a simple plaid button-down shirt. You can choose a shirt in a loose or fitted style, but either way, it should have some volume to it in order to balance out the sleek, slim silhouette of your lower half.






Stick with medium to dark wash, blue denim skinny jeans.






Accessorize as desired. You can wear simple jewelry or look for a few country-inspired pieces to accent this ensemble. Keep things fairly understated, though. Trading cowboy boots in for riding boots softens the Western style, so your accessories need to be softened, as well.







,

Wear white or cream colored skinny jeans and black riding boots.






Select a crisp, fitted shirt with clean lines. A standard white button-down shirt works well, but there is room for variety here as long as the silhouette remains clean.






Slip a blazer on over your shirt. Wear a fitted blazer in black or navy blue for a more traditional look, or try a colored blazer for a fun spin on this style.







, The simplest way to wear your riding boots is with a standard blouse and your usual accessories.

Select riding boots and skinny jeans in any color and style. Just make sure that the colors coordinate with the colors of your blouse.






While most tops work well enough, the best option is a loose, flowing blouse made of soft, draping fabric. You can choose an empire-waist top to define your waist, or you could simply wrap a belt around an airy blouse at the waist to add the same sort of definition. Regardless, a shirt with volume creates a smart contrast with the skinny silhouette of your bottom half.

Wear bootcut jeans.,
Alternatively, trade your jeans for corduroys.,
Dress the look up.,
Dress the look down.",How to Wear Riding Boots2," These jeans are aptly labeled as “bootcut” because they flair out just enough at the bottom to slip comfortably and loosely over boots of all heights and styles, including riding boots.

This style works best when work with standard blue denim, but you can select any wash that appeals to you.






If you do opt for a colored jean, stick with neutral colors like black, gray, white, and brown.






Make sure your jeans are long enough to cover the majority of your boot but short enough to reveal the toe and heel of the boot.

, As with bootcut jeans, you should wear your corduroys over the boots so that just the toes remain visible.


Play with the color of your corduroys. You can wear corduroys in a traditional color, like tan, brown, black, or gray, or you can opt for a deep shade of a less traditional color, like olive green or midnight blue.

, This look can be turned into a business-casual style with relative ease when you select a pair of dark wash jeans or corduroys and black riding boots.


Wear a simple button-down shirt over your pants or a well-fit blouse in a solid color or fine pattern. You can wear a blazer over the shirt to add a greater degree of professionalism to this look, or you could leave it off for a stronger casual hint.






Accessorize, but keep it simple and classy. Plain metal jewelry is preferable over elaborate costume jewelry with large gemstones or bright colors.







, By wearing light to medium wash jeans and a less professional top, you can easily make black or brown riding boots work for a chic, easy-going weekend ensemble.


Your top can be loose and flowing or snug and fitted. Since your jeans flare out at the bottom, the silhouette on your legs is not quite as skinny as it is when you wear skinny jeans with your riding boots. As a result, you can wear a loose, flowing shirt to maintain an overall air of balance or you can go with a snugger top to create a smoother, more streamlined appearance from top to bottom.

Mix things up with a maxi skirt.,
Show off your legs with a shorter skirt.,
Decide between bare legs and covered legs.",How to Wear Riding Boots3," Select a maxi with more volume so that the skirt does not cling to your boots.Also consider trying out a maxi skirt or dress with a long slit up the side to transform the look from dowdy and maternal to daring and flirty.






To prevent the look from becomes too boxy or shapeless, wear something fitted at the top. Choose a fitted top with a daring neckline or exposed back when wearing a maxi skirt. If wearing a maxi dress, shrug a fitted cardigan, blazer, or jacket on over the dress to create more shape around your torso.







, Select a full, A-line, or pleated skirt to balance out the slim silhouette of your lower leg.Go with a mini skirt if you have riding boots that extend up to your knee or past it. The idea is to allow a portion of your leg to peek through in between the boot and lower hemline of the skirt.






A knee-length skirt works well if your riding boots hit below the knee. Moreover, knee-length skirts flatter most body types and can be used to create both sweet and sexy looks.






You have considerable room to play around with tops when wearing a shorter skirt. Fitted tops are often used to balance out the curves created by a flared out skirt, but whether you choose a shirt with a demure or sultry style is up to you.

, If wearing a thin, flowing fabric, bare legs often looks best. For heavier materials, leggings and tights may look more appropriate.

A knee-length skirt made of a stiff material like wool, tweed, corduroy, or denim is often associated with cooler weather, so tights often seem fitting in this instance.






Short and long skirts made from light, breezy materials like linen and various cotton blends often look better when worn with bare legs, since this style is more commonly associated with warmer weather.

Pick out an appropriate color and texture.,
Wear leggings with a skirt and riding boots.The most common thing to wear leggings and riding boots with are winter skirts and dresses.,
Slip on a pair of shorts for a funky, fashion-forward style.,
Try on a long tunic.A loose tunic that comes down to your mid-thigh can create a stylish yet casual weekend look when matched with riding boots and simple leggings.",How to Wear Riding Boots4," A smooth legging in a shade that matches your riding boots will create a crisp, trendy appearance, but you can play with color and texture to put different spins on your style.

Cable-knit leggings have a warm, cozy ambiance, while other textures and patterns, like lace-overlay, can have a flirty or playful air.






You can also wear leggings that contrast against the riding boot in order to show your boot off more. For instance, white leggings against black riding boots can create a dynamic contrast capable of making your riding boots stand out more.







,

Consider wearing smooth, solid leggings with a sweater dress for a sleek fall and winter look. To create a cozier appearance, trade the smooth leggings for a cable-knit pair.






When selecting a separate skirt to wear with your riding boots and leggings, choose a heavier material like wool or corduroy over something light and airy like linen.







, This look is a little bolder and less common than many others, but it can create a dramatic effect when done well.

Select a pair of fitted shorts that come down to the mid-thigh. Super short shorts can work, as well, but long shorts that come down to the knee reduce the effect by shortening the leg too much.






The shorts can be standard blue denim, but you can also have fun with a gray denim, colored khaki, or patterned pair of shorts.






This is also a good opportunity to play around with colored and patterned leggings. For example, you could try metallic leggings to give your style added sheen. When wearing colored or patterned leggings, though, you should avoid shorts with bright colors or patterns. You should also keep your shirt fairly subdued to prevent anything from clashing.







,


The loose, flowing appearance of a tunic balances out the slim-fit style of leggings and riding boots.
For this look, smooth leggings that closely match the color of your boots work better than leggings in elaborate patterns or contrasting colors.

Annual veterinary checkups allow for preventative care, such as vaccine administration, to be given, as well as the ability to catch health problems before they get too serious.


Discuss testing for problems common in Singapuras. They are generally healthy cats but the most common inherited disease they get is called pyruvate kinase deficiency. This is a condition that causes anemia in Singapura cats.When you first get a cat, take it in to get evaluated by a veterinarian.;
, Giving your Singapura quality cat food will keep to keep it healthy throughout its life. Since cats are strictly carnivores, quality cat food should consist mainly of animal tissue. Take a look at the ingredient list of a food you are considering and make sure that meat or seafood, or their byproducts, are the first couple of ingredients. This will help you make sure you are purchasing a high-quality food.Consult with your veterinarian for suggestions about what type and brand of food to give your cat.
Avoid cat foods that are made mostly of grains. A cat's biology is not made to process grains.
Also make sure that you think about your cat's age when picking out a type of food. Cat food is formulated differently for kittens, adults, and seniors, based on their specific nutritional needs.

, You should provide clean and fresh drinking water for all cats. Singapuras can expend a lot of energy due to their curious and playful personalities, so they will need access to water so they don't get dehydrated.Encourage your cat to drink water by having multiple water bowls in different locations throughout your home. You might also consider purchasing a water fountain bowl for your cat.
If your cat is not drinking a lot of water and looks dehydrated, discuss switching its food to wet food with the cat's veterinarian. Giving the cat wet food can give it much needed water.

, In order limit the general pet population and to keep your cat healthy, it is important to get your cat desexed. Spaying or neutering your cat can improve their behavior, by eliminating spraying and sexual activity. It can also reduce the chances of mammary cancer in older female cats.Discuss the timeline for desexing with your veterinarian. It should typically be done when the cat is between three and six months old.

, While many people are hesitant to keep their cats indoors because they think it is cruel, it is actually more dangerous for a cat to let it outside. Cats that are let outside can be injured by cars or other animals, get diseases or parasites, or even ingest toxins. In order to avoid these hazards, it's best to have your cat be an inside cat.The curious nature of Singapuras means that they can get into a lot of trouble when allowed to roam outside.
Keeping your Singapura inside increases its life expectancy and it helps to protect wildlife, in particular birds, from being killed by your cat.

, Singapura cats have short, smooth coats that need little maintenance. However, you may want to comb your cat once in a while to pull out shedded fur and to keep it off your furniture or floors.Many cats love the touch and attention that comes with combing.
Use a long-toothed metal comb to comb your Singapura. These are commonly sold at pet supply stores.

, It is important to trim your Singapura's nails so that it doesn't tear up your furniture or snag a nail and damage its paw. Hold the cat's paw in one hand and use cat nail trimmers, or human nail trimmers, to trim off the very end of the cat's nails with the other hand. Trimming back further could result in you hitting the quick, the vein inside the nail. This will cause bleeding and pain for the cat. Some veterinary offices offer regular nail trims performed by a technician for a low cost.If you are uncomfortable trimming your cat's nails, you can take it to a groomer that is experienced grooming cats. You can also ask your veterinary provider to trim your cat's nails when you bring it in for another issue.

, Because the Singapura's ears are so prominent, they tend to get dirt and debris in them. While the cat may spend some time cleaning its ears, you can help by inspecting them regularly and cleaning out any dirt or debris that you see.


You need to be careful when cleaning a cat's ears. Use a commercial product that is designed for cleaning the ears of cats and follow the directions on the packaging carefully.
Never place a cotton swab or other item in your cat’s ear canal. This can cause serious damage. Only clean the external portion of the ear.

, Singapura cats rarely need bathing, unless you are exhibiting one in a cat show. If you do need to bathe one, such as if it gets covered in something sticky, then it simply needs to be towel dried, not blown dry. This cat's short coat will dry quickly on its own.

, In order to keep your cat happy and healthy you need to give it a clean place to relieve itself. Put the cat's litter box in an easily accessible location and clean it daily. This is a very important part of providing the right environment for your cat.You should also be sure to use a litter box and litter that your cat likes.

, Singapura cats are very social creatures that love interacting with their people. This means that they will require a lot of love and attention. If you have a Singapura it is likely that you spend a lot of quality time with them because they demand it.Singapuras love to play with their people. Get a string toy or laser toy and spend some time playing with your cat often.

, Although Singapuras are very people focused, they also like to play and run around with cat toys and on cat structures. Provide your cat with a variety of toys they can run after, such as bell balls, and furniture they can climb on, such as a cat tower.Singapuras can be very curious, which means that they will explore every inch of your home. Give them lots of stimulating toys in order to minimize this curiosity, which can get them into trouble occasionally.
Intelligent, curious cats like the Singapura benefit from puzzle toys. These are interactive toys that require the cat to solve a problem in order to get a treat. This offers great mental stimulation for your Singapura.

Feed your Bengal responsibly.,
Give your Bengal water.,
Give your cat a litter box that has a cover!,
Do only a small amount of grooming.",How to Take Care of a Bengal Cat1," As with any cat, feed a good quality cat food of either a wet (canned or pouch) or dry (kibble) variety. Use the feeding guide on the back of the package as a guide to the initial quantity.


Take care your cat does not become overweight. Check once a week that you can feel his or her ribs and that he or she has a waistline. If you have difficulty identifying individual ribs then the cat has become overweight and you need to cut back its food allowance by 10%. After this cut back, check your cat's weight again in one week's time.;
, You could just give it water in a dish, or get a running water system. You can buy running water for cats at you local pet store. If you can't find one there, go online and order one.


If you don't want to buy a running water system, give them water in a dish and occasionally turn on the faucet in the bathroom and let them jump up and drink it!
Bengals have a thing about water - an obsession really. They love to play with it and running water holds a special fascination. They will sit and bat at it with a paw for hours. This is great except you can end up with very wet carpets. Therefore, it's best to site water bowls on a waterproof floor that can be mopped dry if it all gets too much.
Also remember to keep the toilet seat cover down. This is the Bengal equivalent of a play pool and it will enjoy dipping its paw in and splashing water everywhere.

, It will give it the feeling of privacy. Also be sure to give you cat a litter box with high edges. Bengal cats can jump up to three times their height, so don't be afraid to give them a little higher edge around their litter box.


The high edge is so they don't pee outside the box. If they only have to step into the box, they may pee along the edge of the box, thus leaving you a big mess to clean.
If you want to teach your cat to go to the bathroom in a toilet, your job is a lot easier with a Bengal! Do some research on training programs and start it when your Bengal is young.

, Bengals have a satin finish to their coat that doesn't need a lot of care. However, like most cats, if you start brushing a Bengal as a kitten, it will grow up loving the attention.


Use a rubber grooming glove get the shed hair out of the coat and keep it extra glossy and sleek.

Take your Bengal to the vet on a regular basis.,
Start vaccination from six weeks of age to give temporary protection.,
Get your cat desexed.,
Get your cat dewormed.,
Understand the unique health issues Bengals can have.The breed is at greater risk than others of Feline Infectious Peritonitis.,
Consider taking out pet insurance for your Bengal cat.",How to Take Care of a Bengal Cat2," Like all cats, for a long and healthy life the Bengal requires certain routine health measures. As a kitten, this includes vaccinations, deworming, neutering, and having a microchip inserted.


Having a microchip in place means you can prove ownership is the cat is recovered from thieves or if found when it's lost.
Make sure your vet takes care of Bengals, because not all vets do.

, Repeat again at 10 weeks, with the final shot of this initial course at 14 weeks of age. The vet will vaccinate against distemper and rabies, as a basic course, and discuss vaccinating against feline leukemia and chlamydia.There is some resistance amongst Bengal breeders to giving the leukaemia vaccine. The reasons for this are not clear but are related to the ancestry of the Asian leopard. There is no proof whatsoever that Bengal cats are especially sensitive to this vaccine and there are no special complications in the breed.Neither does the Bengal's ancestry give them natural immunity, as some breeders argue, so not vaccinating leaves your cat open to possible infection. However, if your cat is going to be purely indoors, then you can save yourself the debate, because an indoor cat is at low risk of contracting feline leukemia., Desexing is usually done between 5 - 6 months. However, some breeders insist on the kitten being neutered before they are homed (at 12 weeks), in order to avoid their kittens being used for breeding stock.

, Worming should be done at 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks of age with an oral product, such as Panacur. Good products, such as Stronghold (UK) or Revolution (US), last for 1 month, so they should be applied monthly from 6 weeks of age.

, This viral disease is most likely to spread in establishments where more than five cats live and who use shared litter trays. Unfortunately, this means breeding establishments can be potential breeding grounds for the Corona virus which mutates and causes clinical FIP.


There is no preventative treatment for FIP, and if you buy a kitten that is incubating the infection, although feeding a good diet will generally strengthen his immune system, it will not stop him from becoming sick with FIP at some point in the future. Thus, avoidance is your best option.
If you already have cats and take on a kitten from a breeder with a history of FIP, then make sure the cats do not share litter trays. The Coronavirus, which is responsible for FIP, is spread via feces, so the closer the other cats contact with poop, the greater the risk of them acquiring infection.
FIP usually affects cats under the age of 12- 18 months, and causes fever, loss of appetite, and seepage of fluid out of the circulation where it accumulates as fluid on the belly. There is currently no cure for this heart-breaking condition.
Before getting the kitten, ask the breeder if they have any history of FIP within their breeding stock. If they are honest, and tell you they have had problems with FIP or reports of homed kittens suffering from the condition, then sadly you should walk away and source a Bengal kitten from a different breeder.
Other common health problems are HCM (a heart disease), PkDef (chronic anemia) and an early onset autosomal recessive disorder which can lead to blindness within the first year of life. However, many breeders screen against these problems and can reduce the likeliness of your cat having such issues.
Nasal dermatitis was found affecting Bengal cats in Sweden. The scientists' conclusions were that this unique skin condition in the Bengal breed suggests a heritable cause., This will cost you a modest sum every year. However, it will help significantly if your cat has a medical emergency. It will pay a portion of your vet bills, depending on the exact policy, and it will assure that you don't have to make treatment decisions based on cost alone.

Give your Bengal a chance to climb.,
Give the Bengal mental stimulation so it doesn't get into trouble.,
Have fun with your Bengal!,
Help the Bengal to bond with all members of the household.",How to Take Care of a Bengal Cat3," Bengals love to climb and the higher they get the happier they are. If you don't give them suitable things to climb on, they will find things for themselves, such as your curtains.


A floor-to-ceiling cat gym is ideal, with lots of platforms and nest boxes. In fact if you have one in every room so much the better. Place one cat gym beside a window, so your Bengal can climb and watch birds through the window at the same time, which he or she will hugely enjoy.

, Provide plenty of toys, and be sure to have a minimum of twice daily play sessions, lasting at least 10 minutes (or until the cat gets tired). Bengals are intelligent and extremely energetic so you need to provide an outlet for all that pent up hunting behavior. Neglect this and the cat is likely to find its own amusement by shredding your best furniture.


The Bengal is highly intelligent and adept at problem solving. This means he or she may work out how to open the food cupboard, or even the fridge. Be prepared to fit child locks on doors where there is anything that could harm the cat (such as cleaning products) or where there is food.

, Playing with your cat can provide hours of entertainment for you, and your Bengal. These cats love attention, so the more, the merrier! They also love to sleep with their ""parents"" so, let 'em snuggle up to you at night! Bengals only live 12-18 years average, so make the most out of each day with your cat.


Play time with kitties is always important! Cats love anything moving. Get a feather on a string, and move it slowly on the ground. This will make your Bengal think it is alive. Move it slowly, shaking it a little back in forth, until your Bengal pounces.

, Bengals have a tendency to become one-person cats and ignore everyone else. To avoid this, when you get the Bengal kitten, make sure all members of the house spend equal time playing with, feeding, and grooming the kitten. This will help the cat become equally familiar with everyone.


Consider giving your Bengal cat a friend to play with. Bengals have play fights in the middle of night, so if you don't want a cat to bother you all night, get another cat. The second cat doesn't have to be a Bengal. It can just be a stray, cat from the pound, or a cat you already own.

Get your kitten his shots.,
Groom the cat regularly.,
Feed the cat appropriately.,
Spay or Neuter your Kitten.,
Give the cat plenty of attention.",How to Raise Angora Cats," If an Angora has one or more blue eyes, that means they could be deaf. If its right eye is blue, that means it could deaf in its right ear. If both eyes are blue, it could be completely deaf. So if your cat has blue eyes, take them to the vet to get a check up on their sight, so you can cope with the kitten accordingly.;
, Your kitten will need his first set of shots by eight weeks, and the second set three or four weeks later. If an initial veterinary exam was not done at the time of his adoption (highly recommended), he should also be tested for worms. Topical flea treatment can be started safely at eight weeks.

, The angora cats usually have medium length fur, and need to be groomed at least 3-4 times at week. This does not include bathing, you should only bathe the cat if it gets specially dirty, or for a show.

, The Angora is a lively cat and will require approximately 80 Kcals. of food per kg body weight per day (the kitten needs more). This type of cat rarely overeats and will soon let you know how much it requires each day.

, Your kitten can, and should, be spayed or neutered between three and six months. Cat's sexual maturity can vary, and both female and male kittens as young as four or five months have been known to become sexually active.

, The Angora can be very talkative, even noisy, and also very affectionate, loving to chat with its owner. Angoras are born show-offs, and love approval. They become bored easily, so need toys to occupy them, and plenty of owner participation in their games. These cats crave company; ideally this would be another cat, but otherwise from their owners, so if you are away from home for most of your day, you should ensure that your Angora has another cat for company.

Position your toys.,
Avoid crowding the cage.,
Change things around.",How to Exercise Your Guinea Pig1," Ensure that your cage is large enough to safely and properly accommodate a guinea pig. It must be large enough for them to run around, do laps, and have some piggy fun! Guinea pigs can't just sit around, waiting for someone to take them out-let your guinea pig be able to exercise on its own time.For one guinea pig, they cage should be at least 7.5 square feet.
For two guinea pigs, 7.5 square feet is the minimum, but 10.5 is recommended.;
, There are many wooden balls, chews, and other toys that will encourage your guinea pigs to exercise inside of their cage. As mentioned before, guinea pigs like to exercise on their own schedule, and placing some fun stuff in there will encourage them to play.Sometimes your guinea pigs won't play with the toys you got them, and that's okay! It is good to know your piggies' preferences, as they will help you shop in the future.
Be choosy with the toys you buy. Guinea pig toys with dyes, small parts, or added sugars can hurt your guinea pig.

, Don't place all of the toys up against the wall. If you have hidey houses, food bowls, and toys scatter them around the center of the cage. It might look a bit messy, but your guinea pigs will be able to run around much more freely!


Balls and hidey houses (or other things they can crawl through) will encourage the most movement.

, Place things properly in the cage, but don't crowd it. If you have so many hidey houses, toys, or food bowls that your guinea pigs hardly have an inch of room, it is best to consider removing a few items.

, To keep it fun, it is highly recommended to move accessories inside of the cage around once in a while. Some owners do it every day, while others do it after every cage cleaning. Many piggies enjoy a change of scenery once in a while, and this encourages them to explore and play.

Let your guinea pig play on the floor.",How to Exercise Your Guinea Pig2," Make sure that the space is guinea pig-proof! That means no spare cords (to avoid electrocution), other pets, or anything that is potentially dangerous to a guinea pig. Try to close off spaces such as under a dresser, couch, or bed, as this can tempt your guinea pigs to squeeze under there, and it can be very difficult to lure them out., If you don't want your piggies to do their business on the carpet or tile, place some towels (or an old blanket) on the ground. You may even want to put them in a large puppy playpen, with towels underneath., Select a few of your guinea pig’s favorite hidey houses, balls, or other toys are position them in your play area. These will signal to your piggy that it is time to play., It is also a good idea to put out some vegetable for your guinea pig to nibble on as he plays. This will give him a small energy boost, as well just make this time a little more fun. Try giving him broccoli, carrots, or celery., Once the area is safe, the towels are down, the toys are positioned, and the veggies are out, there is nothing left to do but let your piggy play!"

If your lawn has been treated with chemicals, you may want to put down a blanket or tarp for your guinea pig., Before you take a guinea pigs outside, make sure that you have an escape-proof play pen of some sort. If done correctly, many guinea pigs love to run around, nibble on some grass, and soak up some sunshine. Allowing them to run freely outside (without a pen) can be very risky.


A play pen can be purchased at any pet store.
Alternatively, you can make your own using low corrugated plastic meant for lawn borders (from a hardware store), or metal baking cooling racks and zip ties.

, A little bit of sun is great for your guinea pig, but too much harsh sunlight can be overwhelming for them. If it is a particularly sunny day, you may want to put up a sunshade or umbrella for your piggy., Once all the proper safety precautions are in place, take your pig outside and let him play! Sit in a lawn chair near the pen and enjoy the day with him.

Prevent any issues.",How to Keep a Guinea Pig on a Budget," Keeping the minimum of two guinea pigs together will suffice. If you struggle with money or think you will potentially struggle then avoid adopting any more than two cavies. As much as they're irresistible in the pet store, you'll most likely end up having to give them away afterwards due to the financial struggle.;
, Avoid just going to the store closest to you. If you want to save on items, discover some other stores in town. By comparing prices and visiting more than one store you can find yourself a great deal on items you buy and save yourself money.

, Don't buy something that's way too expensive yet unsuitable for your guinea pig. Some pet stores tend to overprice their cages. Online stores or DIY C & C cages are sufficient enough. You can always build your own cage instead of purchasing an expensive commercial cage.


Buy second-hand which are a lot cheaper (almost half price) than new store cages and are just as good.
Two guinea pigs will need 7.5 square feet at the minimum.You will find that C & C cages come up a lot cheaper than hutches and runs. You can also make your own by purchasing cubic grids and connecting them together. However, these are more suitable for indoor guinea pigs. They will not be practical for an outdoor guinea pig.

, Bedding can be one of the most expensive parts of keeping guinea pig's with some people spending $20 a week on it! There is no need to spend so much on bedding that doesn't last and costs you a fortune. Switch to something that lasts longer or is cheaper.


Fleece will last you a lifetime with it only needing to be washed regularly. However, keep an eye on utility and water bills. You will need to wash your fleece at least once a week.
Switch to a different brand/make of bedding. Line recycled newspaper at the bottom of your cage for extra absorbency and longer lasting bedding. Switch to a cheaper bedding such as wood shavings (but avoid cedar and pine). If you're using hay as bedding you might be spending too much money.
Don't overuse your bedding. You only need a small amount of bedding to go over the top of your bottom lining. Don't overdo it by packing the bedding up. It's a waste and isn't needed.

, In pet stores, hide-outs can be $20-$30 which is a major fortune for the items used to make it! Purchase second-hand or buy from someone who makes their own. You can even make your own huts and bridges with untreated, pet-friendly wood. They're easy and cheap to make.

, Guinea pigs don't need toys or chew toys and often don't use them. Pet stores put these colourful toys on display to engage the customers when they often aren't needed and end up being a waste of money.


If you want to provide toys and chew toys to your guinea pigs, you can always make your own for free. You can provide them with toilet rolls or wooden blocks as chew toys and socks stuffed with hay as a playful toy.
Guinea pigs don't need chew toys as long as they have hay available to them. Their teeth are kept filed down and healthy when they chew on their hay. They usually don't use chew toys making them completely unnecessary.

, Mineral blocks, vitamin supplements and/or vitamin water drops are completely unnecessary and sometimes dangerous. Guinea pigs don't need artificial items to get their nutrients from and definitely avoid adding anything to their water as they might completely stop drinking! These items are another unnecessary waste of money.

, Spot cleaning can help your bedding last longer and keep the cage cleaner. Tidy up any patches of wee and poo. Your bedding can last 2 x as long using this method daily.

, Guinea pigs require hay available to them 24/7 which can become pricey if you aren't buying it from the right place. Most pet stores over-charge for a bag of hay in order to make profit. Try finding a place that grows their own hay and sells it for a cheap price.


Some equestrian centres sell bales of hay which are cheaper and you get more for less. Essentially you want to be looking at $5 a bale which should last your guinea pigs months. Another option is to get your hay from a farm stop.
Make sure the hay you buy is dust extracted to prevent any respiratory problems.

, There are a few useful and helpful ways on saving money when it comes to buying vegetables. You can feed leftovers, grow your own, find produce on sale, shop elsewhere, buy in bulk, or purchase vegetables in season. A factor that can effect your vegetable shopping is also your knowledge on vegetables and what you're buying.

, You can feed them strawberry tops, carrot peels, cucumber cuttings, lettuce leaves, etc. Your guinea pigs can be your living compost. Before you feed them your leftovers ensure that the vegetables are free from any sauces, salt and pepper. Never feed them iceberg lettuce, tomato stems/leaves, potatoes or avocado.

, Having your own veggie patch is becoming increasingly popular in every-day homes as it saves on grocery shopping. If you don't consider yourself a green-thumb or cut out for growing your own vegetables you can always have a small herb garden.

, Plenty of vegetables get reduced each day when they're coming up to passing their best before date. You can find bags of salad leaves and spinach for 50 cents or carrots reduced per kilogram. Some produce that have been bruised can also be found at a cheaper price.

, Make sure you are comparing prices to see which place suites your financial needs. Majority of farmer markets tend to sale their produce for a cheaper price than super markets in order to compete for their income.


Avoid buying vegetables that aren't in season because they will cost a lot more than their original price.

, Buying in bulk, or also known as wholesale, can save you a significant amount of money and even get you a discount on what you're buying. This includes hay, food and bedding. Avoid going to pet stores for overpriced items which are packed in small quantity.


Agriculture and equestrian places usually sell items in bulk whilst in small prices such as hay and animal feed.
Purchase your vegetables in bulk too. Find vegetables that are in bags or priced per kg. You can find yourself a bargain by shopping for vegetables that are kept in plastic bags such as cabbages and zucchini. You should also look for bags of herbs which can come up very cheap but plentiful for your guinea pig's daily intake.

, Some super markets have weekly offers or coupons if you sign up online. You will find the latest discounts, sales and reduced items online. By collecting coupons, offers and such you can find yourself great deals in store especially on vegetable produce which can be the most expensive to buy for guinea pigs.

, You can perform a self-examination daily/weekly to spot any early symptoms of illnesses or parasites such as hair loss and/or unusual droppings.


Keep note that an accurate diagnosis and treatment can only be done by a professional vet.

, Veterinary schools can offer you a lower cost when it comes to check-ups and treatment. Call up a veterinary school nearby to see if they will perform a reduced cost appointment.


Go for a reliable veterinary school that you can trust and has supervision. If you feel something is off then go for a professional exotic vet.

, You can apply for financial help online. Many organisations are available to help aid with veterinary costs if you're struggling to cover the money for veterinary care. You can find them online and contact them via email or phone.

, You can prevent things such as dental and gut issues already by simply providing your guinea pigs with hay and an adequate amount of vegetables. The healthier your guinea pig the less risks you run of having to take your guinea pig to the vet.

Often, just petting is enough to remove the dead hair and help move oils around.A curry brush is good for this cat.Also, these cats only really need to be bathed when they get into something messy, such as if they go running through the mud outside.;
, The Bombay cat is prone to excessive tearing in the eyes, more so than other breeds. Tears can be irritating, so try to wipe down the corner of your cat's eyes at least once a day. Use a soft cloth dampened with warm water., Bombays, like all cats, need their ears cleaned regularly. Clean them when you notice a buildup of wax on the inside.

You'll notice when they start getting long; they'll be extra sharp, and the cat will keep getting them stuck in things.Start by getting your cat used to the noise of the clippers. You can practice on a piece of spaghetti with the cat nearby.

Train your cat.,
Give it things to jump onto.,
Buy your cat puzzle toys.",How to Take Care of a Javanese Cat2," Javanese cats are incredibly social and very inclined to be around people, often involving themselves in whatever they are doing. To care for a Javanese you must be willing to spend quality time with your cat when you are at home. Be prepared for a Javanese cat to shadow you, sit in your lap at any opportunity, sleep next to you at night, and copy your actions (opening cupboard doors, for example)., The Javanese is a highly intelligent and energetic breed that can be trained to fetch and walk on a leash. Attempt training just before mealtime, when your cat will be alert and eager. Use treats as a reward for when your cat retrieves a toy for you or allows you to attach its harness without struggling.To get your cat to fetch, dangle the object in front of it (e.g. a toy mouse), toss it onto the ground in front of you, and call your cat back to you if it picks up the toy.

Comb your cat's hair.,
Check and clean its eyes and ears.,
Brush your cat's teeth.",How to Take Care of a Javanese Cat3," The Javanese's coat requires very little maintenance because it does not have an undercoat.

, Prevent periodontal disease in your Javanese by brushing its teeth once a week. Start introducing the cat to the toothpaste by placing it on a toothbrush and letting your cat taste it. Once your cat licks or chews on the toothbrush on its own, you can attempt to brush its teeth while bracing its face gently but firmly.Purchase special toothpaste for your Javanese cat from a pet store. Never use human toothpaste, which may contain ingredients that are toxic to cats (e.g. Xylitol).

Take your Birman for annual vet checkups.",How to Take Care of a Birman Cat," Your Birman cat will be a great addition to your home and your family. To make sure your beloved pet doesn’t get lost, you should purchase a collar with an identification tag.


For the collar, be sure you purchase one with a safety stretch or break-away option so that your cat doesn’t choke itself and can get out of the collar if it gets stuck on something.
On the ID tag, include your pet’s name and your phone number. You can also include your home address if you wish.
Because a collar can become lost or removed, consider having your cat microchipped by your veterinarian.
Some veterinarian clinics can may also offer to have your cat's i.d number tattooed on to them.
You may also want to consider keeping your Birman cat as an indoor-only pet, as this will protect it from being stolen, from getting hurt by other animals, and from catching various diseases.;
, Your Birman cat will need access to food and water, so you should buy some food and water bowels for the cat. You can purchase small dishes that you refill often, or larger ones that hold more and allow your cat to self-feed.If you use a self-feeder and your Birman cat becomes overweight, you may need to switch to a smaller food dish that allows you to control how much your cat eats.
You can purchase either ceramic or metal food dishes for your Birman cat. Just be sure to clean both regularly (once every few days).

, Your Birman cat will be affectionate and will want to be near you throughout most of the day. Consider purchasing a cat bed that you can put nearby where you often sit, work, or sleep so that your cat can stay close in a comfortable bed of its own.Of course, your Birman may choose to sit on your lap instead! But it’s always nice for your cat to have a bed of its own.
Your Birman cat will probably prefer a softer, more plush cat bed – so try to find one made out of a velvety or suede material.

, Your Birman cat will be a very playful kitty, so you should purchase some cat toys to use while playing with the cat. This will be a great way to encourage your cat to exercise, while also strengthening the bond between cat and owner.Try some string toys, an oversized feather on a stick, and some toy mice for your Birman cat to chase and play fetch with.
You could also purchase a collapsible tunnel toy for your Birman cat to play in. Because of their adventurous spirit, Birmans typically love to run through tunnels, especially when their owners play with them.
Laser pointers are a good option for your cats that like to chase, but the Birman’s fun and playful nature will benefit from something concrete to satisfy their sense of play and adventure.

, Birman cats are medium-sized cats who are quite active and playful. They need a high-quality food with as a good source of energy. Look for foods that contain a meat source as the first main ingredient listed.Avoid foods that contain meat products, meat byproducts, or anything with the word “meal” (like cornmeal) as one of the first ingredients. These are lower quality products and won’t give your cat as much energy and nutrients.
Wet food is typically considered the better option for Birman cats because you can monitor their intake/weight (since you have to feed them several times each day) and it also helps your Birman cat stay more hydrated.
However, if you have a busy schedule, dry food can be a better option since Birmans are usually pretty good at self-feeding if you leave dry food out for them.

, All cats, Birmans included, need regular access to drinking water. This should be made available to your cat so that it can drink whenever it wants. Not providing a consistent source of water for your Birman cat could lead to dehydration and other serious health problems.Keep a bowl of water by the cat’s food dish. Refill it daily so that the water doesn’t get contaminated.
You can also use a drinking fountain. Birman cats, in particular, love to drink from running water.
Make sure there is more than one water supply for your cat in case it dumps over the first one. You don’t want your Birman cat to be without water.

, Birman cats are very affectionate and playful. They love to follow their owners around and “help” them with whatever they’re doing. Play with your Birman cat every day to keep it happy.Make a game out of making the bed by letting your cat hide under the covers.
Purchase some toys and let your Birman cat chase the toys around.

, This particular breed of cat loves attention from their humans. To make your Birman cat happy, you should show it affection regularly and love on the cat often.Pet your Birman cat and show it that you care. Let the cat sit on your lap and stroke its fur.

, As with most other cat breeds, Birman cats should be spayed or neutered to avoid unwanted pregnancies and kittens without a home. When your Birman cat is old enough – for Birmans this occurs quite late, at three years old – you should schedule an appointment with your veterinarian to get your cat spayed or neutered.Spaying and neutering is the responsible thing to do as a pet owner. This helps cut down on cat populations that can overwhelm an area.
You should only consider not spaying or neutering your Birman cat if you plan on breeding it.

, Birman cats are especially prone to developing periodontal disease, so it’s quite important to schedule regular cleanings with your veterinarian. This should happen once every six months or so, with more frequent cleanings if you notice signs of disease like bad breath or tartar buildup.You can also give your Birman kitty treats that encourage dental health – like hard chewing sticks.

, Birman cats are typically a healthy and hearty breed, but they still need regular vet visits to make sure they are in tip-top shape. Schedule an appointment with your veterinarian once every year.In addition to a general health checkup, the vet will give your Birman cat its annual vaccinations to prevent it from getting sick.
Be sure to follow your vet’s advice regarding the health and care of your Birman cat.

If the mess is a bad one, cut floor time short. Put them back in the cage so that their shavings can catch any further droppings.;
, If you have a plastic scoop or spoon handy, you can scoop up any poop pellets. Normally, guinea pig droppings will be small, solid droppings, and it will be easy to pick them up. If you do not have a scoop, you can use a paper towel to pick them up. Do not touch droppings with your bare hands.

, If your guinea pig pees on a carpet, get a paper towel, and fold it over to create a thick pad. Press the towel to the carpet spot in order to soak it up. Don't try to rub it away; this causes the urine to soak deeper into the carpet.

, Once the droppings and urine have been removed, you should use a pet-safe disinfectant. You can use conventional antibacterial sprays so long as you wait a day before reintroducing your guinea pig to the area.

Afterwards, if you choose, you can vacuum up any remaining shavings or bedding.

, If you are using newspaper lining—either as bedding or as a lining beneath the shavings—you should roll it up before throwing it out. Fold over the edges so that feces and loose shavings do not tumble out.

Provide your pups with toys.",How to Care for Baby Guinea Pigs," Pups will reach adult size very quickly, so it is recommended to have your pups in a cage that is an adequate size for an adult guinea pig. The cage should be at least 7.5 square feet. If you purchased pups from the pet store, make sure that the cage is large enough before you leave the store.Even though the cage may seem a bit big for your pups, they will appreciate the extra space they will have to run and explore their environment.
If you have a mother guinea pig in a cage with her babies, the cage should be large enough (minimum of 8 square feet) to accommodate all of them through the nursing stage.If your current cage is not large enough, visit your local pet store for assistance in selecting the right size cage.;
, The majority of guinea pig cages are built for adult guinea pigs.For example, there is usually one-inch spacing between the bars on a guinea pig cage. Your pups could possibly be small enough to squeeze through this spacing. To prevent them from doing this, consider purchasing a cage that has a deeper pan at the bottom. The deeper pan would be more difficult for your pups to climb out of.As an alternative to buying a new cage, you can purchase grids with smaller spacing at your local pet store. Secure the grids on the outside of the cage with cable ties., The water bottle should be positioned low enough so that your pups can comfortably reach and sip from the bottle’s sipper tube.You may need to reposition the water bottle several times before it’s at just the right height for them. These water bottles can be purchased at your local pet store.


The lowered water bottle may too low for your pups' mom. If you see that she is struggling to sip from the water bottle, it may be helpful to place a second water bottle at a higher height for her.

, This is important whether you are bringing home pups or caring for the ones that your female guinea pig has given birth to. Guinea pigs can be very sensitive to noise,so your pups will need to stay in a quiet area during their first few weeks of life.


The cage should also be out of the path of direct sunlight and placed away from vents that could constantly blow air on the cage.It is ideal for the cage to be placed at approximately waist-level. This can make it easier to clean., Pups should be held as early and often as possible so that they can become comfortable with human interaction. The more comfortable they are with people, the better socialized they will be, making them better pets. The mother guinea pig will not reject her babies if you hold them, but she will need time to complete the birthing process before they are ready to be held.Female guinea pigs typically give birth to an average of three pups per litter. The birthing process usually takes about 30 minutes, with about three to five minutes between pups. You will know when the process is over when all pups have been delivered and the mother has eaten the placenta and cleaned the pups.In general, guinea pigs are not used to being held and may initially feel afraid when you pick them up. Getting your pups to be comfortable with you holding them may take some time.To pick up one of your pups, slowly reach into the cage and reach for him from the front. Slide one of your hands under his chest and use your other hand to support his back end. Slowly pick him up and hold him against your chest for as long as he will let you. Talk to him with a gentle voice as you are handling him.If the pup becomes squirmy when you are holding him, gently lower him back into his cage.Your pup may start to squeak when you take him away from his mom to hold him. Make sure not to keep him away from his mother for long.Do not try to handle your pups when they are sleeping or nursing.

, If you purchased your pups from your local pet store, you probably will not need to determine whether they are male or female. If your adult female guinea pig gave birth, you can try to determine the sex of the babies soon after they are born. Female guinea pigs will have what looks like a tiny grain of rice in their genital area. Male guinea pigs will have a white ring in this area.It is recommended to have your veterinarian or a guinea pig expert determine the sex of your pups,if this has not already been done at the pet store.

, If necessary, the male pups should be separated from their sisters and mother and moved to a different cage at the time of sexual maturity, which is around three to four weeks of age.This separation is necessary to prevent accidental pregnancies.Ideally, males should be moved to a different cage around three weeks of age. Female pups can stay with their mother until four weeks of age.Guinea pigs are usually ready to begin leading more independent lives when they are around six weeks old,but you should still aim to separate them by three to four weeks of age if necessary.

, Pups generally eat the same thing as adult guinea pigs, so you do not need to feed a specific baby diet. One exception is that pups need additional calcium in their first few weeks of life. The extra calcium will help their bones grow properly.Alfalfa hay is especially high in calcium.Alfalfa-based pellets are also available.Timothy hay and fresh fruits (oranges, melons) are high in vitamin C and are nutritious foods that you can feed your pups., Feed your pups twice a day by placing small amounts of food in a sturdy food bowl. Remove any leftover food so that it does not spoil.Pups also need a constant supply of fresh water. Refill the plastic water bottle as needed and clean it with hot, soapy water once a week.If the pups are still with their mother, they will start nursing within about 24 hours of birth and will continue nursing for about three weeks (before they reach sexual maturity). They will nurse from their mother during the first few days of life, then transition to solid food and mimic how their mother eats., Guinea pigs are susceptible to many types of diseases, such as heat stress, foot pad infections, and pneumonia. Because pups need a lot of vitamin C in their diet, a deficiency of this vitamin can cause a disease called scurvy. Signs of scurvy include swollen and painful joints, lack of appetite, and a reluctance to move.If your pups are showing signs of scurvy, take them to the veterinarian for immediate treatment. Depending on the severity of the deficiency, your veterinarian may need to give your pups vitamin C injections., The ideal bedding for your pups' cage consists of several inches of shredded newspaper or pine shed bedding. This bedding can quickly become soiled with leftover food and dropping. It may also become wet with drops of water from the water bottle. Change this bedding twice a week to keep the cage clean., Just like adult guinea pigs, pups love to play. Toys that your pup would enjoy include tunnels and ramps (if your cage is multi-level). Toys can be purchased at your local pet store, or you can make homemade toys out of such items as empty shoeboxes, empty milk cartons, and toilet paper rolls.


You can also let your pups play outside of their cage. You will need to guinea pig-proof a room first to make the play area as safe as possible.

Consider adopting an adult guinea pig from a rescue or shelter.,
Call around to local shelters and ask if they have any guinea pigs for adoption.,
Look in your local newspaper for classifieds or online classified websites, such as Craigslist, for guinea pigs to adopt.,

You can also look on the Guinea Pig Adoption Network for adoptable guinea pigs in your area.;
, If you don't see any adoptable guinea pigs on your local shelter's website, don't assume they don't have any. Many shelters do not list their guinea pigs and other ""exotics"" for adoption online.

, However, beware of back yard breeders who sometimes post there. They will usually have numerous babies and will usually charge more than $20 re-homing fee for babies. Healthy, perfectly social Guinea pigs are really frequently being rehomed on Craigslist at no fault of their own.


Many backyard breeders breed solely for money and looks with little to no regard to health, longevity, or temperament of the animals they are producing.

, Pet stores and backyard breeders are notorious for selling sick, parasite infested guinea pigs. Pet stores usually get their guinea pigs from pet mills that are like puppy mills for smaller animals. This is why they often get sick animals in stock.


If you want to get your guinea pig from a breeder be sure to thoroughly check them out before hand. Do online research on them. Make sure they are breeding their pigs ethically and with the animals best interest in mind. It's best to actually visit several breeders before choosing one.

Decide what breed of guinea pig you would like.,
Take other factors into consideration.",How to Choose a Pet Guinea Pig2," Females tend to be more calm, while males tend to be more active.Other than this general difference, the sex you choose is basically a matter of preference.

, There are a wide variety of breeds of guinea pigs, each with a distinctive appearance.To narrow down the breeds, decide whether you would like a short-haired pig or a long-haired pig. This will help you narrow down your choices.


The American guinea pig is the most common breed. It has a short and smooth coat that is easy to care for.Getting a long-haired guinea pig will require a bit more grooming on your part. They need to be brushed regularly to avoid tangles and mattes in the coat.
If you are adopting a guinea pig from a rescue, you may not have much choice when it comes to breed. If the specific breed is important to you, you may need to go to a specialized breeder.

, For instance, if you already have a guinea pig, you need to make sure that your new and old guinea pig will not breed, although male and female guinea pigs usually get along really well. In addition, if you have several male guinea pigs in a cage already, it is not a good idea to introduce a female.This can lead to fighting between the males.

Another sign that the guinea pig might be sick is if it doesn't eat. It should eat frequently, so even if you meet a guinea pig for a short period you should see it eat.

, In order to do this, you will need to inspect the genitals.


Also check that they are over six weeks old and aren't pregnant.

, Just because a guinea pig is healthy doesn't mean it has the personality to be your perfect pet. Play with the guinea pig for a bit and gauge its personality., Ask him or her if the pig has ever been sick and if its parents were healthy. Chances are good that they will tell you the truth and its always better to ask than not to.

However, pet stores also have a number of drawbacks and many guinea pig owners advise against using them. You might end up with an unhealthy and poorly behaved pet.


One downside to pet stores, or department stores that sell guinea pigs and other small cage animals, is that workers are oftentimes not knowledgable about pet needs. Guinea pigs may be kept in poor conditions and workers might be unable to answer basic questions about caring for your new pet. Pet store guinea pigs are also often mislabeled in terms of breed and gender, so you won't know exactly what you're getting.A more reliable pet shop route would be well-known retailers such as a local pet store with a solid reputation. In these types of stores, workers generally have some knowledge of guinea pig care. There is usually more of a process for adoption and you'll be provided information on guinea pig health, care, upkeep, and socialization. Prices vary depending on season, but guineas usually go for $30 to $60.Understand that pet stores shouldn't necessarily be your first option. They are notorious for selling improperly cared for guinea pigs and there are plenty of reports of customers buying pregnant or mixed sexed guinea pigs whilst being completely unaware. Most tend to sell equipment that are not suitable for guinea pigs too! Restrain from buying from a pet store unless you know they hold a good reputation.;
, Guinea pig rescues help re-home guinea pigs that have been abandoned by former owners. Rescues tend to be more committed to finding quality homes for their pets, so you'll be taught how to care for your guinea pig if you go through a rescue.


Websites like petfinder.com can help you locate guinea pigs in need of new homes in your area. Also, many animal shelters take guinea pigs and other exotic pets. Check shelters in your area to see if they take guinea pigs and if any are currently available for adoption.Adopting from a rescue is a process and the necessary work varies from shelter to shelter. Generally, there's some form of application in which you verify you're committed to providing a loving, safe home for your new pet. You may have to put down references. If so, choose other pet owners you have pet-sat for previously or people who have taken care of your animals in the past. Such people can confirm you're a responsible pet owner.Rescues can generally be trusted considering the workers there are mostly volunteers who put their energy and time towards raising ill-treated guinea pigs back to health and finding them loving homes. You can trust them to come home with a guinea pig which you know is healthy and you can leave confident that you haven't been misinformed.

, Another way to find a guinea pig is by asking other guinea pig owners. They will be able to give you an inside look into the route they took.


If you know someone with a guinea pig, ask him where he got his and whether or not he would recommend the shelter or pet shop to you.
Ask friends who own guinea pigs to let you know if any of their females have babies. You might be able to adopt from a friend, but remember you'll have to put in some extra money for vaccinations and, if you choose, spaying or neutering.
You can also ask your vet for advice. She might be able to point you in the direction of refutable breeders or quality rescues., Before you purchase a guinea pig, familiarize yourself with the kind of care guinea pigs need. You want to make sure you have the time and money to truly commit to your pet before making a purchase.


Guinea pigs are social animals. While it's not impossible to make a guinea pig happy without a cage mate, it can be difficult. Guinea pigs thrive when they have a cage mate and many rescues will want you to adopt a pair together. Consider buying two guinea pigs to make sure your pet is not lonely.However, you should make sure that no two males, or a male and female should be placed together because there are already to many unwanted guinea pigs in the world. Make sure no two male guinea pigs are together ether unless the are related or at least one is neutered.
Guinea pigs live about 6 years. Know how old your guinea pig is when you purchase him and how long you can expect him to live. You need to know you're able to commit to the guinea pig for that time frame.Make sure you have access to a vet with the necessary experience to treat your guinea pig. Guinea pigs are often considered exotic pets, meaning not all vets are willing to take them as patents. Find a good vet before buying a guinea pig.Many people purchase guinea pigs assuming they're more of an aesthetic commitment and that, much like fish, are content to roam around unattended. This is not the case. Guinea pigs need time out of their cage to run and explore and like to play with their humans. Your guinea pig will need attention and care each day. If you get a longhaired guinea pig, the commitment will be even greater as daily grooming is necessary.If you have cats, reconsider getting a guinea pig. Cats will view your guinea pig as prey. If you have cats, make sure there's a space you can keep your guinea pig's cage that's out of their reach. However, never put a guinea pig cage outside. Guinea pigs do not tolerate the cold well., Before you purchase your guinea pig, make sure you have adequate supplies. Start with selecting a good brand of food for your pet.


Guinea pig food is sold at most pet stores. You should choose a diet specifically made for guinea pigs as you want to make sure they're getting adequate nutrition from their diet. In addition to their pet store food, guinea pigs also need to eat veggies and some fruits as a daily meal.Vitamin C supplements are important for guinea pigs as they cannot store or manufacture vitamin C on their own. Add vitamin C to their water each day to make sure they're getting the proper vitamins in their diet., Your guinea pig will need a cage as guinea pigs cannot be left out in a home unsupervised.


You can find a cage at a pet store. Once again, go to a well known retailer like Petco or Pet Smart or a refutable local business. You want to make sure workers can answer any questions you may have.
Your guinea pig's home should be well-ventilated and big enough to store a food bowl, water bottle, and bedding. There is no set size for a guinea pig cage, but know that bigger is generally better. This is especially the case if you have two or more guinea pigs, as territory disputes are less likely in a larger cage.Having a bedding area is also important. Guinea pigs should have access to hay or grass to burrow in and guinea pig safe beds can be purchased at most pet stores. Make sure you designate a specific area of the cage for sleep., You need a water bottle and bowl to store your guinea pig's food.


Your guinea pig will need a water bottle, not simply a bowl to store water. This is because guinea pigs can be slightly messy and you want to make sure their water is free of debris and food. You can purchase a water bowl to attach to a cage or crate at a pet store. In fact, some crates come with a water bottle already attached.
Food bowls can also be purchased at pet stores. Make sure the brand you get is guinea pig safe. If you're confused, ask your vet.

, Guinea pigs like to play, so make sure to have a variety of toys available for your pet before you move them into your home.


Hidey houses are one option, which are small houses made of wood or cardboard that can be placed in a guinea pig's cage. They can be purchased online or you can make your own hidey house using cardboard. In general, you should have one hidey house for the number of guinea pigs in a crate. This reduces fighting.Small balls can be purchased at pet stores, which guinea pigs love to throw and chase. It's safer to go buy a toy specifically marketed for guinea pigs as the material used in other pet toys might not be guinea pig safe.
Guinea pigs also love to chew. Household items, like paper towel or toilet paper rolls, can be placed in their cage for entertainment., Before you make your selection, decide if you want a male or female.


If you're purchasing guinea pigs in pairs, it's recommended you get two of the same gender. Two males or two females tend to get along better than guinea pigs of the opposite sex and there is no risk for accidental breeding. If you're new to guinea pigs, it's best to go with the safer route and choose same gendered pairs.Males can be territorial. If you do get two males, opt for a larger cage to reduce tension over territoryHowever, any time you have a pair of guinea pigs, be sure to duplicate things like hides and bowls so that there is no tension over resources when you first bring your guinea pigs home.
Some places will refuse to sell mixed genders as guinea pigs constantly breed and don't stop! Sows have a 20% mortality rate during pregnancy. It is highly frowned upon to breed as it can be dangerous for the sow and pups too.

, Guinea pigs come in a variety of breeds and cross-breeds. Get a general sense of what type of guinea pig you're looking for before making the selection.


Longhaired guinea pigs, like Peruvians or Shetlands, will need daily grooming to maintain a sleek, tangle-free coat. If you like the look of a longer haired guinea pig, keep in mind the added time commitment. You will also need to occasionally get your guinea pig trimmed, so make sure you find a groomer.If you're getting a guinea pig from a rescue, you'll probably end up with some kind of crossbreed. Ask the workers at the rescue about the traits of each breed your guinea pig's ancestry is comprised of to make sure the guinea pig's personality is matching with your needs and wants as a pet owner., When looking at potential guinea pigs, know how to recognize good health.


Healthy guinea pigs run around on all fours. Be wary of sluggish guinea pigs, especially those with flaky skin and bald patches.Guinea pigs should have smooth, steady breathing and their eyes and ears should be clear, bright, and free of discharge.Feel the guinea pig's body to make sure it's plump and free of any unusual lumps or swelling."

Check their weight regularly.,
Monitor and change your guinea pig’s diet.,
Keep an eye on their water intake.,
Clean your guinea pig.",How to Care for an Elderly Guinea Pig1," Regular veterinarian visits are required, even for aging cavies.

Search for an exotic vet or one that specializes in guinea pig care. Also, find a vet that has 24-hour care in case of emergency.;
, Dramatic changes in weight can be signifiers of a health issue so be sure to check your guinea pig’s weight regularly. Purchase a home scale and weigh your guinea pig at the same day and time once a week.One ounce fluctuations from day-to-day are normal. Any fluctuation more than 2 ounces and you should go on alert.One ounce weight fluctuations are fine. Fluctuations of 2 ounces and you should be alert. A change of 3 ounces and you should be extremely alert. Changes of 4 ounces or more and your guinea pig needs a trip to the vet.
You should weigh your guinea pig daily anytime a health problem is suspected.
Seek veterinary attention if you notice weight fluctuations. Bring any documentation you have of your pet’s weigh-ins.

, Their diet and appetite is likely to change slightly as they age. Vegetables that were eaten in seconds may remain at the bottom of the bowl. Try adding a few new fruits and veggies that they may have previously not enjoyed. Also try adding some new treats to playtime. Overall, avoid drastically changing their diet.Try adding a Vitamin C supplement to their diet. This can help your guinea pig fight off illnesses as they age. Speak with your veterinarian about adding this to your cavy’s diet.
If your guinea pig is eating less in a single sitting, try breaking down larger meals into smaller, more frequent sittings.

, Keep your senior’s water fresh by replacing it once a day. Monitor how much water they intake on a daily basis because drinking more or less water than usual can be a sign of a medical issue. Examine and replace water bottles that are old, broken, rusted or difficult to use.Most cavies need about 100 ml of fresh water daily. However, many drink less than that because they get water from fresh vegetables such as cucumbers.Your cavy’s water intake will differ from others. If your guinea pig’s water intake increases drastically, take them to the vet for a check-up. This could be a sign of diabetes.
Avoid using distilled water and avoid adding salt and sugar to water.

, Normal guinea pigs should be given a bath no more than once or twice a month. However, as cavies age or become frail, they can find bath time stressful which can lead to panic and even heart attack. Instead of baths, wipe your guinea pig clean with vet approved wipes or a warm, damp, cloth.Try distracting the guinea pig by giving them some fresh vegetables. Then, begin to slowly sponge warm water over them. You can also use shampoo and conditioner, gently massaging it into the coat and then sponging off with warm water.While bathing your guinea pig, you can also take note of anything out of the ordinary such as lumps, thinning fur, urine stains, bald patches on their feet, dry nose, or lip sores.
When done, wrap your pet in a towel and pat them dry. Avoid using hair dryers and heating pads. Make sure your cavy is dry and comfortable before returning them to the cage.
Many guinea pigs enjoy the massage and attention received during the drying process so don’t be surprised if they purr or vibrate their entire body.

Watch how the guinea pig moves.,
Take a look at the guinea pig's fur.,
Check the guinea pig's eyes.,
See if it has a runny nose.,
Look for signs of diarrhea.,
Check for drooling.,
Hold the guinea pig up to your ear.,
Look at its ears.,
Check its rear end.,
Consider adopting from a shelter.,
Pick a guinea pig free from symptoms.,
Take your new guinea pig to the vet.",How to Buy a Healthy Guinea Pig," If the guinea pig is slow and lethargic, that's not a good sign. Of course, a guinea pig that is just waking up may be a little slow. However, a healthy guinea pig will be moving about the cage, using all four legs. It will be curious about its surroundings, including visitors like you.Lethargic guinea pigs could have a vitamin C deficiency.
If they are deficient, they may also have a limp or exhibit a number of other symptoms, from a dull, mangy coat to diarrhea.;
, A healthy guinea pig will have a full coat of fur. In addition to being full, it should be fluffy and silky. See if you can tell what the fur is like as the guinea pig runs around the cage.Patches of missing fur and raw spots can be a sign of illness.
Problems with its coat could be a sign of a fungal infection or mange mites. A rough coat could also indicate a upper respiratory tract infection., The guinea pig's eyes should be clear. You shouldn't see any cloudiness. You also shouldn't see any crustiness around the eyes. If you can't tell from outside the cage, examine the eyes again when you hold the guinea pig.Cloudy eyes can be a symptom of several conditions. The most likely culprit is an upper respiratory infection. If left untreated, the guinea pig will die, but it likely can be treated with antibiotics safe for guinea pigs.
Allergies could be another cause.
Oozing from the eye could be a sign the guinea pig has conjunctivitis., Similar to cloudy eyes, a runny nose can be a symptom of a number of problems. Check to see if it's nose has a discharge, which you should be able to see from a distance. If you can't, check again when you pick the guinea pig up.A runny nose can be a sign of pneumonia, for one.
It can also be a sign of any number of bacterial infections, as well., Diarrhea and other symptoms of an upset stomach can indicate sickness in the guinea pig. Look in the corners of the cage or the guinea pig's litter box to see if you find any diarrhea.Diarrhea can be a symptom of a bacterial infection or a virus. It can also be a sign the guinea pig has parasites of some sort.
Once you pick the guinea pig up, you can also check its rear end for signs of diarrhea.

, Drooling may seem fairly innocent, but it can actually be a symptom of a common guinea pig condition. In fact, the condition is sometimes referred to as ""slobbers"" because of the drool.This condition is usually a sign that the teeth are out of alignment, causing problems with eating. In fact, you can also look at the guinea pig's teeth to check to see if they're aligned. The two top front teeth should fit perfectly over the two bottom teeth.The condition can be caused by any number of factors, from a lack of vitamin C to genetics.
While a guinea pig can live with this condition, it will likely need to have some teeth filed down at the vet, and it may need regular vet visits.

, Take a moment to hear what its breathing sounds like. Its breath should be soft. You shouldn't hear wheezing, for instance. In addition, the guinea pig shouldn't look like it is having trouble breathing., Discharge from the ear could be a sign of an ear infection. Ear infections, though rare, often mean the guinea pig has another issue, such as pneumonia.Another bad sign with the ears is a bad smell coming from them. Take a quick sniff near the guinea pig ears to check for smells.
Also check to see if the ears have a build up of wax in them.To look at a guinea pig's ears, gently lift one up and peer inside.

, If you see any signs of blood near its anus, that is a bad sign. You can also look in its litter box to see if there is a blood in its stool. Either way, blood in the feces or anus is not a sign of a healthy guinea pig. Blood can indicate anything from bladder stones to pyometra.Blood in the urine is also bad, as it can indicate similar problems. It can also indicate urinary tract infections. Basically, if you see any blood where the guinea pig goes to the bathroom, that's not a great sign.
To check the rear end, gently lift the tail to look at the anal area.

, Shelters are often overrun with guinea pigs that need good homes. Plus, shelters that take guinea pigs often have a better idea of how to care for them than pet stores. Many pet stores do not properly care for guinea pigs., When looking at a guinea pig, make sure it doesn't show signs of the symptoms above. In addition, try to pick one that is friendly towards you and shows some affection, though it may take a while for a guinea pig to warm up to you.

, Once you choose a guinea pig, it's a good idea to have it checked out by a veterinarian. You should pick out a vet that has experience with small animals like guinea pigs.A vet will be able to identify signs of sickness better than you.
Don't jump to conclusions if your vet says your guinea pig is sick. Many diseases are treatable.

Make their food and water more accessible.,
Reconsider cage setup.,
Clean the cage at least once a week.,
Keep the cage layout consistent.,
Consider a companion for lonely guinea pigs.",How to Care for an Elderly Guinea Pig2," As cavies age, they tend to have difficulty getting around. Move their hay, food, and water to a place in their cage that is easily accessible to them. Snacks should not be kept on levels where they are required to jump, and hay should be kept in a bin on the floor versus hanging in a basket., As guinea pigs age, they become less flexible, their legs become fragile, and their hips become delicate. Find toys, homes, and bedding that is more compatible with changing needs. Reduce to a one-story cage to cut down on climbing and jumping, and remove hammocks and hanging tunnels where they can get tangled.Also consider making the floor easier for stepping by creating a flat surface of fleece. Limit bedding such as shavings to a litter pan or the eating area.

, Guinea pigs are naturally clean and tidy creatures so they can become frustrated when their surroundings are dirty. Place your guinea pig in a secure temporary environment, then clean the cage using warm water and biodegradable soap. When thoroughly clean, rinse with water and pat completely dry.You may need to clean the cage more often as your guinea pig ages, or if there are multiple guinea pigs in the home.
You can also use 1 part white vinegar to 3 parts water instead of soap.
Besides deep cleaning, be sure to keep up with daily cleaning such as removing urine and stool, making sure bedding is as clean as possible, and cleaning food and water dishes daily.

, After each cleaning, return furniture and toys to the same location as before. As guinea pigs age, their eyesight begins to fail. Cavies with failing eyesight can make out shapes and outlines by keeping the layout consistent and avoiding busy patterns., When senior guinea pigs lose a companion, they may suffer from loneliness. Changes in behavior include withdrawal, silence, changes in eating habits, and biting. Consider consulting your local shelter to find your guinea pig a new friend.If a new guinea pig is not an option, opt for a stuffed toy buddy with which they can snuggle. Make the toy available at all times.

Look for signs of dental problems.,
Check for failing eyesight.,
Listen for labored breathing.,
Look for signs of arthritis.,
Inspect their skin for abnormalities.,
Know when to let go.",How to Care for an Elderly Guinea Pig3," Common dental problems during the golden years include ingrown teeth, brittle or loose teeth, or crooked teeth. These issues can be helped by visiting a vet to have the teeth properly ground down. You can also help by chopping fruits and veggies into smaller, bite-sized pieces. This does not always remedy dental issues, but it can help.If teeth are ground down improperly it can trap the guinea pig’s tongue and lead to painful complications while eating. Defer all dental questions to your cavy's vet.
Guinea pig’s teeth grow throughout their entire lifetime so if they fall out, they are likely to grow back. Just monitor their growth to ensure they are growing in properly.

, Guinea pigs naturally have poor eyesight, but as they age, they are more likely to develop cataracts. Vision will slowly deteriorate but guinea pigs will acclimate to the change and still live happily. If you notice changes in vision, immediately take your guinea pig to the vet to determine whether it is a treatable condition or cataracts, which is untreatable and will eventually lead to blindness.Look for milky appearance of the eye, red, sore or swelling eyes, crustiness, or excess tear production.
Check with your vet for conditions such as foreign debris or in-turned eyelashes which can be treated with antibiotics .
There’s no real prevention for eye problems. However, you can learn how to cope with them to make your guinea pig more comfortable and less stressed.

, A guinea pig’s breathing should be quiet and not labored. If you hear a clicking sound or note any changes in breathing patterns, this could be a sign of a respiratory problem.Avoid cold and damp cages, draughts, and unchanged bedding.Respiratory issues deserve an immediate trip to the vet. Veterinarians can prescribe droppers of antibiotics to assist in clearing the infection.

, As your cavy ages, it is likely that he or she will experience inflammation and stiffness in his or her joints. Look for limited mobility, limited range of motion in the hind legs, limping, or hopping. If you see any of these symptoms, immediately contact your veterinarian and consider prescriptions to ease your cavy’s pain or discomfort.Additional symptoms include a soiled bottom due to the cavy’s inability to clean itself, or squealing or squeaking to express discomfort.

, As cavies age, they are more prone to skin conditions such as dry, flaky skin, sores, bald patches and abnormal swelling. Contact your vet if you notice skin abnormalities or notice that your cavy is sensitive to the touch in certain areas. This could be a sign of mites and requires professional medical treatment, as opposed to treatment through products sold at pet shops.Mites burrow under the skin and can cause pain and discomfort to your pet. Not only that, but they can cause dehydration and death due to the numerous amounts of sores they cause., When your guinea pig is no longer able to enjoy life, you need to discuss euthanasia with your vet. While it is a difficult decision, consider whether life for your pet is a joy or a drag.


Try following the “Rule of 5 Good Things”. Make a list of the top 5 things your pet enjoys. His or her quality of life has been greatly impacted when he or she is no longer able to enjoy 3 out of the 5.Keeping a pet hospice journal can help you determine his or her quality of life over a longer span of time. This can also help you to determine how many good days and bad days your pet typically has.

Give them space.,
Give them a bed area.,
Know their sleep schedule.,
Handle them with care.,
Give your Syrian hamsters enough room.,
Get a running wheel for your hamster.,
Give them something to chew on.,
Give your hamster food.,
Never give them a bath in water!,
Don't breed them if you are not capable of having little baby hamsters.,
Take them to the vet when they are sick.",How to Care for Your Hamster," Syrian hamsters want to live by themselves. They are solitary animals and upon meeting other hamsters may fight with each other which can cause severe injury or in some cases, death.;
, In the wild, hamsters live in burrows so they like having somewhere under cover to sleep. You can buy plenty of cute ones from pet shops, or simply cut a doorway into a small cardboard box, such as a tissue box or shoe box. Put plenty of bedding into it - the cotton bedding often sold for hamsters can be dangerous as they can't digest it if they eat it, so unscented toilet paper ripped up is an easily available alternative.

, Hamsters are nocturnal which means that they sleep in the day and are active in the night. If you wake them up too often they can become unhealthy and overly tired. As with humans, this is okay once or twice. If you get into a schedule of usually waking them up with food at a regular time after dark (say, at about 10pm) they should get used to it.

, Hamsters aren't toys and if they do not wish to be held, ensure to give them some space and put them down. You can hold them once in a while and train them to become tame, which requires a lot of time spent with your hamster and a lot of patience.

, Even though they are small they still like to have some space - it is recommended that they have at least minimum 30cm x 60cm of total floor space. They are active and curious and like to explore, so the bigger the better. You could get them a wired cage from a pet store, or you can also use a tank as long as the lid is well-ventilated, or make your own - a popular basis for DIY cages is a large plastic bin, available cheaply in many shops.

, When you do get a wheel, you will need to get one with a closed running surface so they can't catch their toes. Make sure this is big enough for your hamster - if they have to arch their back to avoid the central hub of the wheel, it can cause them health problems. Generally aim for wheels recommended for the next animal size up to be sure.

, Hamsters are rodents, which means their teeth are continuously growing and need to be worn down on something. You can get wooden chews from pet shops for this, or use clean twigs of any hamster-safe wood.

, There are many hamster foods, and as long as it is a complete food you can feed them on that with occasional treats. Before you feed anything to your hamster, look it up to make sure it is safe - even things that are good for humans can be bad for hamsters.

, Give them a little container of pet sand (not chinchilla dust!) or child-safe playground sand. They should roll around in it. Use it at once a week or if they get really dirty.

, This means either being prepared to house them all separately yourself or knowing beforehand you have enough homes lined up for them to go to.

, Even though they are small they are just like any other animal, and it is your responsibility to make sure they are not in pain or ill for long. If your hamster has e.g. diarrhea, seems unusually lethargic, has partly closed eyes or ears or any discharge, this means they need to see a vet as soon as possible.

Be aware of the risks associated with breeding guinea pigs.,
Ensure you have the time, money and space to breed guinea pigs.,
Make sure you know how to care for guinea pigs properly.,
Know where to find a breeding guinea pig.,
Check the age of the guinea pigs.,
Check the parentage of your breeding pair.,
Check the sex of both guinea pigs.,
Purchase a sow that hasn't just had a litter.,
Physically examine your breeding pair before you make the purchase.,
Have your breeding pair health checked.,
Quarantine them both for two weeks.",How to Choose a Guinea Pig for Breeding," Sows have a 20% mortality rate and if the sow is not chosen properly she and her pups could have a higher chance of fatal accidents occurring.

Breeding is not something to be done as a hobby or for fun. It takes experience and proper knowledge for the pregnancy to be carried out properly.
Fatal problems can occur through the last stages of pregnancy including stillbirth pups due to fusing of the pelvic bones and toxaemia.;
, Sows can have up to 8 pups and the pups will most likely have to be separated at 3 weeks. Boars cannot be housed with sows (including the pups after 3 weeks).

You will need at least 2 cages to separate boars from sows. After impregnating the sow, the adult boar will have to be separated half way through the pregnancy period. Then any male pups will have to join him at 3 weeks whilst the female pups can stay with the sow.

, Guinea pigs require at least 7.5 square feet of space each and should have a clean, sanitary cage lined with absorbent bedding.

They also need unlimited pellets (plain, avoid mixes), hay and water. They need 1 cup of vegetables per day each. Choose alfalfa hay which is recommended for the pregnant sow and her pups.
For the bedding, line newspaper or puppy pads on the floor and then add fleece or wood shavings. The cage will need to be cleaned at least once a week or spot cleaned daily.

, Guinea pigs can be found from pet stores, shelters/rescues and from other breeders. If you want a certain show-breed your luck would be to try a specific breeder for breeds such as long-hairs.

Breeders who specialise in show-breeds should have paper work available and may be more reliable than other places.
Do not purchase from backyard breeders. Many are notorious for selling sick guinea pigs that haven't been cared for properly.
Do not rely on pet shops. Many pet stores aren't knowledgeable about their guinea pigs and mix both sexes together leading to many pregnant guinea pigs (some pregnant with their siblings).

, You shouldn't breed guinea pigs under 4 months old or over a year old. Look for a guinea pig that is 6-8 months old which is the best and safest age to breed a sow.

Males can breed at any age as long as they're fertile, but you still want them to be at least 5 months old.
Sows must be 6-8 months. If they are over 1 year old and haven't been pregnant before then they could have their pelvic bones fused together by then, which is a common cause of stillbirth pups.

, Guinea pigs have several hereditary. diseases that could affect them and their pup and cause a lethal pup or severe deformities.

Never breed related guinea pigs.

, Make sure you have a male and female. Check directly above the anus while holding the guinea pig on it's back. A female's genitals will look like a Y shape whilst males will have an I slit where you can see the testes.

If you aren't very good at sexing, you can get them professionally sexed by an exotic vet.

, Sows need time to rest in between each litter and should only be bred twice at the maximum (if the pregnancy went well). Sows need at least 4 months to rest to help ensure the quality of subsequent litters., Your guinea pigs should be alert, their eyes should be clear, tidy noses and they shouldn't have any bugs on them or any hair loss/scabs., Make a booking with an exotic vet that specialises in guinea pigs to ensure that they are both healthy and ready to breed., Unless they have been physically examined by an exotic vet, you should always quarantine new guinea pigs to ensure they are both healthy and no illnesses or parasites are present.

You need to keep them in separate cages where they cannot see or smell each other. Make sure neither of them interact when in quarantine.

Adopt from a local shelter.,
Locate a certified breeder.,
Search local listings for free hamsters.,
Go to a pet store as a last resort.,
Inspect their cage.",How to Choose a Healthy Hamster1," You can call your local rescue organization or humane society to see if they have any hamsters in. Just because the hamster has been surrendered does not mean they are not healthy. Hamsters are often surrendered because they are noisy at night or because two hamsters accidentally had a large litter., Reputable breeders are hard to find in some areas, but try searching the internet to see if one lives near you. Ask the breeder if they have signed the Internet Hamster Association of North America’s (IHANA) Code of Care and Breeder’s Code. This will ensure that they are safely breeding hamsters for good health and temperament., Many people accidentally put two hamsters of the opposite sex together, and they may have large litters of hamsters that need new homes. You can check your local listings, Petfinder, Adopt A Pet, or Craigslist to see if anyone is giving hamsters away. Always be careful when visiting a stranger’s home, but do ask if you can handle the hamster first. You may want to bring a friend.

, While not all pet stores are bad, some do buy their hamsters from breeding mills. Often, they stick several hamsters in the same cage, causing the hamsters to fight and injure one another. Crowded conditions can cause diseases to spread quickly through the population., When visiting a shelter or pet store, you can take certain measures to make sure that the hamster has grown up in a healthy environment. One way to do this is to examine their living area.While there will probably be some odor, it should not smell like ammonia.Syrian hamsters should not be kept in a cage together, or you might find that the hamster has injuries from fighting.
If the cage does not have plenty of chew toys, such as wooden blocks, paper towel rolls, or balls, you may find that the hamsters have dental issues.
Ask if they have been using pine or cedar shavings in the cage. These can cause respiratory issues in hamsters."

The discharge may be crusted around their eyes or nose; it may also be leaky and running. The nose of the hamster should be clean. The eyes should be clear, shiny, and black in color. Eyes should not be cloudy, bulging, or squinting., Give the hamster a small treat, such as sunflower seed. When they open their mouths, try to see if there are any problems with their teeth. Hamsters must continually gnaw on things to keep their teeth from growing too long. If the teeth are overgrown, it may be a sign that there is something wrong with the hamster., Lift the hamster up so that you have a clear view of their rear end. Check to see if the fur is stained or matted around their butt or belly. Does the fur look wet? You may want to use a finger to feel for any wetness around the belly area. Wet, matted, or stained fur on the underside of the hamster could be a sign of either wet tail or diarrhea, both of which can be fatal to hamsters. Other signs you can look for include:


Sluggishness
Low weight
Loss of appetite (or not accepting a treat you give them), A hamster’s coat should look glossy, thick, and smooth. It should be clean and free of droppings.Matted or patchy fur could be the sign of a disease. Part the fur with a finger. If the hamster has bald patches or if their skin is flaky, they may have a behavioral problem or a disease., Let the hamster run around, and see how they run and walk. There are certain genetic behavioral or psychological disorders that can be identified by the hamster’s walking behavior.


Hamsters should be able to walk in a straight line. If they keep turning in tight circles as they walk, they are demonstrating “waltzing” behavior. This may or may not be treatable by a vet.
Some dwarf hamsters may perform continual back-flips. This can be a compulsive behavior that, while cute, can interfere with the hamster’s well-being.
Some hamsters run along the same path repeatedly. Ask the breeder if the hamsters show this behavior often. Check to see if the shavings are worn thin by the compulsive behavior., Hamsters do fight with one another, leading to injuries. Check for any open wounds on the hamster. Run a finger through their fur to look at their skin. You may notice cuts or scars.


Mothers sometimes gnaw off ears or limbs of their litters.Make sure that the hamster you pick is not limping. Limping may or may not be permanent, but as hamsters are active creatures, it is important that they can run freely without being hindered.
Some injuries are not permanent. If the hamster has healed from their wounds, you may still consider taking them home.

Identify the source of the hamsters.,
Inquire about the hamsters age.,
Ask about the hamster’s aggression.,
Investigate their diet.",How to Choose a Healthy Hamster3," If you are at a store or shelter, you may want to ask where the hamsters came from. This will give you an indication of their early life and whether or not they will be healthy. You can ask:


“Where do you get your hamsters? Is it a local breeder? Can I check them out?”
“Was this hamster abandoned? Were they surrendered by their former owners? Do you know why?”

, Hamsters on average live two to three years. You may not want an older animal. Furthermore, young hamsters who have just been separated from their mother may be experiencing stress, which increases the risk of wet tail.While this should not prevent you from getting a young hamster, you should be extra diligent in checking for disease. You can ask:


“How old is this hamster? When were they born?”
“How long has this hamster lived in your store/shelter?”

, Talk to the breeder or staff about how aggressive the hamsters are. Check to see if they frequently charge the walls of their cage or attack hands that enter the cage. Don’t be alarmed if the hamster bites you at first. This is normal. Hamsters may be afraid of strangers, and they like to sleep during the day.Instead, make sure that they are held regularly by staff without problems; this is a sign that the hamster is tame. The biting will likely go away when they become used to you. Some questions you can ask are:


“Do your hamsters often bite you?”
”How often do you hold the hamsters? Every day? For how long?”
“I see you keep the hamsters all in one cage. Do they often fight each other?”
Dwarf hamsters are more likely to bite you than Syrian, but Syrian hamsters are more likely to be aggressive to each other., A hamster that has a varied diet of greens, mixed seeds, pieces of fruit and vegetables, and pellets are more likely to be healthy. Furthermore, by knowing about their current diet, you can keep the hamster on this diet when you take them home. Sudden changes in diet can make your hamster sick.You can ask:


“How often do you feed your hamsters fresh vegetables or fruit?”
“What kind of feeding schedule are these hamsters on?”
“Do you give your hamsters treats?”

Make sure no one at home is allergic.,
Determine if you can care for a guinea pig.,
Assess whether you can house a guinea pig.,
Consider how many guinea pigs to adopt.,
Adopt responsibly.,
Assess the health of a guinea pig.,
Make sure your pets won't reproduce.,
Complete the adoption process.,
Choose the right cage.,
Get healthy food for your pet.,
Arrange a vet checkup.",How to Adopt a Guinea Pig," In addition to guinea pig allergies, many people develop allergies to the hay that guinea pigs use in their cages. Before adopting a guinea pig, you and your housemates way want to talk to your doctor or an allergist to ensure that no one in your home will have an allergic reaction.One of the most common reasons people give up guinea pigs is an allergy, either to the animal itself or its hay/bedding.
Rule out allergies before adopting a guinea pig. That way you won't have to worry about giving up your family's pet.;
, Some people have the false impression that guinea pigs don't require much care or attention, but this is far from true. Guinea pigs live an average of six years. However, some guinea pigs live up to 10 years.In addition to regular cage cleaning, you'll need to spend time each day socializing with your pet. Because of this, guinea pigs can be a large time investment over several years.
Guinea pigs will also require proper nutrition and veterinary checkups. This can get quite expensive over the course of a guinea pig's lifetime.

, Adopting a new pet requires some practical considerations, like whether you can actually house animals in your home. Guinea pigs need adequate room to play and grow. A cage that houses two guinea pigs must be at least 7.5 square feet (2.3 square meters).Make sure you have room in your home to set up a cage this large.

, If you've decided to adopt a guinea pig, you may also want to consider adopting additional guinea pigs for your home. Guinea pigs are very social animals. Adopting a single guinea pig could leave your new pet feeling lonely, especially if it was previously housed with another guinea pig.Only adopt multiple guinea pigs if you have the space and the resources to raise these animals.

, Buying guinea pigs from a pet store creates more of a demand from breeders. This often leads to unethical breeding practices and inhumane conditions.Instead of buying a guinea pig from your local pet store, consider adopting one from your local animal shelter or rescue agency.Some rescue agencies deal exclusively with small animals like guinea pigs.
You can search online for animal shelters or rescue agencies. You can also ask your vet for recommendations on where to responsibly/ethically adopt a guinea pig.

, You should always conduct a visual inspection of an animal before bringing it home. Even if the shelter or rescue organization took good care of the animal, there's always a chance that it came from a home or breeder that neglected the guinea pig's health.Make sure the guinea pig's eyes are clean and completely open. Watery eyes are usually a sign of dental or respiratory ailments.
If the guinea pig's nose has any discharge, it could be a sign of an infection.
Examine the guinea pig's mouth to make sure it does not have any sores or crusts.
Crusting and/or white streaks in and around the ears is usually a sign of a fungal infection.
Check the guinea pig's feet. Any sores or dry patches could be related to an infection.
Look at the guinea pig's teeth and compare its incisor length to that of a healthy guinea pig. Overgrown incisors are painful and can lead to other health problems.

, It's very common for guinea pigs to experience problems during delivery.For this reason, it's generally recommended that inexperienced owners avoid situations in which their pet guinea pigs might breed.


Choosing guinea pigs of the same gender is one way to ensure your pets won't breed.You can also have your guinea pigs spayed or neutered to guard against breeding.

, Though the actual process of adopting a guinea pig will vary somewhat from one organization to the next, it's generally fairly simple. You will typically need to find a guinea pig you like, fill out an adoption application, meet the guinea pig in person, and pay the adoption fees.Be aware that many rescue organizations do not provide transportation carriers.
You'll most likely need to bring a carrier with you to the adoption so you can safely transport your new pet to your home.

, The standard cages sold in pet stores are generally not recommended by guinea pig experts for use with these animals.Your pet will need adequate space to live and play, which means you'll need a larger cage.


If adopting one guinea pig, you'll need at least 7.5 square feet (0.71 square meters) of cage space, though more space is better. A 30 inch by 36 inch (76 centimeter by 91 centimeter) cage is ideal.If adopting two guinea pigs, you'll need around 10.5 square feet (0.98 square meters) of cage space. Look for a cage that's 30 inches by 50 inches (76 centimeters by 127 centimeters).
With three guinea pigs you'll need about 10.5 square feet (0.98 square meters) of cage space, but some experts recommend a cage size closer to 13 square feet (1.2 square meters). Try to get a cage that measures 30 inches by 62 inches (76 centimeters by 157 centimeters).
When adopting four guinea pigs, you'll need even more room. Your cage should be at least 13 square feet (1.2 square meters) and measure about 30 inches by 76 inches (76 centimeters by 193 centimeters).

, Your guinea pig will need a balanced diet in order to grow strong and healthy. That diet should include packaged guinea pig pellets, hay, and fresh fruits and vegetables. Before you bring your pet home, you'll want to ensure that you have the right food picked out and ready.Your guinea pig's daily diet should be composed of roughly 80 percent hay, 10 percent store bought pellets, and 10 percent leafy greens.
Guinea pigs cannot produce their own vitamin C. Bell peppers are a good source of vitamin C for guinea pigs that won't introduce too much sugar into their diets.
For treats you can feed your guinea pig a small piece of cucumber, carrot, or fruit. Do not give your pet more than a half-inch (1.25 centimeter) piece of fruit or vegetable, and only give treats a few times each week.

, Once you've adopted a guinea pig, you'll need to get it checked out by a veterinarian. A vet can help you with spaying/neutering your guinea pig, as well as checking it for ringworm and other diseases.You can find a vet in your area by searching online or checking your local phone book.

Research hamsters and their habits.,
Talk to your parents.,
Be persistent without being annoying.,
Be patient.,
Plan financially for your hamster's care.,
Write a letter to your parents stating, gently but clearly, why you want a hamster.,
Your parents probably won't get you a hamster if you have a history of not being responsible or having bad grades.,
Draw an example of a hamster cage.,
Decide on a place to keep your hamster.,
Don't bring the hamster up too much.,
Pay for it yourself.",How to Convince Your Parents to Get You a Hamster,"


You'll learn that they live around 2-3 years. They are sensitive to light, heat, and many other things such as pets and small children. If you have cats or dogs that might try to eat it, think twice. They can't be kept in direct sunlight or in drafty areas, and need a pretty stable temperature such as 70 or 75 degrees. They also need to be handled every day to stay friendly, and need to have their cage cleaned once every two weeks or so. Don't clean it too often or they might get sick. Also, have a big cage: the bigger the better. You shouldn't get a hamster just because they're cute, you should get it because you are ready for the responsibility.;
, Tell them you have researched hamsters and looked up pet stores, shelters, and breeders around the area. Explain your plans to take care of the hamster. If your parents say yes, you will need a wheel without bars (solid surface so they don't get stuck), cage bedding, hamster food, a cage (really big and make sure it will fit in your room), and a water bottle.

, If they say maybe, you could be lucky! Go to the pet store to show them a hamster and tell them all the interesting things you've learned about hamsters. Get them interested in the subject and you may be able to change their minds.

, After a few weeks or days, they might say yes. If not, ask for the reason, but don't beg, give them more time to think about it if they need it . There are lots of reasons for and against getting a pet. For example, if you have other animals they might say something like ""We don't need a hamster"" or ""We have cats!"" If you know why they refused, you can either give up, or plan how to convince them in the future. If they say no, don't have a fit; just ask them again in a month or so and every once in a while drop them a hint that you still want one like tell them a fact or two.

, You'll need at least a hundred dollars, which you can get by selling lemonade or having a garage sale.

, Also, show that you consider the reasons for not having one use something like a pros and cons list. Your parents will be more likely to give in to the good and constructive argument.

, Try to do your chores without them asking you or try to get better grades in school. If your parents see that you are responsible enough for the upkeep of a hamster, they might let you have one!

, Include everything your hamster will need, and add the prices of all the items (cage included).

, If you have other animals, put it in a place separate from them, but try to put in a place where you go often, like the living room or your bedroom.

, It doesn't help with anything except making your parents feel more pressured.

, You may not want to, but it probably will help convince your parents. Also, it might be a little expensive they are not really cheap.Don't forget to set aside some money to pay for a vet trip if you have to.

Research a breed that will fit into your lifestyle.,
Pick a hamster based on a physical attributes that you like.,
Understand that gender plays a role in behavior.,
Ask yourself how you will be interacting with your hamster.",How to Choose a Hamster1," Just like other pets, hamsters have different personalities or lifestyles based on their breed. There are many different types of hamsters, so researching them are important to pick out a good friend for your house. Syrian hamsters -- Also known as golden or teddy bear hamsters, Syrian hamsters are the most popular breed. They are easy to handle and are great for children. They are best kept separate from other hamsters, and are completely nocturnal.
Dwarf Russian Campbell hamster -- Unlike Syrian hamsters, Dwarf Russian Campbell hamsters are social are do well in groups. They make good pets, but are not quite as easy to handle. They are also more active in the day time.
Dwarf Winter White Russian hamster -- Dwarf Winter White Russian hamsters are much like their Dwarf Russian Campbell cousins in temperament and lifestyle. They are a bit smaller and quite quick and have been known to bite when nervous. They may not be suitable for very young children, but their sweet and expressive personalities make them great pets for older children or adults.
Roborovski Dwarf Hamsters -- Due to their small size (1in-2.5in) and active nature, these hamsters are not necessarily the best for handling. They are social and good natured, and are nocturnal.
Chinese Hamsters -- Also known as Striped Hamsters, Chinese hamsters are slightly timid but can be handled well. They are a solitary breed, and can be aggressive if housed together. They are also nocturnal.;
, Hamster breeds come in all different sizes, colors, and hair length. Behaviors can also range between female and male hamsters.


Hamsters range from around 1 inch-7 inches, depending on the breed. Smaller breeds, like the Dwarf breeds, may not be best suitable for younger children. Larger breeds, such as Syrians, may be better suited for handling and interaction.
Hamsters come in many different colors and patterns. Syrian breeds are more golden, but also can have brown patterns that reflect the “teddy bear” name. Dwarf Russian hamsters can come in a beautiful white or gray color. Hamsters typically come in brown tones, but also can be white, black, gray, spotted, or striped.
You can choose a hamster with short hair or long hair, depending on breed time. Syrian teddy bear hamsters can sometimes be called “fancy,” which means they have long, silky hair.

, Female hamsters may be more aggressive than their male counterparts. If you plan on getting more than one hamster, experts suggest keeping them all the same gender.

, If you want to handle and play with your hamster, consider getting a breed that can handle this, such as a Syrian hamster. If you would like to observe hamsters in their habitat, a smaller, more active hamster, like a Dwarf variety, may be best for you.

Hamsters are relatively cheap to purchase. You’ll spend far more money on their toys, cages, and healthcare., A healthy hamster should have clean ears, a clean and dry bottom, a small rounded tummy, no bald spots or lumps (except for the scent glands on its thighs, which many mistake for cuts or scabs), clean bright eyes, and healthy teeth which aren't overgrown or curled upwards.If a hamster has wet fur around the rump, be especially wary; this is a sign of “wet tail” — a bacterial disease that spreads quickly through contact with other hamsters. The fur must be dry and clean. There are antibiotic treatments for wet tail, but if you just now picking out a hamster, try to find one that is healthy., Syrian hamsters may reach 5-7 inches (12.7-17.8 cm) in length as adults. Dwarf Campbell hamsters and Dwarf Winter White hamsters reach 3-4 inches (7.6-10.1cm). Chinese hamsters can grow to be 4-5 inches (10.1-12.7cm) long. And Roborovski hamsters barely reach 3 inches (7.6cm) in length as adults., Syrian hamsters are mostly golden, but they can come in a variety of colors. Dwarf Campbell hamsters are normally a grayish brown color with a black stripe down their back and with a white stomach. Dwarf Winter White hamsters come in white, with either a purple or grayish tint. Dwarf Roborovski hamsters are a sandy brown with a white stomach. And Chinese hamsters dark brown with an ivory stomach., If the staff or breeder (depending on where you go, of course) is uncomfortable with this, then ask for him to place his hand in the hamster enclosure. Avoid buying a hamster that bites or scratches aggressively. Also do not buy one that is extremely fearful — one that darts, hides, and does not reappear. A curious hamster who sniffs but doesn't climb right into your hand is a good choice. An individual that is curious and nips gently to test your hand (just as some puppies do) is another good choice., Your hamster will do best in a cage with a minimum of 450 square inches or 30 inches by 15 inches. It should also be more than 12 inches tall so as to be able to fir an adequately sized wheel, 10-12 inches for Syrians and 8 inches for Dwarfs. A glass aquarium (as long as it meets the minimum floor space) is a great home for a hamster. The disadvantage is the lack of ventilation, so make sure the lid wire mesh to allow for air movement. An IKEA Detolf is an excellent choice too. Alternatively, the ""cat tray with a wire top"" type of hamster cage do have good natural ventilation. Make sure your cage is not in direct sunlight as your hamster could overheat due to the bright rays magnifying on the aquarium glass. Unless they're second hand, aquariums can be expensive. You can also purchase wire cages, which have great ventilation.

, Make sure there is plenty of ventilation. Don't place the cage in front of a hot window. Make sure to find a place that is quiet and free of any other household pets such as dogs and cats. This will reduce the stress of your pet hamster. At no point should you let your dogs or cats interact with your hamster., You’d be amazed at how clever hamsters are at escaping. Make sure all holes are sealed and that no loose or removable parts can be opened by your hamster. Be sure if you have a wire cage that your hamster can't fit through the bars or get stuck. The bar spacing of your hamster's cage should be no more than 0.7 cm apart. , House Syrian hamsters alone. They are territorial starting at about the age of 5-8 weeks and will fight often to the death with another hamster if placed in the same space. Many Dwarf hamsters can be housed together as long as they are properly bonded from a young age.


The three species of Dwarf hamsters (Campbell's Russian dwarf, Winter White Dwarf, and Roborovski) can live alone or in pairs as long as they are introduced to each other properly. Don't pair different species of hamsters together. Mating pairs should not be permanently housed together as they may fight and injure each other., On the ground, there should be a layer of at least 2 inches (7.6cm) of bedding. Wood shavings such as pine and cedar are just not good for hamsters, as they cause many health issues. They can cause respiratory problems and may contain harmful oils. However, aspen bedding does not contain the same harmful oils and is perfectly safe for your hamster. Never use cotton bedding.. This is very dangerous for your hamster because it is indigestible, and strands of the bedding can wrap around limbs and extremities cutting off circulation and potentially killing your hamster.Any paper based bedding is ok. Even toilet paper is great for nesting material; just make sure it's not scented.

, Provide your hamster with enough food each day to fill both cheeks, approximately 15g (1/2oz) for a Syrian hamster or 8g (1/4oz) for a Dwarf hamster. Make sure you provide fresh food in their bowl every day. Your hamster is a hoarder, so it'll keep private stashes. Removing these stashes can be very stressful, so if you are worried about the quality of their stored food, remove it and replace it with fresh food exactly where your hamster had it.Choose an earthenware or metal dish for their food. This is the best type of feeding bowl as your hamster will simply chew through a plastic one., Your hamster won't drink much water at all, but when it does get thirsty, it is important that water is available. Do not put it in a dish, as the bowl can get dirty very easily, and your hamster may get wet and die. Instead, use a water bottle or dispenser. Change it every day if possible to keep the water fresh, or once every 3 days maximum. The water bottle can be cleaned by placing uncooked rice and a little water in the bottle, and then shaking it vigorously. The rice will dislodge any algae build-up. Remember to remove all the uncooked rice before returning the water bottle back to the cage.

, Seed mixtures allow the hamster to be picky and to select the tastier, less healthy items. Offer the pellets or blocks as the main or staple diet, and offer the seed mixture as a supplement. Make sure the hamster has ingested a good ration of pellets or blocks before offering the seed mixture., Make your hamster search for it. If you place it in a bowl, your hamster may become overweight and less interested in physical activity.

, This includes things such as candy, pasta, raw meat/fish, sugar, and desserts. Hamsters can develop diabetes. Foods that you might not consider high in sugar content will be too sugary for your hamster. This can be damaging to their health., Regularly feed treats twice or three times a week. Hamster favorites include carrots, cucumber, apples, bananas, peppers, lettuce, celery, kale, collard and dandelion greens and a bounty of other vegetables and fruits. Some of these foods can also be used in a hamster's daily diet. Hamster treats are also available at all pet stores, like yogurt chips, hamster chocolate drops or blocks of wood that the hamster likes to chew on. Some veggies and fruits are NOT safe to feed to your hamsters. Onions, almonds, beans, potatoes, fruits with seeds, avocados, chives, eggplants, scallions, spices, leeks, garlic, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes and citrus fruits are big no-nos., These come in many different sizes, colors, and flavors. Since your hamster’s teeth grow constantly, it'll need to slowly grind them down. Chew sticks are good for this. Keep trying new ones until you find one your hamster enjoys. Some hamsters will shun all chew sticks. If this is the case, you can expect your hamster to chew on other things in its habitat like the bars of its cage.

, When first bringing your hamster home, place it in its cage, with fresh food and water, and leave it alone. Cover the hamster's cage with a light cloth so that it can explore the cage or habitat in privacy. Make sure there is enough food, water, and toys to keep the hamster occupied for a few days, as you will should not go near the hamster during this initial period. If there are children, friends, or guests in the house, make sure they know not to disturb the hamster., After about 3 days of leaving your hamster alone, you and your hamster can start to become acquainted. When approaching the cage, speak softly to alert the hamster of your presence. Your hamster may be nervous at first, but remember he or she is not used to you yet and don't be discouraged. Start the things you should do daily such as changing food and water, as well as replacing old toys and putting in new toys. Also, try to remove soiled bedding. Your hamster will start to get used to your hand being in the cage., Have short taming sessions starting on the second week of your hamster being in its new home. Most hamsters are active during the early to late evening and throughout the night. Try to learn the hamster's individual routine and do taming sessions when it is most active. A good way to tame your hamster is to put your hamster in an empty bathtub then get in yourself. Bring in a few toys for your hamster to play with whilst its getting used to your presence. Do not force your hamster to play if it does not want to. If during the training stage your hamster bites/scratches do not punish it.To tame your hamster, place your hand in the cage. Let your hamster sniff it and explore it. If the hamster nips gently and not out of aggression, pull your hand back gently, but immediately let it explore your hand again. This will help the hamster learn that the hand is nothing to bite or fear. Next, place treats in your hand; seed mixtures are good for this because as a supplement to the pellet or block-type diet, hamsters love this food. Your hamster should become used to climbing onto your hand, learning that the hand is something to climb into. Gradually move the treat up your hand, as your hamster will become more and more comfortable climbing onto it.
If your hamster is showing good progress, try to let your hamster climb onto your hand and offer it treats right after it has. Your hamster will see your hand as a good thing. This time, let your hamster climb onto your hand, and lift the hand slowly off of the cage floor. Your hamster may be frightened at first, but speak softly and offer it treats to make it feel more comfortable. Sit on the floor during this step, as your hamster may decide to leap out of your hands and can be injured once falling from about 6-8 inches (15-20cm) off the ground., Although hamsters are nocturnal animals, they do shuffle around some in the day to get food and such. Although it may seem awake, it's not in the mood to play, unless you see that it feels otherwise. Likewise, keep other people around the hamster to a minimum. It's important that the hamster only bonds with you for now, as it will have plenty of friends later. But now, it needs to know that you are its companion and you will never harm it., The wheels that come with the cages are generally too small and isn't good for the hamster's back. A wheel is too small if your hamster's back curves upwards. Buy one that is minimum 20cm (7.9in) for a dwarf hamster and 28cm (11in) for a Syrian. Don't be afraid to go bigger.

, Toys such as toilet paper rolls, empty tissue boxes, tubes, tunnels, nest boxes, PVC piping, and hamster chew toys are fun for your hamster. Most hamster owners simply give the hamster a wheel and a ball to enjoy. As a result, the hamster will start to have unhealthy habits such as pacing and/or chewing the bars of a wire cage (if housed in a wire cage, that is). Your hamster needs more than just wheels and balls to occupy itself. Have enough toys so that you can rotate them and keep your hamster interested., Your hamster will relish the chance to explore outside of their cages. Having play areas also helps when you clean the habitat and need a place to put your hamster where it can't escape. You can use a plastic storage bin in your house or a small animal playpen sold in pet stores.Make sure that there are no dangerous items that the hamster has access to (such as electrical cords which your hamster will chew on) and that the room is escape-proof.

, While you are cleaning their home, place your hamster in their hamster ball or in a playpen. You want to take your time while you clean and you’ll need both hands. Do not try to hold on to your hamster with one hand while you clean with the other. It won’t be good for your cleaning job or for your hamster., Use regular dish soap mixed with water. Even the tiniest trace of other types of soap (like hand-wash) can prove uncomfortable for your furry buddy. Use special hamster or rodent cleaning soap, which you can buy from most pet shops.You can also use a vinegar solution to clean the hamster’s habitat., Make sure that all the water has evaporated and all of the cleaning solution has been removed. Remember that hamsters have sensitive noses and the scent of vinegar or soap will be bothersome., In order to retain the hamster's scent on the bedding, mix a small amount of unspoiled bedding with new bedding. Cheap bedding can be found at most grocery stores. Another good bedding is shredded tissue; you could also use shredded paper towel. Do not use newspaper, as the hamster will lick the ink off it and this will make it extremely ill. Never use pine or cedar wood shavings, as they are unhealthy for hamsters. Aspen is fine."

Pick a good pet store or breeder.,
Observe the hamster cages and habitat.,
Interact with the store employees.,
Ask to handle your hamster before purchase.,
Look for a healthy, young hamster.,
Take your hamster home.",How to Choose a Hamster2," Consider a smaller store over a large chain as they may have a smaller stock. This may mean they spend more time with the hamsters, making sure that they are healthy and ready to be sold.

, Make sure they are clean and the hamsters have access to fresh food, bedding, water. They should also have access to exercise.


If there are multiple hamsters in the habitat, they are probably young. Observe how they interact with each other. They should be inquisitive and active if awake. They should not be aggressive toward each other.
The hamsters should look well fed and well taken care of. They should appear to have bright eyes and shiny coats.

, Another way to assess the store is by interacting with the store employees. Ask questions about the hamsters, such as age and breed. They should be knowledgeable and readily helpful.


Ask for references from other customers. If you are unsure if the pet store is for you, ask if the store can provide references from other customers. You may be able to ask questions of these pet owners to inquire about the hamsters after they were purchased.

, If you are thinking about a breed that you plan on handling and interacting with, ask if you can hold your pick before you decide to pick it up. You will want to look for a few good attributes before purchasing.


Tameness. You want to make sure the hamster is not stressed or anxious while being held. It should not nip, bite, or squirm.
Interested rather than anxious. Your hamster should be interested in its surroundings rather than scared. If your hamster is looking around or sniffing for food, it is showing signs that it is relaxed.

, As hamsters have a life-span of about 2-3 years, you want to make sure you are taking home a healthy and happy friend. Observe these obvious traits before making a purchase.


Clear eyes, nose, and mouth
Dry, not runny, nose
Shiny coat
A steady gate
No overgrown teeth
A happy disposition
No hair loss
No lumps in body or fur

, The pet store or breeder may provide a small box to take home your hamster. Your hamster may feel trapped or anxious in the box, so it may crawl, chew, or dig.


It is important to go straight home with your new friend. You do not want to stress it out even more or allow it to escape!

Don’t make yourself sick by homing your new friend!,
Consider time responsibility.,
Feed and water your hamster responsibly.,
Afford to take care of your hamster.,
Create a suitable home for your hamster.",How to Choose a Hamster3," Make sure you aren’t allergic to hamsters or its bedding before you decide to house one. You can see if you have any reactions at the pet store near the hamster or rodent area. Hamster habitat can produce a lot of dust due to bedding so make sure you can handle this prior to committing.

, Ask yourself if you have the time and energy to take care of your new friend. Hamster are relatively low maintenance, but they still need fresh water and food daily. They also need their cages cleaned frequently and should be monitored for their health and well-being.

, You want to make sure your hamster has the proper amount of food and water each day. Do not underfeed your friend. Hamsters, if overfed, will hide their food in their cheeks or in their habitat.

, Having a pet is not necessarily cheap. Make sure you have the necessary funds to pay for things such as vet visits, food, toys, bedding, and other needs.

, Make sure you have everything you need before you bring home your furry friend. You should have:


Plenty of room -- hamsters like to burrow, hide, and explore. Your cage should be spacious enough for these activities.
Escape proof housing -- hamsters can be like little Houdinis. If your cage has bars, they should be sturdy and narrow enough that the hamster can not destroy or escape. All cages should have study lids.
Water and food bins -- You should feed and give fresh water to your hamster daily. Hamsters do well drinking from water bottles, which may save space in the enclosure.
Items to chew on -- Rodent’s teeth will grow continuously unless they are able to grind them down. Make sure you provide safe material (toys, like hamster-friendly sticks, that can be purchased at any pet store) to provide this much needed activity.
Bedding -- Hamsters like to burrow and also need something to relieve themselves on. Use aspen or other soft material to create a happy home for your new housemate. Never use cedar or pine wood bedding because it is bad for your hamster's respiratory system.

This way, your little friend will have a safe place to play. Your terrarium should be greater than 15 inches long by 12 inches wide and 15 inches high (38 by 30 by 38 cm).If you have a lot of toys or places for your hamster to climb and explore, though, you may need a bigger cage.;
, Line the bottom of the cage with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of bedding made of cellulose and plant-based fibers. This is important, as it will give your hamster a cozy and soft place to play, sleep, and walk through. However, avoid products that have dyes or chemicals, as they could irritate your hamster’s respiratory system. Stay away from:


Wood shavings
Cat litter
Corn cobs
Newspapers
Anything with an unnatural scent or smell, Just like children, hamsters need toys to play with. Without toys, they’ll be bored and generally unhappy. To avoid this, give your hamster several different types of toys. Some include:


A hamster wheel
Chew toys, like unpainted and untreated pieces of wood.
Walnut shells
Hard dog biscuits, Have your parents purchase a bag of hamster food mix. These mixes include seeds, grains, vegetables, fruits, and more. Diverse food is important, as it will give your hamster all the vitamins they need to be healthy.In addition to normal food, you should give your hamster treats occasionally. While you can purchase hamster treats at the store, your little friend will really enjoy bite-sized pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables.

, Put out multiple sources of water. One good source is a shallow dish of water. Another good source is a drip bottle you can hang on the side of the cage. This way, your hamster will always have plenty of fresh and clean water.Change your hamster’s water every couple of days. In addition, make sure to clean their water bowl with warm water and soap every week.

, While hamsters don’t need anything special to keep them comfortable, you should make sure that the temperature in their cage stays within certain limits. In most circumstances, the temperature in the habitat should be between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius)., Never put your hamster’s cage in direct sunlight. If you do, the temperature could climb very high, very fast. This could harm or even kill them. Instead, locate your hamster’s cage in a cool, shaded location with some indirect sunlight., Create a chart of your hamster-related duties. You can either download or create your own chart. This way, you’ll have a constant reminder of everything you need to do and when you need to do it. Once you have your chart and you’ve filled it out, post it in a place you’ll see it all the time.Consider putting aside fifteen minutes before school to feed your hamster, fifteen minutes after school to feed and check on your hamster’s water, and an hour on the weekends to clean the cage.

, Before you clean your hamster’s cage, you’ll have to trap it and then remove it from the cage. Do this by picking your hamster up and placing it in a temporary cage (with a top that closes). Its best to ask your parents or a sibling to help, as you might need a spare pair of hands. This is important, as your hamster could easily get out of your hands and run off., You should clean your hamster’s cage every week. When you do this, throw out whatever bedding material you used to line the bottom of the cage. This is important, as it can accumulate dirt and bacteria. If you leave it in too long, your hamster could get sick., After you remove the old bedding, you need to wash down the cage. Mix light dish detergent with warm water in a small bucket. Take a clean cloth and wipe down the inside surface of the habitat. Make sure to get the corners and other hard to reach places – you don’t want bacteria to accumulate there.


Wash any toys or other objects that are in the habitat.
Allow the habitat to dry before putting anything back in. If you want, you can take a towel and dry it down by hand., After you've washed the habitat and allowed it to dry, you need to restock the habitat with bedding. Again, make sure to line the floor of the cage with 1 to 2 (2.5 to 5 cm) inches of your chosen bedding product.

, Before touching your hamster, thoroughly wash your hands with antibacterial soap. This is important, as you don’t want to introduce bacteria or other contaminants into your hamster’s cage. In addition, you need to make sure you wash off any chemicals that could potentially poison your hamster.

, Be silent or very quiet when approaching your hamster or it may get scared. When you go to pick your hamster up, gently cup your hands around it. Then, slowly raise the hamster out of its cage and onto a safe surface.

, When you are done handling your hamster, place it carefully in its cage and close the door. This is important, as your hamster could easily escape if you leave the cage door or top unsecured.

, If you notice that your hamster seems sick, behaves weird, or has had any noticeable change over a short amount of time, you should tell your parents immediately. Some things to look out for include:


Weight loss
Loss of hair
Diarrhea
Lack of energy
Watery eyes
Problems breathing, Especially when you first get your hamster, you should let your parents know before you take it out of the cage. This is important, as your hamster could jump out of your hands, run under the door, and get lost in your house.


Go to your parents and ask politely, “I’d like to take the hamster out of its cage. Is this okay?”

, Since you’re the primary caretaker of your hamster, your parents likely won’t know if you’re running low on food, bedding, and other supplies. As a result, you’ll need to let them know when you are getting low. Make sure to give them several days’ notice so they have plenty of time to go with you to the pet store to get more supplies.

Provide the cage with a hamster wheel or ""tread-wheel"".,
Give your hamster a hamster ball.,
Provide the ability to indulge in climbing.,
Provide toys.,
Buy hamster tubes.,
Understand the importance of exercise for your hamster.,
Keep your hamster happy with exercise.,
Protect the hamster from hazards.,
Keep the water supply topped up.",How to Exercise a Hamster," This is a wheel that turns about when the hamster steps inside and causes the hamster to run as he continues to turn it around. When choosing a hamster wheel or tread-wheel, the following is recommended:


Ensure that the wheel is solid. If your hamster chews a great deal a solid metal wheel is best. Never use a mesh or barred wheel - these can cause serious injury because the feet can get stuck between the slats or bars.Check the wheel for size. Syrian/Golden hamsters need wheels that are at least 8"" in diameter although 10"" plus sized wheels are guaranteed to be large enough for their entire life. Dwarf species require wheels to be a minimum of 6.5"" in diameter. Wheels that are too small can cause severe back problems and is often a reason for hamsters not using them and subsequently becoming bored.Don't place a hamster wheel into a cage with a nursing mother; the mother may lose interest in her young and young hamsters tend to try to get in the wheel together and run on top of one another, thereby creating the potential for injury.;
, A hamster ball is another great way to give your pet some fun exercise in a safe way. The beauty of a hamster ball is that your hamster cannot fit under anything and get stuck; just make sure that the lid to the ball is closed tightly so that your hamster doesn't get loose. Also make sure that there are no stairs or other drop offs that your hamster could roll over. As with wheels, ensure that they are large enough to prevent damage to their spines. When using a hamster ball outside the cage, be present at all times so that you can fend off any other pets or hazards before they turn into a problem.
It is a good idea to lay down a hula hoop on the floor to provide a boundary that prevents the hamster ball from going anywhere else. You should still watch your hamster in the ball but this makes it easier to keep your hamster in one place.

, Hamsters love to climb, which is why providing a cage with horizontal bars on it is a great way to encourage your hamster to climb (it also provides terrific ventilation). Of course, the downside for you of a bar cage is that the mess drops out easily. Try to find ways to deal with this, such as having newspaper laid across the surface where the cage sits, or locating the cage inside a much larger base container to catch things that fall out.


If you have a Roborovski hamster, choose a mouse cage over a metallic hamster cage because the young ones can squeeze between the bars and escape.

, Play is exercise and toys are the tools of play that lead to exercise. There are quite a few hamster toys you can improvise, or you can buy them from the pet store if preferred. Here are just some ideas to get you started:A piece of sisal rope: Hang it from the top of the cage. This is great for climbing practice.

Build hamster toys out of household items such as empty kitchen and toilet paper rolls. These are very similar to the movement provided by the hamster ball, these will delight the hamster for ages until he discovers he can chew it up too!
A stump of wood or tree twigs taken from fruit or willow trees. These will give the hamster something to chew on (jaw exercise) as well as material to carry about and build with.
Small smooth stones or pebbles of interesting shapes: These could act like mini-weights, as the hamster carries them about, rolls them, and tries to build things with them.
Tin cans which have had all sharp ends removed. This can make a good metallic tube for the hamster to explore.Jar without a lid. This can be another fun place to explore and roll around in.
Boxes with multiple openings. This can provide good exercise through hunting and seeking to get through and around the boxes. You could also place differently sized boxes inside a large container to make an open playpen for your hamster to explore.

, You can buy hamster tubes to create an elaborate labyrinth for your hamster to climb in. This gives the hamster a lot of places to climb and plenty of tubes to run around through. Buy a few to extend your cage, or buy many to make the tubes cover an entire wall. Remember, Syrian hamsters might not fit in the tubes and get stuck, so make sure your hamster is small enough to get trough the tubes., Hamsters need exercise to prevent them from becoming obese and to mimic the running about that they'd be doing if they lived in the wild. Insufficient exercise for your hamster can lead to obesity,and even to paralysis in some hamsters. The great thing about hamsters is that if you give them the means to exercise, they will.

, Hamsters get bored if they don't exercise. They may become lethargic, irritable, and destructive. Bored hamsters can chew on the cage and destroy items in their cage. They may also be difficult to handle. Exercising a hamster will keep it happy and help prevent this., When your hamster is playing outside its cage, make sure you hamster-proof the room. Hazards such as electrical cords, toxic plants, small hiding spaces, pets, and drop offs like stairs can cause injury to your hamster. Try putting your hamster in a playpen.If you have the hamster out of the cage, make sure you are supervising it so it doesn't get hurt.

, Hamsters need to stay well hydrated. Ensure that the hamster's water supply is adequately filled at all times.


If the hamster is playing outside of its cage, like in a hamster ball, make sure to make the hamster take a break every 15-20 minutes so it can eat and drink water.You can place them in the ball 2-3 times a day.

Let your hamster adjust to his new environment.,
Wash your hands.,
Place your hand inside the cage.,
Pick him up.,
Do not punish your hamster if he bites.",How to Play With a Hamster1," Handling your hamster is a great way to bond with your hamster, but he will need some time to adjust to his new home. Give him about 12 to 24 hours to explore his cage and become comfortable with his surroundings. During this time, you can gently talk to him or interact with him, but do not put your hand in his cage.









Your hamster will need a large cage so that he has plenty of space to run and play. The minimum size cage is 59 cm x 36 cm X 25 cm (approximately 23 in x 14 in x 10 in). Ideally, his cage should also have some tubing and ladders.;
, Hamsters do not see very well and typically use their nose to pick up on cues from their environment. For example, if you have just eaten something and then go to handle your hamster, he will smell the food on your hands and may try to bite you. If you have more than one hamster, one hamster could pick up on the scent of the one that you just handled, which could be perceived as being attacked by the other hamster.


Use unscented soap to wash your hands
If you are handling multiple hamsters, wash your hands before and after handling each hamster.

, Before your hamster will be comfortable with you handling him, he will first need to get used to your hand. Place your hand in his cage and leave it there for him to sniff and explore. If he tries to bite or nibble your hand, pull your hand away slowly and gently blow on his face to discourage that behavior.


Hamsters are prey animals, so putting your hand in his cage could resemble a bird reaching down to swoop him up. The more comfortable he becomes with your hand, the less afraid he will be of you picking him up.
It may take anywhere from a few hours to a few days before he is used to your hand.
Feeding him treats can also help him get used to your hand being in his cage., When your hamster no longer sees your hand as a threat, you can start picking him up. Slowly reach into the cage and let him see and sniff your hand first. Then, place one hand under his chest and one hand on his bottom and gently lift him up towards you. Talk to him in a gentle voice and make sure not to squeeze him too tightly.


Sitting on the ground or standing over a tabletop are the best places to hold him. Your hamster may want to jump, which could cause injury, so you want to make sure that you are as close to a solid surface as possible.
After you pick him up, you can also try lying back on the floor and allowing him to walk around on your chest.If you are having trouble picking him up in your hands, you could also lift him outside of his cage by gently nudging him into a cup or small bowl.
Keep in mind that hamsters generally do not enjoy being handled for long periods of time.Begin by holding him for a few seconds and gradually increase the amount of time that you hold him.If he gets squirmy, place him back in his cage as gently and slowly as you picked him up.
Because they are prey animals, hamsters are wary of sudden changes in their environment. Slowly reaching in and picking up your hamster will help reduce his fear that he is being scooped up by a predator.

, Hamsters generally do not respond to punishment because they cannot make a clear association between the behavior and the consequences. Rather than yelling or hitting your hamster, you can gently blow on his face and say “no” in a firm voice. The air on his face will probably cause him to rear back and squint. That should be enough to discourage him from biting you again.

Watch for signs of illness.",How to Care for Old Hamsters," This will ensure that your hamster will be able to reach everything in his cage easily without too much effort or discomfort. , The bedding in your hamster’s cage should be cleaned out and changed once a week. This is where your hamster’s excrement goes, so you don’t want to keep that around for too long. It’s unsanitary and will cause an odor. Throw the old bedding in the garbage and replace it with new, clean bedding., It is important to keep your hamster’s cage clean, especially in their old age. You should remove the contents of the cage once every two weeks and thoroughly clean everything. Use something mild to clean it with like soap and water, rather than something with harsh cleaning chemicals that might harm your pet.Make sure you put you hamster in a secure location while you are cleaning their cage – like an empty trashcan or a bathtub with the drain stopped.

, Older hamsters are less mobile than younger hamsters. Keep their toys stored in areas of the cage that they can reach without difficulty. If you notice that your hamster isn’t playing with a certain toy anymore, try moving its location to somewhere your hamster can reach it more easily.

, You should give your hamster a stoppered water bottle so that they have continuous access to water. If you put a bowl with water in their cage, they will fill the bowl with bedding and other items. So it is important that you give them a water bottle instead.

, Make sure your hamster gets a balanced diet – this will lead to increased overall health. There are several different types of food you should consider.Pellets. These are easy to find in any pet store and include lots of different foods all ground together.
Mixed seeds/grains. This kind of food gives your pet some variety, but also meets their dietary needs.
Snacks. To give your hamster a completely balanced diet, give them some fresh foods every once in a while. Try carrots, grapes, celery, etc. But only give them small portions because they will hoard the leftovers and you don’t want your hamster eating a bunch of rotten food.

, Make special provisions considering your hamster’s age. For example, if your hamster has lost any teeth because of old age, mush his food together to make it easier for him to eat.

, Just like with their toys, you want to make sure that your hamster can easily reach all of their food and water. You don’t want them to be unable to eat because it hurts them to get to their food. Make sure your hamster is eating and drinking regularly to ensure that there are no problems with this.

, Old hamsters need exercise too. It will help them stay strong and healthy at the end of their life. Try to gently play with your hamster, encouraging it to move around and be active.

, One of the first signs of old age in a hamster is decreased levels of exercise. Make sure your hamster has access to an exercise wheel so that they can use it whenever they want. This is an easy and important way for pet hamsters to remain active even in old age., If your hamster’s health allows, let them roam around in a hamster ball. These balls provide a great deal of exercise for hamsters because all of their movement is powered by their body. But make sure you keep an eye on your older hamster to make sure they don’t get too tired.

, All hamsters should be handled carefully, but older hamsters especially so. Just as elderly humans have hurts and aches in their bodies, old hamsters do too. Be gentle when you pick up your hamster and be sure to show extra care when carrying him or placing him back in his cage.

, Hamsters are generally sensitive to sound, but older hamsters are even more so and can startle more easily. Avoid making loud, startling sounds around your hamster. Speak in a soft, calming voice when you interact with your hamster. This will soothe him and make him more comfortable., As hamsters get older, their behavior may change slightly. This is common for most living things. An older hamster might get grumpier or seem less social than it was when it was younger. That’s okay. Just realize that this is a sign of old age, not that your hamster doesn’t like you anymore.

, As your hamster ages, it is important to pay more attention to its health so that you can be prepared if something happens and your hamster needs medical attention. Watch for changes in behavior or physical symptoms.In general, hamsters live for about 3 years. So, once your hamster is about 2 years old, you should start watching for problems. Take your hamster to the vet if you have any questions or concerns.

Good sportsmanship is a necessity in dressage, if you are causing a disturbance or arguing with the judge you will be disqualified.",How to Dress for a Dressage Show," These are normally black, but can be brown. The European design, which are taller, have overtaken the more traditional hunting boots. The outside of the boot is extended to partially cover the knee. This gives the leg a longer appearance. At lower levels, jodhpur (short) boots and matching garters are allowed. Children are allowed to wear jodhpur boots on their own. Half chaps shouldn't be worn. Be sure to clean and polish your boots well before a show.;
, Breeches are more comfortable under long boots and garters, and are also cooler. Many dressage riders wear 'full seat' breeches, or jodhpurs with a patch of grippy leather over the seat. This helps to 'stick' you to the saddle. Whether you prefer full seat or regular, wash them well. No stains allowed!

,, If it is warm or you have a heavy jacket you can choose to wear a bib, which looks like a shirt when a jacket is over the top. If it is very warm you may be allowed to compete without jackets, and you will also want the warm up without a jacket. If you think that jackets may be waived, make sure the shirt is a flattering fit and well ironed. Make sure it has a small loop at the back of the neck for your stock.

, Pin the tails to your shirt with small safety pins and insert a stock pin horizontally though the knot.

, Make sure that the sleeves cover your wrist ever so slightly when your arms are bent. You may also want to invest in a tailor in order to improve the fit of the jacket. Try to wear a suitable weight for the weather. At lower levels you can wear a tweed hacking jacket, at higher levels you must wear tails and a waistcoat. Dark brown jackets are now making their way into the arena, but can get a mixed response from the judges. Black is the safe, traditional color choice.

, Choose a colour to match your jacket.

At lower levels, especially in eventing (you are now required to wear a helmet while jumping) you can wear a hat with a velvet cover.

, If you are wearing a hat rather then a helmet you will have to remove it when saluting the judges, therefore extra care is needed to make sure both long and short hair is neat under the hat. For men with long hair it is best to secure the hair in a tight knot at the back of the head with a black hair band, all hair must be up.

,, On the wrong canter lead? Smile, it's counter-canter. Can't remember the test? Smile, it's freestyle. Keep smiling no matter what - it will endear you to the judges and the crowd.

Hamster-proof the area.,
Place him in an exercise ball.,
Place him in a large playpen.,
Allow him to run around in an open area.,
Look for your hamster if he runs away.",How to Play With a Hamster2," Your hamster will need daily playtime outside of his cage.To make this an enjoyable experience for him, you will need make sure that his play area is safe. For example, you will need to remove or hide any electrical cords that he could nibble on. You should also block any possible areas where your hamster could squeeze or hide in, such as under furniture or between couch cushions.


If you have other pets, they should not be allowed in your hamster’s play area.
A clean bathroom is a good area for your hamster to play in. Make sure that the toilet lid is closed so that he does not accidentally fall in the toilet.

, An exercise ball is a great way for your hamster to exercise. Exercise balls are available at your local pet store in different varieties. Because hamsters do not see very well, make sure that the exercise ball you choose is made of clear plastic.After you gently place your hamster in the ball, put a piece of tape over the ball’s door so that it does not open while your hamster is in the ball.Place the ball in a carpeted area, which will give the ball extra traction.Supervise your hamster closely when he is in the ball so that he does not run into any furniture or get too close to a set of stairs.
Keep him in the ball for no longer than 20 minutes and provide him with food and water when you place him back in his cage.

, A playpen is another way that your hamster can play outside of his cage. Ideally, the playpen should be larger than his regular cage. To make the playpen fun for him, place some of his toys inside of it. Supervise him closely so that he does not climb out of his playpen and escape.









Playpens are available at your local pet store.

, You can also let your hamster explore the hamster-proofed area without being in an exercise ball or playpen. If you are in the bathroom, you could place him in the tub and let him run around. Place some of his toys in the open area and create some obstacle courses to keep him interested.








The obstacle course can be made of common household items, such as empty cardboard boxes and toilet paper rolls.

, Despite your best efforts to hamster-proof the area and keep a close eye on your hamster, he may still find a way to escape and hide. If you cannot find him when playtime is over, check the places where he would be most likely to hide: behind or underneath furniture, between seat cushions, inside of drawers or boxes, etc.


If you have searched all of these places with no luck, consider placing food near or inside of his cage to encourage him to come back to his cage.

Supervise your hamster.",How to Play With a Hamster3," An exercise wheel is considered the mainstay of a hamster’s exercise. An exercise wheel with wires could injure your hamster’s paws, so select an exercise wheel that has either a solid or mesh bottom. Also, look for one that can attach to one of the interior sides of your hamster’s cage.The exercise wheel should be large enough (minimum 12 inches in diameter) to prevent your hamster’s back from bending when he is running on the wheel.Listen to the wheel when your hamster is running on it. If it is noisy, you may want to consider moving your hamster’s cage to an area outside of your bedroom. Hamsters are nocturnal animals, so your hamster would likely be running on his cage during the night., Your hamster will want to do more than just run on his exercise wheel. He will also enjoy running through tunnels and having toys that he can nibble on. The chew toys will help keep your hamster’s teeth filed down.Rather than buying a lot of toys at your local pet store, you could make homemade toys.








, Although your hamster will likely not escape from his cage, you still want to make sure that his play is safe inside of his cage. For example, if his cage is made of wire, he may try to climb up the sides of the cage. Not only could the wire injure his paws, but he could also get seriously injured if he falls down when trying to climb.








If you see him trying to climb, you could slowly reach into his cage and gently place him back on the cage floor.

A show shirt is worn sometimes with a white stock tie or ratcatcher, plus a pin.
A show shirt is usually white but can be light blue, light purple, light pink or peach.

, Make sure you have jodhpurs you feel comfortable wearing because, depending on your chosen class, you'll be spending a lot of time in them.

, Boys should keep their hair short enough to stay under a hat or long enough that it can be tied back easily. Girls should do the same but preferably have their hair long enough to be styled neatly under a hat, using a hairnet. Hair is worn up in a hairnet most of the time.


Ask someone how to put your hair in a hairnet if you don't know how to do it.

, A neat plait or bun can go a long way to making you look more polished in the ring so try to style hair neatly before going into the ring.

, This is obligatory. Black is the preferred color. Some popular brands are Charles Owen, Samshield, and GPA. Some cheaper alternatives are Ovation or IRH.

, Your hat should always have a recognisable standard. Within a show ring you should wear a velvet hat with leather strap and the velvet of the hat should match the colour of your velvet jacket collar.

, Gloves you wear in the show ring should be comfortable enough to wear on a day to day basis but should look clean and not overly worn. They should match the colour of other leather accessories such as whip, boots and tack.

, Your whip should once again match the leather colour of other items, also there are usually restrictions on whip length under certain show societies.

Shop around for a hamster cage.,
Purchase appropriate bedding for your hamster.,
Use toilet paper rolls and cardboard boxes as hiding places.,
Watch for your hamster’s food to go on sale.,
Share healthy treats with your hamster.,
Opt for a ceramic bowl.,
Find a stick for your hamster to chew on.,
Select a few useful toys for your hamster.,
Let your hamster out to play.",How to Care for a Hamster on a Small Budget," Your hamster’s cage is the most important purchase that you will make because they will spend most of their time here. This will likely be your biggest expense when you first get your hamster, but keep in mind that you only have to make this purchase one time. Wire and plastic cages are the cheapest type of enclosure for your hamster at around $35. Make sure that you choose a cage that will provide plenty of room for your hamster to roam and hide out.Also, if the cage is made from wire, make sure that there is a solid plastic cover on the bottom. Your hamsters feet may get caught in wires, which may cause an injury and require a trip to the veterinarian.Compare prices at your local pet store to find the best cage at a reasonable price.
Check local ads for sales and coupons as well. You may be able to pick up a cage for your hamster at a deeply discounted price if you time it right.;
, While it may be tempting to shred some newspapers or borrow some cat litter to avoid purchasing bedding for your hamster, these are not appropriate alternatives. The chemicals in these materials can be harmful to your hamster’s health. Be sure to purchase bedding that is meant for hamsters.Avoid any kind of bedding that is made from wood shavings, corn cobs, cat litter, or newspaper.
Choose bedding that made from cellulose or plant-based paper fibers.

, There are all sorts of fancy modular hiding places that you can get for hamsters, but they will enjoy climbing in and out of toilet paper tubes and small cardboard boxes just as much.


Try asking your family members to save toilet paper and paper towels for you to give to your hamster.

, Your hamster will need to be fed a tablespoon of hamster pellets or a seed mix every day.This may be one of your major expenses for your hamster, but you can watch for sales and coupons to cut down on the costs.


Buying your hamster’s food in bulk may help you to save some money. Compare the price per pound of the small bags of food versus the large bags to see if this might be a good option. You might end up spending more up front by buying in bulk, but you could save a few bucks in the long run.

, Hamsters need to have a small piece of fresh fruits or vegetables every day, so it is important to keep these on hand. Most of the foods hamsters like to eat are ones that you can eat as well, so you can share a piece with your hamster whenever you have a healthy snack. Some of the low-cost snacks that hamsters like to nibble on include:Apple slices
Cauliflower flowerets
Lettuce leaves

, Plastic bowls may be cheaper than ceramic ones, but your hamster will quickly chew and scratch the bowl until you end up having to replace it. That is why a ceramic bowl is best for hamsters.You can purchase a ceramic bowl for your hamster, or you might also consider designating a small ceramic bowl from your kitchen as a bowl for your hamster. This way you will not have to buy one.


You can also provide a ceramic bowl of water for your hamster instead of purchasing a water bottle. The advantage of a water bottle is that your hamster can’t tip it over or get food or feces in it.If you do opt for a ceramic bowl to keep your hamster’s water in, then make sure to use a heavy bowl to reduce the chances of spills. Check the water dish a couple of times per day and replace it any time it gets dirty.
A very small terra cotta water saucer also works well for a food bowl, especially since many people have one lying around the house.

, Hamsters need to chew because their teeth never stop growing. Check your yard for a stick from a fruit tree that your hamster can use as a chew toy. For example, if you have an apple or pear tree in your yard, then you could harvest a stick and give it to your hamster to chew on.Your hamster can also chew on dog biscuits to wear down its teeth, so you could also pick up a box of dog biscuits for small dogs. Whimzees or Greenies are a good choice, as they don't contain harmful ingredients like onions.

, While you may not be willing to spend money on a giant toy collection for your hamster, you may want to invest in a few useful toys to help keep your hamster happy. Some useful toys to consider include:A hamster ball. Your hamster can get lots of exercise by running around your house in his ball. Always make sure to keep an eye on your hamster when he is using it though.
Wheel. Hamsters love to run, and you might not always be there to let them out for playtime. By providing your hamster with a wheel, he can get his exercise whenever he needs. Wheels are usually considered as mandatory. Buy a solid wheel that is large enough for your hamster's species, as upgrading to a large wheel after spending money on a smaller wheel only wastes money in the long term.
Chewing blocks. Your hamster needs to chew to keep his teeth trimmed down, so it is a good idea to keep a chewing block in his cage at all times., Hamsters need lots of exercise, and playing with your hamster is free! Try letting your hamster out of their cage for a couple of hours every evening. Just make sure to protect your hamster by putting up hazards and keeping track of where your hamster is at all times.


Close your bedroom door and cover hazards like wires before you let your hamster out to play.

Research pet cemeteries.,
Make a budget.,
Hold a funeral.",How to Bury a Hamster2," Pet cemeteries should provide transparency when it comes to how your hamster’s body is tracked and handled. They should care for you as an aggrieved pet owner and be a trustworthy businesses. A good place to start researching cemeteries is the International Association of Pet Cemeteries and Crematories., Cemeteries offer many different services each with different price points. You will be charged a fee for the burial and for maintenance of the grave. It will cost more if you want the grave to be in a special location or the hamster to have a special casket., Your cemetery may allow you to host a gathering to say goodbye to your hamster. If not, consider taking a moment at your house, a favorite park, or some other meaningful place to get some closure. "

Research cremating services.,
Consider your budget.,
Dispose of the ashes.,
Leave the ashes to be professionally disposed of.",How to Bury a Hamster3," You can have your hamster cremated at a veterinarian’s office or at a pet cemetery.

, As with professional burial, there are several price points associated with cremation. The least expensive option is to have your hamster cremated with other animals. If you would like your hamster cremated by itself so that you can take home the ashes, it will cost more., Again, check with your city to find out what is allowed. Some ideas are to scatter your hamster’s ashes in your yard, a park, or in river or lake. Make sure that you are not disposing of the ashes on private property., You can chose to have the ashes buried or scattered. Some businesses will provide you with a certification of cremation and a small memento of your pet.

Bring a water bottle.",How to Dress for a Riding Lesson," Pick a pair of shoes that protects your feet and legs from injury. They should come up over your ankle so there is no risk that low laces or tongues will get caught in the stirrups. Look for shoes with a strong shank that support your ankles.
, A shoe with a small heel will keep your feet from slipping out of the stirrups. A nice pair of hiking boots or western boots is your best option in lieu of official riding shoes., Look for shoes with a medium tread to provide the appropriate level of traction. Cowboy boots with a smooth leather sole will be too slippery and put your feet at risk of sliding out of the stirrups. On the other end of the spectrum, shoes with heavy waffle tread may be dangerous if you fall. Tread that is too heavy can cause your shoe to jam in the stirrup., Protect your lower leg and support your ankle as you become a more advanced rider. Look for relatively affordable, standard leather riding boots or riding sneakers that offer the necessary arch support. They usually start at $100.If you're riding English-style, invest in a pair of paddock boots., Always wear a long pant to protect your legs from chaffing against the saddle. Jeans should be tight enough so that they won't slip off or get caught on anything, but loose enough that you can still lift your leg without difficulty. Try stretchy jeans or jeggings without an inside seam for more flexibility.

For Western-style riding, jeans are your best bet. The uniform for English-style lessons, on the other hand, gets more specific as you advance.

, If you are getting serious about your English-style lessons, consider buying a pair of these stretchy riding pants to increase your leg flexibility. The fabric is sturdy enough to keep you from getting pinched in the saddle but stretchy enough that you can move around freely. You even get extra defense against injury with suede or faux-suede knee patches., Improve your performance and leg-grip with wind resistant riding chaps. You'll not only have an extra strong grip on your horse, but also a higher tolerance towards cold winds. Half chaps that go from your knee to your ankle are also a good investment for lower leg protection.Fleece riding pants, long underwear, insulated ski pants, or wind pants are best to keep the cold air at bay during your winter lessons.

, Choosing a top for your lesson is relatively simple since any well-fitting top that allows you to move around will do the trick. It's more important for you to avoid certain styles like tank tops with thin straps or long, loose sweaters and t-shirts that might get tangled in the riding equipment.

Wear a brightly colored top for added visibility while you ride.
Keep your arms and shoulders free while still layering for warmth with a vest.

, You'll feel like an expert at your very first riding lesson in a professional looking polo shirt. If you wear this traditional English-style top, you will demonstrate how serious you are about learning to ride and make a good first impression on your instructor., If you plan to ride in the cold on a regular basis, a riding coat provides room through the torso so you can stay warm without restricted movement. Gussets make room for your jacket to spread across the saddle rather than get tucked under you. Many of these special coats come with reflective patches that will give you extra visibility on the trails., At any moment your horse might get spooked, or stumble and accidentally throw you off. The best way to ensure your safety is by wearing a ASTM/SEI certified riding helmet. ASTM/SEI certification denotes a quality standard that has been tested specifically for horseback riding. If your riding school does not provide a helmet, you will need to buy one.Helmets usually start at $30 and go up to $300., Bicycle helmets are designed to protect you from bicycle injuries. They leave the back of the head, the forehead, and the sides of the head vulnerable if you come into contact with a horse's hoof. A bike helmet is simply too flimsy in case you fall., Keep your hair out of the way by pulling it into a low ponytail or bun that won't interfere with the comfort of your helmet. Loose hair can get caught and make it harder for you to see. If you fall and your horse steps on your hair it might be painful.

, Gloves will safeguard your hands against chafing caused by the reins. For this reason, many riders opt to wear riding gloves all year round. Skinny nylon gloves are slippery and provide a less-than-ideal shield against wind. A good pair of gloves will help you maintain a strong grip on the reins while protecting your hands against the cold., Preserve heat under your riding helmet by adding extra layers like a fleece hat liner or headband. Take it even further with a cap and face mask combo. In case of wind, protect your neck and chest with a neck warmer to prevent chapping., Add a thick layer under your cool leather boots to keep your feet toasty warm on the coldest of days., If it rains during your lesson wear a fitted rain coat that will give you the flexibility to move around as needed. If you don't have a raincoat, bring a poncho. A loose poncho may be hazardous so you'll need to take precautions to secure it. Prevent your poncho from flying up or spooking the horse by belting it with a strong rope like twine.As a beginner you can get away with wearing rubber boots or wellies to a rainy lesson.

, Horseback riding can get hot very quickly so don't forget to bring a water bottle to your lesson. Try a camelback, or hook a bottle to your saddle on particularly hot days."

Make sure the nails are spaced far enough apart from one another so that they can comfortable be fitted with an ear of corn. , Drive full ears of corn onto the nails you inserted into the piece of wood you selected. Make sure the ears are spaced far enough apart to allow multiple squirrels to access them at once. , Make sure that the feeder is placed in an area that is ideal for the squirrels and also accessible to you. You will need to be to access the feeder to replenish the food supply.


If your primary aim is to observe the squirrels that come to your yard to feed, make sure the feeder is located in an area that will be visible to you.

, The vast majority of show classes permit any rider to wear safety headwear in any class, as long as that helmet is conservative and otherwise complies with discipline rules regarding rider attire. This allowance includes disciplines such as saddle seat and dressage, where a helmet may not be considered traditional.

, A riding hat that has been tested to national safety standards will have a mark on the inside, so remember to look for this whilst you are buying. Know the standard used by your country, and ensure that your helmet has been certified to that safety standard.

, To check it if fits, try the helmet on and adjust it to fit. This may include a knob at the rear of the helmet, laces, straps, buckles, etc. Turn your head rapidly to the right and left, and nod your head quickly. Ensure that the fit is snug, but not too tight. Make sure that you are able to breathe comfortably and that your helmet straps do not put uncomfortable amounts of pressure on your throat. If the helmet wobbles all around after the straps have been adjusted, it is too big on you. If you can grasp the sides of the helmet and wobble it in any direction once the straps have been adjusted, the helmet is too large.

Find a breeder.,
Ask the right questions.,
Be wary of pet stores.,
Take in the environment.,
Do a nose-to-tail check.,
Ask questions about the sugar glider's background.,
Recognize signs injury or illness.,
Watch for dehydration.,
Stay away from flea markets and glider mills.,
Ask questions about a sugar glider's personality.,
Prepare for setbacks, even when being cautious.",How to Pick a Healthy Sugar Glider," If you want a sugar glider, your best option is to find a breeder. Breeders work specifically with sugar gliders and will have more knowledge about how to care for them, therefore increasing the risk of you obtaining a healthy pet.


Finding a sugar glider breeder can be difficult. It's not as easy as finding a breeder for a particular kind of dog as there are few specific networks for breeding sugar gliders. However, browsing the internet for breeders in your area is a good start. As sugar glider breeders aren't very common, you may have to travel to work with a breeder.
Use some discretion. If a breeder offers to simply ship you a sugar glider, for example, this is a bad sign. A quality breeder will want to have some contact with potential owners to assure that his gliders receive quality care. You may have to contact several potential breeders before you find a good fit.;
, When you do make contact with a breeder, you should ask certain questions. A good breeder will be more than willing to address your concerns as his or her goal will be finding a loving, safe home for his gliders.


Ask the breeder how long he's been in the business, if he has a USDA license, if he offers after care support, and whether his gliders come with a health guarantee. You should also ask if you can see the pedigree information for your glider to make sure he has a healthy family tree.
Ask the breeder how he cares for his gliders. Sugar gliders that are not well cared for are more likely to have health problems. Ask what kind of diet he supplies, what care regimens he follows, and any problems he's had with buyers in the past.A good breeder will not hesitate to answer these questions. He should be able to provide fully thought out answers that show he genuinely cares about the health and wellbeing of his animals.

, A pet store is another option when buying a sugar glider. While it's better to go through a breeder, it's not always an option as you may not find a breeder in your area. If you have to go to a pet store, understand there are certain risks.


Pet store workers may not have as extensive knowledge of sugar gliders. They may not provide the healthiest diet or environment, which can increase the risk of your glider having health problems. Pet stores may also buy gliders from mills where gliders are bred poorly, leading to an increased risk for genetic conditions.
If you do go to a pet store, ask some of the same questions you might ask a breeder. A pet store owner or worker may have less extensive answers but should still be able to provide you some information. You should choose a pet store where your questions are addressed the most thoroughly. Pet stores vary in quality and choosing a more renown, responsible pet store can increase the likelihood of you bringing home a healthy sugar glider.

, You should never have a sugar glider shipped unless it's the only option. It's always best to check out the environment beforehand. This will allow you to see if the glider is being housed in a safe space. A poor quality habitat can translate to health problems later on. Consider the following questions when evaluating a sugar glider's environment.


Are the sugar gliders kept in clean environments? Are their cages or containers spacious so that they can move around freely?Is the temperature being monitored by a thermostat to assure that's it's neither too warm or too cold? Do the animals have enough food or water? Are water and food bowls clean and easily accessible?Are the sugar gliders provided with toys and other forms of entertainment? If a sugar glider gets bored, this could lead to behavioral problems later on., A good pet store or breeder will allow you to handle your sugar glider before purchase. When doing so, do a nose-to-tail check to make sure your glider's in good health.


The eyes, nose, and ears should be clean and clear. There should be no discharge or unusual colors, as this indicates illness.Does the glider have all of its teeth? Is his mouth free of signs of infection?Do the glider's legs appear strong and free of injury? A sugar glider should be able to grasp with all four paws. Is his tail a normal length? Make sure there is no discoloration of staining around the rectum. This can indicate the glider has diarrhea, which may be a sign of a health problem., Once you've examined your sugar glider, ask the owner questions about his background. You want to make sure he has no history of health problems or any other issues before making a purchase.


Ask about how he's been socialized. You do not want to purchase a sugar glider who's not used to being handled. This can lead to behavioral issues. Also, a sugar glider who hasn't been held or touched may make potential health problems hard to notice.
Ask if there's been any disease in his litter or with other sugar gliders in his cage. Even if the sugar glider you want is perfectly healthy, if he's been around sick animals he could develop an illness after you bring him home.If you're going through a breeder, ask about your sugar glider's family history. Is he at increased risk for any inheritable disorders? If possible, you want to get a sugar glider who has a healthy family tree.

, Sugar gliders may become injured from playing or fighting. They may also come down with illnesses, especially when they're young. If you want a healthy sugar glider, make sure he's illness and injury-free.


Sugar gliders are fairly active. They should crawl and play in their cages. If a sugar glider appears inactive, he may be sick. Sugar gliders should have bright eyes, a moist nose, pink gums, and a smooth coat. If his gums look dull, his nose is runny, his eyes are cloudy, or his coat is thin and patchy, this is also a bad sign.Look for sores on your sugar glider. Patchy red skin and rashes may develop around sores, which can be difficult to treat. You do not want to take home an injured sugar glider.If the sugar glider has left any droppings, take a look at them. The appearance of his droppings can be an indication of health. Small, hard droppings may be a sign the animal is prone to digestive issues., Some sugar gliders have health conditions that cause them to dehydrate easily. These sugar gliders can be hard to care for longterm. If you notice abnormal breathing, a lack of energy, and dryness around the nose or mouth the sugar glider may be dehydrated. In this case, you may want to pick a different glider., Sugar gliders can be hard to find. If you can't find a breeder or pet store, you may be tempted to go through a mill or flea market. However, sugar gliders from such places are not bred responsibly. They are very prone to both health and behavioral problems. Avoid getting a sugar glider from a mill or flea market as he is less likely to be healthy.

, You should ask a breeder or pet store owner a little about a sugar glider's personality before making a purchase. Like people, sugar gliders vary in personality. Some are friendlier while others are more withdrawn. A certain personality type is not necessarily indicative of a sugar glider's health. However, if you wanted a more social or more playful pet this is something you should take into consideration.

, Keep in mind there is no guarantee of perfect health, even when taking precautions. Sugar gliders, like any animal, can come down with a health issue at any point at life. Before deciding to purchase a pet, make sure you're prepared financially to deal with any health issues that might arise in the future.

Take the time to bond with your glider.,
Find a veterinarian for exotic animals.,
Look out for common illnesses that affect sugar gliders.,
Connect with other glider owners in your area.,
Be careful when you take your gliders outside.,
Play with them as often as you can, but don't worry too much about it.,
Buy or build a sizable cage.,
Place the cage on a large tray lined with bedding.,
Provide a pouch.,
Add safe branches and toys to the cage.,
Always be sure to have a glider safe wheel, as the ones at pet stores are almost never safe for them.,
Avoid cleaning too often.,
Provide a healthy diet.,
Keep snacks on hand.,
Provide fresh water at all times in the cage, and feed them at night.",How to Care for a Sugar Glider," One of the most special things about sugar gliders is their need for socialization. Gliders are capable of a lot of love and if you spend time with them and give them respect, they will grow to trust you. Gliders form strong bonds and can become despondent when the bond is broken. Before bringing home a glider and starting the bonding process, make sure you want to keep the glider for its entire lifespan, which could be up to 15 years.


Though some breeders will sell single gliders, gliders do much better in pairs or colonies. It's much better to get two gliders if you want them to stay happy and healthy.
Starting the bonding process is as simple as wearing some fleece squares on your person for a few days, then putting them inside their sleeping pouch. They are very scent oriented and this will help them recognize you as part of their colony.
Carrying them in a bonding pouch during the day is a great way to bond. They'll mainly sleep and you can coax them into the pouch with treats. Carry them close to your chest and don't let it bounce around too much. This also helps them get used to your scent.
Give them treats, but not too many. Offer them when you wake them up to put them in a bonding pouch or when you want to play with them. This will help them understand they shouldn't fear you.
One useful technique for play time is ""tent time."" Playing with your gliders in a tent allows them freedom to roam without worrying about making a mad dash to catch them before they end up somewhere you can't coax them out of.
Another great idea if you don't have a tent is ""tub time"" where you can sit in a clean bathtub with them. Make sure a towel is covering the hole underneath the door, a plug is in the bathtub, and the toilet seat is down.;
, Just like dogs and cats, sugar gliders occasionally get sick. Before you bring a pair of sugar gliders home, make sure you have a vet in your area who specializes in glider care. You should bring your gliders in for a checkup about once a year to make sure they're doing well.


Neutering your male glider is highly recommended unless it has lineage to prevent possible inbreeding if paired with a female. If you have males together, it's still better to have them neutered to help prevent fighting.
Try to find at least two emergency vets in the area and have their numbers in case something happens. Sugar Gliders often seem to get sick after regular business hours.

, When conditions are right, sugar gliders are relatively low maintenance pets. However, from time to time they may become ill due to lack of essential nutrients, not getting enough playtime, and other causes. If you see signs that your sugar gliders aren't feeling well, take them to the vet right away. Here are the common illnesses that affect them:Calcium deficiency, which can cause paralysis and is preventable as long as you feed your gliders the correct diet. Some good diets are TPG, BML, and OHPW
Constipation or indigestion
Open wounds from getting scratched or caught on a sharp part of the cage
Obesity due to eating too many fatty foods
Stress caused by poor socialization or being alone
UTI, which is easy to spot. The most common sign is hissing while using the bathroom.

, It is great fun to connect with other glider owners to share the joy. Plus they can be a great resource when you have to ask questions. There are many forums and message-boards that are glider-related.

, Sugar gliders, even when fully bonded, may run off to explore nearby and any nearby animals will be a risk to them. It's not recommend to have them outside unless you absolutely know they'll stay with you.


Be watchful of other pets and loud noises that might scare them up a tree or into the drain pipe. They are very fast escapees.
Do not use harnesses or leashes with Sugar Gliders. They can severely damage their patagium, neck, or spine.

, They are social animals, but as long as you have at least two, it's fine to just play with them once a week or so.


Don't stop using all the bonding techniques and keep playing with them even after they're fully bonded. Even once bonded they'll still want you to keep them company sometimes.

, One amazing qualities sugar gliders have is their ability to spread their legs and glide through the air. In order to do this, in captivity, they need a nice tall cage. Though many breeders will give you a cage with your purchase, it may not be big enough. The minimum cage size for a pair of gliders is 3 feet (0.9 m) high by 2 feet (0.6 m) wide with no more than 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) bar spacing. If you have extra room, the bigger (and taller) the better. There are several sources for cages online, or you can check your local pet store. Many glider owners build custom cages that fit the needs of their household.Avoid galvanized steel cages because they can rust and cause urinary tract infections in gliders.
No need to worry about the direction of the bars. They have opposable thumbs and can climb easily on horizontal or vertical bars.
Check that the wood if safe for gliders, of building or buying a wooden cage. Remember that wood is harder to clean and absorbs odors though.

, This is useful for absorbing waste and stray food, and you can easily change out the bedding when it gets soiled. A plastic or metal tray works just fine. Use paper bedding such as CareFresh or other nontoxic bedding available such as yesterday's news cat litter or puppy pads. Change it out once a week or so.


Only use kiln dried bedding. The oils in other wooden bedding can cause health problems for sugar gliders.
If you don't want to buy bedding, you can use newspaper or another nontoxic material from around the house.

, Sugar gliders are nocturnal, and in their natural environment they sleep in trees. To replicate that experience in captivity, place a wooden birdhouse (made of safe wood such as manzanita or eucalyptus), or a fleece pouch with a slit in the side, Attach it to the side of the cage by using plastic c-links to affix it to the mesh or bars. Be sure any pouches are sewn safely for gliders, with small, hidden seams to keep their nails from catching on it. Many vendors online sell glider safe pouches and cage sets.


It's important to make sure the nesting box is made from nontoxic materials. A fleece or 100% cotton (outside only) bag is a good choice, or an untreated manzanita, applewood, or eucalyptus bird house is good. It's always good to enhance their lives and buy both.
Hollowed-out coconuts are another popular choice. Provide more than one to add some variety.

, Sugar gliders are intelligent and need an engaging environment. You need to stimulate your gliders' minds with interesting things to look at touch, smell and climb.


Use eucalyptus branches. Attach them to the sides of the cage to replicate their natural environment, as well as cut down on smell and give them something to chew on.
Toys can be bought from vendors online, or made from plastic baby toys and chains. Always make sure they are safe though, with no places they could get stuck or pinched.

, There are a many brands that are safe, of these Raptor wheels and Stealth wheels are most popular. Consider rotating toys and rearranging the elements in the cage on a regular basis.


Check online for ideas on how to make the best possible habitat for your gliders. Glider forums are filled with great ideas for toys and other interesting things to add to the cage.
If your gliders are understimulated, they will become depressed. This can lead to long-term health problems.

, As sugar gliders are scent oriented, if nothing smells like them they will mark everything even more and make it smell worse.


Clean the cage itself one week, the pouches the next, and the toys the next. This will help prevent them from over making.

You can use unscented baby wipes daily to wipe down particularly dirty sections.


Use a vinegar and water mixture with a few drops of eucalyptus essential oil to clean the cage and toys. The pouches and any other fabric can be washed by hand or in the washer with a little unscented detergent and/or a cup of vinegar.
Check for any loose pieces or seams in the cage, pouches, and toys when cleaning and repair or replace accordingly.

, Sugar gliders are native to Australia, Indonesia, and a few other places, where they live on a diet of sap, bird eggs, lizards, insects, and other wild foods. Preparing food for sugar gliders is more like feeding animals in a zoo than opening a bag of kibble. There are several diet plans available, such as TPG, BML, or OHPW, which all provide a Step by step guide for feeding gliders. All these diets are accompanied by fruits and vegetables nightly. Be sure to follow them exactly as if you don't you may throw off the ratios. Both help the gliders get the calcium they need to avoid malnutrition and HLP (hind leg paralysis). Do some research online to find one that works for you, add some of them are more strict than others. Never feed gliders pellets as a total diet, while they are okay as a snack or emergency food, they are not a good diet. They have too little protein as well as fillers. It may seem as though food prep for sugar gliders will take a lot of time, but once you get the hang of it you can prepare enough food for the whole month in one day. The important thing is to make sure you provide the right ration of protein, sugars, and fats, and ensure your gliders are getting the minerals they need to stay healthy.
Do not feed sugar gliders dog food, cat food or other foods not meant for sugar gliders. They don't contain the nutritional makeup that sugar gliders need to thrive.
Do not feed garlic, rhubarb, onions, or anything in those families. Do not feed fresh lima beans. If bought frozen, they're fine, but otherwise they need to be cooked.

, Gliders love snacks, and can be a great resource for bonding. One of the favorites is live meal worms, though they are high in fat so feed in moderation. Seeing how much your little guy loves mealies will help you get over the ""ick"" factor (most pet stores sell plastic tweezers).


Other snacks include fresh fruit, dried unsulfured papaya, dried unsulfured coconut, yogurt drops, pine nuts (in limited quantities), peas, and ""lickey treats"" which could be yogurt, applesauce or baby food. (Hawaiian Delight and chicken with apples are favorites.)
When choosing snacks avoid all artificial sweeteners, colors or other non-natural ingredients.
Never feed sugar gliders plain sugar, candy, or chocolate, as these will cause health problems. Only white chocolate is safe, any other chocolate is toxic to them.

, Using a weighted food dish is best or they may tip it over. Keep the water bottle or silo full at all times, but only feed them the specified amount of food each night. You should feed them at night around the time they wake up, and then take out the dish and any leftover food in the morning.


You can leave a tablespoon of glider cereal, sold by The Pet Glider, in their cage during the day in case they wake up and are hungry.

Find a suitable tree branch.,
Hang simple wires from the branch.,
Create loops or holding points at the end of each wire.,
Attach the corn.,
Enjoy the feeder in action.",How to Make a Squirrel Feeder2," You will want to select a low-hanging tree branch that requires the squirrels to do some maneuvering to reach it, but that still rests in a comfortable line of vision for you viewing pleasure.

, In this case, twisted coat hangers or fishing-wire with a high tensile strength will suffice. Hang these wires with roughly six inches to one foot of slack around the tree limb. This will require that squirrels maneuver to get to the food without providing a major obstacle to them.


Try attaching corn cobs to a bungee cord which is then hung from a tree limb or platform. Squirrels will perform acrobatics in an effort to feed on the corn, which is entertaining to watch.

, Once the wires are fastened to the tree branch, create a mechanism at the end of each wire capable of holding an ear of corn. The simplest way to do this is to twist a loop into the wire hangers that will support an ear of corn or tie a loop into fishing-wire.

, Attach whole ears of corn into the loops you created at the end of your wires. Make sure they are securely fastened, as they will need to support the weight of squirrels climbing on and hanging off of them.


If the squirrels knock the corn to the ground, it largely defeats the purpose of employing a hanging feeder which is designed to make the squirrels “work” for the food.

, Now that the hanging wires have been stocked with corn, sit back and enjoy watching the squirrels perform various physical and acrobatic feats to get to the food supply. Be sure to replace exhausted ears of corn to keep the squirrels coming back.

Acquire an appropriate piece of wood.,
Cut the wood into five measured pieces.,
Drill pilot holes for mounting screws.,
Assemble your cut pieces of wood.,
Position the lid.,
Mount the feeder.,
Stock with food.",How to Make a Squirrel Feeder3," You can build a box feeder out of any size or type of wood, depending on your needs and specifications. Ideally, you would purchase a cedar fence slat which measures 5"" x 1/2"" x 4 ft., Cut the wood you purchased into four pieces of various sizes to make the base, the back, the lid, and the sides. If you are utilizing a 5” x 1/2” x 4ft piece of wood, you should cut the pieces to the following specifications:


Back= 10 x 5 inches
Base = 12 x 5 inches
Sides = 5 x 5 inches (2 pieces)
Lid = 5 1/2 x 5 inches , Drill the first hole about 1"" from the top of back piece in the center of the wood and drill a second hole roughly 7"" below the first one. The two side pieces need a 1/4"" deep saw kerf made about 3/16"" from front edge. This will allow the plexiglass front cover slide up and down. One of your side pieces needs a hole drilled thru at the saw kerf, so that it is just large enough to allow the nail to be put in by hand. This will keep the plexiglass from being lifted up by the squirrels. , First, fasten the bottom piece to the back piece using 3 flathead screws. Then, fasten each of the side pieces to the bottom piece with 2 flathead screws and to the back piece with 2 flathead screws. , Put the lid in place and screw a hinge to lid and the back piece. Make sure to use the screws that came with the hinge piece to ensure all the components fit together properly. , Remove the plexiglass front cover and fasten the feeder to a tree or a post with the 2"" flathead screws. , Once you have fastened the feeder to a tree or post, select a food type and fill the feeder. Then, simply wait for the squirrels to come along and enjoy.


Squirrels eat a wide variety of nuts, seeds and plants. While peanuts and corn, due to their wide availability, have become popular choices in stocking squirrel feeders, they actually provide very little nutritional value to the squirrel. Hickory nuts, butternuts, walnuts, sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds are all healthy substitutes that the squirrels will enjoy."

Purchase seed cake.,
Decide on a seed cake holder.,
Hang or fasten seed cake holder.,
Find a multiple trees for hanging.,
Stock the seed cake holder with seed cake.,
Monitor wildlife eating habits.",How to Make a Squirrel Feeder4," Go to any pet supply or outdoor supply store to purchase a seed cake.


Alternatively, you can make your own seed cake at home by purchasing the mix of seeds you want to feed the squirrels and mixing them together with lard or gelatin mix.
When using lard, melt the lard in the microwave, which usually takes about 2 minutes and then stir in the birdseed. If you decide to use the gelatin, measure out an appropriate amount of water into a small saucepan and add the dry gelatin, heating the mixture on the stove for a few minutes until the water dissolves the gelatin. Then, take the mixture off of the heat and stir in the birdseed. Place your seed/lard/gelatin mixture into your desired mold, on top of parchment paper to avoid any seepage, and let it set in the refrigerator for a few hours., Seed cake holders generally come in two styles, those that hang from a tree branch and those that fasten directly to a tree or post. Figure out which style is best for you before making your purchase.

, Find an ideal area of your yard or nature space to place the seed cake holder.


If you purchased a hanging seed cake holder, you will want to look for a tree with a reasonably-sized, low-hanging limb that is perpendicular to the ground to which you can tie the seed cake holder. If you purchased a seed cake holder that fastens to a tree or post, place the holder roughly six feet off the ground and follow the fastening instructions on the label.

, When hanging a seed cake, it is important to remember that many animals in your yard will feed on seed cakes. If your goal is to keep the squirrels and birds separated, make sure you hang multiple seed cakes. Cakes hung higher in locations are ideal for birds, whereas seed cakes hung at lower levels will be more readily accessed by squirrels. Take care not hang the cake too low, or it will be eaten by deer.

, Once the holder(s) is in the correct position, stock it with the seed cake you purchased from the store.

, You may find, once you have hung your seed cake, that squirrels prefer one brand of seed cake over another. Make sure to monitor the frequency and volume of squirrels coming to feed on the seed cake and adjust the type of seed cake as you see fit.

Protect your backyard bird feeders from being raided by squirrels.,
Place squirrel feeders away from your home.,
Find an area of your yard away from bird feeders.,
Select an ideal location for squirrels.,
Select a feeder and food type.",How to Make a Squirrel Feeder5," Squirrels will find and feast on the seed you place out for birds. Constructing a squirrel feeder may help keep squirrels away from food set out for other wildlife.

, Any feeder placed too close to the house may encourage the rodents to try to gain entry. Squirrels are also very destructive and will chew through parts of your home or get into the attic.

, The squirrel feeder needs to be in a separate area so the squirrels will stay away from places you don't want them to be. Squirrels are very territorial and will soon claim their feeder as their own.

, Locate an area of your property that has shrubbery or trees which will give protection and will provide a way for the squirrels to escape.

, Once you have found the ideal location for your squirrel feeder, you will need to decide which type of squirrel feeder you would like to build and select a food supply with which to stock the feeder.


The food source you select often plays a role in deciding what sort of feeder you may want to build.
Squirrels like to eat corn and will find a multitude of ways to get to it. Also, corn is cheap and readily available in most areas, making it an ideal source of food for a squirrel feeder.
Native nuts are a good choice of food. Walnuts, acorns, pecans, or whatever nuts grow in your area are natural squirrel food. Of course, these must be raw and not salted or flavored. Sunflower seeds are also a good food for squirrels.
Many people feed squirrels peanuts, but unless they are roasted to kill a toxic mold, squirrels can get sick from eating them. While squirrels will certainly take advantage of a readily available food source like peanuts, they are of limited nutritional value to squirrels.
Squirrels also need a source of calcium to be healthy. Consider buying a special calcium mixture made for squirrels or provide occasional bones for your squirrels to gnaw.

Choose something comfortable.,
Wear a body protector where possible.,
Wear coats and jackets with a covered zip all the way down.",How to Choose Safe Riding Clothes2," A shirt that's too constricting or too loose will make riding difficult and unsafe. Choose something you feel comfortable in. Do not choose clothing that hangs from the body; it may catch or snag on objects, leading to an extremely dangerous situation.

, Although they are very bulky, they do make riding safer. This is particularly true if you're hacking out, as falling on objects on the ground poses a greater risk than usual. Note that body protectors may be mandatory for some disciplines, most notably those involving jumping.

, A complete zip means you will not have to pull the jacket over your head, but all zips should be covered to prevent them from catching as you ride.

"
"
Wear jeans with few attachments on them.,
Ensure your jeans/jodhpurs/breeches fit correctly.",How to Choose Safe Riding Clothes3," Don't wear jeans with lots of zippers or attachments (such as chains, lots of buttons, etc.), as these can get caught on tack and cause accidents.

, Jeans should be slightly looser, in order to allow you to move freely when you ride. Jodhpurs and breeches are generally designed to stretch, or otherwise cut to allow for free movement. These should fit more closely, for both looks and comfort.

"
"
Choose well-fitting boots.,
Wear suitable footwear.",How to Choose Safe Riding Clothes4," Ensure that your riding boots fit properly. They should be snug, with a small amount of toe space for comfort. They should support your ankle without interfering with your ability to flex at the ankle and drop your heels.

, The heel on the typical riding boot is designed to prevent the foot from slipping through the stirrup; if the heel becomes worn down, it is time to replace the boots. While not recommended, it is possible to wear any boots with a small heel as long as they are comfortable. Take care to ensure that they will not slip through or catch on a stirrup in the event of a fall.

Compete in every event At Western Shows or Performance Shows, the events range from Western Pleasure, Western Horsemanship, Western Equitation, Trail, Western Riding, Western Reining and Bareback.,
Ride the horse to its advantage You wouldn't ask a swimmer to do a Marathon, and you wouldn't ask a Hurdler to do Pole Vault.",How to Be a Fashionista at a Western Performance Show1," Some people ride many horses depending on the event, in some cases, riders are only permitted to ride two horses to go towards High Point Awards. In some shows you can ride as many horses as you wish. Try riding the one horse in every event, from Showmanship, Hack, Hunter Under Saddle, Hunt Seat Equitation through to Western Pleasure, Western Horsemanship and Trail. This not only shows the diversity and versatility of your horse, but you will be with the few that compete with only one horse in all the events...and these riders do just as well in terms of placings and results.;
, It is the same with horses, an English trained horse is able to do Western with the right training and guidance, but you should take all necessary actions to provide adequate training in this event before asking the horse to ride it. This is the same for any Western Performance event, from Halter, Hack, Hunter Under Saddle, Equitation and Western and Trail. From the point above, if you compete with your horse in everything, keep in mind its abilities. Does it side pass with ease? Are you able to lope straight from a halt? These aspects are required for Western Equitation. Can your horse Canter with a loose rein? Can you get a single or a two beat simple change from one lead to the next? These are important features of an English Performance Horses, especially for the Equitation. You can try all the events, but ride each horse to its abilities and not so much to its faults...you can improve them as your ride.

Make a shelter for your squirrel.,
Provide a nest box and bedding material.,
Keep baby squirrels warm.,
Provide toys and other supplies.",How to Take Care of a Wild Squirrel1," If you find a wild squirrel injured outside, the first step is to make sure you provide him a proper shelter. Will squirrels DO NOT carry rabies. If you are bitten, clean the wound out with some water. Having the squirrel tested for diseases will result in the squirrel's death. However, if you don't have a cage there are other options.


Injured squirrels found in the wild tend to be babies. They often fall from nests or get lost from their mothers. A baby squirrel can be comfortable housed in a small box, such as a shoe box. You should leave the shoebox outside, away from other predators, and keep it open. This way, if he's lost his mother will be able to find him and retrieve him. However, you can keep the shoebox in your garage or a closed off room in your home if leaving the squirrel outdoors is not an option.If you intend the keep the squirrel longterm because a rehabber or wildlife rescue is not an option, you're going to need a lot of time and money. The first step is to get a cage. Adult squirrels need tall cages so they can move around and play. Baby squirrels need smaller cages so they don't climb and end up falling and hurting themselves. If you have an old cat cage or pet carrier, you could use this for a baby squirrel. If it's plastic, the squirrel will chew through it quickly. An old bird cage, at least 3 feet tall, might work very temporarily for an adult squirrel. You can also purchase animal cages of a variety of shapes and sizes at your local pet store. Critter/Ferret nations are recommended for the small bar spacings and size. ;
, After finding a suitable container for the squirrel, you'll need to give him nest and bedding material. This helps him stay warm and comfortable and also mimics some of the conditions of his natural habitat.


Squirrels enjoy building a nest for sleeping. Do not use cardboard as it dries out the skin and mucous membranes. Many pet stores sell nest boxes for birds for relatively low prices. These could work to keep your squirrel feeling warm and safe.Squirrels need to have a lot of bedding and padding to keep warm. However, be careful of what kind of materials you're using. Use old clothing, like old cotton or fleece shirts. However, stay away from towels or other items made of terrycloth or something similar. Squirrels can easily get their claws stuck in such materials, leading to injury., If you found an injured baby squirrel, he needs to stay warm in order to survive. Wrap a hot water bottle or a heating pad in flannel or a similar material. Place it in the box or cage where you're keeping the baby squirrel. Do not cover the squirrel in any fabrics and do not put water in without wrapping it up first. This could cause the squirrel to overheat. If you use a heating pad, ensure it is non-auto-shut-off and place it half UNDER the box. , After your squirrel has settled in, it's nice to give him some toys and other supplies for his entertainment. The transition from the wild to someone's home will be jarring. You want to make sure your squirrel is entertained.


Small stuffed toys for children can be great toys for squirrels. Just make sure to remove any plastic parts, like plastic eyes or noses, before letting the squirrel play with it. Only give a squirrel stuffed toys that use natural stuffing. Squirrels can choke on beans or bead-like materials sometimes used to stuff toys.Hanging toys, like mobiles or cat toys with feathers on the end, can also be fun for squirrels. If you're keeping your squirrel until release, consider installing some kind of perch in his cage if he's older. Squirrels like to be able to climb. You can buy bird perches at a local pet store and install them in your squirrel's cage."

Understand the regulations By most regulations, at a Western Performance Show horses can be banded or left natural but trimmed.,
Band it up by using a different coloured plaiting band.,
Give your horse a twist when plaiting your horse.,
Lock it up or let it loose?,
Shine it up For most showing face oils are permitted, but sometimes they are not.,
Let your horse be a star or a moon, or a square?,
Shine those hooves Horses hooves can be black, white, stripped, or tri-coloured, and can be variations and combinations of each.,
Flaunt it or fake it?,
Organise and Execute your presentation ideas well before a show.",How to Be a Fashionista at a Western Performance Show2," Horses may not have ribbons in their mane or tail, and may only be plated up for English events. (Always refer to the Club or Body guidelines and rule book). This does not mean you can't read between the lines so to say.

, Bands come in various colours from the basic black and white to chestnut and bay colours. Many other colours are around, as well as clear, so have some fun with it and look around. On a white mane black bands look quite stunning, whereas with a black mane you could go for a white band. When using a different band colour to the mane colouring, make sure that the top of each section between the band and the crest are super neat and tidy. Contrasting colors make the bands stand out, and in turn, the faults. If your only new to banding or can not keep them neat, go for a matching colour to help hide those small imperfections. At the wither end of the mane there is always a piece of hair that doesn't band correctly, in western events this can be braided to keep it neat and tidy. Some people trim this off, others keep it. Whatever your choice, you should make it on a knowing slate. This piece of hair allows rain to drip away from the horses back and down to the ground. If this is removed, then the water will run down the spine and causes rain scald. If you do remove it, rug up.

, There are many different styles and methods to braiding and stitching them in. To make them interesting, give the braid a twist before doing it up or stitching it.

, A forelock is the hair between the horses ears which resembles a fringe. Some breeds usually put a band in it to keep it from moving around while keeping the forelock in position. Others braid it and stitch it to keep it out of the way and tidy. This all depends on the style and discipline. In Western usually you either leave it out or band it up like you would the mane. Because the forelock comes off the poll, which can be rather high, you may need two bands to make it sit correctly. For English and Dressage you can plait it or wrap it, again, just like the mane. NEVER cut or hog the forelock, as it is the horses natural fly swatter and wind screen wiper.

, If they are, use them around the eyes and muzzle, but ensure you only put enough on and not too much, as this will cause dust to collect on it and can detract rather than be attract the judges eye.

, Quarter marks are great to give your look a twist. Most clubs allow them, and some may even allow you to put some glitter spray onto them to give them a bit more of a shine. They come in heaps of different shapes and sizes, so shop around and if you can't find one you like, try making your own. Take into account the type of event you are riding, quarter marks only look good on an English horse during a hack class, they are not suitable during a western pleasure event or a showmanship event. So if you are competing in events back to back, make sure you can brush it out before your next class.

, Though many people stick with all-natural some like to glam it up or black it down. Black hoof polish is good to cover up any bumps and cracks as well as hiding any discolouration from hooves hitting coloured poles. It is best used on Hacking horses as it makes a real statement. Others prefer to use clear, to ensure the natural look is kept while giving it a gloss appearance. When using clear, you must ensure your horses hooves are spotless and tidy. If they have a bruise on their upper hoof, it won't be covered up. Some clubs such as Pony Club and General Riding Clubs allow you to experiment and play by adding glitter and sparkle. This has a great effect when used in the right situations. Go with your instinct and if in doubt, go clear. Look at your competitors and note what the winners do. If they all consistently have black or clear hooves, try the same thing. Always remember though, if your horses hooves look silly to you, then most likely they don't suit the choice you have decided upon.

, Some people prefer a natural tail. Others, a false tail. In some events it doesn't matter either way, other times it is greatly prohibited. If you are allowed to use a false tail, make sure it is the exact match to your horses current tail colour. If you have an Appaloosa, a Paint or a grey, you may have to bleach the tail to ensure a match with colour. Some false tail designers can make an individual tail to suit the horse. This works well for horses that have mottled dock skin resulting in a parti-coloured tail. If you prefer to flaunt what you have, ensure you protect the tail hair and promote the growth of it. Bag it up to keep it from getting dirty and only brush it with a tail brush when you really need to. If you continuously brush at it, it will gradually thin out. Condition it often to promote healthy growth and give it a good trim every few months. A basic tidy up is essential when showing, but only take a small amount off.

, Test them out to get the method perfect and if an opportunity arises to show them off, go ahead. A judge may give a positive comment on them, or one might say it did nothing for the combination. This is critical feedback, as another persons shimmer and shine may be another persons step up the ranking.

Buy a good pair of pants that are a good cut and length to suit you.,
Wear a shirt or a slinky on your top half.,
Put on a jacket or wear a specially designed halter outfit.,
Buckle Up with a good leather type belt suited for Showmanship and Halter and have a Buckle.,
Finish the look with a sturdy pair of boots such as Pull Ons, or Lace Ups.",How to Be a Fashionista at a Western Performance Show3," Your pants are not the main part of the halter look, but you do have to run and move around in them. Look for a show pant that is flattering to your body shape and has a slightly longer leg cut with a higher waist. This gives a longer leg impression so as you walk and jog beside your horse you too will look longer.

, It should be long sleeved unless you are wearing a halter jacket. Otherwise you can get away with a short sleeved shirt under the jacket as it won't be seen. The shirt for handlers should be long sleeved and have a collar. The shirt should be buttoned all the way up the front. A slinky, (suitable more so for females) should have a turtle neck type collar. You are required to have your shirt tucked in unless it is a slinky and sits right on the gab between your pants and skin line, no skin should be seen.

, Jackets come in two basic cuts for Showmanship and Halter - cropped and long. A cropped Jacket sits just on the pants line, and gives a flattering appearance. A longer Jacket is one that may or may not have a split similar to that of a riding Jacket. It gives a longer appearance and many judges prefer a longer jacket to a cropped or a shirt style top. If you go for a specially designed halter outfit, look for one that suits your body shape. The Halter outfits are usually made of leather and do up at either the front or back depending on the design and shape. They are good for the handler that does a lot of Halter showing as they are less likely to get dirty and can be wiped clean with a damp cloth. They are also especially good as they are at most good Western Attire Retailers and the designs are quite bright so they suit a new Handler wanting to make an impression.

, The buckle can be either Glitzy and Glamour with Rhinestones and Diamantes or it can be a silver plaited trophy type buckle. Either is well suited, and this just makes the outfit. If you don't wear a belt and buckle you can be eliminated from the event.

, They can have fancy stitching or embroidery or they can be plain. During a Halter or Showmanship event you must always wear a hat. This can have a Hat band and can be glitzy or plain. To finish the look wear a neck piece such as a Yolk band or bolo tie for males and a piece of jewellery such as a necklace or bolo tie for the woman.

Gather your tools.,
Gather wooden boards.,
Create the front and back panels.,
Create your side walls.,
Create a doorway.,
Attach the walls.,
Connect the flooring.,
Fill the house.,
Attach the roof.",How to Build a Squirrel House1," This is a basic woodwork project and doesn’t require anything too elaborate. You’ll need a saw (jig-saw if you have one), electric screwdriver, and screws (3-4 dozen). If you don’t have an electric screwdriver, you could also use a hammer and nails. Screws hold the squirrel house’s design more securely than nails. Keep the following on hand as well:


Measuring tape
Pencil and paper
First aid kit
Sandpaper;
, Scrap lumber will work just fine for this project. Exterior grade plywood could be used, but this material is easier for the squirrels to damage. Two boards should be 12” x 12” or larger to be used as the floor, roof and overhang. You’ll also need two additional 35” x 6”.


The six is based off the average squirrel size. If you notice larger species such as Red or Grey squirrels, use a wider size wood. Use something between 6” and 10”
You don’t need to follow these exact dimensions, if you acquired enough scrap wood.

, The key to a good squirrel house is for the roof to overhang slightly. To achieve this, the front board should be one inch shorter than the back board. Use your measuring tape to mark 18” on one board and 17” on another board. Draw legible and straight lines with your pen across the board.


Use your saw and cut along the line in an even fashion. Take your time sawing. A good cut is better than a quick and choppy cut.
Again these are the measurements for this squirrel house. You can make your house smaller, but don’t make it bigger. Squirrels enjoy compact spaces.

, The sides must be the same width as the front and back panels. The side panels require a more advanced cut. You’ll need to measure 18” on one edge and 17” on the other edge.Each plank's top will be cut into a slanted edge. Use your measuring tape to mark the right measurements.


Draw a line to connect the 18” marker to the 17” marker. Use a ruler to create a straight and even line.
Take your time to create a clean cut with your saw. You should now be able to see the panels align with the front and back walls.

, Now you need to create an entrance for the squirrels to use. Take one of the side panels and measure three inches from the 18” side. Use the 3” mark to create a hole that is 3” in diameter. You’re basically removing the pointed edge of a side board.


It doesn’t need to be exactly three inches in diameter, but should be close. The hole size determines what species can fit into the house.People have reported possums n their “squirrel house,” because the opening was too large.

, Start by positioning all the walls in place using your hands. Make sure all the front and rear edges align with the proper sides. Once you’re pleased by the outline, it’s time to attach the walls. Attach everything in the following order:


Position the front wall (17”) with a side wall. Place the side panel’s edge in front of the front panel’s edge. Insert 4-7 evenly spaced nails or screws to attach the two.
Attach the side panel that is attached to the front wall to the back wall (18""). Again, the nail or screws should pass through the side wall before going through the rear wall’s edge.
Attach the other side board onto the house. For each corner, you should use between 4-7 screws or nails.
If you are using an electric screwdriver, take your time. It is easy to damage the wood if you try to work too quickly.
There should be an even slope from 18"" (back wall) to 17"" (front wall)., Use one of the 12” x 12” boards as flooring for the squirrel house. Position the frame created in the previous step on top of the 12” x 12”. Align the 18” wall along the edge of the floor board. Center the frame and mark where the corners will be on the floor.


Flip the frame to begin attaching the nails and screws. Attach nails or screw into each corner. Use between 3-4 screws or nails for each side.
Be careful to only attach the nails or screws along the house’s frame.

, Some builders like to insert a wooden divider into the house with a 3” gap to create two stories. Squirrels like to play in compact spaces. Make it comfortable for the squirrels by adding pillow fluff or the contents of a stuffed animal. Another good bedding material is dried moss found in nature or a craft store.Measure the inner dimensions to create a floor divider for the house. Cut out a 3” hole as you did with the entrance to the house.

",How to Keep a Pet Squirrel," Owning most varieties of squirrels is illegal in some regions. If you are caught with an illegal pet, the animal will be seized and euthanized and you will be fined and possibly face jail time. If you aren't caught and the animal becomes sick, most vets will not treat wildlife, leaving you with almost no option.


Before investing time, money, and a piece of your heart in a squirrel, consider volunteering with your local rehabber to see if a squirrel is right for you. If you still feel that owning a squirrel would fulfill you, check with all vets in your area to see if they will treat one and check all government agencies to ensure your little friend won't be harmed because of your actions.

, Having some climbing room and some wood (preferably a stick of hardwood) to gnaw on for the squirrel. This is important for the squirrel's dental health and necessary for teething young. The Author made one out of 2 round pieces of wood, held together with 2X4's on the inside, wrapped in chicken wire. Keep in mind that squirrels need a lot of room and if they are not going to be allowed to roam around the house (which is not a good idea if there is anything you don't want chewed, such as electrical wires), you may want to consider an outdoor cage. However, this may eventually lead to wilding-up, which is when the natural instincts of the squirrel kicks in and he wishes to return to the wild.;
, Build nest boxes, buy lots of fluffy hammocks, cubes, and other lounging areas to give the squirrel lots of choices for bedding. Make sure there is plenty of bedding and a place for it to snuggle in like a pouch. Another idea is a bedding pouch, such as the type you would use for a ferret.

, Too many things can and will go wrong without guidance that may lead to death for the baby. If a rehabber can't be found, TheSquirrelBoard.com is a fantastic resource. A baby squirrel cannot thermoregulate itself, meaning that it cannot stay warm without assistance. Put a heating pad half underneath whatever you are keeping it in, but make sure it does not exceed 100 degrees. Make sure the heating pad is underneath half of the enclosure, so that the baby has a cool half to move to in case the baby gets too hot.


A good internal temperature for the squirrel itself is between 98 and 102 degrees, which means it should feel warm to the touch, warmer than your hand. A cold baby can die very easily, so this is very important.
A cold baby can not digest food as well as a warm baby. Never feed a cold squirrel.

,


Food for adults: store bought rodent block such as Harlan Teklad, Mazuri or Henry's Healthy Blocks are great along with fresh vegetables and limited fruits and an occasional nut as a treat.
For babies: Fox Valley milk replacement is a must. Check TheSquirrelBoard.com for formula updates. Often, formula recipes change and will cause babies to die. Before purchasing formula, check to see which one is recommended. Feed this to the squirrel using a 1cc syringe slowly as babies will often aspirate milk out through their nose while sucking which could lead to pneumonia.

For ages 2-3 weeks: feed 5 times a day, 5% - 7% of the squirrel's body weight. (Squirrel's weight in grams x 5% = amount to feed. Example 100 grams x 5% = 5ccs each feeding)
Age 4-5 weeks: feed 4-5 times a day. You can stop night feedings if the baby is doing well.
Age 6-7 weeks: feed 4 times a day.
Age 8 weeks: feed 3 times a day. Begin weaning onto small pieces of solid food such as blocks and veggies. Do not start with nuts.



, Healthy squirrels will generally drink from a water bottle, such as the type you would use for rabbits and other rodents. If they do not drink from the bottle, set out a shallow dish for them to drink from, but be aware that they may make a mess.

, This will keep away the painfully fatal disease of Metabolic Bone Disease. Do not feed more than 1-2 small pieces of fruit and 1 nut a day.

, If someone in the house has a cold or a virus, keep them away from the squirrel, just to be safe. Wash your hands before and after feeding, touching or cleaning around the squirrel.

, Most pets have a natural instinct to kill the squirrel. Too many people have trusted their 'harmless' dog or cat only to come home with a house full of blood and a very much dead squirrel.

, If you insist on keeping a wilding-up squirrel as a pet, realize that they will become very aggressive and antsy. They will chatter, growl, bark, snap, bite, and constantly run away from your OR even charge at you. If this happens, you will want to start the release process for the squirrel.

Feed your squirrel a proper diet.,
Provide plenty of water.,
Check your squirrel for wounds and injuries.,
Encourage exercise.",How to Take Care of a Wild Squirrel2," You need to make sure your squirrel has a healthy, balanced diet. As squirrels are not traditionally kept as pets, this can be somewhat tricky.


Do not attempt to feed a baby squirrel on your own. Baby squirrels need specific vitamins and minerals. Feeding a baby squirrel formula or milk could result in the squirrel dying. Take your baby squirrel to a vet or wildlife rescue as soon as you can. The workers there will know how to feed him properly. In the event you take him back home with you, you can learn how to care for the baby online at TheSquirrelBoard.com. They do make specially designed food for squirrels. It can be tricky to find, however, as it may be sold at your local pet store. Some states do not allow people to keep squirrels as pets. You may be able to order squirrel food online, but it might take a few days. In the event you cannot get squirrel food quickly, TheSquirrelBoard.com has recipes to make temporary formula. , Keep a bowl of water in your squirrels cage or enclosure. Squirrels need plenty of water for their health and wellbeing. You can either leave water in a bowl or use a bottle, like you would in a hamster cage. If you're getting a bottle, make sure you use a glass bottle. Some squirrels chew through plastic.If you're giving water to a baby squirrel, make sure any bowls you use are not too big. You would not want a baby squirrel to accidentally drown in his water bottle. You can place rocks or marbles at the bottom and fill the bowl to just halfway up to the marbles so he doesn’t drown.

, If you found a squirrel in the wild, he may be injured. You should carefully assess a squirrel for injury and get him veterinary care if you see any injuries.


Find a safe spot in your home with good lighting. Stay away from children or other pets. Wear heavy, protective gloves when handling a wild animal. You should also wear a long sleeve coat. If a squirrel has not been handled before, he may bite or scratch. If you are bitten/scratched, rabies is NOT A PROBLEM. Squirrels are cleaner than most other animals. Just rinse out the cut and go about your business. Keep a basin of warm water and a few clean washcloths on hand. Check the face, nose, and mouth for dried blood. If you see any parasites, like fleas or ticks, remove them. Parasites should be killed if still alive to avoid infecting other pets in your home. If you need to wash any blood, wring out the rag thoroughly and move it gently over the squirrel's fur.Pay attention to your squirrel's limbs. Lets and feet may be twisted awkwardly or limp. Baby squirrels are especially prone to injury from falling out of a tree or nest.If your squirrel is injured, contact a wildlife rehabber and/or vet IMMEDIATELY.

, Squirrels need a lot of exercise. If you plan to keep your squirrel for awhile, you need to make sure he spends time building his muscles.


Allow your squirrel access to one room of your house for at least an hour a day. Make sure you remove anything breakable or anything you do not want damaged. Allow your squirrels to run, climb, and play in this room.Do not allow the squirrel outside without a cage. Hawks and other predators are faster than you and can make a meal out of the baby before you can react. Also, the baby may get spooked and run away, to never return, and thus die due to not knowing how to fend for himself. If you're keeping your squirrel longer than a week or so, install some perches in his cage. As stated earlier, bird perches work well for a squirrel cage. They should come with manufacturer's instructions for set up.

Look for an exotic veterinarian in your area and take your squirrel in for regular checkups. Start building your release cage ASAP. Great guidelines can be found online at TheSquirrelBoard.com. , Not every state allows squirrels as pets or even to be raised by someone non licensed. Some states may allow squirrels to be kept domestically but may have laws or regulations forbidding you from taking a squirrel out of the wild. You also might need a permit in some states to own a squirrel. Make sure you check your state's government website for specifics about the laws in your state., It is not recommended that you try to keep a wild squirrel as a pet. Squirrels are not domesticated and do not do well in captivity. They can be high energy and destructive if taken in from the wild and kept as pets. It's strongly recommended you make every effort to get your squirrel to a wildlife rescue as soon as you can. They are also very expensive – plan to invest A LOT of money into the squirrel before release. "

Talk to a wildlife rescue, if possible.,
Place your cage outdoors.,
Lessen contact.,
Release the squirrel at least five miles from where he was found.,
Choose a safe location.",How to Take Care of a Wild Squirrel4," Re-releasing an injured animal into the wild requires a certain level of expertise. If there is a wildlife rescue in your area, it's best to contact the rescue before attempting to rehabilitate a squirrel by yourself. Even simply talking to a worker on the phone can be invaluable as you'll be provided with important information on safely releasing your squirrel.

, If you want to eventually release a wild squirrel, you need to make sure you do not domesticate him too much. If your squirrel is injured, you should keep his cage inside your home or garage until he's strong again. However, once he seems to be recovering steadily you should place the cage outside. This way, he won't get too used to human contact. When he's fully healed, you can develop a plan to release him.


Place a tarp over his cage. This will provide him protection from the rain as well as shade from the sun.You might want to transfer him to a cage with a feeding door if you're not already using one. You do not want to release your squirrel prematurely. He may escape during feeding without the proper door.Keep the cage in a place that's easily reachable for you. However, keep it far away from other humans. If your squirrel gets too used to human contact, it may be difficult to release him back into the wild., You should still provide your squirrel with food. However, lessen your contact with him as time goes on. Spend less time interacting with the squirrel on a day-to-day basis. If you have friends or neighbors nearby, advise them to leave the squirrel alone., If you've been caring for a squirrel, he may return to your home after being released. Squirrels can be pests, especially if they're trying to get into your home. When you decide to release your squirrel, pick a location that is at least 5 miles from the sight where you originally found him. More distance is generally better. If 10 miles is possible, release him 10 miles away., The location where you release your squirrel is important. You should take a few things into consideration before re-releasing a squirrel.


Do a little research on the type of animals typically found in the area you're considering. You should choose an area with a low population of potential predators, like house cats. Even if his injuries have healed, it may take your squirrel a few days to readjust to the wild. This can make him vulnerable to predators.
Make sure there are other wild squirrels in the area you choose. You want to release the squirrel into his natural habitat.You should not release a squirrel near a busy street, intersection, or highway.
You should also double check the legality of releasing a squirrel in the area you chose. Some states may have restrictions on re-releasing wild animals in certain regions."

Let your squirrel go.",How to Raise a Baby Squirrel," While you can certainly raise a baby squirrel, no one can raise it better than its mother. When you find a baby squirrel, it’s important to always try to reunite baby and mother before doing anything else. A squirrel mama will look for her babies and reclaim them if they are warm.Squirrel moms will not take back a cold baby because they will think it is either sick or dying. It’s up to you to monitor the situation. If the baby is hurt, cold, or it's nighttime and mom does not come to get the baby within one to two hours, the baby is probably an orphan and needs your help.
Human scent on a squirrel baby will not deter the mother from taking them back so touching them is not a worry at any point.
If there is more than one baby and one is already dead, the mom will not take the live one(s) back. Therefore it will be up to you to rehab them and see if mom will reclaim them after some time has passed and the scent of her deceased baby subsides.;
, Wearing thick leather gloves (just to be safe), take this chance to observe the baby and check for injuries, bugs, bleeding, bumps or wounds. If they are bleeding or you see broken bones or serious injury, you need to find a vet who will see a squirrel as soon as possible. Most vets will not see the squirrel unless you are licensed. If this is the case, call any and all rehabbers in your area immediately.

, Baby squirrels don’t generate their own heat so you must do that for them. Find or borrow a heating pad, electric blanket, a hot water bottle, or even a hand warmer. A liquid heating pad that recirculates water is the best for heat control. Make sure the heating apparatus of choice’s temperature is a low-to-medium temperature.


Baby squirrels should be incubated at about 99 °F (37 °C). If you have a thermometer handy or can borrow one it will help you create the right environment for your baby squirrel’s good health.
Some heating pads shut off after a few hours, so check it often to be sure it is still on. If you have no option, but to raise the baby yourself, invest in a non-auto-shut-off heating pad. The baby's life depends on it. You can also place a towel over top of the container or the lid to the container with air holes punched out to keep the heat inside.

, Once you get what you need to warm your baby squirrel, a small box, basket or a large Tupperware about a foot square (with air holes punched out of the lid) or another similar container is needed. Place your heating device to one side. This way if it gets too hot, the baby squirrel can simply crawl away from the pad. If a heating pad is used, be sure it is under the container, not inside with the baby.


Make a nest inside the box with nesting material from the area where you found the baby. Make a donut-shaped nest and place the baby inside. Be sure the heat source is nuzzled up against the nest but not directly in contact with the baby.
If necessary you can use soft fabrics from your home. Do not use towels as baby squirrels can snag their toes and break ankles, lose limbs, etc.

, Put the nest outside. If the area is safe from dogs, cats, raccoons, and other predators you can put the nest on the ground. If you’re not sure, put it up in a tree or on a pole to keep it safe.


As your baby squirrel warms it will instinctively call for its mother. If she is around there is an excellent chance she will come and get her baby. Squirrel mothers carry their babies just like a cat so don’t worry about the nest being in a tree.

, After one to two hours it’s time to throw in the towel. There are many reasons why the mother may not come. She may be injured or dead, for instance. In any event, at this point the baby and your nest need to come join your household.


If you have a dog or a cat make sure the baby has its own protected room and other animals are never allowed to have contact with the baby.
Make sure you continue to keep the nest warm.

, Call your local vets, animal shelters, humane societies, Fish & Game, Fish & Wildlife, and Wildlife groups to get a referral for a local wildlife rehabilitator that takes in squirrels. You can also search online by typing in ""squirrel rehabilitation"" and your state and city.


Go to http://www.thesquirrelboard.com for help with the baby squirrel until you find a rehabber. It is a forum that you can join and ask questions that will help you raise the baby until a rehabber is found.
If a rehabber cannot be found, the squirrel board will help you raise the baby to release back into the wild.

, In the United Kingdom it is a criminal offense that carries a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment, to rear, keep or reintroduce a grey squirrel back into the environment. Some states in the U.S., such as Washington state, have laws that make it illegal to possess or provide rehabilitation to a sick, injured, or orphaned wild animal, such as a squirrel, unless you are transporting the animal to a licensed wildlife rehabilitation for care.Familiarize yourself with the laws in your area, and be aware that you may be liable for prosecution if it is illegal to raise orphaned wildlife.

, Be aware that baby squirrels might have parasites such as fleas, mites, ticks and maggots. Remove the fleas and maggots by hand with flea combs and/or tweezers. Petco also sells flea and mite sprays made specifically for small animals such as hamsters. Always check to ensure this is safe for your baby. Non-chemical options such as diatomaceous earth and blue Dawn dish soap (blue only) may be used.


If it's a tiny, pink-skinned baby, do not apply any chemicals to the squirrel. Put the spray on the cloth around the baby. Do not spray into wounds. It will sting.
Wash your hands immediately after cleaning it, since the parasites could spread to you or other animals.

, You can see how dehydrated they are by gently pinching their skin. If the ""tent"" of their skin stays there over a second or more, they are dehydrated. A dehydrated baby squirrel needs water as fast as possible as you don’t know how long it has been since they ate or drank.


Wrinkly, sunken eyes or appearing emaciated are also telltale signs of a dehydrated squirrel.

, Most fallen babies will be in need of water. An even better solution is to go to the supermarket or drug store and purchase Pedialyte in the baby section. They may also carry their own store brand of rehydrating baby fluid as well (Gerber has a brand also). Squirrels like fruit flavors, but plain will do if it's all they've got. Do not use Gatorade or any other sports drink.


If you are nowhere near a store or drugstore, here is a homemade formula:
One teaspoon salt
Three teaspoons of sugar
One quart of warm water
Mix well

, These are the types of syringe that have no needle. Do not use anything larger than 5 cc syringe. The best option would be to use 1cc syringes. These can be obtained by asking your local pharmacy for some needle-less syringes.

, You don’t need a thermometer to obtain a precise temperature, but the baby should be warm to the touch. This is a crucial step before you give it any fluids because it won't be able to digest what you’re feeding it if it is not warm.

, If your baby is hairless and pink it is probably also tiny, about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) long. It's easy to aspirate the babies when they are this little and that leads to fluid in their lungs. This will give them pneumonia and they might die. To avoid this, hold the baby upright in your hand with the syringe pointed towards the roof of their mouth. Do not force feed the baby - go as slow as the baby requires. It may take an hour to get 1cc in the baby until they learn how to suck on the syringe.


Be sure the fluids are warm but not too hot. You can store the unused amounts in the refrigerator.
For these little babies, just put one little drop on their lips at a time and let them suck that in. If they won't take the fluids, poke a drop in their mouth so they can taste some of it first. Some will just open their mouths wide and start sucking away.
If their eyes are open, you can let them take the syringe in their mouth and gently give them a few drops.
If a lot falls out of their mouth or comes out the nose, you're going way too fast. Hold them upside down immediately for 10 seconds, then blot the fluids off their nose and out of their nostrils then wait about one minute before you continue.

, Give tiny, eyes-closed pink babies 1 cc every two hours; fully furred eyes-closed babies 1-2 cc about every two hours; open-eyed babies 2-4 cc every three hours until a rehabber calls you back with your instructions.

If the baby is gagging or unresponsive to feeding, take it immediately to a rehabber and request lactated ringers. If done properly, these should help get the baby feeding again.#*Feed every two hours around the clock until the baby squirrel is two weeks old. After that, feed every three hours until their eyes open. Then feed the baby every four hours until weaned, which is between seven and ten weeks old., They need to be stimulated to poo and pee when their eyes are closed so before and after each feeding of fluids you will need to gently wipe the genital and anal area with a warm, moist cotton ball or Q-tip until they pee or poo. Otherwise their stomach will bloat and may result in death.


Their mothers do this for them in the wild. If they are very dehydrated and haven't eaten in a while, they may not pee for a quite a few feedings and may not poo for a day.

, If the baby is feeding well and hydrating and continuously growing without incident, feed it every hour for four to six hours. Use the following recipe as a guideline:1 part powdered puppy milk replacer
2 parts distilled water
1/4 part whipping cream (not whipped cream) or plain yogurt

, Microwaving is fine. Like liquids, introduce this soft food gradually. Like the Pedialyte, however, you will move up the feeding steps rather quickly.Do not mix Pedialyte and formula. Start with a weak formula mixture. 4 parts water to 1 part powder for 1 day. 3 parts water to 1 part powder for 1 day. 2 parts water to 1 part powder until weaning.

, Once your little one is ready for solid food (when its eyes are open), you can use Rodent Blocks by Kaytee, Oxbow, or Mazuri found at most pet stores. They contain the right amount and right types of nutrients. You can also buy blocks specifically made for squirrels at HenrysPets.com. Give the squirrel blocks until he is released. , Start with healthy vegetables (broccoli, spring mix, kale, etc). Once the baby is eating all blocks and veggies, you can slowly introduce fruits and nuts. Give only one nut per day and only 1-2 small pieces of fruit per day.


Like a human baby it will also let you know when it’s done with formula by pushing it away.
If your squirrel pees on the food, don't worry, it's just what baby squirrels do.
Give them small amounts of just one food at a time to be sure it doesn’t get diarrhea.
Avoid picking acorns from the ground as many contain an invisible toxin that can quickly kill a squirrel. , Squirrels need room to run a bit. Make sure the cage is at least 2’2’x3’ with shelves, a bed, and places to hide and climb.


Keep a ceramic water source in the cage. If it’s plastic the squirrel will chew, destroy, and possibly eat it.
Provide it with toys to play with. Good ideas are pinecones, clean sticks, or a clean, thick dog bone. Bad ideas are anything it can rip apart, choke on, and throw the stuffing all over the place (like a bean-stuffed toy).Include objects to grind his teeth on, as they never stop growing.

, They need social interaction, especially if your baby is a loner. This should include at least one hour of outside-the-cage fun time every day. If you don’t have a room safe for this, either get a larger outdoor cage for them to spend time in (you’ll eventually need one anyway, but don't transfer the baby to the outdoor cage without a travel carrier) or move it to a different cage in a different part of your house. Do not allow the baby to play outside while not contained. Hawks and other predators are much faster than you and may snatch up the baby before you have a chance to react. The baby may also get spooked and run away, unable to return.


It is a good idea to let them get used to heights and curtain rods will be a great help here. You don't want your baby to be crawling on the ground once it gets outside and many hand-raised squirrels tend to do just that, ending up easy prey for snakes, cats etc.
Rehabilitators will pair a baby squirrel with a friend before either opens their eyes so they bond together. This is yet another reason to take the baby to a rehabilitator: two squirrels will help each other survive in the wild in a variety of ways.A baby squirrel kept in a small cage too long can have growth deformities from the cramped spaces or from circling the small cage.
Once the baby stops taking formula completely, stop taking the baby out. He will need to learn a natural fear of humans to ensure his safety in the wild.

, At four to five months of age the squirrel will need to be moved to an outside cage that is as large as possible, preferably at least six feet tall. Make sure it is predator-proof.


Make sure it has a nesting box, sticks to play with, allows your squirrel to climb and jump on various surfaces, and is partially covered from rain. The cage should also have a solid bottom or your squirrel could pull a daring escape. If you're building one, a sally port is recommended to ensure he doesn't jump out when you're opening the door to feed him. Ensure the cage has a tiny squirrel-sized door for release. This door should be around 4 inches square. This way, if a squirrel is being chased by a larger predator, he can return home safely without fear that the larger predator will follow him and trap him. When it is time for release, open this door only and allow the squirrel to venture out on his own. Your squirrel should spend at least four weeks in its outdoor cage prior to release. During this time, it's crucial to feed wild foods so he knows what to look for.

, Because it has no mother or siblings, you must make sure the release area is safe from dogs, cats, unfriendly neighbors, and other predators. The area should have plenty of water, food, and fruit and nut trees.


Provide enough food for at least three weeks after release. If you release in your yard, put up a feeder and keep it regularly stocked with fresh food. After all, you already know what your squirrel likes to eat.Putting your squirrel back in the environment where you found it is a great idea if it is safe and provides to food sources it needs.
It’s vitally important not to release your squirrel too soon. At four months a baby is woefully unprepared to survive on its own and is easy prey for predators.
You must monitor the squirrel for the first week to make sure he is able to find food, water, and is confident in the new surroundings.

Look for common Birman cat fur colors.,
Look for a single layered coat.,
Examine their paws carefully.,
Take note of the cat's size.,
Look closely at the eyes and head.,
Observe their behavior and personality.",How to Identify Birman Cats1," Birman cats are known as color-point cats, and are born fully white with pink noses.They are known as pointed cats because the majority of their coloration will be at ""points,"" like their face, ear, legs, and tail. Their color patterns will emerge as they grow, and can be diverse. Their traditional coat colors are seal or blue point but can also be found in: Red pointed, Seal Tabby (Lynx) point, Blue point, Blue Tortie, Chocolate Point, Lilac Tabby (Lynx), and Seal Tortie Tabby.;
, Unlike most cats who have double coats, a Birman only have a single layer coat. This will make their fur slightly lighter and softer to the touch with a ruff of fur around their neck., While Birman cat colors can be similar to other cats, their white paws, really make them stand out. All Birmans will have four white paws that almost appear like gloves. The myths about the Birman cat's origins make a point to say the white paws remained so as a sign of their purity.If you plan on showing your cat, make sure the paws are fully white and as symmetrical as possible.
This is also a way to tell the Birman apart from other pointed cats, like the Siamese cat. While they may have similar color patterns, the Siamese or Persian will not have the starkly white paws.

, Birman's are an average sized cat. They generally range from 7-12 pounds with females being on the smaller end of this range. They are approximately two and a half feet in length and their height should be 12-16 inches. They are considered a medium to large cat.If you are looking at kittens, this can be more difficult. However, most reputable breeders will allow access to the parent where you can better gauge the potential adult size of your kitten.

, While the white paws are a distinctive feature of the Birman cat, so are its deep blue eyes. The ideal eye color is a deep sapphire blue.


Birman cats should have a rounded face, medium ears and a ""Roman nose,"" which will give them a pleasant looking disposition., Over the years, purebred Birman cats have been selectively bred for a mellow disposition and to weed out any aggressive tendencies. Birman cats are quiet and have a chirp like meow. They are typically mellow, gentle, and sociable. They are very patient and gentle which makes them a great choice for a family or kid. They are very social cats so be prepared for a cat that will require a fair amount of attention and want to be near you often. Many people compare them to dogs for how attached they become to their owners.If they are kept with other breeds, they can sometimes act dominant.

Scout your yard.,
Create a grip.,
Wrap the squirrel house.,
Mount the squirrel house.,
Add food.",How to Build a Squirrel House2," Plan to spend a day watching your yard to witness how active the squirrels are. Take mental notes of certain trees you see multiple squirrels pass through. Pick out one of the trees that you think will hold that house.


To promote squirrel activity, choose a location that is 10 to 30 feet off the ground.The higher the house is, the more likely squirrels will occupy it.

, You will need two large nails to create a stable grip for the squirrel house. Use a secure and long ladder to reach the desired spot for the house. Have a partner around to spot you for safety measures. Drive the first nail into the tree with a hammer, but leave an inch exposed. Take the second nail and drive that about eight inches parallel to the first nail. Leave an inch of the second nail exposed.


The squirrel house should fit in between the two nails.

, You will tighten the squirrel house to the tree by tightening a thick wire around the house and tree. Make sure you use strong wire that has tightening abilities. You could also tie the wire together and tighten with pliers, but this may prove dangerous at such a height.


Go to a local hardware store and ask about thick gauged wired that can be tightened easily. They will have something that will work.

, Fit the squirrel house between the two nails previously inserted into the tree. The goal is to have the nails fit the house’s width in a snug manner. Then use the wire from the previous step to secure the squirrel house.

, Squirrels are easy to attract once you’ve provided a shelter for them. Squirrels enjoy the same foods that birds like. This is a reason why squirrels invade your bird-feeders. You could use bird food or any of the following:


Fruit (berries)
Sunflower seeds
Nuts
Pet food"

Ask for pedigree papers.,
Get a DNA test.,
Be weary of where you get your kitten.",How to Identify Birman Cats2," Cats like the Birman that are more exclusive and expensive than the typical cat should come with some sort of paper validation affirming their pedigree. Various associations offer pedigree papers that demonstrate the cat's line. For Birman cats, choose a breeder whose cats are registered with a cat registry, particularly one that specializes in Birmans.You should also be careful of putting too much stock in this, as some kitten mills can purchase papers that do not necessarily reflect the cat's lineage. You can inquire into the breeders history breeding Birmans and to meet the parents to put yourself more at ease.

, Even more certain than papers are scientific DNA tests. This may sound complicated and expensive but is both common and affordable for a prospective cat owner. Choose a reputable DNA testing service, particularly one backed by a university or your vet.These tests are typically over 90% accurate.
You will only need to obtain a cotton swab sample from your cat's cheek and follow protocol and send it to the lab for testing. In exchange, they should be able to give you a full report that gives the cat's parentage. This can be done to kitten as well as adults, as your cat's DNA will never change., Especially with more expensive breeds, kitten mills that attempt to sell non-pedigree cats can be a problem. Make sure that you get to see where the kittens were raised, meet the parents if possible and inquire into their experience as a breeder.


Be cautious of deals that seem too good to be true. Although the price of Birman cats can vary considerably based on where you are, you can expect to pay more than a typical cat, and sometimes several hundreds of dollars, depending on the pedigree. If there are Birman cats available for a price that seems too good to be true, inquire with the seller the reasons behind the low asking price.

"
"
Do a search on the Internet for ""Birman"" cats.,
Contact local animal shelters.,
Contact a breeders association.",How to Identify Birman Cats3," This can help you find any breeders in your area or groups dedicated to the breed that may point you in the right direction.

, Shelters usually have an over abundance of kittens and cats. Although they are not usually purebred cats, there is a chance that you could stumble upon a Birman if you know how to recognize one.

, This is a sure way to make sure you are getting a reputable stock of Birman. A great example of this is the The International Cat Association (TICA) who's website includes breeder listings and criteria to look for on your own. They also have information on exhibitions and shows where you can get into contact with Birman breeders. "

Play with your Bengal cat.,
Prevent your Bengal cat from getting sick.,
Make sure you have a good vet to take good care of your Bengal cat when it is sick.,
Don't hurt or yell at your Bengal cat.,
Give your cat love.",How to Keep a Bengal Cat Happy," Make sure everything is done correctly, so your Bengal cat feels loved from you.


Make sure you feed it a food that is healthy for them. Choose whether to feed your cat dry food or wet food. Consider asking your local vet for advice about feeding it the correct type of food. Make sure the ingredients are appropriate for your cat to eat.

You may feed your cat chicken, but make sure there isn't any dressings or other foods on it. Make sure that the chicken is washed and free of debris. Tuna is also a nice snack, but reserve chicken and tuna fish as special treats. Feeding chicken and tuna to them exclusively detracts from their overall health. A healthy diet keeps your cat happy since they won't get diseases or become sick.
Never feed any of the following foods:

Chocolate
Candy
Grapes
Onions
Garlic
Wheat




Give your Bengal cat fresh, clean water every day. Place it in a water bowl, or purchase a water fountain from your local pet store.
Exercise your Bengal cat. Get a laser pointer and have your cat chase it. You may not want to point it at the ceiling or high walls around your house, as your Bengal cat may jump high and hit a wall, which could injure it. You can also tie a string to a toy feather and hold onto the string, while the cat chases the feather. Move it so your Bengal cat will pounce and run. Make sure the object your cat is chasing is perfectly safe and cat-friendly.
Walking your Bengal on a leash. Bengal cats are territorial by nature, They need to roam through the open spaces in their territory. The outdoor activity is a major stress reliever for your Bengal.;
, Toys used for exercise can be great things for using for play time. You can still let your cat play with other toys too, such as a ball (make sure that it's too big for your cat to swallow!). Play with your cat for 30-60 minutes, but don't tire it. If it lies down for a rest, don't force it to play. It may be exhausted from playing so much. Do not give it anything dangerous to play with such as:


String
Yarn
Sharp toys
Toys with loose objects on them
Small toys
Toys with things that can fall off

,


Keep the litter clean. If you do not do this, you and/or your Bengal cat may get sick. Scoop out the feces and throw the dirty litter away in a trash bag. Clean the litter box with a sponge and scrub dish soap on it. Rinse it off with water. Dry the litter box with a clean towel, and make sure the litter box is completely dry before pouring in new litter.

, Look out for vets that act strangely, as if they want to kill your cat. If you find the vet acting this way, do not choose him/her. Make sure the vet includes Bengal cats . Some vets will not cure Bengal cats.


You may want to see how he/she cares for other animals to see how the vet does, but do not snoop too much.

, This may actually make the cat not like you anymore. Never hit your Bengal cat. This may wound the cat, and it may start to ignore you. Yelling at your Bengal cat could cause it to ignore you too. Instead, say ""No"" firmly for what they've done wrong.

, Pet it on its favorite places of its body, but don't pet anywhere it doesn't like to be petted. Scratch its head if it likes it, and if it purrs or nudges you, it may mean it likes you!


Don't scratch the Bengal cat too hard, or push down too hard while petting. This may hurt it.

Decide which spotted cat you're looking at.,
Tell smaller wild cats apart from their larger counterparts and from each other.,
Note the subtle differences between the three common cat species that have tufted ears.",How to Identify Feline Species by Fur," If you're trying to work out which spotted great cat you're observing in a movie, photo or artwork, there are some telltale signs to help you without resorting to a great cat expert, shown in the cat's fur patterns. Big cats of the spotted variety will be one of either a cheetah, leopard or jaguar. Here is how to tell which of the three you're looking at:



Cheetah: If it is slender, long-legged, and on open grassland, it must be a cheetah. The cheetah's spots are simple black blots scattered over yellow fur. There are no elaborate patterns as in other spotted cats. You may also easily identify a cheetah from the tear-like stripes that run from its eyes, and down to its jaw. This stripe reduces the daytime glare, and lets the cheetah see better. Cheetah cubs look different from adults. In addition to spots, a cheetah cub has long, silvery hairs on its head, neck and all along its back.







Leopard: On a leopard's fur, small spots form oval patterns that are called rosettes. They are called rosettes because these clusters of spots look like little flowers. A rosette is usually filled by darker, orange or brown fur. Rosettes occur on the sides of a leopard's body, along its neck, chest, belly and back. Its head and legs are patterned in large, simple spots. Compare the pictures here to see how a leopard's rosettes are smaller than those of a jaguar.







Jaguar: As the picture shows, a jaguar's rosettes are much larger than a leopard's. Jaguar rosettes are also squarish - shaped roughly like squares, pentagons or triangles. Leopard rosettes are circular or oval. Some rosettes on a jaguar's fur have a tiny spot at their center. Leopard rosettes almost never have a spot within the circular patterns.





;
, Smaller felines can be easy to tell apart from big cats, because they look more like domesticated cats. They have comparatively smaller heads, large ears and large eyes. Some spotted wild cats that are commonly filmed are the ocelot, margay and serval. In order to work out which one you're looking at according to its pattern:


Ocelot: The ocelot is a wild cat commonly found across central America and South America. Its fur is distinctive, because it has rosettes that are so stretched that they look like stripes running along its body. These large stripe-shaped rosettes run from its neck to its belly, giving it a distinctive appearance.







Margay: The margay is a rare cat that lives in the rainforests of central America and South America. Its coat is a combination of large brown spots, and long, stripe-like rosettes. It has thick, black stripes running along its back , long rosettes on its shoulders and front legs, and round rosettes on its belly.







Clouded leopard: The clouded leopard is so called because its spots are large, cloud-like patterns, as the photo shows. Clouded leopards also have very large, muscular tails. The head of a clouded leopard is longer than that of most felines.







Serval: The serval is a long-legged feline with a short tail. They are easy to identify because of their spotted coats and short tails. A serval has large spots on much of its body, and a few stripes on its shoulders.







, These three cats are the lynx, bobcat and caracal. They each have short tails. Characteristics that distinguish these cats include:Caracal: This cat has long tufted ears and no markings on the fur.

Bobcat: This cat has short tufted ears and short facial ruffs, and a short tail. The markings on a bobcat tend to be spotted and streaked, and the markings are discrete. Bobcats have shorter legs than lynx.

Lynx: This cat has tufted ears, a facial ruff and mottled fur with a pale base. It has a short tail with a black tip. It has longer legs than the bobcat and large feet (for walking on snow). The characteristics on the lynx are more exaggerated than those on the bobcat.

Pay for a DNA test.",How to Identify an Oriental Cat," Oriental cats, much like Siamese cats, have a unique body frame that is often described as sleek or graceful. Thus, they’re relatively easy to tell apart from different cat breeds.


They have a long torso, neck, legs, and tail.
They have an angular head.
Their ears are relatively large and flaring.
Oriental cats are also medium sized and may range from 6 to 12 pounds.;
, As opposed to the Siamese cat, Oriental cats have many more color variations. In addition, Orientals come in both shorthair or longhair varieties. Some of the most important characteristics of the Oriental’s hair and color include:


They come in more than 300 color variations. However, the most common colors are ebony, white, chestnut, or blue. This is opposed to Siamese cats come in about 4 different variations, including seal, chocolate, blue, and lilac point.
They can be both short and medium-haired. However, short-haired variants are much more common.
Their hair may appear glossy.
They have solid, tabby, or bi-color patterns., Combined with their length, the color and shape of the Oriental’s eyes makes it a unique attribute that will help you identify them. Ultimately, much like with other attributes, the eyes of Oriental cats are much like the eyes of Siamese cats.


Most oriental cats have blue or green eyes.
White Orientals could have blue or odd colored eyes.
Pointed oriental cats have blue eyes., Unlike some other breeds of cats, many Orientals demonstrate a close attachment to their owners. They often manifest this with affection and by staying close to their people.


Orientals will follow their owners around relentlessly.
They may seem as if they are needy or are very interested in what you are doing.
If you don’t pay attention to them, they’ll be very vocal about getting your attention., Oriental cats are exceptionally social animals. They will make noises, assert themselves, and be very interactive. This contrasts to other cats that may be more solitary and quiet.


The cat may play games, like fetch, with children.
They may get along with other cats and even dogs.
They like to be around people. For example, if you have a gathering, your oriental might make the rounds and introduce itself to your friends and family., Orientals are very curious. This, along with their intelligence, means that you should notice a level of inquisitiveness that you might not notice with typical house cats.


Make sure to secure parts of your home that are dangerous. Orientals are adept at opening drawers or even doors.
Secure your purse or wallet, as they might open them up and play with the contents.
Try to keep them entertained with games, toys, and by playing with them. Entertainment is a great way to positively channel their curiosity., Breeders of Oriental or Siamese cats are perhaps the best authorities to consult when trying to identify an Oriental. They’ll be able to take important factors into account, like the cat’s body type, color, and personality.


If you own a Siamese or Oriental, contact the breeder you adopted it from. They should be happy to help you confirm whether another cat is or is not an Oriental.
Run an internet search for breeders of Orientals or Siamese cats in your area. Call them and ask if they’ll help you identify a cat.
If you have trouble finding a breeder in your area, you may be able to contact one in another region who will look at photos and give you their assessment., Next to a breeder, your vet is the most qualified professional to help identify an oriental cat. Ultimately, your vet’s substantial experience will be an asset.


Call your vet and see if you can bring the cat by for a quick identification. While some vets may require an appointment, others may be happy to take a quick look.
If you don’t own the cat in question, take pictures and ask your vet if they’ll look at the photos.

, If you’re still unsure that a specific cat is an Oriental, you can choose to run a DNA test on your cat. The DNA test will tell you without a doubt whether the cat is a purebred or not.


The DNA test will give you an idea of the breeds of cats in your cat’s blood line.
Visit popular websites like animalsdna.com, vetdnacenter.com, or catdnatest.org for more information on testing a specific cat.
As there are many DNA tests commercially available, make sure to confirm that one you choose will verify the specific breed of your cat. If trying to determine the difference between a Siamese and Oriental cat, it may be best to call the vendor to verify the test will work."

This is why the exotic shorthair is nicknamed the ""the lazy man’s Persian.""The only area on the cat that may have longer fur is the tail, but this is not always the case.;
, The exotic shorthair comes in a wide variety of fur colors. Its coloring can be anything from white all the way to black and every color in between, including variations of brown, orange, and grey. This makes it very difficult for non-professionals to use coat coloring as a way to identify the breed.

This is not to say that there isn't a standard for the coloring of an exotic shorthair. It just means that the standard is extremely varied and complicated.

, An exotic shorthair's eyes are very distinctive. They should only be green or blue green, or brilliant copper in color. They are also very round, which complements the roundness of the cat's body and face shape., Like its relative, the Persian, the exotic shorthair has a delightfully flat face that is warm and inviting. Its eyes are set far apart and its face is very round and large in proportion to its body. It has an extremely stubby nose that is set in line with its eyes, which is key to its distinctive look.The cat's nose is almost flush against the head, as the cat's muzzle is very short.

, An exotic shorthair has small ears for the size of its head but this smallness highlights the cat's round and soft head. The short little ears are spread far apart and, although sticking up, are low to the head.The ears are rounded at the tips and tilted slightly forward, which also increases the rounded appearance of the cat's head.

, The exotic shorthair cat usually looks big boned yet well proportioned. The general look of its body proportion has been described as ""rounded."" This strength of build may also be described as ""sturdy"" yet not large or obese.The cat's legs are slightly short for the size of its body. This also adds to the perceived roundness of the cat.
Part of the reason the cat has this appearance is the plushness of its coat. The fullness of the fur adds to the roundness of the cat's appearance.

, Exotic shorthair cats are known to be easy going and relaxed. They love to lounge around and curl up in their owners laps. They also don't get disturbed by much, so are not apt to run away and hide if a new person comes in your house or a loud noise is made., The relaxed nature of the exotic shorthair means that they like interacting with their humans but they do not need attention all of the time. For example, depending on the specific cat, they might sleep with you or take a nap on your lap, or they might prefer to spend their sleeping time alone.Some people assert that male exotic shorthair cats are more cuddly and affectionate than female exotic shorthair cats.This may, however, depend completely on your specific cat.

, Unlike a Persian, which is known to be very docile, an exotic shorthair can have more liveliness. They like to play and run around more than a Persian and they tend to stay active into adulthood.Your adult exotic shorthair is likely to enjoy the simple pleasures of a cat's life, such as playing with a dripping faucet or climbing in and out of a cardboard box.

, Exotic shorthair cats are very quiet cats. Their voices are seldom heard and they do not meow incessantly when begging like other breeds can. While there are always exceptions, if your cat is very, very quiet, it may be an exotic shorthair.Instead of meowing for food or attention, an exotic shorthair is likely to sit right in front of you and make intense eye contact with you until you give it what it wants.

, If you are unsure about your cat's breed, discuss it with your veterinarian. They are likely to be well versed in popular cat breeds and are likely to see a wide variety in their work.

Discussing your cat's breed with your veterinarian can also allow you to get information about potential health problems that are common with your particular breed of cat. Once your veterinarian identifies what breed your cat is, ask them about any issues that might be common in this type of cat.

, If you cannot identify the physical characteristics or behavior yourself, consult with an expert. This could be a cat behaviorist or trainer, or someone that is familiar with the breed standards of the exotic shorthair, such as a breeder or member of a cat breed club.

If you want to find a breeder or a cat breed club, consult the website of a national cat organization, such as the Cat Fanciers' Association. They should have lists available of breeders and local clubs available.

, If you want definitive verification about what type of cat you have, get a DNA test done on it. You will need to contact a company that does cat DNA testing and have them send you a sampling kit. Once you have collected a sample of your cat's saliva, you will send it back to the company to be analyzed and then the company will send you the results.There are a wide variety of labs that do DNA testing on pets. Some are private labs and some are labs connected to organizations, such as veterinary schools or animal appreciation organizations.
DNA testing is done for a fee, so you may want to shop around to see what company will do your cat's DNA testing for cheapest. However, you may also want to search for online reviews of companies to verify that they provide quality service.

Feel for a dense, kinky coat.,
Look for rounded ears with crimped inner hairs.,
Look for kinked or curled whiskers.,
Check your cat for bright, round eyes.,
Weigh your cat.,
Look for rounded paws with heavy pads.",How to Identify an American Wirehair1," American Wirehairs are known for their unusual wirehaired coats, which means the hair will have a textured, crimped appearance. The coat’s ripples often make it stand straight up on the back of the spine. To the touch, the coat will feel thick and dense., American wirehairs have medium sized ears with rounded tips. Inside, the hairs of their ears will exhibit the same characteristic crimp of their coat. Examine your cat’s ears gently when you stroke it to get a better look.

, American Wirehairs often look as though they’ve put their paw in an electrical socket, because their whiskers have exaggerated kinks and curls, almost like in the cartoons. To get a better look at your cat’s whiskers, scratch under its chin so you can examine them better., American Wirehairs have round, bright eyes that turn slightly upward. Their eyes can come in a variety of colors but always exhibit a slightly enlarged, rounded shape., American Wirehairs are muscular cats of medium build. American Wirehairs weigh 6-11 lb or 2.5-5 kg. If you want to weigh your cat at home, a good method is to weigh just yourself, then weigh yourself holding your cat. The difference will be the cat’s weight., American Wirehairs have medium-size rounded paws. Because they are good hunters, the cats often have heavy pads that are good for grasping prey."

Note your cat’s desire to hunt.,
Encourage your cat to vocalize.,
See if your cat follows you around the house.,
Look for an adaptable cat.,
Get a cat DNA test.,
Consult any breeding papers.",How to Identify an American Wirehair2," American Wirehairs are skilled hunters who enjoy chasing small birds or mice. They may even bring you a “gift” or two. If your cat is not an outdoor cat, this hunting behavior may manifest itself indoors in stalking toys. Pay attention to your cat’s desire to hunt, and try to coax out its inner hunter with feathered toys to gauge its interest., American Wirehairs are usually on the quieter side, preferring play and hunting to lots of meowing. Try engaging your cat in conversation with a few of your best meows to better establish its desire to vocalize. If it is very quiet and meets the other criteria, it could be an American Wirehair., American Wirehairs are affectionate cats that enjoy the company of people. Many American Wirehairs like to follow their owners from room to room, preferring their company to being alone.Just because a cat enjoys your company doesn’t mean it’s a lap cat. Even if your cat doesn’t enjoy being held, it may still be an American Wirehair.

, American Wirehairs are easygoing cats that are not disturbed by minor changes in routine. They are also receptive to learning if you want to reroute undesirable behaviors, for example, offering up a scratching post rather than your favorite chair. Move your cat’s food bowl to a new place to see if it goes with the flow., If you really want to find out for certain if your cat is an American Wirehair, the only way to do so is with a DNA test. Have your veterinarian swab your cat’s saliva to determine what breed or mix it is for sure. It usually takes at least one week to receive results., If you cat is an American Wirehair, it will likely come with a pedigree. This can provide additional information about your cat’s breed and lineage.

Pay attention to a large head.,
Notice full cheeks.,
Look for short ears.,
Check for a muscular body.,
Note thick winter fur.,
Check the lineage.,
Check its weight.,
Look at the cat's height.",How to Identify an American Shorthair Cat1," American shorthairs have an uncommonly large head, particularly in relation to their body size. If you're trying to identify an American shorthair, see if the head seems a bit too large for the cat., One defining characteristic of an American shorthair is a wide face, particularly in the cheeks. The cheeks should seem round and full, which can make the cat look happier. A narrow face is not characteristic of this breed., American shorthairs tend to have shorter ears than other cat breeds. In addition, the ears tend to be pointed. Check the ears on the cat in question to see if they seem shorter than average., American shorthairs were breed to be hearty, muscular cats. Their primary job early on in America was rodent control, particularly on farms. Therefore, over the years, they began to develop strong bodies, so look for sturdy cats with a muscular build.These cats will often have a full head and neck, as well as stout legs.

, Obviously, a shorthair cat is going to have short hair. However, these cats also tend to develop hearty coats during the winter to protect themselves form harsh weather, so their coats will get thicker and longer. In addition, their fur isn't particularly soft, as its main purpose is protection.As far as coloring goes, they come in a wide variety of colors, from tabby to tortoiseshell and calico., If you are looking for a purebred American shorthair, you need to look to the lineage, which is why using a reputable breeder is important. One of the defining characteristics of any cat breed is the fact that it can reproduce cats in the same breed, rather than a collection of different breeds., A male cat of this breed is typically 11 to 15 pounds. The female is a bit smaller, usually 6 to 12 pounds. This cat is a medium-sized breed, so it should look basically like an average-sized cat if you're trying to eyeball it., As a medium-sized breed, American shorthairs are about average height. Most cats in this breed are 10 to 14 inches tall, so see if the cat is in that range when trying to identify the breed."
"
Look for a sociable cat.,
Note if the cat is low-maintenance.,
Notice a quiet cat.,
See if the cat plays well with others.",How to Identify an American Shorthair Cat2," If you're looking for a friendly, affectionate cat, it's hard to go wrong with this breed. They enjoy being around you, and they will cuddle with you when you're nearby. Plus, they don't mind being picked up., While American shorthairs are perfectly friendly, they are also fine being on their own. In other words, they aren't a cat that will be on top of you all the time. That means if you have a busy life, a shorthair may be a good option for you.While they are low-maintenance, they still enjoy play time with you. Try a game that has a bait on the end of a pole that you can make dance for your cat., American shorthairs will talk to you by meowing. However, they aren't especially noisy cats. They generally will show you what they want rather than talking to you. If you want a cat that will hold a ""conversation"" with you, this breed may not be for you, though it does depend on the cat, of course., Because these cats are easy-going, they do well with families, including those with younger children. They are also usually fine with other pets in the household, including dogs."

Look for a cat with a slim, athletic body type.,
Check for unique head and facial features.,
Examine the distinctive qualities of its coat.,
Look at the coat colour.",How to Identify an Abyssinian Cat1," Abyssinians are slender and medium-sized. Their legs and tails are long, and they have a lean, muscular look, with a slight arch to the back. Their feet are oval shaped, and they seem almost to be standing on their toes at all times.Males usually weigh 8-10 lbs. (4-5 kg), while females usually are 6-7 lbs. (3 kg).;
, The head of an Aby is shaped like a wedge with a slight break at the muzzle, but their ears are the most striking feature. They are noticeably large and triangular; they are also forward-arched and alert, as if the cat is eager to hear everything. Additionally, an Aby’s eyes are distinctly almond shaped and can be copper, hazel, green, or gold., Abyssinians are shorthaired cats. Adult Abys have soft, fine, dense fur, lying close to their body. Their fur is short and ticked — that is to say, each hair has a light base, with three of four bands of colour, growing lighter towards the tip.Kittens are born with dark coats, but these lighten as they grow older.
These cats can also have light, faded blackish stripes around the face.

, The most common Abyssinian coat colour is ruddy, a warm, deep reddish brown. The ticking is black. Another common coat colour is chocolate; this is light brown. Sorrel, also known as red or cinnamon, is a light coppery base with chocolate brown ticking.


The officially recognized breed colours include ruddy, chocolate, cinnamon, blue, lilac, and fawn. There is also a “silver” variation for each colour, with this lighter colour appearing closest to the skin."
"
Notice the Aby’s intelligence.,
Appreciate its playfulness.,
Take note of the cat’s sociability.,
Check out its perching preferences.",How to Identify an Abyssinian Cat2," This breed is known for its insatiable curiosity and quick mind. An Aby will likely explore every nook and cranny of your home, yet is lithe and graceful enough to avoid disturbing items (like breaking a glass or knocking over a vase) unintentionally.While Abys are certainly bright enough for training, many owners feel as though they are the ones being trained by this smart and crafty, yet lovable, cat.

, Despite their regal carriage and presumed sacred heritage, Abyssinians are actually very playful and extroverted. They love to play games and interact with their human companions, and can provide entertainment as the “star of the show” for long stretches of time.They are very affectionate cats, but are too inquisitive and athletic to be a traditional lap-cat. Lying quietly and purring for hours on end just isn’t their thing.

, Abys love their human companions, and it’s nearly impossible not to love them right back. They love attention, but aren’t bossy; they love to explore, but usually don’t cause many headaches; and they normally get along well with other people and pets.They don’t like being left alone for long stretches. On the other side of the coin, however, they also don’t prefer being one cat in a large group — they simply don’t want to share the spotlight to that extent. One or two other companions of either sex is usually fine.

, Abys like high perches with a commanding view of the surrounding space and anything going on there. Thus, expect to find them atop bookshelves, mantles, etc. Providing safe, cat-specific perches for them is a good idea.Abyssinians also love a good window vista. They want to see what is going on outside of their own little world as well.

Examine its breeding papers.,
Use DNA testing.,
Consider potential health problems.",How to Identify an Abyssinian Cat3," Abyssinians have been extensively bred in Europe since the nineteenth century and in the United States since the 1930s, and ample documentation on the Aby’s breeding heritage should be made available by any responsible breeder. If your heart is set on acquiring a show-quality, purebred Aby, do your homework, visit potential breeders, and study the documentation provided.A good breeder typically makes Abys available at around twelve to sixteen weeks of age, as separating the kitten from its mother earlier may lead to health risks and behavioral issues.

, If you have no documentation of a cat’s breeding heritage, but suspect that it’s an Aby based upon appearance and personality, genetic testing can provide further evidence. A fifteen-second cheek swab can provide you with a wealth of information regarding the genetic heritage of your cat.As with DNA testing for humans and dogs, there are a growing number of options when it comes to finding a laboratory that does genetic testing for cats. Typical tests require you to take a mouth swab from your cat using a provided kit that you mail back to the lab.

, While Abys are generally healthy cats, they do have a somewhat greater risk for certain illnesses and conditions. If your cat has one or more of the following conditions, it may be more likely (but certainly not guaranteed) that it’s an Abyssinian:Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) — an inherited anemia that can be identified through genetic testing
Hyperthyroidism
Retinal atrophy (i.e., eye problems)
Kidney failure

Don't expect a lap cat.",How to Identify a Somali Cat," The general color of the Somali's coat comes in four different colors: red, ruddy, fawn, and blue, which is generally perceived as grey. However, each hair on the Somali has several bands of color on it, leading to a generally speckled appearance. These bands of color on a animal's coat is called ""ticking.""The ticking on the Somali's coat is the same as on an Abyssinian, but the Somali's fur is just longer.;
, The Somali's coat is generally long but its tail is especially bushy with thick fur. The Somali's tail is especially prominent when looking at the cat and its bushiness gives the cat a very regal appearance.The cat's tail should be widest where it meets the cat's body and it should taper towards the tip of the tail.
The Somali's chest fur may also be slightly bushy in comparison to the rest of the cat's coat. However, it is not as busy as the cat's tail.

, The Somali is a medium-sized cat that is usually around six to ten pounds in weight. It has a long torso for its size and a body that is relatively muscular and toned.However, despite its muscular build, the cat appears, thin, graceful, and light.

, Look at your cat's legs and make sure that they are generally proportionate to its body size. The Somali has very proportionate legs, meaning that they do not appear overly long or short.The Somali's feet are oval and compact. They should have five toes in front and four toes in back.

, The Somali's ears are large for the size of the cat's head. They are upright and softly pointed, which makes them a very noticeable feature. When looking at the cat directly from the front, the ears make the cat have a general appearance of alertness.The ears are very cupped at the base and they are set pretty far back on the skull, away from the eyes.

, Somali cats can use their paws with great skill, manipulating items more easily than other breeds of cat. They are known to open all kinds of doors, even those with turning handles. If you often come home to find an open fridge or cupboard door, you may have a Somali cat. Watch how your cat investigates its world. If it reaches out its paws to investigate and feel everything in its path, then that is a good sign that you have a Somali.

, The Somali is a pleasant cat that is not phased by much. It will gladly make friends with other cats or dogs that are not aggressive towards it. Even if another pet is aggressive towards a Somali, this breed of cat won't run and hide, choosing instead to stand its ground.


However, the Somali does like the uninterrupted attention of its humans, so having this cat in a household with a lot of pets may be challenging., The Somali is not a cat breed that loves to curl up on a lap and sleep the day away. They are so intelligent and inquisitive that they hardly have time for that kind of thing. Instead of curling up and snoozing, look for a Somali to be investigating every nook and cranny of its home, climbing to the highest heights it can find, and looking out a window to inspect the neighborhood.With this personality in mind, be sure to give a Somali lots of interactive cat toys and give them things to climb, whether it be a cat tower or shelves along a wall that allow them to climb to great heights.

Feel for a muscular build.",How to Identify a Siberian Cat1," Siberian cats are distinguished by their thick, triple-layer coats. Look for long guard hairs (the outermost coat), followed by the awn hairs (or middle coat) and then a soft supple undercoat. In their native Russia, these many layers help protect Siberian cats from the intense cold. The coats of Siberian cats can come in all colors.Typically a Siberian cat’s coat gets thicker and fuller in winter.
Siberian cats often have thickly furred tails.;
, Siberians are notable for their large size and ample bodies. Most Siberian cats weigh between 8-17lbs or 3.5-8kg. If you want to weigh your cat at home, a good method is to weigh just yourself, then weigh yourself holding your cat. The difference will be the cat’s weight., Most often, Siberian cats have almost perfectly round green or gold eyes. Though blue eyes are possible, they are much less common.

, Siberian cats’ ears have a rounded shape with coloring that darkens at the tips. Often, long hairs will stick out of the ears as well. The overall head shape is a wedge, usually widest between the ears and tapering to a small muzzle.Use petting as an opportunity to really look at your cat’s face. Pet them gently, examining ear shape.

, Siberian cats are known for being quite muscular under their thick coats. Run your hands over your cat to feel for muscle definition and size. Their paws are generally large to help them better catch prey as well.


Some cats don’t like to have their paws handled. If you don’t know a particular cat well, examine their paws with your eyes rather than hands.

Run some water.,
Play with your cat.,
Drop a utensil.,
Place your cat in your lap.",How to Identify a Siberian Cat2," Siberian cats are unusual from many other breeds in their affinity for water. Discern your cat’s interest in water by running a bath or the faucet at the sink. Do they come over to bat at the water or drink a bit?Siberian cats’ coats are also waterproof. If your cat doesn’t seem bothered by the water, try putting a couple drops of water on their coat to see if the water beads up or soaks in.

, Siberians are active, playful cats who enjoy engaging with their caretakers. Try playing with a feather or piece of string to see if your cat likes play. Siberians are known to be vocal as well, so watch for vocalization—chirps, trills, meows—while engaging in play with your cat.Some Siberians have even been known to play fetch like dogs. If your cat fits the other criteria and likes to do this, it may very well be a Siberian.

, Siberian cats are unusual from other breeds in that they are typically not bothered by noise. Some people even describe them as “fearless.” To put your cat’s temperament to the test, drop something loud, like a spoon, near them to see if they startle. If your cool cat is unphased, you may have a Siberian on your hands.Don’t drop anything on your cat or drop any dangerous object such as a pair of scissors. Blunt kitchen utensils such as spoons, whisks or spatulas are good.

, Siberian cats are social, affectionate cats who often enjoy sitting in their owner’s laps. They’ve also been known to follow their owners from room to room to keep them company. Observe your cat’s behavior to see if they enjoy affection or prefer to be on their own."

Secure with a quick-release knot.",How to Tie a Rope Halter," There are many different types of rope available, and which type you use will depend on your preferences as well as your budget. Some experts recommend using an all-cotton rope for tying halters, as this material will be easier on your hands and on your horse's skin.Rope is available at most hardware stores, as well as many horse equipment retailers.
Ropes made of synthetic materials tend to ""burn"" skin when dragged across the skin or through a clenched hand.
For tying a horse halter, choose a rope that is between 1/2 inch to 9/16 inch in diameter.;
, If you are new to tying rope halters, you will want to give yourself more length to work with. Some experts recommend starting with a rope that's between 22 and 25 feet in length.As you gain experience and get more proficient with tying halters, however, you may be able to decrease your length of rope as short as 13 to 16 feet in length.Place the rope on a firm wooden block to cut or chop it to length.
Use a sharp knife or axe to cut the rope to whatever length you desire. A dull blade could cause frayed ends, which can weaken the strength of your rope.

, Even if you used a sharp blade to cut the rope, there's still a chance the ends could fray and come undone, which would weaken your rope and compromise the halter you're creating. That's why it's imperative that you secure the ends. You can do this by a number of methods:

melt the ends of the rope over an open flameuse a soldering iron to fuse the ends of the ropeuse a combination of soldering the ends and wrapping them in parachute cord
wrap the rope with friction tape, applying two to three turns around the rope approximately 1/2 inch from the ends, To begin with, lay your rope flat on the ground or on a table. Fold the rope in half so you can easily gauge the middle of the rope. Tie a simple, overhand-style knot at the center, and make sure it is snug. Then move your hands 11 inches to the left of the knot and tie a second overhand knot. When you've got two knots, adjust your hold on the rope so that the entire rope is folded in two at the direct center of the two knots you've just tied.These knots will later become the noseband knots that hold the halter around your horse's face.

, Keeping the rope folded together, move your hands down the rope. Grab a paired section so that you have both strands of the rope and cross them over the rest of the rope approximately seven inches from the center (between the two overhand knots). If looking at the rope flat on a table, the rope should come straight down from the center of the two knots, curve around over on itself (with the paired section off to the left of the rope, laid across the main strand), and taper back off to the right, forming what looks vaguely like a plus sign., With the paired strand forming a small loop still off to the left over the main strand, pull that loop down, under/behind the main strand, and up through the second loop that was formed at the bottom (the lower ""leg"" of the plus sign). The knot will be similar to a tied shoelace. Pull that knot tight, and you have a simple alternative to the fiador knot.Double check that the overhand knots from step one are still seven inches from the alternative fiador knot you've tied.
Adjust the loops until they each measure approximately 2.5 inches in length.
Once everything is spaced and arranged as it needs to be, tighten the knots as needed.

, Keeping the rope flat on the table, extend the two un-knotted ends of the rope off to the right of the alternative fiador knot. Take the ""bottom"" strand (farthest from you) and tie a simple overhand knot on this strand, approximately six to seven inches away from the loops. Then feed the other strand through the knot, but do not tighten it yet., With the loose strand through the un-tightened knot, pull the rope up, over, and back underneath the rope between your overhand knot and the alternative fiador knot. Pull the rope out to its end and then feed it back through the center of the knot. Pull both strands to tighten the knot. You should now have a double-stranded ""arm: of rope between the alternative fiador knot and the overhand knot you've just tied.Make sure the distance between the alternative fiador knot and the overhand knot is still between six and seven inches. Adjust as necessary before tightening the overhand knot into place.

, Take the strand of rope closest to you (on top, if looking down at the rope on a table) and form a simple overhand knot approximately 9 to 10 inches from the previous overhand knot. Before you tighten that knot, take the end of that rope and tie a loop knot.Feed the end of the strand you're working with through the overhand knot you've just formed. Pull it through the knot until you're left with a small loop approximately two inches in length.
Using the same strand of rope, feed the strand up and over the overhand knot you've formed, then bring it back down under the knot. Feed the strand through the center of the loop and back through the knot.
Pull on the loop and the end of the strand simultaneously to tighten the knot.
Double check the length of the rope between the two knots. It should measure approximately 9 to 10 inches in length.

, The cheek piece should measure approximately 11 inches in length between the loop knot you've just formed to the noseband knot you formed at the original center of the rope. Start by loosening the central knot (noseband knot) closest to you and feeding the strand you've been working with through the middle of that knot. This strand will be the left cheek piece.Before you tighten the knot, cross the strand over and then under/behind the cheek piece. This should form a loose overhand knot. Then feed the strand back through the middle and tighten the knot.
There should now essentially be a second knot directly against the noseband knot you're working with (also called a double-overhand knot).

, Begin by loosening the other noseband knot. Take the strand of rope you're working with and feed it through the center of the noseband knot, forming another double-overhand knot. Pull the strand of rope through the center and over the top of the two arches (between the two noseband knots). Feed the strand under and through the access. Then feed the strand through the loop you've just formed and continue through the center of the first simple overhand knot.Adjust the knots as needed to balance the alternate fiador knot and the noseband piece.
When everything is in place, tighten the knots.

, This cheek piece should be approximately 11 inches in length, just like the left cheek piece. Start by forming a simple overhand knot with the strand you're working with. Take the other strand and feed it up through the center of the overhand knot. Then go up, over, and then underneath the loop you've just formed. Then put the end of that strand through the center of the overhand knot. Pull the strands on both ends of the knot to tighten it., Measure both strands of the halter to 27 inches. Cut off any excess rope in the same manner that you cut the rope at the beginning (a sharp blade on a wooden block), and secure the ends in the same way you did after cutting the rope to size. You now have a completed rope halter., Size up the size of your horse or cow's head, and adjust the head stall as needed. Be sure to allow some slack in the chin strap. Hold the halter lead and the loop splice in your left hand and the head stall in your right hand., Choose an appropriate place to halter your animal. It's best if you do this away from other animals and away from any food sources so the animal does not become excited or distracted.Approach from the animal's left side and slide the nose piece over the animal's nose. Keep the chin strap underneath the animal's chin, and put the head stall over the top of the animal's head, behind the ears.Use caution when approaching any animal, especially if it's an animal you're not familiar with (and who isn't familiar with you).

, If you need to tie your animal to a post, use a quick-release knot. It's similar to a slip knot, but can be untied more quickly and easily in case of an emergency.Take the end of the lead in your hand and form a loop. Make a second, smaller loop to the left of where the first loop is formed, and lay it off to the right.
Form a third loop and feed it through the second, smaller loop. Tighten the loop to form a knot.

Identify a modern Siamese.,
Identify an applehead Siamese.,
Look at the cat’s head.",How to Identify a Siamese Cat1," Modern—or show—Siamese are easy to identify. Their bodies have been bred for extreme qualities: modern Siamese are slim, angular, and have a deliberately skeletal appearance. The modern Siamese cat also has an elongated, thin neck and tail. The cats look elegant, and commonly appear in cat shows and competitions.Due to the rigorous breeding practices that went into breeding the modern Siamese, the breed is predisposed towards certain genetic illnesses. However, modern breeding practices have improved, and modern Siamese cats can live long and healthy lives.
Like any purebred animals, Siamese can be susceptible to genetic health problems. These include congenital heart defects (including aortic stenosis) and amyloidosis: a disease which causes excess proteins to build up in the liver.;
, Applehead Siamese, also known as traditional, are much less angular and thin than their modern counterparts. Applehead Siamese have thicker, stockier bodies, and their tails and necks are both thicker and shorter than those of the modern Siamese.Although modern and applehead are the two common types of Siamese cat, there are some that do not fall completely into either of these categories, but display a body type that borrows characteristics from both show and traditional Siamese.

, As indicated by the name, the head of a traditional Siamese cat is rounded and almost apple-shaped. This is in stark contrast to the triangular, smaller head of the modern Siamese. The traditional Siamese will have a larger, heavier head that sits close to its body.Modern Siamese were bred for decades to have smaller and smaller heads, with increasingly angular features.
Modern Siamese with wedge- or triangle-shaped heads are genetically susceptible to respiratory concerns, such as asthma and bronchial disease, and dental problems."

Look at the cat’s coat.,
Inspect the eyes of the cat.,
Look at the cat’s ears.",How to Identify a Siamese Cat2," Siamese have distinctive fur colors and patterning, although there is no single coat pattern or color shared by all Siamese. Typically, Siamese have creamy white coats with dark patches or “points” on the muzzle and face, ears, tail, and feet. However, several variations on this pattern exist.These coat patterns are shared between both modern and applehead Siamese; the body shape and coat coloring are independent of each other.“Seal point” cats have dark brown points.
“Chocolate point” cats have lighter brown points, closer to the color of milk chocolate.
“Blue point” cats have gray/blue points.
“Lilac point” Siamese have the palest points. Their points are light gray, sometimes almost pink-tinted.

, Siamese cats are known for having bright blue eyes. The lids can be narrow, giving the cats’ eyes an almond shape.Their arresting blue eyes are a consistent characteristic between both show and traditional Siamese.


Kittens of nearly all cat breeds are born with blue eyes, which later mature into darker colors. The eyes of the Siamese stay blue their entire life, so they can’t be easily identified by eye color as kittens.

, Both types of Siamese cat have distinctive, recognizable ears. The modern Siamese especially has a specific ear style: its ears are large, and shaped like triangles or wedges. In some purebred modern Siamese, the ears may be nearly as large as the head itself. The ears of an applehead Siamese are more proportional to its body, and less angular and pointed.The ears of an applehead Siamese will also be closer together on the top of its head. Due to their shape and size, the ears of a modern Siamese can be far apart on the cat’s head.

Spend time around the cat.,
Play with the cat or give it toys.,
Listen to the cat’s vocal sounds.",How to Identify a Siamese Cat3," As you watch and observe a Siamese, you’ll notice that it’s energetic and intelligent. Siamese cats have a close bond with their owners, and are demonstrative and affectionate. When they’re not playing or exploring, Siamese like to sit in people’s laps, and often sleep near their owners at night.If you’re in the same house with a Siamese for any length of time, you’ll notice that it will begin to follow you around. Siamese are curious animals, and want to keep tabs on where you’re going.

, Siamese can be demanding and need frequent attention, and a great way to provide this attention is through play. Throw a ball or fake mouse toy for a Siamese and it’ll likely retrieve it. Siamese also enjoy puzzle toys that require thought to move parts and release a treat.Siamese also enjoy physical activity. They enjoy a game of fetch, and will also chase a piece of ribbon or laser pointer.

, Siamese cats are a very vocal breed, and you’ll soon become aware of this if you spend time around one. Siamese will verbally interact and “talk” with their owners through loud meows, and will have a deep, loud purr when they’re pleased. The voice of a Siamese cat can sound raspy or hoarse, and is a good indicator of the cat’s breed.Siamese owners will describe their cats as “chatty” and may even grow tired of the cats’ talkative behavior.

Weigh your cat.",How to Identify a Singapura Cat1," Singapura cats are known for their smooth, short coats and sepia coloring. If your cat looks as though they could blend right in to an old-timey photo, they could be a Singapura. Look for a tan to light brown color that’s “ticked” or flecked with small bits of white., Singapura cats have big, expressive eyes that are large relative to their body size. Typical eye colors for Singapuras include yellow, green, hazel and brown., Singapuras have exceptionally large ears for their head size.

Create a lightweight ball out of crumpled paper or tinfoil and try to engage your cat in play to gauge their interest., Singapuras love to sit in laps and crave human company. Place your cat in your lap to assess their interest in being with you.Singapuras get lonely easily and are often unhappy staying home by themselves for long stretches of time. If your cat displays destructive behavior when you are gone and meets the other criteria, it’s possible you have a Singapura.

, Singapura cats are known to be very curious, often to the point of getting into mischief. To test your cat’s curiosity, show them a toy then hide it behind a piece of paper. If your cat seeks out the toy even when it’s hidden, they are naturally inquisitive., Singapuras are not usually big talkers, and when they do “speak” their voices are tiny. Try to engage your cat in a conversation by chatting with them about toys or food. If you’re not getting much response, it could be that your cat is vocally shy, like a typical Singapura."

Undo the clasps from back to front, except for the front buckles.,
Fold the back third of the blanket up onto the middle third of the blanket.,
Undo the front buckles.,
Undo all the buckles before removing the blanket.,
Fold the blanket.",How to Take off A Horse Blanket," There are various kinds of horse blankets, each with its own purpose. Blankets should be breathable and waterproof as a rule, but otherwise they can be lighter or heavier and made of different materials like fleece, wool, mesh, and others. Make sure that you know what kind of blanket to use in the circumstances.Turnout blankets keep the horse warm and dry while outside, in cold weather and rain. They come in different weights and need to be waterproof. You can also use a rain sheet to keep your horse dry – these will be lighter than turnout blankets and can be lined or unlined.
Coolers help cool and dry off horses after they’ve been worked out, by wicking off sweat. They can also keep the horse warm in its stall or while out walking.
Flysheets are for keeping flies and other biting insects off the animal, not for keeping it warm. They’re light and made from mesh.
There are also summer sheets, quarter sheets, and stable blankets. Summer sheets can give very light warmth when needed; stable blankets can keep a horse warm when stabled or turned out in dry weather.;
, Be sure that you’ve checked the fit of your blanket. Blankets come in many different sizes. One that’s too small will rub and cause hair loss and sores, while a blanket that’s too big can move around and possibly get twisted, come off, or cause injury.You may need to have your horse measured to be sure about the right size. Staff at tack stores can also help you. The horse should be able to move comfortably and naturally when wearing the blanket.
The blanket should be removed daily to check for any blanket rubs, sores, and to assess body condition score. This is especially important in the winter when horses are blanketed a lot and can lose weight quickly.

, The insulating value of a horse’s coat is lost when the animal gets wet or covered in mud. This can cause the horse to get too cold. Consider using a blanket if there is a risk of this while your horse is turned out.Weather like rain, freezing rain, and ice may all call for blanketing. Snow is less of a problem for wetness. Depending on factors like air temperature and wind chill, you can use either a turnout blanket or rain sheet to protect the animal in this kind of bad weather.
A cooler will dry your horse after a workout. It absorbs sweat and moisture so that the animal doesn’t get cold from the evaporation of sweat., Cold is cold, even for horses with thicker coats. Cover your horse with a blanket if there’s no shelter available during turnout periods and the air temperature dips below 5 degrees Fahrenheit.A heavier turnout blanket is presumably good for cold winter weather.
Use a blanket if the wind chill drops below -5 degrees Fahrenheit, too.

, Some horses are more at risk in cold and damp conditions than others. These vulnerable animals need extra consideration and may require a blanket even when other, healthier horses don’t.Very young horses and very old horses will need extra protection and should be blanketed in cold and inclement weather.
Do the same for horses that are in poor health or have a Henneke body score of 3 or below.

, Some horses have thicker coats and may be more used to cold – that is, they’re acclimated to colder weather. Horses that aren’t used to the cold may need blankets more often, though.You may need to blanket horses that aren’t acclimated to cold. For example, horses that have recently been relocated from a warmer, southern climate.
The same goes for horses that have had their winter coats clipped for showing. They won’t be able to retain heat as well.

, If you’re going to ride the horse, you will need to groom him and tack him up. You won’t ride him with the blanket. If it’s cold, though, you can put a cooler on him while you’re brushing him.


In some cases, you can use a quarter sheet if you’re planning to ride. Quarter sheets only cover the horse’s back quarter. You can use them to cover its loins while warming up or cooling down, or to protect the horse from the rain while you’re riding., If your horse is sweating beneath the blanket, you’ve chosen the wrong blanket and he is uncomfortable. Though a blanket might be appropriate for some nights when it’s cold, look out for changes in temperature from night to day., You can remove a horse blanket when ambient air temperatures get warmer, usually when they go above 50 degrees. You don’t want the horse to start sweating under the blanket and become wet.

, Put the horse on cross ties or attach it to a hitching post. Pat the animal to relax it before you take the blanket off. Move slowly and talk quietly to let the horse know where you are and what you're doing. Be relaxed, and don’t make any sudden movements.

, Most blankets have three sets of clasps: one pair of straps underneath the tail (often between the hind legs), one or two belly straps, and one or two buckles in front, on the horse’s chest. Going from back to front is important because, if the horse gets spooked and runs away, the front buckles will keep the blanket attached, rather than having the blanket come off and get tangled around its legs.Do not go right behind a horse unless you know the animal well, just in case it kicks. Always go around the front of the horse.

, This keeps the horse comfortable and makes it easier to take the blanket off. Do this step slowly and carefully, making sure that all of the straps are undone and untangled from the horse’s legs and tail., Fold the front third of the blanket onto the middle third, so that the entire blanket is folded onto the horse’s middle. Take the blanket off of the horse slowly and gently, going with the direction of the coat. Try to lift the blanket off instead of sliding it, so that you can prevent the transmission of static electricity.If necessary, pull the blanket over the horse’s head. Some blankets must go over the horse’s head, rather than being taken off completely from the side. If this is the case with your horse’s blanket, untie him from the cross ties or hitching post but attach the halter to a lead rope. Hold the lead rope in one hand and slowly bring the blanket over the horse’s head. Slide it onto your arm and then tie your horse up again., Be sure that you’ve undone all the buckles and clasps before you try to remove the horse’s blanket. Otherwise, you could spook the animal and cause an injury, depending on its temperament., If the blanket is wet, hang it up with the wet part facing out and in the sun, if possible. If the blanket is clean and dry, fold it. Grab the top of the blanket on both the mane and tail ends, so that the blanket is already folded once. Put the mane and tail ends of the blanket together to fold it again. Fold it in half one more time and put it away.

Look at the cat’s fur.,
Check the length of the cat’s coat.,
Look at the cat’s whiskers.",How to Identify a Selkirk Rex1," Easily the most identifiable characteristic of the Selkirk rex is their thick, curly coat of hair. The Selkirk’s curly coat will have a soft, plush appearance, and will be soft to the touch as well. The curled hair will be most pronounced around the cat’s tail and neck, where hair may bunch together.The color and pattern of Selkirk rex coats can vary from one cat to the next. There is no way to identify a Selkirk rex based on the color or pattern of its fur.;
, Selkirk rex cats can have either a short or a long coat. With either length, though, the coat will be thick and curly, although the types of coat curl differently. The shorter coat will curl evenly over the entire body, and will have the typical plush appearance. The coat of long-haired Selkirk rexes will hang down from the cat’s body, and will grow in individual ringlets.The coat will change somewhat as a kitten Selkirk rex develops. While the kitten is born with a curly coat, the hair straightens quickly and does not regain its curl until the cat is 8–10 months old.This can make identifying a young Selkirk rex difficult.

, Much like its coat, the whiskers of a Selkirk rex are curly. This is the case for both kittens and adult Selkirk rex cats. Unlike other cat characteristics (eye color, for example), the whiskers of a Selkirk rex will curl through its entire life.The curled whiskers of a Selkirk rex can be brittle compared to the whiskers of other cat breeds, and can even snap off. When petting a Selkirk, do not play with or pull on its whiskers.

Inspect the head.,
Look at the cat’s ears and eyes.,
Look at the cat’s body.",How to Identify a Selkirk Rex2," If you’re attempting to determine if a cat is a Selkirk rex, look closely at the animal’s head. Selkirks have large heads compared to most other cat breeds; their head will be round and broad in shape, with noticeably prominent cheeks.If you’re close enough to the cat to stroke it, run your hand lightly over its head. Due to the hair on cats’ heads, it can be difficult to tell the size of the head itself. Don’t squeeze the cat’s skull, but use your hand to gauge the approximate size of its head.

, The ears of a Selkirk rex are one of its most prominent features. The cat’s ears will be wide-set at the base, and set relatively far apart from one another on the animal’s head. The cat’s eyes are rounded, large, and expressive.A Selkirk rex will often have an expression that looks curious, alert, or inquisitive.

, Along with their large, broad-featured heads and faces, Selkirk rex cats will also have a medium- to large-sized body. They torso of a Selkirk rex will be well-defined and muscular, and their tail will also be thick and heavy.The breed is medium- to large-sized in general. Selkirk rexes commonly weigh between 10 and 15 pounds.Selkirk rexes should have medium-length tails. Their backs are straight (parallel to the floor when standing), with a slight incline towards their hips and tail.

Ask the cat’s breeder or owner about its temperament.,
Play with the cat.,
Listen to the cat’s meows.",How to Identify a Selkirk Rex3," Selkirk rexes are known to have strong personalities, and are curious about their surroundings. The breed tends to be curious and very sociable. Since these qualities are easy to perceive when interacting with the cat, ask the breeder or owner if they’ve noticed these types of temperament traits.If the cat in question is living at a pet shelter, talk to the shelter owners or staff. They should be able to give you some indication as to the cat’s personality.

, In order to ascertain the cat’s personality for yourself, you should spend time playing with the cat, or at least pet the animal and observe its behavior. Selkirk rexes are playful as kittens, and retain that quality into adulthood. They enjoy active games and may even play fetch, so throw a cat toy for the Selkirk or let it chase a feather toy.As with any other breed of cat, a Selkirk rex will need time to feel comfortable around a new person. Sit quietly in a room with the cat; allow it to approach you, and let it smell you before you reach out to touch the cat.

, Selkirk rexes are a vocal breed. If you speak to the cat or play with it for long enough, it may respond with soft meows and playful sounds. You may need to listen closely, especially if you’re in a loud area, as Selkirk rexes do not project their vocal sounds very loudly.Since the Selkirk rex is a friendly, social breed of cat, it may become unhappy if it’s not receiving enough attention. If this is the case, the cat will likely protest by meowing or whining in a quiet tone.

Dunk in hot water, then wipe dry.,
Buy a bit warmer.,
Keep an electric crock pot in the barn.,
Heat with a hairdryer or portable heater.,
Keep the bit under blankets overnight.,
Keep the bit indoors.",How to Warm a Horse's Bit1," Heat water until it's just begun to steam, then bring it over to the stall in a bucket. Place a safety hook over the bucket and drape the bridle over it, making sure not to let the leather touch the water or the ground. Dunk the bit for 10–15 seconds in hot water, or 1–2 minutes in lukewarm water. Wipe the bit down with a cloth to dry it. The bit should be warm, but not hot.


If you have running hot water in the barn, you can hold the bit under that instead.
In very cold weather, you may need a bucket insulator to keep it warm on the way to the stall.;
, These thick pads of fabric wrap around the bit and heat it. Some varieties must be plugged in, while others can be microwaved before you head out to the stall. Wrap the bit for about five to ten minutes, checking occasionally to make sure the metal isn’t painfully hot.


If you can remove the bit from the bridle, you can use a hand warmer instead. Drop the bit inside a long, woolen sock. Drop this sock into its fellow, along with the hand warmer.

, You can use an electric crock pot or a battery-operated slow cooker, depending on whether your barn has power. Fill it with water and turn it on. Drape a towel over the edge to wet one end. Once it's warm, wrap the towel around the bit for a couple minutes.


If you visit your horse at the same time each day, look for a crock pot with a timer. Set it to start heating water shortly before you arrive at the stall. Make sure it's automatic shut-off works, or you may cause a fire.
Reduce fire risk by keeping the crock pot on a non-flammable surface, away from animals and straw.

, Obviously, this one will only work if you have access to electricity in the stall. Be careful not to heat the leather or overheat the bit. If using a heater, hang the bit 4+ inches (10+ centimeters) away.


Do not use this method on “soft mouth” bits with plastic parts.

, Cover the bit with heavy blankets, then press them down with a heavy object. You may need to remove the bit from the bridle first, which is not feasible for all bridles. If you leave the bridle attached, the weight could deform the bridle's shape.

, Keep the bit by the door or with your car keys, to avoid forgetting it at home.


If you drive to your barn, keep the bit in your car. If necessary, leave it there next to a heating vent while you start preparing the tackle.

Show affection to your cat regularly.,
Provide attention and care for your cat.,
Play with your cat.",How to Turn Your Cat Into a Lap Cat," Before taking steps to bond with your cat, you should consider turning off any distractions that may scare or startle your cat. By turning off distractions, you’ll help create an environment in which you and your cat will be able to bond.


Place your phone on silent.
Turn off your TV or music.
Inform your family, friends, or roommates that you’d like your home to be a calmer environment for an hour or so.;
, After you’ve created a calming environment, you should sit down somewhere and let your cat come to you. This is important, since lap cats are defined by the fact that they want to be around their caretakers.


Pick a place that is comfortable for you and your cat. A comfy spot is important, since comfort often translates to your ability to relax.
Read a book or otherwise engage in a quiet activity.
Don’t chase your cat down. Chasing your cat down will only alienate them.
Allow your cat to leave, if they want to leave., A great way to enhance a bonding experience with your cat is to make it double rewarding for them. By providing a reward for sitting on your lap, you’ll build a positive association for your cat.


Give your cat a treat when they sit on your lap.
Consider stuffing your pockets with catnip or some other treat or scent that your cat likes.
Pat or rub your cat in a way that they like when they sit on your lap.
Repeat phrases like “good kitty” when your cat sits on your lap., One of the best ways to train your cat to be a lap cat is by providing a calm presence. By being calm, you’ll signal to your cat that you won’t harm or threaten them. Make sure to:


Relax and try to not be tense.

Don’t hold your glance on your cat for more than a few seconds.
Depending on your cat’s demeanor, it might help to avert your eyes if your cat is approaching you. Looking away will signal that you’re not a threat., The single best way to alienate your cat from you is to deal out harsh discipline.

Never hit your cat.
Don’t yell at or scold your cat.
Embrace behavior modification. Reward your cat with treats for good behavior. Hold back treats for bad behavior. For instance, give your cat a treat if they use the litter box instead of peeing on a chair. , If you show your cat affection on a daily basis, you’ll build a solid foundation for turning your cat into a lap cat.


Whenever your cat approaches you for petting or for love, offer it to them.

"
Eliminate other sources of water.,
Keep the fountain away from the food bowl.,
Place the pet fountain somewhere your pet feels safe.",How to Train Your Cat to Use a Pet Fountain1," If you offer your pet both a pet fountain and a regular water bowl, it will continue to use the same boring old water bowl that it always has. Instead of offering your pet options, dump the old water bowl, wash it well, and store it in a cupboard. Make the pet fountain your cat’s only option for drinking water., Cats don’t naturally locate their food near their drinking water. Plus, if any water splashes from the fountain onto the food, it could cause the food to turn to become damp and mushy. Alternatively, if food gets in the fountain by accident, the water could be contaminated. Place your fountain in a different room than the food bowl.For similar reasons, do not place your pet fountain too near the litterbox.

, Cats often spend more time in part of the house than in others. Monitor your pet’s behavior carefully to discover if it has a favorite room or space in the house. Place your pet fountain in this favorite space. Your cat might enjoy drinking from the pet fountain in:the library
the living room
the basement
Cat owners often place their pet fountains on tables or stands. Ensure your pet has enough room to move about without knocking the pet fountain over if you choose to place it on a table or stand.

Rub it between your hands.,
Stick the bit in your jacket pocket.,
Hang in the sun.",How to Warm a Horse's Bit2," Wear gloves to speed up the process and avoid hurting your hands. Test the temperature of the bit against your cheek, since your hands are a poor judge of temperature. This usually takes several minutes.

, If your bit is removable, this is a quick way to warm it up. Keep it there while you ready the rest of the tack.


If the bit won’t fit in your pocket, hold it under one arm while you groom the horse with your free hand.

, If you’re lucky enough to have sunshine, hang the bridle in full sun as soon as you get to the stall.

Let your pet get used to the fountain.,
Get a quieter fountain.,
Reward your cat.,
Don’t worry if you pet doesn’t drink much.,
Do not punish your cat for not drinking from the fountain.",How to Train Your Cat to Use a Pet Fountain2," Pet fountains make some pets nervous. Fill the fountain, but don’t turn it on. Your pet’s curiosity will quickly overtake it. Once it begins using the fountain regularly, turn it on once or twice each week. If it has multiple settings, turn it on the lowest setting. As your pet familiarizes itself with the fountain, leave the fountain on more and more often and set it to higher settings., Some pet fountains are especially noisy. Fountains made of plastic, especially, tend to be louder and amplify the sound of the fountain motor. Ceramic fountains, on the other hand, are much quieter.If you suspect your pet is scared of the sound of the fountain, try a different model with a lower volume.


Sometimes loud fountains are consequence of a low water level or a dirty impeller.Clean your fountain’s impeller and ensure the water reaches to at least its minimum level.

, When your cat drinks from the pet fountain, give it a small kitty treat. This will create a positive association in your cat’s mind with the act of drinking from the pet fountain, and encourage it to continue doing so.Give it a treat immediately after it finishes drinking from the pet fountain. Be consistent in rewarding your cat for using the fountain at first.
Gradually reduce the frequency of your rewards. Over time, offer your cat verbal praise or the chance to play a game after it drinks from the fountain instead of a treat. (Though it’s okay to still offer a treat now and then.)

, If your pet eats wet food, you may notice that it drinks less than your friends’ cats, or less than other pets in your house that eat dry food. But the added water content of wet food means your pet does not need to drink as much water. Cats who eat dry food, on the other hand, will need to drink more water to digest their food properly and stay hydrated., If your cat doesn’t drink from the fountain, or tries to drink from your dog’s water dish, don’t yell at your cat, strike it, or place it in its cage. These behaviors will only cause your cat to be fearful and will not encourage it to drink from the fountain."
"
Change the water regularly.,
Keep enough water in the fountain.,
Conduct regular maintenance.",How to Train Your Cat to Use a Pet Fountain3," Even in a pet fountain, where the water is constantly circulating, it is important to change the water often. How often you need to change the water depends on the particular model you purchased. Consult manufacturer directions for information about how and how often you should change the water. Empty the pet fountain and refill it with a supply of fresh, clean water when necessary., The pet fountain doesn’t need to be filled to the brim, but it should be at or just above the minimum fill line. Pet fountains that are not filled to the appropriate level will overheat and eventually stop working. Always refill the pet fountain with cold water., Pet fountains are complex pieces of machinery and need to be taken care of. This means you should clean your pet fountain’s filter (usually every 2-4 weeks) and impeller. Wipe around and under the fountain to prevent mold and moisture buildup.Every pet fountain is slightly different. Follow maintenance directions provided by your fountain’s manufacturer to determine how and how often to conduct maintenance on your fountain.

Be patient.,
Avoid punishment after the fact.,
Never cause your cat pain.,
Punish by taking things away.",How to Train Your Cat with Positive Reinforcement," When your cat does something you want it to do, especially in the early stages of training, be sure to reward the cat with treats. This will help your cat associate the behavior it just engaged in with receiving the treat.If your cat uses the scratch post instead of scratching the furniture, give the cat a treat as it is scratching the post.
If your cat stops biting you during play time, give it a treat to show that this is the kind of play you want to happen.
Try to give your cats treats that are relatively healthy so that you don’t encourage a weight problem in your cat.;
, If your cat is behaving well and you want to reward it, spend some time playing with the cat. Cats are naturally active animals with a great hunting instinct. For indoor cats especially, playing with them is a great way to keep them active and strengthen the bond between the two of you.Try running around the house with a string for your cat to chase. Or throw a ball or a toy mouse around for the cat to run after.
You can also give your cat a toy with catnip inside. This is a treat for the cat, and also a fun thing you can use to play with your cat.
Put your cat on your lap and pet it. Showing affection is also important in strengthening the bond between the two of you.

, Too many treats can lead to an unhealthy, overweight cat. So it’s important to transition away from treat-based rewards once your cat begins to learn the desired behavior. Switch from treats as every reward to rewarding only occasionally with treats. Instead, praise your cat when it behaves the way you want it to.Try praising your cat by saying things like, “Good kitty!” or by saying its name in a loving way.
You can also pet your cat and rub it affectionately as an alternative to providing treats.
Feel free to give your cat treats on occasion, just not every time once the behavior is learned.

, One of the most important things in training any animal, cats included, is repetition of the expected behavior. They need to see consistency over time and be rewarded regularly behaving in the way you want it to.Remember to be consistent. If you want your cat to learn a new thing, you need to always show the cat that this is how you expect it to behave. Don’t let it slide sometimes when you feel like it, as the cat won’t be able to distinguish the difference in your expectations.
If you want your cat to stop biting and scratching during playtime, you need to practice this over and over. Play with your cat often and encourage it to avoid biting or scratching each time. If the cat bites or scratches, stand up immediately and walk away. You can come back a few moments later and begin to play again. But if the cats starts biting or scratching again, walk away every time.

, When your cat performs the behavior you are trying to teach, be sure to reward it immediately. This is crucial if you want your cat to associate the positive reinforcement with the act it just committed. Waiting even a matter of moments will negate the training and confuse the cat.If you don’t see your cat do the thing you are trying to teach it, wait until the cat does it again before you reward it.
If you see your cat using the scratching post instead of tearing up your furniture, immediately offer it a treat. This is most effective if you give the cat a treat while it is still using the scratching post.

, Your cat can’t be expected to learn something new overnight. You need to give your cat some time so that it has a chance to learn the new behavior. Be patient with your cat and let it learn at its own pace, rather than trying to force it.Try not to get frustrated if it takes longer than expected. Keep working at it and your cat will get the hang of it over time.
Don’t pick up your cat and try to force it into new behaviors. Let the cat come to the desired behavior on its own and then reward the behavior. Trying to force your cat may scare it.
If you pick your cat up and try to make it use a scratching post or play with a certain toy, the cat may feel trapped or uneasy. Let the cat find the thing on its own.

, It is unlikely that your cat will know what it is being punished for if you give it a punishment for something you discover hours (or even minutes) later. This is confusing for cats and will not improve their training.For example, if you come home and find cat poop outside of the litter box, don’t punish your cat for that. Only punish if you catch your cat in the act of doing whatever it is you don’t want it to do.

, It can be an instinctual reaction to swat at your cat if you catch it doing something it shouldn’t do. However, physically harming your cat, even in a minor way, can make your cat feel scared and unsafe. Your cat may lash out by biting, clawing, or defending itself in some other way.Causing your cat pain can also make your cat afraid of you. This isn’t the kind of relationship you want with your pet.

, If you must punish your cat, you should do so by taking away things that it wants. This can include things like treats, your attention, or even a favorite toy. Be sure to make it clear that you are withholding the item because of the cat’s behavior and not just randomly.For example, if your cat is biting or scratching your hand when you try to play with it, simply stop playing and walk away from the cat. The cat will eventually learn that engaging in this behavior will mean an end to playtime.

Do not use a squirt bottle.,
Avoid ""scruffing."",
Do not punish your cat.",How to Train Your Cat to Listen," Treats can be a great way to reward your cat for positive behavior. However, the kind of treats matter. Your cat is unlikely to behave for everyday food. Find a treat it loves and use that as a reward.Buy a variety of treats at a local pet store and see what your cat likes. Try to use the treats it responds well to in training.
You may also be able to feed your cat some table scraps. Some cats love things like turkey and chicken. If your cat has a particular fondness for a certain table food, that may work as a reward.;
, Not every cat responds well to food. Your cat may prefer another type of reward. Maybe your cat loves a particular toy. You could reward it by letting it play with that toy after it behaves. If your cat is particularly friendly, try petting as a reward., You can buy a small clicker at a pet store. You can use this as a way to let a cat know it is behaving well. Teach your cat to associate the clicker with positive experiences.Choose a small, quiet place to work that is free of distractions. This will keep your cat focused.
At first, all you need to do is establish a click means a reward is coming. Sit with your cat and press down on the clicker. Then, immediately give your cat a reward. You can give it a treat, a toy, or attention.
Do this each day until you cat begins to perk up at the sound of the clicker. Cats are easily distracted, so keep training sessions short. Sessions should be no longer than 5 minutes.

, This will reinforce that listening is good. Your cat understands the clicker means a reward, so keep the clicker on you around the house. When your cat listens, press the clicker.For example, you see your cat eating one of the plants in your house. You say something like, ""Get down.""
If your cat gets down in response, press the clicker. If it does not get down in response, do not press the clicker.

, Animals live in the immediate. Your cat will not understand what it is being rewarded for if rewards are delayed. The second your cat listens, give it a reward.For example, your cat is pawing at another cat in your home. You tell it, ""No"" and it immediately leaves the cat alone.
Do not wait a few minutes to reward it. Immediately click and offer a reward.
If you're using treats as a reward, you may want to carry a few treats with you around the house. That way, if your cat listens, you can offer it a reward right away.

, This will help solidify behaviors. It will encourage your cat to listen to your more in day-to-day life. You can try teaching your cat small commands that encourage listening, like coming in response to his name.Choose an area free of distractions and keep sessions short. In general, less than 5 minute sessions are key.
Instruct your cat to engage in a certain behavior. Reward it when it does that behavior. For example, call your cat's name. If it comes to you, give it a reward.
You usually have to work increments. This means, settling for your cat partially completing the behavior first. For example, you tell your cat to come and it takes a few steps forward. Give it a reward. With time, demand more from it. Do not reward it until it completes more of the behavior.

, Cats should not be yelled at for bad behaviors, but there should be some consequences. If you want your cat to listen, make sure it understands what ""No"" means.You do not need more than a loud, ""No"" when your cat misbehaves. Avoid screaming, as this can upset your cat. Simply say, ""No"" when it engages in a negative behavior.
If your cat stops the behavior when you ask, reward it with treats, a toy, or praise.
If your cat does not listen when you say ""No,"" try adding a small clap as well.

, You want your cat to eventually behave without a reward. You do not want to teach your cat it should only behave well when there's something in it for it. As your cat listens to you more and more, taper off rewards.Make use of the clicker. Your cat will eventually learn to see this as a reward in and of itself, as it indicates it is behaving properly.
Once your cat seems to have mastered listening to you, only reward it every other time it behaves. With time, wean it off rewards altogether.

, Many advocate keeping a squirt bottle filled with tap water on hand. If a cat misbehaves, they will give it a quick squirt as punishment. This will not teach your cat proper behavior. In fact, it can actually make negative behaviors worse.Squirting a cat with a water bottle just creates stress. Oftentimes, a cat is engaging in a negative behavior because something is wrong.
Your cat may, say, scratching furniture because it dislikes his scratching post. Punishing it for scratching furniture will not stop your cat from doing it. It will only learn to scratch when you're not around.
A squirt bottle will make troublesome behaviors worse. If your cat feels stressed in his home, it may become more aggressive and act out more frequently.

, This means grabbing the loose skin of a cat's neck to stop negative behaviors. Many people believe scruffing will assert dominance over a cat. However, scruffing frightens and humiliates adult cats. It will not improve a cat's behavior.The only situation in which scruffing is appropriate is a medical emergency. For example, if your cat is hurt you will need to get it to the vet. If your cat is upset and resisting going into his crate, scruffing may be the only way to stop its squirming.
If you do scruff your cat do to an emergency, release your grip as soon as the danger has passed.

, Cats do not understand punishment, and it only serves to create stress. Never use more than a simple ""No"" and a hand clap to deter poor behaviors. Do not yell at your cat or put your cat in a cage as punishment."

Keep your training sessions short.",How to Train Your Cat to Fetch a Toy Mouse," In general, cats like to fetch things that they can easily grab with their paws or put in their mouths.If you do not already have a toy mouse at home, you can purchase one at your local pet store. Consider the size of your cat as you are deciding which toy mouse to purchase—a kitten would need a smaller toy mouse than an adult cat.


If possible, pick a toy mouse that does not have plastic eyes. During her playtime, your cat could remove the eyes and swallow them, which could lead to intestinal blockage that would require veterinary care.;
, Training your cat will be more effective when she is alert and energetic.Cats are most active at dusk and dawn.Training your cat in the morning may not be conducive to your work schedule, so an evening training time may be ideal.


Consider training her during one of her regular play times. She will already be anticipating an interaction with you, so she will likely be attentive to you when you start training her.
You can also train her before her regular mealtime.Her hunger may motivate her to follow your instructions.

, The area where you train your cat should be large enough to allow you to throw the toy mouse at least a few feet.The room should be free of distractions, as well as physical obstacles (e.g., children’s toys, large furniture).If you cannot remove the obstacles from the room, try pushing them to the side to create a larger open area.
You can move to a larger area as your cat becomes more skilled at playing fetch with you., A delicious treat will provide the right motivation for your cat to learn how to fetch a toy mouse. Examples of treats your cat may like include bits of tuna and meat-flavored baby food.You can also purchase cat treats at your local grocery store or pet store.


Whichever treat you choose, it should be your cat’s favorite treat, and reserved only for training purposes.
Remember that treats should make up only a small portion (10 to 15%) of your cat’s diet.To keep a good balance of treats and regular food when you are training her, consider limiting her treats to just her training sessions.

, Begin your training session by holding the toy mouse in front of your cat. Stand a few feet back from her so that she cannot easily reach out and grab the toy. If you are training her during her playtime, she will likely already be attentive to you and the toy.


If she is keeping herself busy with something else, or is in a different room, you will probably need to call her to you.
Reward her with a treat when she comes to you after being called.

, Toss the toy mouse two to three feet in front of you.It is important to start with small throwing distances when your cat is first learning the trick.You can increase the distance as your cat becomes more skilled with fetching the toy mouse.An alternative to throwing the toy is to attaching it to a string. You can sling the stringed toy towards your cat, then pull it back when your cat has a hold of the toy.Remove the toy from the string as your cat begins to understand the motion of catching the toy and bringing it back to you.It may be helpful to give your cat verbal cues—‘fetch’ when you toss the toy mouse and ‘good fetch’ when she brings it back to you—during your training sessions., Your cat may not bring the toy mouse back to you the first time you throw it—she may not understand that you are teaching her how to fetch.If this happens, try enticing her with a treat in your hand to get her to walk to back to you with the toy.Reward her with the treat and verbal praise when she brings it back to you.When your cat sees the treat, she may drop the toy before she walks back to you.In this case, do not give her a treat. Instead, walk to her, pick up the toy, and walk back to your original position., Wait to toss the toy mouse until your cat has come back to you.When you toss it again, reward her if she brings it back to you. Keep in mind that you may have to pick up the toy mouse yourself several times before your cat understands that she is supposed to bring it back to you.


Toss the toy in the same direction each time that you toss it.Your cat will become increasingly better at bringing the toy mouse back to you when she forms the association between bringing it back and getting a tasty reward., As your cat becomes more skilled at fetching, gradually increase the distance at which you throw the toy mouse.Consider increasing the distance by a few inches each day that you practice with her.

, Limit your training sessions to three to five minutes.It is also important to practice only a few times each day—too much practice may cause your cat to become bored and simply walk away from you."

Avoid using your command in negative situations.",How to Train Your Cat to Come to You," If you want your cat to come when called, you have to offer a reward of some kind. Unlike dogs, cats do not always work to please their owners alone. If your cat does not feel she will be rewarded for behaving, she may not engage in an activity.Food is highly recommended as a reward. The vast majority of cats will work for a treat or food type they love. Choose something other than their everyday food. Get a special treat from the store or offer a small bit of deli meat or tuna. You may have to do some trial and error to find a food type your cat likes.Though most cats’ primary pleasure is food, there are some cats that just aren’t as interested. If your cat is generally disinterested in food, substitute the food treat with a special toy, favorite brush, or even a certain petting your cat enjoys.;
, Make up a unique call to signal to your cat she needs to come. You should choose something that's not an every day phrase. Your cat's name, for example, is a bad option for a call as you likely say it in situations where you don't need your cat to come. This can be confusing. Think of a unique phrase or sound you can use to get your cat to come.Noises can work well. You can say can say something like, ""Ki-ki-ki!"" in a high-pitched voice. You can make a clicking or squeaking noise. A whistle may also work.
You can also choose a phrase you don't say often. You can try something like, ""Come here!"" or ""Treats!"" or ""Tuna!""

, Once you've chosen your noise and reward, start establishing a positive connection. If you want your cat to come in response to a particular sound, you need to make sure she associates that sound with positive things. Make your call and then offer your cat food, treats, toys, or petting as a reward. If you're using food as a reward, you may want to make your call just before dinnertime., Once the reward and reinforcement is established, you can begin training time. To start, begin calling your cat. Offer her the reward as soon as she responds.Stand a couple feet away from your cat. Do your call. It may also be helpful to show your cat the reward as you call her. For example, you can crinkle a bag of treats or dangle her toy in front of you.
As soon as your cat comes to you, reward her. Give her a treat or toy, pet her, brush her, or engage in any reward you've established.
Do not be surprised if your cat takes awhile to come at first. It may take awhile for your cat to learn she should approach you when she hears your call. Be patient. Keep doing your call until your cat figures out she needs to come.

, Once your cat comes to you from a small distance, start increasing the distance. Step back a few more feet when you call your cat. Try calling her from other rooms. You can also try calling her during times she's distracted. Remember, you want your cat to come when called in a variety of situations. Varying the distance and situation can help establish the behavior., Once your cat is beginning to understand the command, you can start training her. If you're using food as a reward, your cat may be more motivated by food if she's hungry. Try scheduling training sessions about 15 minutes before mealtimes., Don’t wait too long to reward your cat. Otherwise, your cat may not make the connection between the treat and the act of coming towards you. As soon as your cat comes to you, offer the reward. Animals live in the immediate. If you want your cat to understand what the command means, she needs to be rewarded right away., Try to get in the habit of training your cat once a day. Cats tend to be more independent and have limited attention spans, so train in short sessions. Try brief 5 minute training sessions once or twice a day., Once your cat begins to reliably come to you in the kitchen or wherever you first began training, move to other parts of the house while calling to them. Eventually your cat will know to just follow the sound of your voice.

, As your cat begins to come consistently when called, alternate the treats with petting, a scratch behind the ears, or any other kind of positive attention. Too many treats or food as reward can cause weight problems in your cat. You also want your cat to come when called in any situation, and you may not always have a treat on hand.


Once your cat reliably responds to your call, give it the same treat three out of every four times, then reduce it to half the time, then a third, and so on until you are only occasionally give it the treat you once trained it with.Continue using non-food rewards. Eventually, your cat will understand she needs to come when called even if treats are not present.

, Cats tend to learn quicker when they're young. Therefore, the best time to begin training your cat is when she's a kitten. However, many people adopt cats when they're older. An older can learn as well. It just may take more time., Don’t punish your cat for not following along with your training, even if your cat only comes some of the time or doesn’t come at all. Cats do not respond well to punishment. They do not connect punishment with bad behavior, and simply think they're getting mistreated needlessly. If you punish your cat, she may become stressed or unhappy at home. This can result in her being even less likely to come when called., At first, it may take your cat awhile to come when she's called. You should not withhold rewards if your cat does not follow the command immediately. Your cat may simply be confused and be taking awhile to make the connection. You want to make sure to reward your cat consistently, solidifying the positive association with your call. Reward your cat even if she's taking awhile., You want to avoid using the come command for anything that may create a negative situation. Bad associations may make your cat hesitant to come when called.If you need to take your cat to the vet or give them an unpleasant medicine, approach your cat instead of having her come to you.

Pay attention to what your cat scratches and when.,
Buy a scratching post.,
Put the post in a strategic position.",How to Train Your Cat Not to Scratch the Furniture1," Typically, cats scratch to mark their territory, sharpen their claws, and stretch their bodies. Pay attention to when and what your cat likes to scratch to figure out how to offer a suitable replacement that will be equally enticing.Many cats have a preferred place and time to scratch, like right after a nap or when you come home. They also have preferences for the type of texture they like to scratch (often some type of nubby fabric that gives just the right amount of resistance).;
, Look for something that is as similar in texture to your furniture as you can find (including density and roughness of fabric). In many cases, cats prefer a scratching post that is similar in texture to tree bark.


There are many products available, including some that are infused with catnip. You an also rub catnip into any type of scratching toy., Since you've observed your cat's habits, you are familiar with when and where she feels the urge to scratch. You should put the post somewhere that is convenient for her. For example, if she prefers to stretch on a post after a nap, put a scratching post near her bed. You might buy a couple of different types of scratching posts and put them in different places, especially if you have more than one cat. Place a post in every room that she frequents so that she won't be overcome with the urge to scratch furniture there instead."

Find a breeder.",How to Identify a Savannah Cat," These cats have inherited the large ears of the African Serval. They are tall and long. Situated directly on top of the head, they point straight up, instead of out., The Savannah also has distinctive eyes. They are slightly hooded and the overhanging skin creates the appearance of eyes that are flat on top. This contrasts with the perfectly rounded eye shape of many other breeds., The most distinctive feature of the Savannah cat is their coat. They have markings somewhat similar to those of a wild African cat. Because Savannahs have been interbred with a variety of domestic breeds, their coats can vary somewhat. But there are important commonalities.


The Savannah’s coat can be brown, tan, silver, or gold, with dark spots. It can also be black with spots of a slightly different shade of black.The Savannah’s spots can be round, oval, or elongated. It should have a series of parallel stripes along its back. Smaller spots will be on the face, legs, and feet.The Savannahs are short-haired cats.

, Servals are medium-sized cats. As Savannahs become more interbred with domesticated cats they will decrease in size. A purer Savannah might be as big as 15 to 28 pounds.More interbred Savannah’s might not be much larger than the average house cat. But they should still have especially long legs that often make them look bigger than they are.

, Because they are nearly wild, Savannahs are not sedate lap cats. They are often friendly, but extremely active. They are curious, playful, and energetic.


Savannahs will be particularly inclined to climb and make long, vertical jumps.
Savannahs’ curiosity and energy can get them into trouble. Be careful with your valuables and put guards over all electrical wires., There is a rather extensive coding system for Savannahs. These codes represent the different types of breeds that the Savannah was interbred with – and thus its physical features – and also how many generations removed your cat is from the wild Serval.


The most basic terminology for Savannahs is their generational rank. An F1 is the direct offspring of a Serval and a wildcat. An F2 is one generation removed, and an F3 is one more generation removed. The closer a Savannah is to an F1 the larger it should be., Savannahs are rare and expensive. The likelihood of finding one in a shelter might be low, but a shelter cat would save you a lot of money and be the most humane option. Using websites like Petfinder.com, which allow you to search through a large database of pets, makes the odds of finding such a rare breed more manageable., Buying a Savannah from a breeder can cost as much as $3000. Purchasing from a breeder might increase your likelihood of getting what you are looking for, but you still need to be mindful of how reputable the breeder is.


Indicates that a breeder might not be reputable include: always having kittens available, having multiple litters on premises, always having your choice of a kitten, and presenting the option of paying online with a credit card.
Be sure to check out the facility where the breeding happens and meet the parents. If the parents have a good disposition and appearance, it is more likely that the children will as well.
Watch for signs at the breeder's house that the animals are sick or poorly maintained. If the cats are sneezing and lethargic or the place appears unclean and has a strong odor, it is possible that the conditions are unhealthy.Veterinarians are often a good resource for referring you to a reputable breeder."

Ask your veterinarian.",How to Identify a Ragdoll Cat," According to the breed standards for Ragdoll cats, all examples of this breed must have bright blue eyes. If you see a cat without blue eyes, it is not a true Ragdoll cat.Some breeders advertise non-blue-eyed variations of the Ragdoll breed. However, this variant is not accepted by any major Ragdoll association and isn’t included in the written Breed Standard for Ragdoll cats.;
, Ragdoll cats can come in a variety of colors and patterns; however, the accepted breed standard establishes that these cats must exhibit the pointed breed characteristics to be included. This means that the cat’s body will be lighter in color than the points of its body – the face, ears, tail, and legs.Ragdolls come in four main patterns: bi-color, van, mitted, and colorpoint. These patterns also appear in six major colors – seal, blue, chocolate, lilac, red, and cream – while the points can be solid, lynx, tortie, or torbie.
Colorpoint ragdolls have the classic “pointed” markings and no white anywhere in their coat.
Mitteds have white feet in the front, white boots all the way up and around the hocks in back, a white chin, and belly stripe. Mitted Ragdolls may also have a blaze, star, or hourglass patch of white on their forehead and nose.
Bi-colors usually have more white – their paws, underbodies, chest, and an upside-down ‘V’ marking on their faces are white. Only their tails, ears, and the outer part of their masks show the darker markings.
In the Van pattern, only the top of the mask, ears, and tail, and perhaps a few spots on the body, show darker markings.

, Ragdoll cats are typically quite large cats when compared to other breeds. They aren’t necessarily overweight cats (though they are often prone to overeating and gaining a larger belly); even the most fit Ragdoll cats are large in size and shape.Adult male Ragdolls usually weigh around 15 to 20 pounds, while adult females typically weigh 10-15 pounds.

, Despite the fluffy, luxurious coat most Ragdoll cats have, they actually don’t shed very much. Their fur is medium long and requires very little grooming.Because of the soft nature of the Ragdoll’s coat, what shedding does occur is quite easy to clean up, as it typically just sits on the surface of fabrics rather than working its way into the material.
During shedding season, it is possible for Ragdoll fur to become a bit matted under the armpits.

, Ragdoll cats are calm and easy to get along with. They enjoy playing interactive games with their owners – like fetch and following their owners around the house – but generally avoid the wild, destructive behavior other breeds often engage in.If your cat seems like a hyperactive kitten all the time, it probably is not a member of the Ragdoll breed.

, Most Ragdoll cats are very calm and easily adapt to households with children and other animals. Due to their docile nature, Ragdolls can quite easily integrate into new situations, especially if they are raised around young children or other pets from the beginning.It is not uncommon for children to “lug” their Ragdoll friend around the house. This breed tolerates this kind of treatment very well.

, Ragdoll cats are known for being very affectionate and cuddly. They are lap cats who enjoy being held and spend much of their time napping on or near their owners. Ragdolls are notorious for going slightly limp when being picked up (hence the name Ragdoll), and even love being cradled on their backs like a baby.Ragdoll cats typically prefer the company of their owners and will seek them out most of the time. Your Ragdoll cat will want to be near you.

, If you want to be sure that your cat is a Ragdoll cat, try to work with reputable breeders who are supported by the Ragdoll cat community. There are plenty of associations dedicated to the love and care of Ragdoll cats, and these groups can recommend reputable breeders to you.Try the Ragdoll Fanciers Club International, Ragdoll Kittens,or Rock Creek Ranch Ragdoll Cattery., Most reputable Ragdoll breeders will have documentation that certify them as members of reputable Ragdoll breeder associations. These forms authorize them to breed and sell acknowledged Ragdoll cats and kittens.They should also be able to provide you with a certificate of authenticity regarding your Ragdoll cat.

, If you are still wondering whether or not your cat is a member of the Ragdoll breed, you should contact your veterinarian and ask for advice. Your vet can help you assess the cat’s features and characteristics and determine the cat’s breed based on their expert knowledge.Your vet may even be able to perform a DNA test on your cat to determine its breed.

Stop her.,
Reward good behavior.,
Don't yell.",How to Train Your Cat Not to Scratch the Furniture2," If you see your cat in the act of scratching on your furniture, stop her immediately and scold her. Clap your hands suddenly or spray her with water. Then, physically remove her from the area.Pick her up and move her to her scratching post. This will help her associate her urge to scratch with the post.
Unless you catch her in the act, scolding won't help. She won't know what you're talking about.

, Cats, like dogs and like people, thrive on positive reinforcement for good behavior. Instead of punishing your cat for scratching the furniture, reward her for scratching the post. You can offer any reward that you know she likes. Many cats respond well to the following:


Praise. Cats love your attention more than anything. Scratch her ears, tell her what a good girl she is, and use a sweet, affectionate tone of voice.
A cat treat. Offer her a favorite treat as a thank-you for scratching the post.
Catnip. This can be rubbed into the scratching post or used as a reward for after she has scratched there.

, Most cats and kittens are annoyed by yelling, but it doesn't do much to deter their bad behavior.


Yelling only teaches your cat to avoid you because you are unpredictable and maybe even dangerous."
"
Trim her nails.,
Cover the sides of the furniture.,
Deter her with scent.,
Give your cat interesting things to do.",How to Train Your Cat Not to Scratch the Furniture3," One reason cats scratch furniture is to wear off the ends of their nails, which in the wild would wear down naturally from climbing and catching prey. If you keep her nails trimmed, she will have less of a physical need to scratch.You can use special cat claw clippers from the pet store, or a pair of human nail clippers or small scissors. Cat claws are retractable, so you have to access the claws to trim them. Holding your cat's paw, gently press on the knuckle just behind the claw to cause the claw to extend from the paw. Very carefully trim off the very tip of the claw, but no more than that. Be sure to do both front paws about every ten daysand both back paws as needed.If you are uncomfortable with trimming her nails, ask a groomer or veterinarian to show you how.

, The cat likes the feel of your furniture under her claws, so you can deter her by covering it with something less appealing.Try double sided tape, sandpaper, aluminum foil, or even a plastic carpet runner., Cats naturally avoid certain scents like citrus or menthol, so you can use this to your advantage by putting these types of scents near the area she likes to scratch to deter her behavior.You can use essential oils on a cotton ball, or you can even buy spray products that are specifically formulated to deter cats and spray items you don't want your cat getting on. There are even natural products in health food stores.

, Sometimes cats scratch simply from boredom, so provide plenty of cat toys and other stimulating activities to keep her occupied.


You don't have to spend any money; cats are fascinated with simple things like a cardboard box or paper bag. Set out a box or paper bag for her and watch her have fun.

Look at the tail.,
Check the cat's body shape.",How to Identify a Persian Cat1," Persian cats tend to have very round faces with full, puffy cheeks. The nose is ""snubbed,"" and therefore not very prominent. Their eyes are usually large and expressive and may be colored blue, amber, or a mix of the two. Meanwhile, the ears tend to be very small and round-tipped in appearance.While many Persian cats tend to have flat faces, there are variations. Some Persians have a more rounded facial shape, which breeders often refer to as a doll-faced Persian.;
, The coat of a Persian cat tends to be very distinct. Persians typically have long fur with a silky texture. Their fur needs to be combed every day to avoid getting knots and tangles, and mats may need to be trimmed out from time to time.Most Persians will require daily grooming that lasts at least 10 to 15 minutes, plus an hour-long grooming session once every week., Though many people picture a white cat when they think of Persians, these cats can come in a wide variety of colors. Some of the most common colors include white, red, cream, black, brown, blue-gray, chocolate, lilac, silver, golden, tortoiseshell, blue-cream, calico, and seal (usually a mix of cream and brown/black)., There are numerous variations on the coat pattern seen in Persian cats. Breeders who raise Persians for cat competitions have divided the most common Persian patterns into seven categories (called divisions) to more easily identify what type of Persian you're adopting or purchasing.Solid Division - this category implies that the cat has a single, uniform coat color. Most solids have copper-colored eyes, but white Persians may have copper, blue, or one of each.
Silver & Golden Division - Persians in this category have either chinchilla (sparkling white with fine black tips) coats or shaded silver and golden coats. Goldens have a warm, creamy coat with black tips, and silvers usually have black down the back with even shading down the sides.
Shaded & Smoke Division - shaded Persians tend to have shell and shaded-cameo coats, typically with a white undercoat and tips that are red, cream, black, or blue-cream. Smoke Persians appear to have a solid colored coat, but close examination reveals a white undercoat.
Tabby Division - tabby Persians have either classic, mackerel, or patched tabby patterns. Classic tabbies have a bull's eye pattern along the side, and mackerel tabbies have thin lines that appear drawn on around the entire body.
Parti-color Division - this category includes Persians that have tortoiseshell, chocolate tortoiseshell, blue-cream, and lilac-cream coats. These coats tend to be a solid color (usually black or cream) with patches of red.
Calico & Bicolor Division - this category includes calico patterns and dual-colored coats. All cats in this division have copper eyes, except for silver tabbies, which may have green or hazel eyes.
Himalayan Division - these Persians tend to have white or cream bodies with point colors restricted to the face and extremities. Cats in this division will always have blue eyes.

, Persian cats typically have a distinct tail. It's usually short and lofted upward. The tail is usually straight with little to no curvature, and Persians usually carry the tail at an angle below the back., Persian cats have a distinctly short, stocky body shape. They tend to be slightly heavier than the average cat, though their bodies remain somewhat compact.A Persian cat's legs have heavy bones that carry the medium- to large-sized body.
The shoulders are usually broad, with an overall thick, compact body. The neck is also short and thick.Female Persians generally weigh between 8 to 12 pounds. Male Persians typically weigh over 12 pounds.

Look for unusually short legs.,
Notice a long body.,
Assess the rest of the body.",How to Identify a Munchkin Cat1," The most defining characteristic of a Munchkin cat is that they have extremely short legs. The front legs average around three inches long. The rear legs may be the same length or slightly longer., Due to the short legs, the body length of this breed looks extremely long. The body is around the size of a medium-sized cat. This breed weighs between four to eight poundsThis breed is often compared to a Dachshund due to the long body and short legs.

, The Munchkin cat generally has a broad, round head that is considered a modified wedge. The ears are medium-sized triangles. The eyes are large, walnut-shaped, and wide set. The tail and neck are medium-thick.The breed has both a short and long-haired variety. Because they are outcrossed with domestic cats, there is a wide variety of colors and patterns.

Verify the cat’s shape and size.,
Observe facial hair and color.,
Examine the cat’s coat.,
Look for a short tail.",How to Identify a Pixiebob Cat1," The pixiebob cat is a medium sized cat and has a sturdy build. Their build is one of the reasons why many people suggest that it is related to the wild bobcat. When evaluating its shape and size consider that:


The cat weighs between 8 to 17 pounds (3.6 to 7.7 kilograms).
They are muscular or brawny.;
, One of the most distinguishing features of the pixiebob is its facial hair. Ultimately, these characteristics are some of the most important in making the pixiebob resemble a bobcat. Some characteristics include:


The cat may have lynx tips on the ears.
Their hair may grow down along the sides of their face and resemble muttonchop sideburns.
The cat may have mascara markings that run from the outside corner of the eye to the cheek., The pixiebob has a thick coat that is relatively resistant to the elements. Thus, the pixiebob is well suited to the outdoors in colder climates. Ultimately, by looking at the cat’s coat, you’ll get a better idea of whether it is a pixiebob. The coat:


Is soft, thick, and has a woolly feeling.
May be shorthair or longhair.
Is usually brown spotted and tabby colored. It could be many different shades of brown.
Will have a spotted stomach., One of the defining characteristics of the pixiebob is its short tail. This, combined with the cat’s facial hair and color have led many people to suggest that the cat might be related to the bobcat.

Look for a playful but reserved personality.,
Anticipate a relatively quiet cat.,
Keep a Persian's surroundings familiar.,
Identify common health complications in Persians.",How to Identify a Persian Cat2," Though every cat is unique, Persians in general tend to have a distinct personality type. They are playful in their own way, yet reserved and somewhat docile for the most part. Unlike other cat breeds, Persians are not particularly known for jumping or climbing.Persian cats tend to prefer sitting in a person's lap or lying in the sun over more physical activities.
They tend to not be very demanding of people's affection. Sitting or reclining in a person's lap is usually sufficient for most Persians.
Persians often get frightened or annoyed with loud noise and/or poorly-behaved children.

, Persian cats are not known for being very vocal. They might greet people with a quiet, low-key meow, but will not meow or yowl with any persistence unless they are distressed.When a Persian cat does vocalize, it tends to be in short, melodic bursts., Persians are generally not very welcoming to surprises.Because of this, taking a Persian cat to an unfamiliar environment may be jarring and unpleasant to your cat. If you are planning on leaving town for a few days, a Persian may need someone to visit your home and care for him or her, rather than being boarded in unfamiliar territory.If you plan on making changes to your home, like buying new furniture, it may be best for your cat to introduce that furniture gradually instead of all at once.
If you move to a new home, make sure some of your old furniture is there before you bring your cat. This can make the transition easier for a Persian.

, Like many purebred cats, Persians are prone to certain health complications at some point in life. Some may not significantly affect the cat's quality of life, while others can be quite serious.Some of the most common health complications seen in Persian cats include:


Basal cell tumors
Cataracts
Deafness (especially common in blue-eyed Persians)
Cryptorchidism
Entropion
Facial fold dermatitis
Lysosomal storage disease
Peritoneopericardial hernia
Polycystic kidney disease
Progressive retinal atrophy
Systemic lupus

Find a reputable breeder.,
Look out for warning signs of a bad breeder.,
Try adopting a Persian from a rescue or shelter.",How to Identify a Persian Cat3," If you want a Persian kitten, you may have to go through a breeder. However, it's important that you only work with reputable breeders. This helps ensure your cat's health and its true breed identity, and it also helps reduce business for disreputable or illegal breeders.A reputable breeder will offer you health certifications that prove that the cat has been screened for genetic health complications.
Reputable breeders typically make kittens available when they are between 12 and 16 weeks old. Kittens sold before 12 weeks of age may not be inoculated and will lack the physical and social strength to adjust to a new home.Ask if you can tour the facility, which any reputable breeder should be able to accommodate. Look for any signs of sick animals or unsanitary/unhealthy living conditions.
You can ask your veterinarian for a list of reputable breeders in your area. If a vet recommends a breeder, there's a good chance that breeder follows acceptable practices.

, If you choose to work with a breeder, make sure you know what to look for. In addition to having health certifications and an open facility, a reputable breeder should have limitations on the number and variety of kittens available at any given time. A reputable breeder will also be more particular about how you can pay for your cat once you've worked out an arrangement and chosen a kitten.Any breeder who has kittens continuously available or houses multiple litters should be seen as a red flag. Also, anyone selling kittens younger than 12 weeks of age is probably an disreputable breeder.Ask the breeder whether he or she sells to pet stores and wholesalers. Reputable breeders are bound by a code of professional ethics that bans this practice, and any breeder who makes these sales is not to be trusted.
If the breeder allows you to pay online using a credit card, it might be a scam or an disreputable breeder. Most breeders will want you to pay in person, usually with cash or a check.

, Persian kittens are incredibly rare to find in an animal rescue or shelter, but adult Persian cats are frequently available for adoption. If you check at a few different rescues or shelters, you will find both mixed-breed and pedigreed Persian cats looking for a home.You can try visiting shelters and rescues in your area, or you can search online with listings like Petfinder or Adopt-a-Pet.

Use color to identify the cat.",How to Identify a Manx1," Manx cats have four different tail varieties. “Rumpies” have no tail at all, and instead sport a dimple at the base of the spine where the tail would normally extend. “Rumpy-risers” have a stubby tail of only one to three bones. “Stumpies” have a short tail that is curved or kinked. And finally, “longies” have tails that are almost as long as those of regular cats.Most breeders cut the tails off of longies, so unless you’re a breeder, you probably won’t encounter a longie.;
, Manx cats are muscular and compact, with a sturdy skeleton. They are medium to large in size with a wide chest.Their hind legs are noticeably longer than their front legs, giving them an appearance some have likened to rabbits.Males might be somewhat larger than females.

, When viewed from behind, the ears appear as a cradle or rocker shape. The ears are broad-based and taper to a rounded tip.Manx cats have broad faces.

, There are two varieties of Manx coats. Short-haired Manxes have a long overcoat with a dense, fluffy undercoat. The hair of the overcoat might feel coarse even though it looks fluffy. If you pet the cat during summer or late spring, the fur might feel thin due to spring shedding. The long-haired Manx has a silky coat of medium length, and tufts of fur between its toes and around its ears.White Manxes might have a softer coat than Manxes of other colors., Manxes have large, round eyes. The outer corners of the eyes will point up slightly toward the ears, while the lower corners will angle down and inward slightly toward the nose.Eye color in Manxes varies. Green, hazel, gold, copper, and blue are all common. Some Manxes are odd-eyed (that is, each eye has a different color).

, Male Manxes weigh around 10-12 pounds (4.5-5.4 kg). Females weigh about 8-10 pounds (3.6-4.5 kg). Weigh your cat on a scale to determine if it falls within or near breed averages.Manxes feel surprisingly heavy when lifted.

, Manxes come in a wide variety of colors, so using color to identify one can be difficult. Common colors include tabby, calico (multicolor), and tortoiseshell. You can eliminate certain colors, though, since Manxes do not come in chocolate, lavender, or pointed (light coloring on the body and dark coloring on the limbs, tail, and face) varieties. They also do not come in any of these colors plus white."

Keep plenty of your cat’s favorite bite-sized treats on hand when trying to train it. Give your cat frequent treats when training it in short sessions.You can also vary treats frequently to keep your cat interested.Some good choices are:Diced chicken
Bits of tuna
Commercial cat treats
Small pieces of dry food;
, Your cat won’t want to learn tricks if it’s not in the mood. Starting by giving your cat a treat might get its attention. If your cat doesn’t act interested in learning a particular trick, don’t force it to play—just be patient and try again later., A pet clicker is a small device that makes a clicking sound. Each time your cat does something you want it to (like a trick), make the clicking sound and give it a treat. The sound and positive reinforcement (reward) of the treat condition your cat to repeat the behavior.Pet clickers can be found at pet supply stores. If you can’t find one, you can try a pen that makes a clicking noise.

, Cats learn through repetition, so frequent training sessions will help them master a trick. Try repeating tricks several times each day.Keeping training sessions brief will also hold your cat’s attention so it will want to keep trying., When your cat completes a trick, give it a treat. Then try to get your cat to repeat the trick 5-10 times in a row (giving it a treat each time), as long as it is interested. This repetition will encourage the behavior.

, For instance, if you want your cat to sit, don’t use the word “sit” until it is used to doing the trick. This will help the cat associate the word specifically with the trick., Positive reinforcement like praise and treats as your cat learns a trick will help it to master the behavior. Trying to teach it more than one trick at a time can confuse it, however, because it may not understand what behavior is being rewarded. Wait until your cat has mastered one trick before moving on to the next., Cats learn when given rewards and positive reinforcement, not when they are punished. Scolding or punishing your cat when it doesn’t complete a trick will only make it stressed or disinterested. If you cat doesn’t act interested in learning a trick, or doesn’t perform successfully, just try again later., When your cat is on all four feet, hold a treat in front of its face to get its attention. Slowly move it from in front of the cat’s face to just between its ears. Many cats will follow the treat in the air and lower their rear end to get it. When your cat sits, positively reinforce its behavior by praising it and giving it the treat.If you cat’s rear end doesn’t quite touch the ground the first time, give it the treat anyway. Keep repeating this training and your cat can get better each time.

, Then, put a treat in your hand (wrapped in your fist, for instance), and wait for your cat to use its paw to try and grab it out of your hand. Give the cat a treat as a reward when it does. Repeat this many times, gradually lifting your hand up higher each time until the behavior resembles giving a hi-five., Call your cat’s name and tap on its food bowl to get its attention. When your cat comes, praise them and give them a treat.


When your cat gets used to coming when called, you can also use the command “come” for this trick.
You can vary this trick by trying to train your cat to come from distances increasingly farther away, from outside to inside, etc.

, This trick is learned best after your cat has learned to sit. Once your cat is sitting next to the object, hold a treat near it to attract the cat. When the cat touches the object, give it a treat.


Once your cat becomes interested in this trick, you can also train it to touch the object with a specific type of its body. For instance, if you want to train it to touch an object with its paw, wait to give your cat a treat until it does.

, When your cat sits up on its hind legs, and reaches for the treat with its front paws, use a command like “sit” and give it the treat.

, When it lifts the paw off the ground, grasp it in yours as though you were shaking hands. Give your cat a treat immediately afterwards.

, Cats are capable of producing a wide range of vocal sounds (meows, chirps, trills, yowls, etc.), and they reserve most of them for communicating with humans.You can try training your cat to produce a meow or other sound on command. Just give your cat a treat when it makes the desired sound. After the cat begins to associate the treat with a reward, introduce a word like ""meow"" or ""chirp"" to create the command.

Accept that cats can be trained.,
Don’t try to train a cat like a dog.,
Work with the cat you have.,
Find the proper reward.,
Get into clicker training.","How to Teach a Cat to ""High Five""1"," Cats are known for being independent, self-absorbed, and generally indifferent to the other creatures around them. This may not strike you as the type of animal that can be — or wants to be — trained, but it is possible and usually fun. You'll want to use reward-based training, which teaches the cat to associate the desired behavior with getting a treat or other reward.


It might be helpful to figure out what your cat's favorite treat is so you will know the best way to motivate them. You might lay out a few different treats and see which one your cat chooses first.
Cats want to feel involved in the training process, perhaps even in charge of it. For instance, it is usually best to let the cat decide whether to continue or halt the training session.;
, Domesticated dogs have been bred over the centuries to work in concert with humans by obeying commands; cats, to help by acting independently, traditionally to kill pests.Not surprisingly, then, the process of training each must be different.


Your cat will be motivated to cooperate with you when this earns them a reward. Do not use punishment to try and train your cat (or dog, for that matter).
Cats prefer short training sessions that they usually choose to conclude.
Conducting a training session by offering treats as a reward to a hungry cat (such as just before mealtime), for perhaps five-to-ten minutes (if the cat permits), can often work.

, Yes, young dogs learn new tricks more easily than old ones, and so do cats (as do people, for that matter!). So starting your training with a young cat is the ideal way to go, but that does not mean that you shouldn’t bother with your mature feline.


With any cat, but especially an older one, it is best to work with, rather than against, its natural tendencies.That is, a cat that naturally paws at objects is a better candidate for teaching the “high five,” while an unrepentant biter may not be.

, Dogs might work for a “good boy” and pat on the head, or some nondescript dog treat. Cats, however, usually demand the good stuff as a reward for paying attention to you, not kitty kibbles.


To make your training sessions effective and last for more than a few seconds, you need to find a “high value treat” to keep your cat motivated.Cubed chicken can make a special and easy-to-distribute reward, as can small mounds of tuna on a dish. If your cat prefers less solid treats, such as perhaps meat-flavored baby food, a wide-mouth syringe can prove useful.

, Clickers are small animal training aids that, when depressed and released, make a sound akin to clicking the removed metal cap of a juice bottle or opening/closing a ballpoint pen. (In fact, either of these items can be used as a training clicker in a pinch, although the real deal is widely available and inexpensive.)


The clicker is the “anchor” that provides the consistent frame of reference for identifying the activity worthy of reward.You should practice your clicking technique before training your cat with it. You need to be able to click with one hand and offer the reward with the other, or do both with the same hand (called in this article “click + treat”), simultaneously. Cats do not usually respond well to confusion or mistakes.
Find a quiet spot for clicker training with your cat, free of external noise and distractions. Don’t add verbal encouragement or praise, either — let the clicker do the talking.A good initial clicker training technique is the “nose touch.” Hold a target, such as a ping-pong ball attached to the end of a chopstick, above the cat’s head. “Click + treat” each time the cat touches the target (ball) with its nose.See also How to Clicker Train a Cat and How to Teach Your Cat to Give a Handshake for more advice and ideas.

Know the cat’s limits.",How to Train an Old Stubborn Cat to Do Tricks," Know exactly what it is you want your cat to do. Having clear goals can help you devise a more thorough and consistent plan to coax your cat into performing the desired behavior.Come up with many possible tricks. Cats can be trained to do a variety of things -- sit, lie down, jump, stand on two feet, fetch, etc. Be kind and don't expect too much. Don't set your cat up for failure either. Make a list of possible, easy tricks your cat can master and approach them one by one.;
, Cats, like people, don’t generally do things for the benefit of others. You need the cat to want to perform the trick because he gets something out of it. You can make or buy cat treats, or you can give your cat bits of cooked chicken (no longer hot) or bits of cooked tuna. Dry cat chow is not a good treat., Now that you want your cat to do something in particular, do not give him treats unless he does the thing that you want him to do. Make treats rare and something that your cat looks forward to. Make your cat work for his treats!, When training a cat, use its natural curiosity to your advantage. Cats are consistently interested in what we are doing and will take time out of their day to investigate. You can get and keep the cat’s attention during training sessions using this curiosity., Cats don't concentrate for more than 5-10 minutes at a time. So four sessions that are 5 minutes long are better than one 20 minute session a day.

, Always stop a training session on a positive note. When the cat has responded the way you want it to, give it a treat, praise it and call it a day. This final, positive memory of the training session will stick with the cat, making it more receptive to future training., This is the simplest trick to teach a cat. As you're standing, say ""up"" and pat your thigh a few times while holding a treat in your hand at thigh-level, just out of your cat's reach so that he has to stand on two feet and lean on your leg to reach it. When the cat finally does this, say, ""Good boy!"" or ""Good girl!"" and give the cat the treat., Using a favorite toy, get the cat’s attention. Once the cat is enthralled with the toy, throw it where the cat can see it. Show the cat a treat in your hand, call the cat and say, “Bring it back.” If he comes back without the toy, don’t give it the treat. If it comes back with the toy, give it the treat, pet it and praise it. Repeating this process may teach your cat to fetch over time.Remember to use a toy that the cat can easily pick up and carry in its mouth.

, Cats that are comfortable with their environment will naturally roll on their backs and expose their bellies. Use this behavior to your advantage. When a cat rolls on its back, give it a treat and praise it. If you do this consistently enough, the cat will roll on its back, on its own, when it wants a treat., This trick is very simple to teach a cat, so long as you have something it wants. Cats, like dogs, should be able to sit before receiving a treat. To get your cat to do this, hold a treat in your hand, out of the cat’s reach. Give your cat the command to “sit” and show it the treat. Move the treat in an arc over the cat's head. As the cat looks up to follow the treat, her rear will hit the ground in a sitting position. Repeat this process until the animal sits down, then give it the treat. If you repeat this process every time you give your cat a treat, it should learn to sit upon receiving the command the first time., Again, if you have something the cat wants, this should be easy. Hold a treat out where the cat can see it, but can’t reach it, and give it the command to “speak”. The cat, over time, will become agitated and will probably express its agitation by meowing or making a sound. As soon as your cat does make a sound, give it the treat and praise it. Over time, your cat will associate the verbal command with its meowing and realize that this is what you want it to do., Remember, cats are not dogs. Dogs do tricks to please owners because they are social pack animals. The mind of a cat works differently than that of a dog. In the wild, cats are asocial -- they do not live in packs and prefer to be on their own. This necessarily makes them more difficult to train., Cats can be trained, but you need to understand them first. A cat will do tricks when it is trained properly, but a cat will only do tricks for its own benefit, not your benefit. A cat wants to please itself. Motivate it accordingly., When dealing with cats, using physical force or a threatening tone of voice will never be effective in achieving a desired result. Cats respond to owners who reward positive behaviors, not owners who punish bad behaviors. If you want your cat to work with you, you have to stay positive., Cats do a number of impressive things on their own. They climb, jump, crawl, paw at things, and run very quickly and with great agility naturally. Teaching your cat tricks that play off of these natural behaviors will help the animal pick up on training more readily., There are some things a cat just can’t or won’t do. Know your cat’s limits and stay within them. You can teach a cat to fetch, but it won’t be bringing in the newspaper anytime soon. Also, if your cat seems unwilling or uninterested in learning a trick after you have dedicated some time to it, give up. The cat is your pet, not your own personal circus clown. Appreciate the animal for the love and companionship it gives you, not just the tricks it will do for you.You may also want to try clicker training. First get the cat to associate a click with a reward, then 'mark' the desired behavior with a click so the cat knows what she's being rewarded for.

,, Practice so that you can use the clicker and provide the treat in concert., Don’t expect to be able to practice for more than five-to-ten minutes at a time, however, and quite possibly less.If your cat is quickly disinterested, try again in a few hours. Try training right before mealtime, when the cat will be eager for treats.

, Stop providing treats for weak or misdirected paw movements., “Click + treat” whenever the cat touches your hand with its paw.Reward contact by only one paw, however, either the cat’s right or left front paw. Teach it to use the same paw every time.

, Do this only when your cat consistently touches your empty hand.Your ultimate goal is to make the cue for a ""high five"" become the presentation of your palm to the cat. Practice by opening your hand quickly in front of the cat, then sharply pulling it away once contact is made (or if no contact is made). This should be a quick and small movement.

, If the cat tries to extend its nose or mouth to the target, withdraw it, wait five seconds, then try again., Over time, reward only paw movements toward the target, then only those that touch the target, then only those with the same paw (either front right or front left).Withdraw the target, wait, then try again for wrong-paw or weak paw movements.
For this method, you will need to be able to click and offer the treat using the same hand, since the other is holding the target. Practice beforehand so you can do the move properly each time.

, Try to hold it with your palm facing down, using your thumb to help grip.Keep sliding your hand towards the tip until it is covering the end of the target.

, Extend your hand, palm down, and “click + treat” palm contact with the correct paw., “High five” is the natural choice., Once your cat masters this maneuver, you can work on other angles for your “high fives.”"

Find a quiet spot and sit facing your cat.Place a chair or small table nearby, to the cat’s paw-side you want to use for the “high five” — that is, to your left and the cat’s right for the right paw.
Please note: This is the most involved method described in the article, and is a simplified version of one described by “clicker training” pioneer Karen Pryor.

, If the cat makes any type of movement toward the saucer, immediately “click + treat” by returning the saucer to the floor.If, however, the cat leaps onto the table after the treats, calmly return the cat to the floor and present the saucer for a treat.
If the cat makes no movement, lure it to move by sliding your hand toward the treat table. Immediately “click + treat” any movement.

, Take it up again in a few hours or the next day. Training before mealtime is often most effective., “Click + treat” only when the cat lifts its paw deliberately, then only clearly towards the treat.Become increasingly particular about the movements that you reward. Eventually make only an upward-lifted and extended paw worth a treat.

, Place your palm up, so that the cat’s paw brushes it on the way back down. Immediately “click + treat” contact with your hand., Keep going until your hand is at the cat’s shoulder height.Slowly but surely, you are making your hand, not the saucer, the cat’s focus.

, Make your cat reach ever further to contact your hand. Reward only deliberate, forceful contact.Remove the reward saucer from the process over time. Provide small hand-held treats as needed to keep the training going.

, Presenting your hand in this manner will become the cue for the action by the cat., Practice in different rooms and different environments. Let other people try by offering the cue. Add a verbal cue such as “high five” into the mix."

Look for emerald-green eyes.,
Check for round eyes.,
Look for silver-blue fur.,
Look for a single medium-length coat.,
Check for a heart-shaped face.,
Look for large ears.,
Look for a medium build.,
Look for front legs that are slightly shorter than rear legs.",How to Identify a Korat Cat1," Korat cats are born with blue eyes, but their eyes will turn to amber sometime in the period between their birth and the cat’s fourth birthday. Then, sometime between the cat’s second and fourth birthdays, its eyes will turn a bright green. If your cat has emerald-green eyes, it could be a Korat., Some cats have slanted or angular eyes. Korats’s eyes, however, are large, round, alert, and luminous. If this sounds like your cat, you may have a Korat., Korat cats have what is described as a bluish coat (in fact, it’s closer to a brown or gray color). The fur is tipped with silver, giving it a kind of shiny quality, especially where the hair is at its shortest., Korat cats only sport a single coat of medium-length fur, with no undercoat. Run your hand over the cat you’re trying to identify in order to determine if it has a double coat or a single coat., Korats have pointed chins and a brow that slopes toward the center of their foreheads. Combined with their round eyes, you should be able to notice a sort of heart shape to the cat’s face.The Korat’s face is characterized by smooth, curved lines.
The Korat’s nose will have a slight downward curve to it.
Korats have strong and well-developed jaws.

, Korats’ ears are wide at the base and flare up into a rounded top. The ears are located relatively high on the head. The outer edge of each ear aligns with the outer edge the cat’s head. The ears are relatively hairless inside, and have short, close fur on the outside., Korat cats are medium-sized cats with broad chests. They are rather short and thickset, but their bodies are free of sharp joints or hard lines. The females are generally smaller and might seem almost dainty., Korat cats’ legs are proportional to their bodies and end in feet that are oval-shaped. Each front foot has five toes, while each rear foot has four toes. Korat cats’ paw pads are covered in dark blue or lavender fur."

Determine if the cat forms close bonds with a limited number of people.,
Look for an energetic cat.,
Test the cat’s intelligence.",How to Identify a Korat Cat2," Korat cats tend to form very close bonds with their owners, but do not have much interest in the attention or affections of many other people. If the cat you are attempting to identify follows just one or two people about and has little interest in anyone else, you might have a Korat cat., Korat cats love to play. Wave a string toy or flash a laser pointer around the cat you’re trying to identify. If the cat shows great interest and seems to enjoy participating in this playful exercise, you might have a Korat., Korat cats are very smart. Try teaching your cat tricks like sit, stay, and shake. If your cat easily learns these commands, it might be a Korat. Alternately, you could give the cat puzzle toys – small toys filled with treats that are only dispensed when the cat move the toy in the correct position. Your cat might be a Korat cat if it seems to have no trouble getting the treats out of its puzzle toys."
"
Weigh the cat.,
Monitor the cat’s growth rate.,
Get a DNA test.",How to Identify a Korat Cat3," Korats tend to weigh six to 10 pounds (2.7 to 4.5 kilograms). To weigh the cat you are trying to identify, place it on a scale, then check the readout., Korat cats grow slowly. Some don’t reach their full size until they are five years old. If the cat you wish to identify is taking a long time to grow, it might be a Korat., Your veterinarian can help you determine whether you’ve got a Korat by taking a DNA sample. Generally, this is as easy as swabbing the inside of your cat’s cheek or, in some cases, drawing its blood. Your vet will inform you of the exact process and any preparations you need to make before bringing your cat for its DNA test."
"
Make sure your cat is hungry.,
Ask a friend to sit a few feet away from the cat.,
Apply some cat food on your friend’s cheek.,
Let the cat go to your friend.,
Say the command “Kiss!” You should time this so that the cat is “kissing” (licking) your friend’s face at the same time that you give the “kiss” command.,
Repeat this process a number of times.",How to Teach Your Cat to Kiss1," This method works best if your cat has an appetite when you begin training. Your cat should be hungry, but not starving, during this training session.


To accomplish this, train your cat during its typical meal time.
You should never starve or withhold food from your cat.;
, Your cat should also be in the same room, and attentive to your friend. This method will not work if your cat is too far away, in another room, or ignoring you or your friend.


Try playing with your cat (using a cat toy or yarn) while your friend sits down on the floor a few feet away.

, You do not need to apply a large amount of food. Just dip your finger into a jar of wet cat food and smear a little on your friend’s cheek.If you prefer not to put cat food on your face, you can also use cream cheese.
Make sure your cat is aware of the food nearby. You could even hold the cat near your friend, so the cat knows there is food present.
Put the can of food away, so your cat will not be tempted to eat that instead.

, This should be a natural response for the cat. If the cat is hungry, it will attempt to eat the nearby food. It will remember the food and head straight to your friend’s cheek and start licking!

, After you say the word “kiss,” while your cat is still licking your friend’s face, give your cat another treat, praise it verbally, and pet its fur.


Your cat will come to associate your praise with following the “kiss” command.

, Gradually reduce the amount of food you apply on your friend’s cheek, but continue to say the word “kiss” while your cat licks the food from your friend’s cheek.


Eventually, the cat will start responding to the command and kiss without the treat."

Acquire everything listed below in the ""Things you'll need"" section.,
Begin with your cat on the floor, hoop in one hand (at this stage the hoop should be touching floor and always vertical) touching the floor, treat visible in the other.,
Hold the hoop between your cat and the hand with the treat in it.,
Repeat this step until your cats has it down.

,
Raise the hoop about an inch or two.,
Keep raising the hoop and continue to make it more challenging.,
Your cat should now expect a treat every time s/he goes through.",How to Train a Cat to Jump Through a Hoop1,";
, This is the starting position.

, The cat should go for the treat. If the cat tries to go around the hoop, block them with the hoop so that they go through the hoop. If they don't go through, don't give them a treat.


If they need help figuring it out, go back to the starting position and draw the hand with the the treat in it through the hoop. If they still can't figure it out, put the treat hand through the hoop until it is just in front of the cats face. When the cat makes a move for the treat, pull it away slowly until the cat follows through the hoop. Give the cat the treat.

,, Repeat until the cat gets pretty good at it.

, If the cat goes under the hoop, do not give him/her the treat.

, Now start to wean him/her of this. Remember Pavlov? Give the cat treats enough times that they will continue to see the benefits of jumping, but not so little that they won't jump at all.

Recognize your cat’s affection.,
Look at your cat’s ears and muzzle.,
Build up trust with your cat.,
Slowly blink at your cat while making eye contact.",How to Teach Your Cat to Kiss2," Cats do not physically “kiss” one another with their mouths to show affection, as people do. Rather, cats show love and affection through facial movements. Specifically, your cat will look at you and slowly blink its eyes.A slow, heavy-lidded eye blink and is roughly the cat equivalent of a “kiss.”

, When your cat gives you an affectionate slow-blink, its muzzle will be relaxed, and its ears will be in a normal upright posture. The blink itself will be slow and heavy-lidded.If your cat’s teeth are revealed in a snarl, or its ears are flattened, these are signs of fear and hostility. Any eye blinks will not be affectionate.Cats can also use narrowed eyes to show that they feel threatened. This is not the same as a blinking “kiss.” When your cat narrows its eyes, it will tightly fold its ears back and pull its lips up in a snarl.

, Before your cat shows you affection, you’ll need to establish trust and show it that you are not a threat. Give your cat space in your home, and let its move around freely. Treat the cat gently, and let it come to you for pets.


Before you have established trust with your cat, avoid making sudden movements around it, as these could be perceived as threatening. Even if you’re just trying to pet the cat, she could perceive a quickly raised hand as an attack signal.For the same reason, avoid embracing your cat before you’ve established trust. A quick embrace could also be seen as a threatening gesture.

, While you cannot technically “train” your cat to show you facial affection, you can show them the same affection, which will make them more likely to return the “kiss.”Think of it like this:


Relax your facial muscles and look towards your cat.
Once your cat returns your gaze, briefly hold eye contact.
Slowly blink your eyes, with eye contact before and after the blink.

Reach out with a closed hand.,
Touch your cat gently with your closed fist.,
Cuddle your cat after closed-fist contact.,
Allow your cat to bunt you.,
Return your cat’s bunt.",How to Teach Your Cat to Kiss3," To humans, a hand closed into a fist is a gesture of hostility and aggression, while an open hand indicates friendship and trust. To your cat, these gestures mean the opposite.Moving towards your cat with an open, extended hand may alarm or frighten it, as she will associate this gesture with an aggressive attack.

, Although this seems counterintuitive, it will establish affection between you and your cat.If you reach out with an open hand, your cat may think you are trying to grab at it or strike it.


To reassure your cat, brush your closed fist against it. Once it accepts the physical contact, you can start petting the cat as you normally would.

, Reaching out with a fist will signal to your cat that you do not mean to harm it, but you should continue to treat your cat gently and affectionately after you have reached out to touch it.If you cuddle with your cat—let it sit on or near you, or lay in your lap and sleep—you’ll communicate that you can be trusted.
If your cat had any initial misgivings as to whether or not you meant it harm, cuddling and petting your cat will reassure the animal that you mean well and will not harm it.

, Bunting (a cat’s behavior when it rubs or butts its head against you) is also a sign of affection.Bunting marks you with your cat’s scent, and also expresses its happiness and trust in you.


Bunting can also show that your cat considers you a “safe” person to be around and indicates that it trusts you.Like slowly blinking, this is not a behavior you can train your cat to perform.
Your cat will spontaneously bunt you once you have developed its trust.

, Although this may seem silly at first, returning you cat’s bunt will indicate to the animal that you understand its significance and feel affection towards your cat as well.Tap and rub your cat lightly with your forehead or cheek, but remember to be gentle!


If you are playing with your cat, you can get down on your hands and knees so it can bunt your head directly.
Bunting can also be an attention-seeking gesture. If your cat wants you to pet or play with it, it will bunt you to playfully get your attention."

Choose a door that is realistic.,
Tap your fingers on the door.,
Crawl your hand up the door.,
Praise your cat whenever she stands against the door.

,
Place your cat's paw on the door handle.,
Reward your cat when she finally cottons on and does it properly.",How to Teach a Cat to Open a Door," The latch or handle must be easy to move and the door lightweight. Most door handles or catches are likely to be difficult, so you might need to consider rigging up a different solution before training.


The door should be slow to close after she leaves; you don't want the door banging shut with your cat squeezed between it.;
, Do this to show the cat what you'd like her to be interested in. Have a treat in your hand to encourage her.

, Make some interesting movement that your cat will want to follow. If she comes over to check out what you're doing, reward her with a stroke or a treat.

,, With her paw still in place, pull the latch or handle down to show the motion of pulling the paw down.


Do not rush this step. If she squirms, seems uninterested or gets annoyed, let it go and try again later.
Repetition is key. She needs to see the result of pushing or pulling on the door latch or handle quite a few times.

, Keep praising your cat when she does it right.

Put the litter in the box.,
Make sure the clips hold the top and bottom closely together.,
When the litter has been ""claimed"" by the resident cat, roll the litter box onto the right side.,
Roll the litter box right side up.,
Pull out the drawer, which should now be full of...well, you know.",How to Use the Omega Paw Litter Box," Make sure it doesn't go above the grating. Use clumping litter.;
, The clip from the top needs to go through the hole on the bottom, and then the clip must be pushed so that it locks into place. If all the clips aren't secure, you'll have a very messy ordeal with this litter box.

, Continue until all the un-clumped litter should slide through the grating and then until the box is upside down.


Sometimes the clumped litter and all its lovely components can stick to the bottom of the box and refuse to drop when you turn it upside-down. You might feel the urge to tap or smack the bottom of the box to get it to come loose. This will work, but it can also loosen the seal between the top and bottom of the box, causing litter to leak out next time you roll it over. It's better to apply pressure by pressing down on the bottom of the box while it's upside-down; usually this is enough to dislodge clumps.

, Continue to tilt the box a little to the left so all the litter comes back through the grating and into the ""bathroom"" area. Then put the litter box right side up again.

,


If the drawer is particularly full, wiggle it back and forth a little before pulling it out. This will even out the contents so they don't get caught on the top of the slot as you pull the drawer out.

Introduce your puppy’s scent into your home.,
Choose a peaceful time for the first meeting.,
Confine the puppy to a particular area for a bit.,
Put the puppy on a lead.,
Don’t force contact.,
Invite a dog training professional into your home.",How to Get a Cat Used to a New Puppy1," Take a few toys or blankets that have been touched by the puppy and place them throughout your house. You can also wipe down your couch or other furniture with a towel that you used to rub on the puppy. Animals communicate through scent and this will provide an introduction before the two even meet.Whenever the puppy moves in you can continue this process by placing scented towels, from both animals, in the food or play areas of the other one. This will not generally trigger territorial impulses but will increase familiarity instead.;
, Don't try to introduce them when friends or many people are around. Avoid times when you are stressed, such as right after you come home from work. Animals can sense your stress and they can also behave differently due to stress as well. When you finally bring the puppy into your house make sure that you haven’t recently moved or undergone any other major life change too., Place your new puppy in a separate room or living space (blocked off by baby gates) for a few days. Put their kennel and food/drink in the same place. This will allow your cat to get to know the new arrival without the stress of meeting face-to-face. Observe the reactions of both animals to gauge how a final introduction might go.Even after the two have met, it is a good idea to observe all interactions closely. Your puppy, depending on its size, may be able to injure your cat without even meaning to do so., When you take your puppy out of its designated space, go ahead and put a halter or lead on it. This will allow you to control the movement of the puppy, thus ensuring your cat’s safety. It is also okay to put your cat on a leash if you feel that this will add to their safety.It is important to prevent the puppy from chasing the cat because if the puppy is allowed to do it once, then he will want to do it again. Try distracting the puppy with one of his favorite toys and praise him for ignoring the cat.
With an older dog, you can also give them the ""sit"" command and then do some obedience training while the cat is at a distance. This will teach your dog to pay attention to you rather than the cat.

, As the home’s first resident, it is best to let your cat decide when, and how, to approach your new puppy. It is not a good idea to hold or dangle your cat near to your dog, as this may prompt your cat to strike out in fear. This also sets a stage for future interactions dominated by fear instead of positive feelings and curiosity., If your cat is particularly nervous about newcomers, or if you are simply worried about the process, it may be a good idea to contact a dog trainer in your area who can facilitate the introduction process. Talk with your vet to get a good reference.Before the trainer arrives take a moment to write down your primary concerns. Are you worried that the two animals will harm one another? Are you concerned about your cat’s emotional well-being?

Ask a friend or relative to stay at your house.,
See if someone can check in on your cat.,
Leave your cat at a friend or relative's house.",How to Get a Cat Sitter when You Leave Town1," Many people feel the most comfortable asking a trusted and responsible friend, relative, or neighbour to look after their cat while on vacation. The best option is to find someone who can stay at your house with your cat. This way your cat will be able to remain in a comfortable environment and will have company throughout the day.It is best to choose someone how knows your cat and has experience with companion animals.;
, If you are unable to find someone who can stay overnight with your cat, you could ask someone to check in on your cat while you are away. Ask someone who lives close by, such as a neighbour or friend. They should spend at least 30 minutes each day at your house. During this time they will feed the cat, check the litter box, and interact with the cat., Friends or relatives may be willing to watch your cat while you are away, but only if they can do so at their own home. This is often called in-home boarding. Make sure your friend or relative creates a safe environment for your cat and is able to regularly feed and play with the cat.You may want to visit your friend or relative's house with your cat prior to your trip. This way, your cat can get accustomed to the space.

Move your cat’s food to a protected location.,
Move your cat’s litter pan to a protected location.,
Provide high-rise hideaways for your cat.,
Install baby gates.,
Consider crating the puppy.",How to Get a Cat Used to a New Puppy2," Puppies and dogs love to eat cat food. However, cat food is so protein-rich that it often causes serious digestive issues for dogs. Take your cat’s food and water bowls are relocate them to an area where the puppy will not be able to access or reach. Perhaps move them to a countertop. Or, to a separate cat-only room.This will also make your cat feel less vulnerable as it eats. A bouncy puppy pouncing on them can be so stressful that some cats will forgo eating entirely, causing a whole other set of problems.
It is also a good idea to keep your cat away from your new puppy when it is eating as well. Your puppy could lash out in a bout of food protectiveness and potentially injure your cat., Puppies and dogs also love to eat cat feces, oddly (and grossly) enough. Get a box with a closing too small for your puppy to enter or one with a cat flap. You could also put the box in a cat-only room or use baby gates to create a barrier around the box area.Your cat is very vulnerable when using their box. If they feel unsafe, they might start using the restroom elsewhere out of a feeling of self-preservation. Once this outside marking starts, it is very difficult to stop.

, Most cats are climbers or hiders. Take a look at your home and make sure that there are ample spots for your cat to escape from the puppy, if desired. You can place bookcases in an accessible way. You can also clear a path to window sills and counters. Some pet stores even sell specialty cat climbers that you can install on your walls.Make sure that each room has at least one high-rise escape route for your cat. This will help to prevent a direct confrontation.

, Your puppy does not need to have the full run of your home. You can put baby gates in certain doorways or hallways in order to limit your puppy’s access. Your cat will then learn which areas are protected and which are open access. If your cat cannot jump over these barriers, then you will want to use them more sparingly., Putting your puppy in a crate for short periods of time can actually be a good thing for your puppy, you, and your cat. It teaches the puppy control. It gives you a break. And, it gives your cat a puppy-free period of time, as it used to be. Place your puppy in the crate and then issue the “Quiet” command.Don’t let your cat pester your puppy while it is in the crate. This will keep your puppy agitated and will make the crate seem more like a punishment then a training tool.

Share your attention.,
Enroll your puppy in obedience classes.,
Recognize your cat’s stress behaviors.,
Individualize the problems that you see.,
Talk to your veterinarian.",How to Get a Cat Used to a New Puppy3," Relationships take time to form and this situation is no different. Don’t expect your cat to instantly love your puppy or vice versa. Instead, try to get them to get along first in a safe manner and then keep your fingers crossed for something more to develop., Your cat will expect the same treatment that it experienced before, so make sure to keep up the cuddling and treating. Make sure that both your puppy and cat have sufficient toys to play with. And, watch to make sure that toy stealing is minimized. As your cat and puppy behave nicely, make sure to praise them by offering treats and saying, “good job!”Get all of your family members involved. Everyone can help to make sure that both your cat and dog are healthy and happy with one another., Search for a class in your area by typing your city’s name and “puppy obedience courses” into a search engine. Then, take your puppy on a regular basis. They will learn a variety of useful commands, such as “leave it.” These commands can be used if they get out of control when around your cat. This is also a great way to expend a puppy’s natural energy., Keep a close eye on your cat during the first few weeks of puppy cohabitation. Your cat may appear fine on the surface, but could be subtly indicating that they are stressed. Watch to see if your cat is marking the furniture (by scratching or spraying). They may also be using the restroom in hidden places, like the corners of your closet. Your cat may also show more obvious stress by hissing or arching its back.Another warning sign is a lack of grooming. If your cat stops grooming itself, this could mean that it doesn't feel safe doing so with the puppy around. Make sure to give your cat a safe space to tend to these needs.

, Try to adopt an attentive, not a dismissive, attitude. You may see that your cat is only aggressive when the puppy enters a certain room or approaches a particular family member. Or, you may notice that your puppy is only snippy when your cat tries to steal a certain toy. Tailor your responses according to the particular issues that you see., As you bring both your puppy and cat in for their annual visits, discuss with your vet how the animals are getting along. Ask any questions that you have and try to get as much advice as you can.


For example, you might say, “How can I keep the puppy from tearing up all of my cat’s toys?”

Keep trying this for a week.,
Be present at all times when the cat and bird are together.",How to Train a Bird and a Cat to Live Together,";
,,, If the cat jumps up to the cage and tries to attack the bird, spray water at the cat. If the cat just looks up or does nothing, do not do anything.


Since cats dislike water, they will realize that they will get ""punished"" if they try to attack.
Do not pull your cat away when/if they attack. The bird will not get hurt, and the cat needs to stay there in order to learn.
Even if the cat doesn't do anything, still keep your guard up.

, Be patient, as this may take anywhere from 2 minutes to even 30 minutes. It all depends on what your cat does.


Refill the spray bottle if you have to, but still keep an eye on the two.

, This step needs two people: one to hold the cat and one to bring the bird.

, If the cat tries to attack once the bird arrives, spray him/her with water and press the stop button on the leash.


Make sure the bird does not fly: try calming the bird and holding it's feet.

,, Then release the cat without a leash in front of the bird.


Remember, if the cat lunges, go back to keeping him/her on a leash.
Never leave the two together unsupervised.

, With the training and your reassurance that the cat won't attack, they should be fine together.


The full course of the training process should take about a week and a half.

Kneel or sit at the cat's level.,
Extend your finger or hand.,
Respect the cat's limits.,
Pet it under its chin.,
Focus on the back of its ears.,
Pet its back.,
Avoid petting the tail.,
Use treats to draw its attention.,
Toss a toy for it to chase or pounce on.,
Give it a gift.",How to Get Someone Else's Cat to Like You," When trying to get to know someone else's cat, do not approach it. To appear as less of a threat, kneel or sit at the cat's level. Stay relatively still and avoid any jarring movements., While kneeling or sitting, slowly extend your finger or hand towards the cat, making sure that you are a safe enough distance from it that your gesture will not seem threatening. Leave your hand extended and wait for the cat to approach on its own., If the cat does not warm up to you, back off from it and leave it alone. Make sure that the cat understands that it has control of the situation. Pushing an unwanted interaction can result in negative behaviour such as:Scratching
Hissing
Running away
Swatting

, Once someone else's cat is comfortable around you and demonstrates signs of affection (e.g. rubbing up against your leg), try petting it gently. A good place to start is under its chin, which most cats love. Let the cat sniff your finger and move its head upwards to allow you to pet it.Gently rub the spot where the jawbone connects to the skull. This should elicit a purring noise from the cat, if it enjoys it.

, Pet and scratch the cat at the base of its ears, which it is guaranteed to enjoy. Cats like being petted on areas where their scent glands are secreted so that it feels like they are marking you while you pet them. Cats are inclined to spread their scent to make their surroundings more familiar to them.This is the same aim that cats have in mind when they bump you with their heads or rub up against you.

, A back rub for a cat can feel just as good and beneficial as it does to humans. Pet down the cat's back generously, being gentle and cautious. Watch and listen for signs that the cat is enjoying the massage (e.g. purring)., Cats tend to be sensitive about their tails, which are an important part of their anatomy. Petting a cat's tail could result in it lashing out defensively (e.g. scratching, clawing). Avoid touching, petting, or grabbing a cat's tail, particularly when you are trying to win its trust. , As simple as it seems, food is an excellent way to win the favor of someone else's cat. If the cat is apprehensive around you, place a treat close to you, but far enough away that it will eat it without feeling threatened. Ignore the cat while it eats the treat, and continue this process over your next few visits with the cat., To get someone else's cat to warm up to you, initiate a game with it. Toss a toy for the cat to chase, making sure that you throw it away from the cat as well as away from you. The neutral, non-threatening nature of this gesture and the curious nature of cats will make the cat likely to participate., To get positive attention from a cat, bring it a gift it will enjoy. Visit your local pet store and purchase a deluxe toy such as a puzzle feeder, which you or its owner can fill with treats that the cat will slowly draw out (usually over the course of several hours). Introduce the toy to the cat and watch it have fun with your gift."

Don't declaw the cat.,
Make sure your animals get breaks from each other.",How to Teach Cats to Like Dogs," If the cat is new to the home, the cat should remain in a safe space in your house at all times, like a spare bedroom. Keep everything the cat needs in that space: food, water, and litter. Unless it chooses to leave that space, let the cat get comfortable with a small area before allowing it to roam.


Make sure your cat has easy access to litter. Ideally, litter-boxes should be in multiple locations in the house. The fewer litter-boxes and fewer the locations, the higher the chance of an issue.
If the dog is new to the home, begin crate training. Do not keep the dog outside. Being new to a home is stressful for a dog just as it is for a cat to have a new doggie roommate. Dogs are highly social and should be kept inside, especially during this critical bonding time. Just like cats need to learn positive associations with the new dog, the dog needs to learn positive associations (and positive habits!) in its new home. Leaving it outside is asking to have a wound up, stressed out dog that develops anxiety (separation anxiety, barrier frustration, you name it) and takes it out by jumping the fence or digging up the yard.
Make sure the cat has a safe place to escape, which the dog cannot access. Cats love tall perches.;
, Both cats and dogs have a developed sense of smell, and it's much safer to introduce both animals to the scent of the other for a while, before letting them be in the room together. This is a critical step in letting the animals get familiar with each other.Take a blanket, sleeping pad, or chew toy that your dog has used, and put it in the cat's area. Take the cat's blanket and let the dog spend some time with it.

, Be wary of the term ""aggressive."" Most people think of this as growling, biting, etc. However in a dog/cat predator/prey interaction, what you really want to avoid is arousal, the stages before aggression. This means you want to avoid having the dog get over excited or over interested. Obsessing over the cat, chasing the cat, stalking the cat, herding the cat, overenthusiastic play with the cat... Those behaviors can look totally adorable and like the dog just loves the cat but that is when you want to call your dog away from the cat and reward with treats. You want to encourage the dog to feel indifferent about the cat, not ""unaggressive.""

, Walk your dog by your cat's safe room regularly and associate the smell from the blanket with the cat's area. Slowly build up to a more substantial interaction. First with the door closed, then with a baby gate or other room divider, and keep the dog on leash while you do it.


Merely walking by with your dog will be intense for your cat. Calm the dog down as quickly as possible, if it reacts excitedly or aggressively. Make the dog sit and reward it for good behavior.
Don't put your cat in a crate and allow your dog to sniff around it. Your cat will feel trapped and will associate your dog with fear., After the pets can reliably see one another without reacting excitedly or aggressively, let them be together in the same room. The dog should be on leash and if it is not showing interest in the cat then let it drag its leash. This might be nerve-wracking, but try to be quiet and calm. Your attitude will affect the animals.Try not to let the dog to rush up to the cat and smell. Instead, call your dog away from the cat and reward with treats and praise. If your dog will not stop staring at your cat and pulling away, increase your distance until you can distract your dog.
Similarly, reward your cat when the dog is near. This is easier with two people. Try to have someone to ""guard"" the cat while someone else ""guards"" the dog.

, Even animals that are getting along well can start to antagonize each other. Before it gets to that, end the interaction by moving the animals to other rooms, and treating both of them.


If your animals are content to be in the same room and ignore each other, you can stop separating them.

, Socializing a dog and cat should take several weeks, and may take longer. Keep the pets moving forward and get them familiar with each other. Each stage should take a few days, at least. Pay attention to your pets and read their body language to see how they react and go according to their cues., Whenever the cat sees, smells, hears, or otherwise interacts with the dog, both animals should be rewarded with treats, pets, toys, or whatever is pleasing to that cat. You want to make sure the cat is comfortable and never forced into meeting or getting near the dog.


Do not scream and yell at your dog for being excited. This will only make it worse. Remain calm and increase your distance. As soon as your dog starts to calm down and disengages with the cat (try having her do a familiar trick like ""sit"" or ""watch"") give her a reward like a treat.
Don't scold your cat for swatting at your dog. This is a normal way for a cat to establish boundaries with your dog and will typically do no damage to your dog. It is a warning swat.

, Cats like to be high up, where they can feel safe and survey their surroundings. It's a good idea to provide your cats a cat tree or otherwise clear off the top of a bookshelf or other area and make it easily accessible to the cat. This can be a great way to let your pets be in the room together, so both of them can feel safe.

, Your goal is to have your cat associate your dog's presence with positive rewards and to have your dog associate disengaging with your cat with positive rewards.If your cat is forced to be around your dog you may create a negative association that is irreversible or may take years to correct.


Those commercials where the cats and the dogs snuggle? Those kinds of relationships are super-rare between pets, even though they're insanely cute. The best you can hope for is that your pets mostly ignore each other, and can tolerate the presence of one another. If you've done that, you've done extremely well.

, If your pets aren't used to each other yet, don't let them have access to each other when you're not there. A dog's prey-drive can be triggered and sadly dogs who were getting along for months with their new kitty friend have been known to kill the cat.


Even if your dog is doing a good job of leaving your cat alone when you call, be wary about dropping the leash and for several weeks allow the dog to drag the leash around the house so that you can quickly pull her away if needed.

, By taking away your cat's natural defenses, you will cause them to potentially be more aggressive because they are aware they are missing their number one tool to protect themselves. Also, you increase chances of excessive biting and litterbox issues.


Your dog will be fine. Cats are almost never the aggressors. When cats swat at dogs, it's either a sign of play or a warning swat.

, Even if everything is going well, ensure they both have time apart. Spend an equal amount of time with both animals, showing them affection. Use positive reinforcement and keep your animals happy.

Play with younger cats to build their confidence.,
Use food to gain the cat's trust.,
Familiarize yourself with the development of newborn kittens.,
Understand the importance of the socialization period.,
Be aware of how short the socialization period is.",How to Socialize Your Kitten," Before this age, the mother may become distressed if you touch her vulnerable kittens. However, once the kittens' eyes and ears open any they are ready to start discovering their world, she becomes less protective in order to let this happen.;
, If the mother shows signs of unease (such as growling or snatching the kitten back) when you try to handle a kitten, distract her with some food.


As you do this, speak to her in a quiet and reassuring manner. Sit close to her so that the kitten is not removed from her sight, hearing, or scent. This will help to reassure her.
If she wishes, let her touch noses with the kitten as this will reassure her that everything is okay.

, Kittens aged 2 to 4 weeks are weak and wobbly on their legs. At this age it is sufficient to hold the kitten securely in your hands and just stroke her and talk to her. Alternatively, you can place the kitten on your knee while you stroke her.


At this early stage, you are familiarizing the kitten with your smell and the sound of your voice, at at time when her vision is still developing.

, From 4 weeks onwards the kittens are more mobile and start to learn hunting and pouncing behavior, so you may well have to find the kitten, before you can play!


At the start of each session stroke and fuss the kitten, but she will quickly get bored of this, so switch to playing with a toy on a string, or rolling a ball.

, A study compared how friendly kittens were when handled for different lengths of time. It concluded that 15 minutes a day is the minimum amount of time necessary to socialize the kittens.


However, kittens that were held for up to 40 minutes each day produced the most confident, happy, and sociable kittens.
Presumably over 40 minutes a day spent handling the kittens would produce even happier kittens!

, The kitten needs to meet and experience people of all ages, appearance, and gender, in order to become fully confident in all circumstances and be properly socialized.


Luckily, it's usually not too difficult to convince people to spend some time playing with kittens!

, This might include things such as letting her play in the cat carrier, hearing the vacuum cleaner, and experiencing a hair dryer. This will teach her not to be frightened when she hears to sees these things in future.

, The golden rule of socialization, no matter what the animal's age, is pleasure not punishment. Always speak quietly and softly. Never make sudden movements and use reward, not punishment.


If the cat scratches or bites, never shout at her. Simply withdraw the hand and do a mock ""hiss"" at her, such as her mother would do.
Never shout at a cat. This teaches her to run away from you. Instead, ignore bad behavior and reward the good with a fuss, play, or a treat.

, It is worth remembering that orphan kittens also need to be socialized with other cats, because in this circumstance they believe you are mom and think that other cats are weird.


Socializing an orphaned kitten with another cat can be easier said than done because it means finding another cat (who is healthy and vaccinated) who is happy to spend time with the kitten. Since many cats are solitary creatures, finding such an amenable companion can be tricky.
Therefore, you need to bear in mind that when hand-rearing an orphan who isn't exposed to other cats, she may act aggressively as an adult when she encounters another cat., Scans of kitten brains show that those handled regularly between 2 and 7 weeks of age, develop larger brains with more neuronal connections. Thus, socialization has a real and physical effect on the brain's development. Sadly, after 7 weeks this ""brain building"" effect is lost.


This means that it is an uphill struggle to socialize an older kitten, or indeed an adult cat. It is not an impossible task, but to a large extent it depends on the cat's genetic makeup and whether she is programmed to have a friendly disposition or to be fearful. Even fully feral cats may be friendly, because it is in their nature to be so, just as some feral cats are programmed to be highly aggressive.
This is a case of ""nurture vs nature"" because just as different people have different personalities, so cats have different character traits (affectionate, alpha male, submissive) which are independent of their breed, but are ameliorated by proper socialization.

, Socialization in a cat who has not been exposed to people is one thing, but if a cat or kitten has been abused, then they have been actively taught to fear people. This has serious implications with regards to the cat ever learning to trust people.


The rules of engagement with a cat that has been abused are that everything is on their terms. You cannot force a cat to trust you, but only by persistent patience and consistent actions, show her that you are no threat.
Eventually, over the years, the cat may accept your presence, but only if you are luck. Activities like feeding the cat, avoiding eye contact, and talking in a calm manner are key to building bridges.

, If the kitten had some social contact with people in early life, then it is possible to work on that exposure. Be patient. Try to entice the cat with play. Young cats are geared to perfecting their hunting skills and this persists up to around 6 months of age.


Lie down on the floor so you pose less of an intimidating threat to the cat. Use a toy on a string, and encourage the cat to chase the toy, and hence become used to your presence.
She then starts to associate play with people, which helps build her confidence.

, Some cats are highly food motivated and this helps to encourage bold behavior by laying a trail of treats leading towards you.


Lie still while the cat approaches. Avoid looking at the cat since direct eye contact implies you want to dominate the cat. As the cat gathers confidence, hold a treat out on your flat palm.
Once the cat accepts treats, try giving her a gentle stroke, before offering the next treat so that she associates physical contact with a reward.

, For the first 10-14 days of life, kittens are blind and deaf and spend their time in the nest being looked after by the queen (the female mother cat).


From 10 days onward their eyes and ears start to open, and they start to take notice of the world around them. They now have a steep learning curve ahead where they go from dependency on the mother, to catching their own food (if feral!)
To learn how to pounce, stalk, and hunt, as well as other vital skills such as how to get along with other cats and keep themselves clean, the kitten's brain is hugely receptive from a very young age. It is this ability to learn from observation that human's can take advantage of to get a kitten used to people.
Unfortunately, this high intensity learning period or ""socialization period"" is relatively short in the cat, lasting from just 2-7 weeks of age.

, To understand the socialization period, think of the kitten's mind like a sponge. Between 2-7 weeks of age the kitten soaks up all the sights, sounds, and smells she encounters and logs them away as normal. But after 7 weeks of age the sponge is saturated and finds it difficult to absorb any more and the learning process slows down.


More importantly, by 7 weeks the sponge has learnt to ""expand"". If the sponge hasn't expanded by the age of 7 weeks, it now has the absorbency of a rock and refuses to take on board new experiences.
Thus, the pattern set in early life will be mirrored in adult life. A kitten who learned to play with people will be confident around them. But a kitten who didn't meet people and was never socialized is likely to remain fearful and withdrawn., One study conducted on the socialization of kittens showed just how short the socialization period is. The study divided kittens into groups by age, and had volunteers handle them.Kittens whose handling experiences started after 7 weeks of age, behaved like feral kittens, hissing, spitting, and keeping their distance.
Those handled before they were 7 weeks old that were friendly and confident. These kittens exhibited behavior such as greeting people with head bumps, flanks rubs, chirps and purrs.
Therefore, getting to your kitten before 7 weeks of age can make a huge difference in the success of the socialization process.

Prepare for the introduction.,
Go slow.,
Alternate the rooms you keep the animals in.,
Let the cat and dog smell each other under the door dividing them.This will help them associate the new smells they are smelling with a specific animal, even if they can't actually see it.,
Wait to introduce your cat and dog until the cat seems relaxed and ready.If the cat is frightened and runs and hides whenever the dog gets near the door to their room, you need to give the cat more time.,
Hold your cat in your arms until it is calm and relaxed.,
Show your pets equal amounts of love as you introduce them to each other.,
Separate your pets once again.,
Continue to have your dog and cat interact until they are relaxed in each other's presence.,
Separate your pets when you are not home or with them.,
Redirect negative behaviors that your dog directs at your cat.,
Reward and praise your dog for good behavior around the cat.,
Provide your cat with a place where it can always get out of reach of your dog.,
Have realistic expectations.",How to Make a Cat and Dog Get Along," Whether you are bringing a new cat or dog into a home that already has a cat or dog or you are trying to make your existing pets get along better, you need to create a good foundation to build on. To begin with, make sure that your home has ample space for the two pets to have some space away from each other. You will need to keep the pets separated for several days, so multiple rooms in your home are necessary.


Also, make sure that the dog will follow your commands. You will want to refresh it's obedience training if it does not heed your directions well.Don't let the first encounter your cat has with your dog be a bad one because of an overzealous and aggressive pup.
If you are introducing a new dog to your home or you have a young puppy that doesn't know it's commands yet, then you need to be more cautious when introducing it to a cat.;
, Do NOT just let your dog chase your cat around. Keep the pets separate at first, waiting 3 or 4 days before actually introducing the animals face to face.Animals need time to get to know each other's smells and to get to know new homes before they can deal with getting to know another animal.


Cats and dogs are much more likely to fight or be unhappy if you try to force them together suddenly. Keep them in separate rooms and out of sight of one another until they are both calm.
Begin mixing the animals smells by stroking the cat then stroking the dog and vice versa (with pets in separate rooms).

, This is so they can sniff where each other has been without the other animal being present. Smells are a very important way that animals get to know each other. Let your animals get to know the other's smell before they actually get to know them face to face.


Try rubbing a towel on your dog and then putting the towel under your cat's bowl. This will help your cat get used to the dogs smell and accept it.

,


Try feeding the cat and dog on separate sides of the same door.This will force them to adjust to the smell of the other animal.

, When the cat is adjusted to the smell and sounds of the dog, it may be time to let them see each other.

, Then ask a family member or friend to slowly bring your dog on a leash into the room. Gradually bring the dog closer in small steps, waiting for your cat and dog to both settle down as each step of the way before getting closer. Do not let the animals make physical contact with each other, just get them used to the presence of the other.


Be sure to hold the cat only if it is happy to be held.
Wear long sleeves to protect your arms from scratches.
Another option is to have the cat in a crate while you bring the dog in on a leash.This will guarantee that there is not physical contact between them when they first meet.

, Animals, like people, get jealous when 'the new kid' gets more attention than them. Show both of your pets that they are loved by you and that the other animal is not feared by you.

, Don't force them to interact for too long, this will just exhaust them, which can lead to conflict. Make sure the first meeting is a good one by keeping it brief and pleasant.


Gradually increase the lengths of these sessions., Once the cat seems comfortable enough, keep the dog on leash but let the cat go loose in the room.After several weeks of this, your dog should be trained not to go after the cat, as so you can let the dog off the leash as well.


You can also use pheromones, available through your veterinarian, to help both animals stay calm and relaxed. Ask your veterinarian if he or she thinks that the use of synthetic hormones could help your pets during their adjustment period.

, You should do this for quite awhile, so that your cat and dog do not injure each other.

, This includes rough play and barking.Give your pup another activity or do some obedience training with it instead of letting it focus on the cat.


Try to avoid scolding your dog in this circumstance. Keep the situation positive and your dog is more likely to have positive associations with the cat in the future., This can include friendly behavior or simply ignoring the cat. Make it so that when the cat comes into the room it's enjoyable for your dog to treat the cat well, not to be aggressive or to attentive to it.


Say, ""Oh, look, Puppy, Kitty's here! Yay!"" and sound very happy. Then give the dog a small training treat. Your dog will soon learn to associate pleasant feelings with the cat.

, This can include a cat tree or a baby gate across a doorway, whatever allows your cat to escape. Cats will generally attack a dog only when backed into a corner with no way to avoid the dog.

, If your dog or your cat has never lived with another animal before, it will not immediately know how to deal with the situation. In addition, you will not know until they are introduced whether your dog will see the cat as play, prey, or a curiosity and you will not know whether your cat will see your dog as a curiosity or a threat.Understanding that you may have a long period of acclimation between the two will help you to persevere with the process of making them get along.

Desex your cats.,
Introduce new cats slowly.,
Sidetrack the cats from their aggression.,
Use pheromones.",How to Referee Two Irritable Cats That Don't Get Along1," This is especially important to control the behavior of male cats. Neutered male cats tend to have less problems with aggression and spraying, which is a sign of being territorial.Desexing your cats will not always solve the problem. However, without the hormones that cause the sex drive, castrated male cats are less likely to get in conflict with other males and harass females.;
, Adding a new cat to your home can lead to conflict. You need to make introductions very slowly, isolating the new cat away from existing cats for several weeks. Let the cats smell each other under a door but don't let them see each other right away.Once the cats are used to the smell of each other, then you can let them see each other. Gradually let them spend more and more time with each other, but don't leave them alone together until you are certain they get along.

, If the aggression between your cats is relatively mild, you may be able to sidetrack them from fighting. Try putting a bit of tuna fish juice on the coat of one of the cats where she cannot clean it off herself. Your other cat may be lured in by the desire to taste the tuna and to clean the other cat's coat., There are special pheromones that can be used to ease aggressive behavior in cats. These pheromones, airborne chemicals signals, reduce stress and anxiety, which in turn reduces aggression.Pheromones created to ease problem behavior in cats can be found in most pet stores or online.
Pheromones for cats can be given in several ways. There are sprays, diffusers, and collars that expose the cat to the chemicals.

Stop fights before they start.,
Interrupt aggressive behavior.,
Provide plenty of resources.,
Reward good behavior.,
Contact an expert.",How to Referee Two Irritable Cats That Don't Get Along2," Keep a spray bottle full of water at arm's reach. When one cat starts intimidating the other, just aim and spray several times. It may take a few sprays but eventually the intimidator should get the message and scram.


Your aggressive cat should learn that when you raise the bottle it is going to get sprayed. Eventually you should just have to do this to stop the behavior but that depends on you actually spraying the offending cat quite a few times.
""However, be aware the cat may associate the deterrent with you and not the other cat. At best, it might mean the cats behave when you're there but fight when you're gone. At worst, it could make the cat wary of you.

, Your cats will not work their problems out through fighting. In fact, letting them fight may make their relationship even worse. If your cats are fighting, stop them by making a loud noise of some sort, basically scaring them. Try to clap really loud or slam a door, anything that will catch them off guard.


Don't try to get in the middle of a cat fight. You may get scratched or bitten in the process.

, Make sure each cat has his own food and water bowls, litter box, and safe hiding places. Competition for resources increases tension and can lead to fighting.

, If your cats are getting along, you should reinforce that behavior. Give them each a treat and a little affection, if they like that kind of thing. Make sure they both know that they get better treats and more affection if they get along, rather than if they are irritable and fight., An animal behaviorist or other expert may be able to find techniques to reduce feline aggression. You can also talk to your vet about techniques you can try, as well as ask for suggestions about behaviorists to contact.

Keep new mothers and kittens away from other cats.,
Separate and then slowly reintroduce the cats.Some conflicts are short-lived.,
Separate the cats permanently.,
Consider rehoming one of your cats.",How to Referee Two Irritable Cats That Don't Get Along3," A new mother can be very protective of her babies and other cats around may stress her out. The safety of her babies is very important and she may fight to keep other cats from interacting with them.Once the kittens are weaned, the mother should calm down. Slowly allow her to rejoin the other cats in your household at that time.

, Your cats may just need a little cool down time. Put the fighting cats in separate rooms and force them to cool off. Give them space for a day or two and then gradually reintroduce them once again.

, There are some cats that just won't get along. If this is the case, the best solution my be to keep them totally apart. Put food, water, and litter in separate areas.You want to allow the cats to live their lives without running into each other. This means that you need to provide separate food and water dishes, as well as separate litter boxes. It may also mean that you need to physically separate the cats, keeping at least one of them in a room or an area apart from the rest of the home.

, If you don't live in a home where you can keep the cats separated, you may need to find a new home for one of them. This is a difficult decision to have to make but it will potentially make the lives of your cats, and your life, more tolerable.


Don't simply give your cat to an animal rescue. They are over-crowded and your cat could end up being euthanized. Instead, find the cat a new home. Tell friends and coworkers that you are looking for a new home for your cat. You can even post it on social media and ask your friends to spread the word.

Keep food and water bowls separate.,
Place additional perches around the house.,
Provide enough toys.,
Provide enough litter boxes.,
Spend an equal amount of time with each cat.",How to Prevent Fights Between Cats1," Make sure each cat has its own food and water bowls. Keep their bowls separate in different areas of the house. This way, your cats will not feel as if they are in competition with one another over valuable resources like food and water., Use perches and cat trees to create vertical space. Vertical space will help your cats feel as if there is more room in the house, making them less likely to engage in a fight.Vertical space will also help your cats feel more safe and secure, since it provides them with a place to escape dangerous or threatening situations.

, Make sure to have a variety of toys available so your cats do not have to fight over them. Additionally, enhance your cats’ environment with puzzles, food dispensing toys, and other toys that are safe for your cats. This way, your cats can release their pent up energy on their toys instead of each other., Believe it or not, the litter box is a resource that your cats may fight over. In general, you should provide one litter box for each cat you have, plus one extra. If you have 3 cats, for example, you should have 4 litter boxes. These boxes should be in different locations so that one cat cannot guard the litter box space. If you have a multi-level home, there should be a litter box available on each level., If you spend more time with one of your cats, then the other cat might be competing for your attention. Therefore, make sure to play, pet, and comfort both or all of your cats throughout the day.For example, if you are playing with one of your cats, make sure to set aside some time to play with the other one too, or play a game that involves both of your cats.

Their hair may be standing on end or puffed up, especially the hair on their tail. Additionally, their ears may be positioned backwards and close to their head. Look for an arched back as well.If you happen to find your cats in this situation, step in right away to prevent a full-on fight.

, Blow a whistle, clap your hands, or do something that will produce a loud noise. The loud noise will distract your cats, allowing you to break up their fight.You can also say loudly, “Hey” or “Stop it” in addition to making a loud noise.

, Place a blanket or a laundry basket over one of the cats, particularly the aggressor, to break up a fight. You can also place a cushion or another barrier in between the cats to prevent or stop an on going fight.Never try to separate two fighting cats with your hands.

, Place them in separate rooms with the lights off. The alone time will allow them to calm down. After 10 minutes, bring some treats with you and go in the rooms separately to check on each cat. If the cat is calm, pet and praise it in a calm voice and give them a treat. Make sure they are calm before letting them out of the room.If one of your cats still seems rattled, leave the room and shut the door. Check on it again after five minutes.
Some cats may take hours or even days to calm down after a big fight. In this case, keep the cat in the darkened room (make sure they have food, water, and a litter box), and only enter to feed them and freshen their water. The cat will be ready to return when it can approach you calmly.

"
"
Separate the cats into different rooms.,
Feed them on opposites sides of a door.,
Swap their rooms.,
Re-introduce them with a barrier.,
Crack their doors slightly.,
Open their doors wider.,
Consult your veterinarian.",How to Prevent Fights Between Cats3," Place a food and water bowl, litter box, bed, and toys in each room. By placing them in separate rooms, your cats will be able to smell and hear each other, but not see each other. This way they do not have to interact.Depending on the severity of the aggression, you may need to have your cats separated for a couple days or weeks.

, Do this by placing each cat's food bowl near the closed door. This will force your cats to be close together while doing an activity that they enjoy, thus helping them associate more positive experiences with each other.If both or one of your cats is still uncomfortable, try placing their food bowl a little farther away from the door. Gradually move the food bowl closer to the door over the course of several days or a week.

, Take one of the cats and its food bowls, litterbox, bed, and toys to another room and close the door. Then move the other cat and its possessions to the first cat's room and close the door. Finally, place the first cat and its possessions in the second cat's room and close the door. Swap their rooms every three days.Do this after several days of being separated. Swapping rooms will allow your cats to become accustomed to each other’s scent.

, Let the cats see each other through a screen or glass door, or a baby gate. Play with the cats and give them treats while they can see each other. Limit this first encounter to only a few minutes, for example five to ten minutes.Alternatively, you can place both cats in a carrier. Place the carriers across from each other so they can see each other. Gradually place the carriers closer and closer together as signs of aggression reduce.
If using a baby gate, stack two or three gates on top of each other to prevent the cats from jumping over.
If one of the cats begins to show signs of anxiety or aggressive behavior, go back to a distance where both cats are comfortable.

, Once your cats are comfortable with seeing each other from a distance, you can start to crack their doors open as they eat. Have them see each other as they eat, but make sure they are far enough apart so they do not feel threatened. Feed them a small amount of food to keep the sessions brief.Gradually increase the length of the sessions as your cats become more comfortable with each other.
Use a doorstop or a hook-and-eye closure to prevent the doors from opening if one of the cats decides to charge or confront the other one.

, Do this while they are eating. Make sure to watch the cats so you can prevent any fights. If one of the cats is uncomfortable or seems as if it will attack, then close the door. As they become comfortable, gradually let them explore the outside realms of their room after eating and under your supervision.If they are uncomfortable, do not pressure them.
Keep a barrier nearby just in case a fight erupts.

, Inter-cat aggression is a common problem that your veterinarian has probably dealt with before. A vet can help you identify the exact cause of your cats’ fights and give you advice for moving forward.

Your veterinarian may decide that one or both of your cats would benefit from medication to reduce their anxiety and aggression.

Take your cat to the vet.,
Keep your cats indoors.,
Trim your pet's nails every 10 days to 2 weeks.,
Spay or neuter your pet.,
Prepare your cat for baby sounds.,
Prepare your cat for baby smells.,
Invite friends with babies to visit you.,
Maintain your cat's regular schedule.",How to Prepare Your Cat for a New Baby1," As soon as you discover you are pregnant, make an appointment to see your veterinarian. You will want your cat to be checked for parasites and infections, and make sure its rabies vaccine shot is up to date.This is also a good time to ask your vet for suggestions if your cat has any behavioral issues or is prone to jealousy.;
, You do not need to get rid of your cat just because you are pregnant, but you do need to keep it inside at all times. Outdoor cats are susceptible to a parasitic infection called toxoplasmosis, which can cause birth defects in pregnant women. Indoor cats almost never contract toxoplasmosis.Do not touch or handle stray cats (any outdoor cat), or adopt a new cat, while you are pregnant.

, If you do not already regularly trim your cat's nails, begin doing this as a routine well in advance of the baby's homecoming.Sit in a quiet room with your cat on your lap.
Squeeze your cat's paw gently for three seconds or less, until the nail extends out of its paw.
Massage the nail pad again to release a nail, then clip off the very tip of the nail. Clip only the sharp, white portion of the nail at the end. The pink part is called the quick, and contains nerves and blood vessels. If you accidentally clip this area it will be very painful for your cat.
Trim only two or three nails per session until your cat becomes accustomed to the practice. Always give your cat a treat after you clip one of its nails.
If you accidentally clip the quick of the nail and it bleeds, you can stop the bleeding by rubbing it with a styptic stick, which you can buy online or at pet stores.
Never scold or shout at your cat while you are trimming its nails, or it will become very resistant to the process.

, If your pet is not already spayed or neutered, this is the time to take care of this. Spayed and neutered pets are less likely to bite, and will be more calm around the baby., Play recordings of baby sounds, like crying and cooing, so your cat will become accustomed to them before the baby arrives. Cats often find the sound of a baby crying very stressful., At least a month before your due date, begin wearing the shampoo, lotion, or powder you plan to use on the baby. Your cat will begin to associate those smells with you.Rub baby lotion on your hands and then engage your pet in some play time, so the scent will have a positive connection.

, Before the baby arrives, help your cat become accustomed to the sounds and smells of a baby by introducing it to other babies. Be sure to supervise any interaction extremely carefully, to keep the baby safe., As much as possible, try to keep your cat's routine from changing much before and after the baby's arrival. Keep feeding times the same, and do not forget any small routines you may have, such as an evening “snack time.”"

Adopt a dog that is not high energy, like an English Bulldog. For a list of high energy or low energy dogs, look at: http://www.canismajor.com/dog/apart.html.
Adopt a smaller dog that takes up less space, like a Chihuahua or a Shi Zhu.
Adopt a cat who has already lived in an apartment or a cat that you know will be better off not roaming.;
, Many apartment communities will charge pet owners a number of fees depending on the size, breed, and type of their pet. Some of these charges can be very high, so consider them before moving in or getting a new pet.


Pet rent. This could vary from $5-$10 a month to much higher.
Pet fee. Often these are one time fees of several hundred dollars.
An additional security deposit. These may or may not be refundable.

, Often times, even the most well-behaved dog or cat will cause some damage in a home. While your security deposit or pet deposit might cover some of these costs, be prepared to cough up the amount of money needed to make repairs to the apartment before you vacate.

, Most dogs need lots of space to run and play. Cats, too, need space to roam as well. Apartments, by their very nature, offer limited space. Consider the following:


Your cat probably won’t be able to roam freely outdoors.
You’ll have to walk your dog before and after work, rather than just letting them out into your fenced yard.
Your future apartment community might not have a lot of green space. Many dogs are picky about where they pee and poop. If your apartment community does not have much green space, chances are it’ll be saturated with the pee and poop of other dogs, and your dog might have a tough time finding a spot.
Look for apartment communities that have one or more dog parks., When you live in a house, if you want to walk your dog, you can simply go out the front door. For many people, apartment living is much more of a challenge. Consider the following:


If you live on a second or third floor, dog walks might turn into a huge pain.
If you live on a higher level, bringing your sick or injured pet to the car will become very difficult.
Bringing dog poop bags, pee pads, or litter to the garbage could also become a large chore., Neutering and spaying will take care of several problems associated with pet ownership. This is highly recommended for apartment living, and for pet owners in general.


For the owners of male cats, your cat might be less prone to spraying after being neutered.
Spaying will also eliminate problems associated with cats and dogs in heat.
Neutering male cats and dogs might make them less aggressive and could reduce destructive behavior.

, Much like with smells, sounds travel easily in apartment buildings. You’ll have to consider your neighbors below, above, and those on the other side of shared walls. Think about the following:


Your dog might bark when you’re not home, disturbing your neighbors.
You and your dog might cause a lot of noise if you play inside. While throwing a ball in your living room in a single family home might seem like no problem at all, the associated noise in an apartment building will certainly disturb your neighbors.
Any other noise that might be related to your pet that could potentially disturb your neighbors., Most apartment communities require that you inform them of the type and breed of pet before you move in. If you don’t clear it with your landlord, you could face fines, fees, or even eviction. Consider the following when looking to acquire a new pet or picking an apartment community:


Whether the community allows dogs or cats.
The size or weight limit of pets allowed in the community.
Breed restrictions for the community or even the county or municipality.
The number of pets your community will allow.

, Most apartment communities require a vet reference and documents detailing vaccinations. If your pet is not up to date on his/her vaccinations, you need to consider this, and be ready to get him/her vaccinated before you move in.


Make sure to be signed up with a local vet who has your complete file on hand
Make sure to have vaccination documentation on hand, as most apartment communities require these before they will approve your pet.
Make sure to have references from vets, neighbors, or former landlords who will vouch that your pet is well-kept and well-behaved., If you have a dog, you should purchase baggies and be prepared to pick up your dog’s waste every time it poops. There are a number of reasons for this:


Respect your neighbors. You want to keep your apartment community looking and smelling nice.
Respect your neighbors and maintenance workers who don’t want to step in dog poop.
You could face fines from the apartment community if you don’t pick up your dog poop.

, Apartment communities are unique in that you’ll be living in relatively close proximity to other people. Smells can often travel through hallways and from one apartment to another. As a result, you want to make sure you clean your litter box regularly in order to prevent your neighbors from also living with the smell of your cat.

, The central feature of apartment communities is shared space. As a result, you don’t want to be letting your dog or cat roam freely in your community. Keep your dog on a leash, and keep your cat inside (unless you want to walk him/her on a leash, too). There are a number of reasons for this:


Some pet owners, although required to by the community, might not vaccinate their pets. Letting your pet roam would make him/her more vulnerable to parasites and other illnesses.
One of your neighbors might accidentally hit your pet with their car.
Your cat or dog might get into a fight with another cat or dog.

, Some dogs and/or cats are very nervous when they meet new people. You want to make sure that your dog or cat won’t attack or be overly aggressive to neighbors or unsuspecting maintenance workers.


Consider enrolling your dog in obedient school.
Train your dog to not lunge, growl, or bark at people on the street.
Although you shouldn’t let your cat roam in the first place, if your cat tends to escape frequently, make sure he or she is not aggressive. This will help minimize potentially costly or harmful cat fights., One of the biggest challenges of apartment living with dogs is the limited ability to go to the bathroom. As a result, you need to be diligent about scheduling times for your dog to go to the bathroom. Consider the following:


Your dog should be allowed to have potty time at a minimum of 3 times a day.
Consider having someone visit your home while you are at work to take your dog to the potty around lunchtime.
It is mean and unhealthy to make your dog hold his/her pee and poop for long periods of time., Section off an area of your apartment for your pet's toys, food and water bowls, and beds. Since they’ll be confined to a small area, you should do your best to create an environment that is comfortable and stimulating for them.

, All pets, even low energy ones, need exercise. While you might be able to exercise your cat inside by playing with them, your dog will likely need to spend a substantial time outside several times a week. Consider doing the following:


Plan long walks for your dog at least three times a week. Devote 30 minutes to an hour walking around the community or the surrounding area.
Locate a dog park near you. This way, you’ll be able to let your dog off leash and he/she will be able to run around and play with other dogs. Be careful, though, and supervise your pet. You don’t want a dog fight to break out.
Hire a dog walker or find a relative or a friend to walk your dog if you don’t have enough time. Many communities have dog walking services that will, for a relatively low fee, come to your house and walk your dog., Some first-time cat owners discover to their dismay that Garfield leaves little ""presents"" for them, if their litter is not kept clean. If you don't clean your litter box, you'll feel like your living in a litter box. Consider:


Making sure you have the right sized litter box for your cat's breed.
Making sure you purchase litter that is agreeable to your cat.
Setting a schedule to change your litter box.

, Get a proper wire kennel or crate, and work with your dog until he/she is completely trustworthy in the house. Diligence is a must; so until your dog is completely housebroken, do not let them have the run of the house unless you can be there every minute to watch them.


Keep your dog in the room with you with the other doors shut until he is 100% potty trained.
Provide pee pads for puppies or older dogs who have a hard time holding their pee.
Don’t yell at your pet if he/she makes a mess. Positive reinforcement is the best route to housetraining., This loosens dead hair that's about to be shed, removes dander, and keeps your dog or cat's coat healthy and looking fine. This will also help keep your home cleaner and smelling better.

, Providing your pet with toys is an important part of keeping a happy pet in any environment. This will not only benefit your pet directly, but it will benefit you. Toys will help keep your pet entertained during times you might not be able to devote much attention to your dog or cat.


Chewing for a dog will relieve nervous energy and help promote good dental hygiene.
Cats like to scratch things and sharpen their claws, scratching posts will indirectly protect your furniture.
Providing a nylabone or another safe chew toy is far superior to losing the knob of a kitchen cabinet.

, Feeding your pet people food encourages begging and bad behavior, and it might also contribute to them making a mess in the house. Feed your pet a good quality food on a set schedule.

, Keeping up to date with immunizations is especially important since your pet will probably be exposed to other pets that could carry parasites or other contagions. Keeping your pet healthy also insures that any messes they make are just mischief or lack of training and not illness.

, Cats and many dogs continually shed hair. They also bring dirt in from the outside and produce other forms of grime. In the small space of an apartment, this hair and dirt can quickly turn your home into a unwelcoming environment. Vacuuming often, at least twice a week, will help keep your apartment clean and create a better environment for you and your pet, not to mention visitors.

, Cats tend to like to pull their food out of the bowl then chew it off to the side, leaving bits of kibble or canned food all over. Some dogs do the same thing. Using a mat underneath will help keep your home cleaner.

, Pet dander and hair accumulate very quickly in small homes with pets. Dust and dander may aggravate allergies and contribute to decreased air quality in your home. Make sure to dust your home at least once a week.

, Rugs and doormats will help decrease the muck and grime that your pet brings in after you’ve gone on your daily walks. Rugs will also help collect dander and hair, making your home easier to clean. Rugs, especially small ones, can easily be thrown in the wash.

Wait until the cat comes to them.,
Have your partner offer the cat a treat.,
Be consistent.,
Do not reinforce fearful behavior.,
Do not tolerate aggressive behavior.,
Reward good behavior.,
Give the cat its own space.",How to Introduce Your Cat to Your Partner," If you have a fearful cat you should begin introducing your partner to it before the partner even comes over. This can be done by bringing something with your partner's smells on it into your home. This will allow your cat to get used to the smells and will potentially make the cat more comfortable when your partner shows up in person.You can simply use a piece of clothing that your partner has worn or a pillowcase that your partner has slept on. Basically anything that your partner has had a lot of direct contact with.;
, Your partner should know what they are walking into before they show up at your home, and you should be clear with them about what you need them to do when they are there. This will allow the introduction to go as smoothly as possible and set a good foundation for the relationship to develop in a good way.


If you have an easygoing cat that loves new people, these instructions could be as simple as explaining how your cat likes to be petted or what its favorite game is.
If you have a fearful cat then you will need to explain that to your partner and be very clear about what they should and shouldn't do when meeting the cat. This could be as extreme as needing to completely ignore the cat and not make eye contact with it. While this can be embarrassing or difficult to explain to someone, it is better that they know before entering the situation.

, Introducing your partner to a cat that is aggressive due to fear or skittish will be more difficult than introducing your partner to a cat that is friendly and sweet. If you have a very fearful cat that has a hard time meeting and adjusting to new people, you should spend some time and effort at curbing that behavior before it is introduced to your partner.


Cats that are very fearful can respond well to behavior modification techniques and clear discipline, especially if done under the supervision of a qualified animal behavior specialist.Talk to your veterinarian about getting a referral to an animal behavior specialist in your area.
You can also potentially get help for this behavior from your veterinarian, who may be able to prescribe a medication that could curb your cat's anxiety and fear.

, When a cat is meeting a new person it is likely to be a little standoffish, especially if it is a skittish cat. This hesitance to interact with a new person will only be increased if you force the cat to interact right away. For example, do not pick up a cat that is fearful of new people and foist it onto the lap of your partner. This will not create warm feelings in your cat for this new person.In fact, forcing interaction will likely make the cat more fearful and make acclimation to this new person even harder in the long run.

, If you want to introduce your partner to your cat, you need to make the cat feel safe and in control. This is done by giving the cat space and allowing it to keep its distance. Not forcing the cat into a situation it doesn't want to be in will show the cat that it is safe in the company of this new person.However, this means that a first introduction may include little to no interaction between the cat and your partner.
What space will do is allow the cat to know that your partner is not a threat and it will allow the cat to get used to your partner's unique smells.

, It is key that you allow the cat to come to your partner, and not the other way around. Have your partner spend a good chunk of time at your home and let the cat roam the home freely. In many cases, if your partner ignores the cat, the cat will become intrigued by this new person and begin to investigate.This is especially important if you have a skittish cat that is weary of strangers.

, In order to lure the cat towards your partner and to create good feelings between them, give your partner a cat treat that you know your cat loves. Have your partner hold it out and wait for your cat to come to them. Even a cat that is fearful of new people may find the treat irresistible.If your cat is especially fearful, make sure to tell your partner to avoid eye contact with the cat while it is getting its treat and to avoid trying to pet it after the treat is given. Showing the cat that nothing bad will happen when it interacts with this new person is key to having a successful first introduction.

, It may take multiple visits with your partner for the cat to engage with them. During these visits your partner should act consistently, allowing the cat to come to them and providing treats to the cat when it does show interest.Consistency will teach the cat that your partner is trustworthy and will not act in a way that is threatening to it.

, If your cat is skittish or aggressive with new people you should not reinforce that behavior. While your partner is there, or after your partner leaves, do not give the cat attention or console it. You need to show the cat that its behavior was wrong, not right.In fact, it may be a good idea to leave your home with your partner after this first introduction. This will help to show the cat that there is nothing to fear from this person.

, As your partner tries to build up a relationship with your cat, you need to be clear with the cat that aggressive behavior will not be tolerated. This means that you cannot calm or reassure a cat after it bites, growls, or hisses at your partner.Instead, you should leave the room the cat is in and give it no further attention.
You should not, however, punish the cat physically. Hitting or swatting at a cat will only increase its anxiety and aggressiveness.
Do not pick the cat up and move it to another room. Just picking it up gives it physical contact, which can be read by the cat as a comforting and reaffirming act.

, Just as you should not reward bad behavior, you should reward your cat when it has good behavior. This means if it is friendly towards your partner or takes interest in them, give your cat a treat.If your cat sniffs at your partner but will not get close enough to take a treat from them, you can give the cat a treat. While it would be better to have the cat take a treat from your partner, reinforcing any positive interest is most important.

, Your cat should be given a space all its own where it can get away from your partner and take some alone time. Giving your cat its own space in which it can decompress and destress will go a long way towards improving its attitude when it chooses to interact with your partner.This space could be a whole room or just a cat tower or cat bed that is tucked away in a corner.
Do not ever block off the cat's access to this area, in case it needs to retreat to a safe space.

Avoid cleaning the litter box.,
Move your cat's food dishes.,
Change your environment gradually.,
Eliminate cat-access to the baby's crib.,
Try a tape barrier to deter your cat from entering baby's room.,
Consider using a Feliway diffuser.,
Provide your cat with an escape.",How to Prepare Your Cat for a New Baby2," While you are pregnant, arrange for someone else to clean the litter box. Transmission through accidental contact with cat feces is one of the main ways pregnant women contract toxoplasmosis.If you must clean the litter box while pregnant, wear a mask and gloves.
Toxoplasmosis infection is also caused by drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated or undercooked meat (lamb, venison, and pork in particular). It can also be transmitted by eating from contaminated utensils or dishes.
It can also be transmitted by accidentally ingesting soil that has been contaminated – this can occur when gardening, or eating unwashed fruits or vegetables from contaminated soil.

, Although this won't become an issue until your baby is crawling, it's a good idea to relocate your cat's food dishes as far in advance as possible. Try to locate the food dishes in an area your baby will not be able to access, and preferably not on the floor., Most cats are highly resistant to changes in their environment, and sudden changes will cause them stress. Begin painting the baby's room and rearranging the furniture well in advance (at least 2 – 3 months before your due date), so your cat will not associate the baby with all the new changes.This is especially important if your cat's litter box was formerly housed in the room that will become the nursery. Move the litter box as soon as you can.
If the baby's room is one of your cat's current favorite hangouts, buy a cozy new cat bed and designate a new comfortable area for your cat to claim as its territory.

, Before you bring your new baby home, make arrangements to keep your cat away from the baby's crib.Consider installing a screen door to the baby's room, which will allow you to hear the baby while keeping your cat out. (A half screen, or “baby gate” is not enough to keep a cat out of the nursery.)
Purchase a baby monitor system, and keep the nursery door closed while the baby sleeps.
If there is no way to restrict access to your baby's room, purchase a crib net or guard to keep your cat out of your baby's bed.

, If you can't install a screen door on the nursery, try creating a tape barrier to keep your cat out of the room.


Place a wide barrier (at least 6 inches, or 15 cm) of cardboard covered in double-sided sticky tape at the entrance to the nursery.
Most cats will avoid stepping on sticky surfaces.

, Feliway is a product containing artificial pheromones that can have a calming effect on felines. If you are worried about your cat's stress levels, consider setting up diffusers in the house that will distribute feliway mist into the air., Your cat will need to have some place to escape the baby's attention when the baby begins to want to touch and grab it.Consider purchasing a tall feline climbing tree or other large cat furniture that your baby will not be able to climb.
You could also build step shelves on one or more walls, which your cat can climb but your baby cannot.
Ask your guests to ignore your cat when it is in its “safe place,” so it can retreat from all the unexpected visitors, as well.

Introduce your cat to the baby in a neutral space.,
Allow your cat to sniff the baby.,
Reward your cat.,
Avoid pressuring your cat to meet the baby.,
Avoid scolding your cat.",How to Prepare Your Cat for a New Baby3," Be sure to arrange for a friend or neighbor to feed and care for your cat while you are in the hospital during and after the birth., When the baby is born, bring home one of his or her swaddling blankets and let your cat smell it, before bringing the baby home., Greet your cat in a quiet space, without the baby or guests. Once you have given your cat some attention, bring in other family members, guests, and the baby., The first time you introduce your cat to the new baby, try to do this in a place that has no strong associations for your cat. Don't introduce baby and cat in the room where your cat is fed, for example, or next to its favorite napping spot.There should not be any distractions or noises that may scare your pet when it meets the new family member.

, Hold the new baby, and allow your cat to get close enough to sniff your arms and the baby. Keep the baby wrapped safely in a blanket and supervise the interaction carefully.Most cats will be curious, but will then lose interest and wander away.
If your cat is mildly alarmed by the baby and runs away, that is okay, too. Never force your cat to interact with the baby.

, Reward your cat with treats and affection, after it has been introduced to the baby. Be sure to create positive associations for your cat, so it connects the baby with only good things like treats and cuddles., Allow your cat to inspect the baby if it is curious, but do not force it to interact with the baby. Always supervise any interactions between your cat and your baby., If you constantly scold your cat and chase it away from the baby, it will quickly learn to resent the new family member. Be gentle with your cat, and try to remember that it had your attention before the baby did – be patient with your cat as it learns to share your affections."

Begin with a confinement period.,
Trade items between the cats.,
Encourage the cats to interact through the door.,
Switch out the cats.",How to Introduce a New Cat to Other Cats1," Never allow two cats to interact face to face right away. Cats are territorial by nature. Your current cat will not react well if you simply introduce a new cat into its territory. Begin the introduction process with a period of confinement.Choose a small room to keep the new cat. Make sure the cat has all the essential, such as food, a litter box, a scratching post, and so on.
At first, keep the new cat's food, water, and other things away from the door. Interacting through the door can help the cats get used to each other, but you should not encourage too much interaction right away.;
, Cats learn to recognize other animals through scents and pheromones. In order to ease both cats into knowing a new animal, swap toys and bedding. The transition will go smoother if each cat is used to the other cat's scent.For best results, go for items you've seen each cat rubbing up against or nuzzling.

, After a few days, you can begin allowing the cats to interact through the doors. Play with each cat near the door. Move bedding, toys, food, and water closer to the door.The cats may be standoffish and nervous at first, but be persistent. You want the cat to gradually get used to the other animal.
You may see your cats pawing at one another through the door. As long as there is no hissing, this can be seen as a form of play.

, After two to three days of interaction through the doors, switch the cats between confinement areas.Let the new cat explore the house while the old cats are placed in the confinement area. This will get your new cat used to its new home and allow the other cats to get used to the new cat's scent.Switch out the cats several times a day for a few days.
Make sure you only let the new cat roam around the house when you are home to supervise.

Give your pets separate care and attention for the first day or two.You should usually confine the new pet initially, meaning you should keep your puppy in a separate room before letting her roam around the house.
Make sure the room is stocked with adequate food, water, and toys. Make sure to spend plenty of time with your new puppy as she adjusts to your home.;
, You should switch out which animal is confined. This will give them each a chance to explore the home. They can also get used to one another's smells, and become increasingly comfortable with the fact a new animal is present.Rotate the animals every few hours. It's important the puppy has a chance to leave the room and explore a little, but you should not allow her free-range of the house yet, as this may interfere with potty training. Expand the area in which the puppy is confined to two or three rooms and watch her closely to watch for signs of toileting.
When the animals are not confined, they may interact through the door. Your dog may, for example, sniff or paw at the door. For the most part, this is safe; however, if your puppy is excessively pawing at the door, correct the behavior. This can cause stress for your cat, leading to a messy introduction.

, It's very important the dog and the cat get accustomed to one another's scent. You can swap small bits of bedding, like pillows or blankets. You can also exchange toys. Try rubbing a towel on one animal and putting the towel under the other animal's food dish., You should never leave your pets unsupervised before you've made many successful face-to-face introductions. Make sure both the dog and cat are securely confined to separate areas when no one is home.
You may wish tocrate train your puppy and keep her safely confined while you are out, allowing the cat free range (as he is presumably already comfortable in the house)
If you secure the cat in a room while you're gone, make sure he has access to a litter box.

, After a few days, you can introduce the animals. The introduction should take place in your home. With dogs, initial introductions are often made in a neutral location. Bringing a cat outside the home, however, can cause the cat stress.Choose a room in your home to make the introduction. Make sure the room is large enough to comfortably keep both animals on opposite sides of the room initially., This is best done after your puppy has tuckered herself out with play and exercise, as she will be less rambunctious around the cat. Whilst holding the leash, let the cat into the room. Allow the animals to look at one another.You may notice some fear or aggression. If the animals are growling at one another, or if the cat bats at the puppy, you're moving too fast. Return to the separation phase for a few more days and try again.
Have a favorite toy or treat to distract the puppy if she is showing too much interest in the cat.
Do not let your puppy off the leash for the duration of the first meeting. You have to ease into unrestrained contact. An overeager puppy could easily injure a cat.

, Begin with short encounters and gradually build up. Remember to give each pet attention, affection and rewards for peacefulness.Try your best to end meetings on a positive note. If neither animal is being aggressive, and they've been in the room together for a few minutes, this is a good place to end the meeting for the day.
As time goes on, the cat should become more confident and the puppy should become disinterested in the cat.

, How long this will take depends heavily on the temperament of both animals. Some dogs and cats will calm down quickly, while others will take more time to relax.Your cat should be calm with the puppy in the room. He should eat, drink, and use the litter box without hesitance.
Your puppy should be largely uninterested in the cat. She should mostly ignore the cat and pay attention to other stimuli.
Once both animals are at this state, you can allow them to be in a room together without leashing the puppy.

, Many people are inclined to scold or punish a puppy for chasing or bothering a cat. This is actually counterproductive and could create a stressful situation, causing your puppy to become aggressive towards the cat. Instead of punishing negative behaviors, strive to reinforce your puppy's positive behaviors.


Always reward your puppy for being calm and obedient around the cat. Offer treats and praise when your puppy ignores the cat in the room.
Keep a small bag of treats on hand. Whenever your puppy displays good behavior, reward her.

, It's better to distract your puppy than punish her if she bothers the cat. If your puppy is chasing, watching, or otherwise bothering the cat, find a distraction to keep her occupied.Use treats, a happy voice, or a toy to distract your dog when she seems to be bothering the cat.
As soon as the dog leaves the cat alone, give her a treat as a reward.

, You want to be very careful allowing your dog and cat to interact. Aggression can become an issue, and both animals can get hurt during a physical confrontation. If you notice signs of aggression, act promptly.If a puppy is overly focused on the cat to the point she won't take her eyes off the cat, this is a sign of aggression. Growling, hissing, and swatting are signs of aggression in a cat.
Make sure you get the animals away from each other if they're becoming aggressive. You do not want to deal with a fight.

, Only once your animals are totally accustomed to one another should you ever leave them alone together. Always give each animal a means to find privacy. This could be a cat-door, doggie-door, high shelves or small recess so the animals can have their space. It will take at least a month for supervised interactions to be safe.You may need longer than a month, depending on the temperament of your animals. Do not leave them alone unsupervised until they largely ignore one another.

, A medical problem can stall or complicate the introduction process. Make sure to have a vet evaluate both your pets to make sure they're healthy before attempting an introduction., Cats need their space to be happy. When bringing a new puppy into the home, make sure your cat has a space to hide. Hostility may become more of an issue if your cat feels like he has no privacy.Invest in something like a kitty condo. Your cat is likely to feel safe there.
You should also make sure your cat has access to some perches in your home. Clear out a shelf on your bookshelf that your cat can use.

, If the introduction does not go smoothly, hire an animal trainer. Some puppies or cats are more difficult to train than others. A qualified trainer can help you smooth over any behavioral problems."

Be careful about introducing the new cat to other pets in the household.",How to Introduce a Cat That Used to Belong to Someone Else to Your Home," Your new cat won't be happy with the new environment to begin with; everything smells different, the layout is unfamiliar and the noises, sounds and light will be different. Therefore, it is important that the cat has its own space that remains private and undisturbed, to allow the cat to slowly get used to the newness.;
, Make some strict ground rules within the house that prevent intrusions on the cat. Tell other householders that the cat needs its space and to keep out of the specified room.


Ask other householders to get you to go into the room if they need something from inside it; this will limit the amount of people the cat initially has contact with. It is best if the cat can meet everyone gradually.

, Keep other cats or dogs out if you have existing cats and dogs. Be sure that no pets can find their way in uninvited.

, It isn't at all unusual for the cat to want to stay well hidden; in the wild, this is a natural instinct whenever out in an area that is unknown to the cat, uncertain of possible pitfalls and predators. In the house, the cat's mind works just the same way––hiding is a defense mechanism that reassures the cat.


Your new cat may want to hide under the bed, under a chair, inside a cupboard or in a corner. Slowly, the cat will get used to this new home and come out. A good way to make sure this happens is to put the food on the opposite side of the room as where the hiding spot is. That way, he/she will have to come out sometimes to eat.

, It is extremely helpful if you can bring home a toy, a blanket, a basket or anything else that the cat had in its old home. This provides reassurance for the cat and also begins the new process of spreading your cat's odor in at least one little corner of your home.


It is great if you can obtain a blanket or basket that the cat used to sleep in. The cat will feel happier snuggling up in its familiar bed.

, Find out from the previous owner what the cat was used to eating. You can either do this by asking directly, or if the owner has deceased, ask if you or someone else can check the cat's feeding cupboard to find out what was the standard fare. If the food can be kept the same as before, at least something that helps the cat feel normal is provided.


If you can't work out what the cat used to eat, buy good quality cat food, such as cat biscuits recommended by your vet. The higher the quality of the food, the more enticing it is likely to be to the cat.
Provide plenty of water and replenish frequently. Being anxious is thirsty work!

, Use a soft tone of voice and very slow movements around your cat. If you're already a cat person, your cat will recognize your gentleness and way with cats but even if you've never had a cat before, just by being calm, kind and considerate, you'll help ease your new cat's fears.

, Allow your cat to initiate the length of patting and always respond to the cat's indications of whether or not it likes the patting. It will take a while of trial and error to discover which parts of the cat are off bounds and which parts cause it to purr like crazy!


A lot of cats are wary about pats on the head from strangers. Approach this slowly and gently.
Scratching and biting is a real possibility. Be careful but don't take out your upset on the cat. The cat is only reacting out of anxiety and fear of the unknown. It may take quite some time before it feels okay around you if the relationship begins with bites.

, If you sleep in the room where your cat is for a night or two, this is a nice way for the cat to investigate you while you're harmless. The cat can get used to the rhythm of your breathing, learn that you're safe to be around and can generally just ""hang out"" around you. When you're happy this works well, you can have everyone else in the house do this as well, so the new cat can get used to the people it will be living with.

, These are signs that the cat has at least accepted its new digs. Ask all householders to remain calm around the new cat and to be friendly but not overbearing. Introduce the cat to one new person at a time initially, to avoid being overwhelming.

, It is actually a good thing to let the new cat discover who else in the house for itself. Have children doing quiet activities, like playing seated on the floor, watching TV or reading. Adults can sit down and read, do a craft or be on the computer. Whatever it is, make the activities quiet and let the cat loose to choose for itself whom it wishes to meet.

, If you already have a cat, follow the steps in How to bring a second cat into the family and not upset your old cat.

Let the cats have time to get used to each others' scents if you already have other cats. This will happen during the time that the cat is in its own room. When you think it's time, open the door to the room your cat has been staying in. Let him/her go in and out of this room as he/she pleases.
Dogs can be dangerous for a new adult cat. You know your dog's behavior and handle accordingly. Gradual introduction is best, from a distance, with the dog under your restraint, or the restraint of another adult in the house.
Realize that the new cat may never like the existing pets, or one or more of the existing pets may never like the new cat. However, they can live under a truce with the occasional fight. This is just something you'll all need to keep a close eye on over time.

Putting her in a small, confined space will help her feel more comfortable and will allow you to socialize her in an area where she feels at ease. Given your kitten’s instinct to run and hide, choose a space with no hiding places, such as a bathroom.The bathroom has the added benefit of being a place where people normally go. This will allow your kitten to get accustomed to people, which is an important part of her socialization.Other than a bathroom, you could choose another small room that doesn’t have furniture (e.g., couch, bed) that your kitten could easily hide under or behind.Make sure the area is quiet—loud noises would startle your kitten.;
, Since this small area will be your kitten’s world for a while, it should have everything she needs to feel comfortable. Place her food and water bowls in the room, along with some comfortable bedding and toys. Put her litter box in the room and clean it regularly. You could even plug in a cat pheromone diffuser.Pheromones are chemicals that animals use to communicate with each other, and can have a calming effect.Cat pheromones are commercially available as spray products and plug-in diffusers at your local pet store. These pheromones can calm your kitten and help her feel less timid.
Your kitten will need regular veterinary visits, so she will need to get comfortable with her carrier. Place her carrier in the room. Put some comfortable blankets in the carrier and leave its door open so she can explore it whenever she chooses., Soothing sounds can put your kitten at ease. If your kitten is in a bathroom, place a portable radio in the room and pick either a classical music or talk radio station. If she is in a small bedroom, you could place a TV in the room and turn it to a station where people are talking calmly (e.g. news station). Having a TV on would allow your kitten to get used to human voices., This quiet time will be crucial to socializing her and helping her become less timid. How much time you spend with her will probably vary according to how timid she is. In general, aim to spend about 15 to 20 minutes with your kitten, 3 to 5 times a day.Before you enter your kitten’s space, knock lightly on the door a few times and call out her name.Talk in a soothing voice to your kitten. You could even sing her lullabies!Try slow blinking with your kitten. Slow blinking communicates friendliness. When she does a slow blink back at you, then you will know she feels safe around you.Other than talking quietly with her, you could also read a book or do another quiet activity around her.
Do not be surprised if your kitten does not want to get anywhere near you at first.

, Your kitten should be comfortable in her space, but that does not mean you should make major changes to your own routine. Make your usual noises so your kitten can become accustomed to the ‘normal life’ sounds in your home.She will come out of the small space eventually, so she will need to be comfortable with the other noises in your home.

, Getting your kitten used to human touch is an important part of her socialization. Remember, though, that your kitten has claws and will likely use them if she feels threatened by your hand. Wearing a pair of gardening gloves will protect your hands from scratches as your kitten acclimates to your touch.Consider rubbing your hand on the outside of the gloves so your kitten smells your scent as you touch her with the glove. You can also rub that scent on her bedding., As you spend more quality time with your kitten, place your hand gently on the floor for her to explore. When she feels bold enough to approach your hand, give her soft verbal praise. Keep in mind, though, that she may be too shy explore your hand, or not interested in doing so.Hold your hand about one of her body lengths away from you. Be prepared for her to react strongly to your hand (e.g., spitting, hissing, growling, swatting). No matter what she does, keep your hand still to let her know you are standing your ground. Eventually, she’ll stop reacting this way.It may help to give your kitten treats when she explores your hand without reacting negatively. You could also place some treats by your hand to lure her closer to it.

, Once your kitten is comfortable with your hand, begin stroking her gently. Start with the top of her head and ears, where she will not be able to bite you. Do not touch her paws, tails, or underbelly at first—she will probably try to bite you.Make sure to reach from behind when you stroke her—bringing your hand towards your kitten’s face may startle her.If your kitten wants to run away from you in the room, let her do so. Do not try to grab her to keep her close to you., If she’s relaxed or curious, she will be purring and have her ears up. Nervous body language includes tense muscles and hissing. If she’s completely scared, she’ll growl and have a wide-eyed stare.If your kitten has nervous or fearful body language, stop stroking her and let her calm down. If she is displaying relaxed body language, work on stroking other parts of her body, such as her cheeks.
As your kitten becomes more comfortable with your stroking, take your glove off and see how she handles your bare hand touching her. Ultimately, she will need to get used to the feel of your bare hand.
After some time, try stroking her underbelly. She will need to be comfortable with you touching her there so you can practice picking her up., If your kitten is not adjusting well to human touch, try stroking her lightly with a peacock feather. It will feel lighter, less direct, and possibly less threatening than your hand. Set the feather on the ground first so she can explore it, then use it to stroke her body from head to tail. Watch her body language to see if she likes it or not.Look for peacock feathers at your local pet store.
Try using your hand again after your kitten has acclimated to the feather.

, Inevitably, you will have to pick up your cat for one reason or another during her lifetime. Your timid kitten will need to get used to you picking her up. Place a bowl of tasty food in front of her and lift her up while she’s distracted with eating. Gently place your hand under chest and lift her. Try putting her close to your chest so she can feel the comfort of your body heat and beating heart.Lift her up slowly and gently.If your kitten struggles mightily or lashes out at you, put her down softly and try again later.

, Kittens may be tiny, but they have huge appetites. Use this to your advantage as you socialize your timid kitten. In fact, food will be your most important tool as you work with your kitten.Other than her regular kitten food, pick some especially tasty foods—tuna, baby food without onion powder or garlic—as treats that you will give her only when you work with her., Since your kitten is timid, do not expect her to come to you right away for food. She will probably want to stay back until she feels comfortable enough to approach you. When you sit with her, gently toss a small piece of a treat towards her from a few feet away (depending on the size of her small space). If she eats the treat, continue to toss more treats her way, gradually shortening the distance that you toss it.When it’s meal time, place her food bowl a few feet away from you at first. Similar to tossing the treats, gradually shorten the distance between you and the food bowl.Try working up to placing the treats or her food bowl in your lap to encourage her to climb into your lap. You could also place some tasty food on your finger to see if she will eat food from your finger., Do not give your kitten food and then leave the area. Stay with her until she finishes eating, then take the food away when you leave.Staying with her as she eats is another way for her to become more comfortable with your presence.


Because your kitten is timid, it may take a few tries before she actually eats in your presence., Overcoming shyness may be difficult for your kitten. When she is confident enough to be close to you as she eats, reward her for that closeness. As she eats, gently stroke the top of her head and back.


Stroking your kitten as she eats will help her develop a positive association with you and the food you serve her.
Give your kitten verbal praise by telling her how brave she is., Playtime is another important component of socializing your timid kitten. Playing gives you quality time with her, and allows her to get some exercise and challenge herself mentally. Interactive playtime can also build up your kitten’s confidence. Examples of interactive toys include laser lights and wand toys with a small toy attached to the end.


Ping-pong balls are another good interactive toy, since you can roll them around on the floor and watch your kitten chase them.Select a variety of interactive toys.

, Whichever toys you choose, set them on the floor and give her time to explore them. Next, slowly pick up one of the toys and gently pet her with it as you did when you stroked her with your hand. This will let her get comfortable with the feel of the toy before you and she start playing with it.As you introduce her to new toys, repeat the same acclimation process.

, Being comfortable enough to play with you will be a big step for your kitten. Make sure you give her plenty of praise so she can continue building up her confidence. In addition, verbal praise will help her make a positive association with playtime.Give your kitten treats as you play with her.Schedule several play sessions each day and keep them short (5 to 10 minutes).

As relatively solitary and territorial creatures, cats need a decent amount of space. Without the proper amount of space, your cats are more likely to come into conflict.


If two or more cats are confined to one bedroom for large amounts of time, they might come into conflict. Instead of cooping multiple cats up in a room, consider letting them roam. If you need to cat-proof the house, do so.
If you have many cats in a small apartment or home, you may want to consider moving to a bigger place. However, if this is not an option, then providing some hiding places, such as cardboard, can help to alleviate some of the tension.
If you have many cats and a small home but can’t move, you may want to consider letting your cats roam outside. However, carefully consider the risks and rewards before letting your cats roam outside freely.;
, A common source of conflict between cats is competition for resources. If cats are forced to compete for limited resources, they’ll undoubtedly come into conflict. To prevent this, make sure that everything your cats need or want are available in large quantities and in multiple locations. Think about:


Litter boxes. You may want to consider providing multiple litter boxes. You should have one litter box for every cat in your household plus one extra litter box.
Food. Provide multiple food bowls throughout the house. Your cats may benefit from eating in separate areas of your home.
Water. Station water bowls throughout your home.
Toys. Buy multiples of toys so your cats won’t fight over a favorite., One of the most important things in resolving (or even preventing) conflict is to create an environment which lacks tumult or conflict. By creating a relaxing environment, you’ll establish an environment where it is easier to resolve outstanding conflict.


Avoid blasting music or TV programs.
Sort out domestic disagreements between family members. Cats, like people, are sensitive to unhappiness or arguments among their caretakers. If there is a lot of conflict in your home between people, there might be more conflict among the cats.
Discourage small children from chasing your cats around. In addition, don’t stress your cats out by forcing them to spend time on your lap or next to you. Let them come to you when they want to be a lap cat.

, Cats like to avoid one another rather than having confrontations, so try to provide alternative pathways through the house. This will allows your cats to avoid meeting if they choose.


For example, if you normally keep a door closed that would allow your cats to have two options for passing through an area of your house, then try leaving it open and see if this reduces the fighting.

, Separate your cats’ resources, such as litter trays and food bowls. Avoid placing them in one location, which the more dominant cat could monopolize. Try placing two or more food and water dishes in separate locations of your home, and spread the litter boxes out in your home as well.

, This will help your cats to feel less threatened when they meet. This is normally something that you would do when bringing a new cat into your home, but you can also use a scent handshake for your existing cats.


Start by separating the cats, such as by putting them into separate rooms. Then, after a day or two of separation, swap their bedding so that they can get used to each other’s smells.

, An important way to manage your cat’s behavior is to not punish them for their conflict. Ultimately, if you scold or punish your cat, you’ll reinforce the negative associations that your cats have with each other. Make sure to not:


Yell at them for fighting.
Use a spray bottle to punish your cats after they come into conflict with each other.
Hit them for fighting with each other., While it may seem like a good idea to make two competing cats play with each other, this is quite possibly the worst thing you can do. Not only will you cause conflict, but you might help create a negative association with you. This will undermine all of your efforts to resolve conflict.


Never lock cats in a room to make them interact.
Don’t pick one cat up and bring it to another cat.
Instead, coax the cats into coming to you at the same time. This way, they’ll be able to see that the other cat is approaching or is present, and they’ll have the ability to run away if they want., The best way to manage your cat’s behavior is to reward them for positive interactions. By rewarding your cats for positive interactions, you’ll help them build healthy associations with each other.


Give your cats treats when they are around with each other without conflict.
Verbally reinforce positive behavior by saying “good kitties!” or “good cats!”
Avoid invoking jealousy among your cats by petting one or the other when they are interacting. This could cause more conflict. Instead, offer them treats at the same time., One of the most helpful things to do is to supervise all interactions until the cats have resolved their conflict. You’ll probably find that by refereeing your cat’s actions, you’ll help them establish more cordial relations.


Instead of forcing cats together, allow your cats to voluntary enter into a relatively neutral area so that they can interact.
After allowing the cats to enter a neutral area, keep them distracted with food, toys, or yourself.
Consider adding a layer of supervision with harnesses or leashes., Cats that don't get to display natural behaviors such as hunting as more likely to be testy with one another. Diffuse the situation by regularly playing with each cat (separately) so they expend energy.


For example, you can use a laser to play with one of your cats or use a wand for some one-on-one playtime.

, As a good caretaker, you should provide good healthcare to your cats. By providing good healthcare, you’ll make sure that your cats don’t have problems that exacerbate or cause conflict in your home. Ultimately, a licensed veterinarian might be able to identify or rectify conditions that are causing problems for you and your cats. Conditions that might contribute to conflict include:


Toxoplasmosis.
Hyperthyroidism.
Epilepsy.
Rabies., One of the greatest ways of both resolving and preventing conflict between cats is to make sure that they’re treated well. Ultimately, a cat that is abused or neglected will be a cat that may develop psychological problems and may be more prone to conflict.


Never hit your cat.
Don’t yell at your cat
Avoid letting small children tease or torment cats, especially kittens. Instead, explain to children how cats are intelligent and sensitive creatures who need to be loved and nurtured., While it may be the last thing you want to consider, you may need to consider separating cats or rehoming one. You should, though, only consider this if one or both of the cats’ health or mental health are in danger.


If your cats frequently get into fights that result in one of them getting hurt, you should consider separation or rehoming.
Consult your veterinarian or a trainer before separating or rehoming a cat.
If you don’t want to consider the rehoming option, do what you can to separate your cats in your home. You may want to confine one cat to the upstairs and another to the downstairs.
When considering rehoming, always place your cat with a reputable rescue organization or a trusted friend. Do not advertise “free cat” on Craigslist or similar websites. Cats given away in such a manner are often hurt or killed by new owners with malicious intent."
"
Allow the cats to look at one another.,
Have the cats meet.,
Break up conflicts promptly.,
Separate the cats when they're alone at first.",How to Introduce a New Cat to Other Cats2," If it's possible, let the cats look at each other before interacting. You can place a screen door between the confinement area and the rest of your home. You can also let the cats take a peak at one another with the door cracked open slightly.While this can certainly help with a smooth interaction, it may not always be possible depending on your home's set up. If you can't do this step, simply proceed to the next step.

, Only take this step if all the cats seem calm. All your cats should be eating, drinking, and using the litter box as normal. If your cats aren't showing signs of distress, you can let everyone meet face to face. How long this will take depends on the temperament of your cats.You can never quite predict how an interaction will go. Best case scenario, all the cats will act normal after inspecting the new household member.
There may be some hissing and scratching. However, there is usually no need to intervene. Animals can often work out such conflicts amongst themselves.

, In the event a serious fight breaks out, you should step in. You do not want any of your cats to get hurt during the introduction process.Flattened ears, growling, spitting, and crouching are all signs a cat is becoming very aggressive. If you notice any of your cats behaving in this way, find a way to distract them. Clap your hands or throw something like a pillow near the cat to distract it.
Herd your cats to separate parts of the house if the aggression does not taper off after distracting your cat.

, Even if the introduction goes smoothly, keep the cats separate for the first few weeks when you're not home. A new cat will disrupt the balance of your household. Territorial disputes, or fights over food and toys, could break out when you're not home to intervene. Make sure all your cats have a chance to calm down with the new household member before leaving them alone together."
"
Choose the right cat.,
Take steps to reduce tension.,
Give your old cats special attention.,
Restart the introduction process if necessary.",How to Introduce a New Cat to Other Cats3," When selecting a new cat for your home, make sure you make the right choice. An aggressive cat, or one with existing behavioral issues, may not do well with other cats.When selecting an adult cat, make sure it's lived with other cats before. A cat that's used to being an only child may never adjust to living with other animals.
Ask at the pet store or shelter if a cat you're considering has any aggressive tendencies or behavioral issues.
Kittens can usually adapt to situations quicker, especially if they're still very young at the time of the adoption.

, You can make the introduction smoother by making sure each cat has its own space. This will reduce territorial disputes between your cats.Provide places in your home, such as kitty condos and boxes, where your cats can find privacy if necessary.
Make sure there are enough beds and toys to go around.
Strive for one litter box per cat.

, Cats that are already in the household need to feel secure when a new cat arrives. Make sure to spend time petting and playing with your old cats each day. This way, they will feel less threatened by the presence of a new cat., If the first meeting goes very poorly, start the introduction process from the beginning. While this can be time consuming, it will help cats recover from a poor initial introduction.In rare cases, some cats simply will not get along. If this is the case, you may have to find your new cat another home.

Try to keep your cat's daily routine as stable as possible.",How to Introduce a Cat to a New Home," If you're going to move with a cat, it's important to use a good quality cat carrier, not a temporary one used in some pet stores, and certainly not a cardboard box or other type of carrier. Use a carrier big enough for your cat to turn around comfortably, but small enough to keep them contained and persuade your cat to bed down and hide.


Even if you have a really calm cat that's a good traveller, keep it in the carrier during the move. Don't try to let cats move freely about the car during a road trip, unless you want to spend time herding them around rest stop parking lots.
It's a good idea to carry along a roll of duct tape to make repairs if necessary along the way. Sometimes, cats will claw, push, or chew at the carrier if they get a bit anxious.;
, If you've never moved your cat in a carrier before, it's a good idea to keep it out and open for a few days to let your cat become accustomed to it. Cats will typically rub their scent onto the corners of the carrier, which will make it more familiar when you close them inside.Some people like to feed cats inside the carrier, but since the cat won't actually be eating in the carrier, it's not necessary. Just leave it out, throw a toy or two in there, and let the cat explore alone.

, A lot of anxiety can be alleviated for your cat by treating the inside of the carrier and making it smell more inviting. Natural cat pheromones are commonly used for this purpose, but there are lots of ways to do this, with both commercial products and things around the house.


Feliway is the pheromone emitted through cats' faces, used to mark territory. Synthesized Feliway wipes can be used to apply to the inside of the carrier and calm the cat. They're available at most pet stores.
For a quick and easy remedy, try putting one of your t-shirts into the carrier. Your smell and the smell of home will calm your cat in many cases. Cat toys or blankets can also be used in the same way.

, If your cat tends to be skittish and nervy, it's a good idea to talk to your vet about anxiety meds that you can use during the moving process to make it easier on everyone.Bach flower, valerian, and kava are natural herbs sometimes used to calm motion sickness, and mixtures are widely available at pet stores. Meclizine is an anti-nausea medication that you can use with a prescription from your vet.

, As moving day approaches, the stacks of boxes and general hubbub can be quite anxiety-inducing for your cat. Some people prefer to isolate the cat during this transitional period, closing them in a bedroom with food, water, and litter, in a quiet corner of the house.


This is an especially good idea if you're hiring movers to come and go, which usually requires the door to be left open for a longer period of time, increasing the odds that your cat may make a dash for it. If this is a concern, close them up for a while.
You know your cat better than anyone else. If being closed up in a room will stress your cat out more than letting them roam, don't do it.

, If you've got a long move ahead of you, it's probably not the best time to put your cat in the car for the very first time. Instead, try making a few shorter trips, driving around long enough for the cat to calm down. This way, your cat will learn that they'll eventually be let out of the car and the trip well end.

, A common worry when moving a cat is that the cat will need to eat, drink, or do its business. In general, when your cat goes into the carrier, it will go into hiding and resting mode, and won't want to do these things, anyway. To make the cat more comfortable, however, don't feed them anything, so they'll be able to ride without having to go to the bathroom.


Some people suggest withholding food from the cat for 12-24 hours, if your cat gets car-sick regularly. If you're going on a longer trip, though, it's likely the cat won't eat during that time, so it's better to feed the cat normally leading up to the drive.

, If your trip will last less than one day, you don't need to worry about food, water, or bathroom breaks for the cat, and until your cat has a special medical concern it's much better to just leave your cat in the carrier while you're traveling, until you arrive at your destination. After eight hours or so, your cat will need a break and need to be let out for a trip to the litter box and some water.


If you're going on a multi-day drive, you can let the cat out of the carrier in the evenings at the hotel, or wherever you're staying. There, you can provide food and water, though cats will commonly only be interested in drinking a bit and using the litter box.
Never, under any circumstances, leave a cat in the car. Cars can overheat extremely quickly, making them death traps for your pet.

, Leave the litter box easily accessible until the very last minute, when you're ready to put the cat into the carrier, then clean up the litter box and make it the last thing you bring, or discard.


If you have an appropriately sized litter box, most cats won't try to use it to do their business. It's not recommended that you try to use a big carrier and put litter inside.

, Once you've got the cat inside the carrier, put the carrier in the car, or whatever you're moving with, and leave the cat alone as much as possible.


It's common to keep the carrier covered with a light blanket, as long as there is enough air circulation. Making the space dark can help to calm the cat down and encourage them to sleep.
Don't stick your fingers through the cage, or move the carrier around, or attempt to let the cat out of the carrier. Just leave the cat alone to calm down.

, Try to keep the radio off, or very low, and keep your voices as low as possible during the trip. Loud sounds can be quite agitating for your cat, so Try to keep things no louder than the gentle hum of the air conditioner.

, Soon after you move in, it's important to do a quick cat-proofing sweep around the house. Tuck away electrical cords and hide things that the cat will be tempted to knock around or hide in, or mess with, to be on the safer side. A lot of this will depend on your particular cat, and they're preferences.


Remember: cats can usually jump about five feet in any given direction.Is Granny's heirloom vase going to be safe there? You decide.

, When you've arrived at the new house, it's a good idea to avoid overwhelming your cat with the whole house. Pick a room, put out litter, food, and familiar objects, and let the cat get comfortable there for a day or two before opening the door when the cat seems comfortable.At first, keep them away from anything they'll be able to hide under or in. Many cats first instinct will be to crawl under the refrigerator, couch, or between some hard-to-reach boards in the basement and hide there, for as many as three days.
If your cat does hide, try not to panic. Put some food and water just out in the open from where the cat is hiding, Try to keep the area around where the cat hides as quiet as possible, and wait. The cat will come out eventually and explore when they're ready.

, The litter box is the first thing your cat needs to find in a new house. The best way to do this is to pick up your cat, place them in the litter box, and then leave them alone. If your cat's feet touch litter once, you can be confident that they'll a way back to the box, when they need to use it.


Cats want to use the litter box. You don't need to do much work to encourage them to use it in a new house. As long as the box is easily accessible and clean, your cat should be using it., When the cat enters the new room or the new house, put out some familiar items that your cat will recognize to make them as comfortable as possible. Toys, blankets, or chairs that the cat commonly napped on, are all great options for helping the cat acclimate to the space.


If you ultimately want to feed the cat elsewhere, or move that chair somewhere else, try leaving it there for a day or two to let the cat get comfortable, and then move it when the cat seems more comfortable.

, Cats will need to discover the new space alone, with the freedom to move around and explore at their own pace. Don't try to force a cat to tour a new house, or make the cat move around the house faster than you want. The best way to let the cat get used to the house is to leave it alone as much as possible. Make food, water, and litter available, and let the cat be.


Don't follow the cat around as it explores, or you'll start to make your cat feel uncomfortable. Just relax and do other things. It may take several days, or up to a week for the cat to really calm down and acclimate, but it'll happen eventually.

, Feed the cat at the same time as you fed the cat at your old house. Try to start your new schedule on as even a keel as possible. Try to keep things quiet for the first days and weeks in your new house to make your cat comfortable. Save the housewarming party for next month, if possible.

Consider your current pets.,
Prepare a room or safe area for your new pet.,
Put up baby gates.",How to Introduce Dogs to Cats1," Before you decide to bring a new pet into your home, you may want to consider how your current pets will react to a new addition. Think about how your current pets might react to a new pet and use this information to help inform your decision. Considering how your pets might react will also help you to develop a plan for introducing the new pets into your home.For example, if you have dogs and you are thinking about bringing a new cat into your home, how might the dogs react? Are they familiar with cats? Have you ever had a cat before? If so, how did your dogs act around the cats? Did they chase the cats or ignore them?;
, Coming into a new home is a frightening experience for a pet, so you should create a safe, quiet space for your new pet to escape to when necessary. You may use a spare bedroom, a quiet corner of your living room, or a hallway. Whatever area you choose, make sure that you make it a safe space where your new pet can escape to if needed.For example, if you are bringing home a new cat, you could place a litter box and some food and water in a room where people seldom go. Allow your new cat to stay in this room for the first week in your home to get used to the sounds and smells of her new home. During this time, let your dog sniff the door and get used to the smell of the cat. This will be helpful when you introduce them to each other.
Make sure that you visit your new pet often and allow your new pet some time to roam the house as well. Keep in mind that providing a safe space or room should only be a temporary measure to help your pets get acquainted with each other.

, Baby gates are a great way to allow your cat and dog to coexist. By having baby gates placed in a few doorways in your home, you can prevent your dog from going into areas where you keep your cat’s food, water, and litter boxes. Baby gates also provide an easy way for your cat to escape from your dog if necessary.If your cat is older and cannot jump the gate, try placing the gate higher up so that your cat can fit under it but your dog cannot.

Start by keeping the animals apart.,
Swap scents.,
Feed the two animals on separate sides of a door.,
Start training your dog.,
Introduce them face to face.,
Allow your cat to come and go.,
Reward your dog's good, calm behavior.,
Watch for warning signs that this is not a safe match.",How to Introduce an Older Cat to a New Dog1," When you're introducing a new dog to an older cat, you'll want to plan their introduction carefully. Though they're sharing your home, male sure that they're confined to their own spaces at first. Allowing them time to adjust to each others' scents within your home will help them get used to each other.You'll want to prevent any direct contact until your new dog has had his vet checkup and is cleared of any contagious diseases or infections.
Consider having a sanctuary room for your cat, who's likely to be more comfortable in a confined space.;
, Animals use smell to ""see"" and understand one another. To help speed this process for your new dog and your resident cat, switch their sleeping blankets so they become used to each other's scent. Or try rubbing a towel on one animal and put it under the food dish of the other.If you have other animals, do this with each animal in the house.
Allow your animals to sniff each other when they're in close proximity.

, During the time when they're still being separated, start to feed them at the same time, but on separate sides of the same door. For example, if your cat's sanctuary space is in your bedroom, put her food dish by the door inside your room, and put your dog's food dish in the hall.They'll be able to smell each other and recognize how closely they're in proximity to each other.
This will encourage them to associate each others' scent with good things, like food.
With each feeding, move their bowls a little closer together, but keep the door closed.

, If he's a rescue dog, he may already know some basic commands, such as ""sit"" or ""stay."" If he doesn't, he may learn them quickly.For example, teach your dog to sit by holding a treat above and slightly behind his head. His body will naturally sit in order to access the treat.
As soon as his bottom touches the floor, reward him with the treat. Say, ""Good dog!"" in a cheerful voice.
Repeat, using identical gestures and voice commands.
Being able to follow basic commands (sit, down, come, and stay) will help ease the introduction to your cat.

, Once they've become accustomed to each others' scents, allow them to meet. Your cat should be able to come and go as she pleases, while your new dog should be held on a leash. Keep these initial meetings quite short, and provide plenty of treats and praise so that they continue to associate each other with good things.Don't restrain either pet in your arms, because this risks injury.
Repeat this introduction process several times per day for several days.

, After a few introductions, allow your cat to come and go while your dog remains confined to a leash. If your dog is crate-trained, keep him in the crate while encouraging your cat to explore the room.If your dog obsessively paws the floor, whines, barks, or attempts to get out of his crate when looking at the cat, you're likely to need the help of a behavior specialist.
If your dog relaxes his attention, appears calm or stays focused on you, reward him with a treat.

, When you're making introductions, have your dog sit or stay. If he obeys your command, reward him with a tasty treat. Dogs are more likely than cats to learn to associate the treat with behavior. This will also keep the dog's attention on you, rather than the cat. Your cat can then explore the dog with more confidence.You can toss some cat treats to your cat as well, but don't allow your dog to catch them.
If either pet acts aggressively, such as growling or snarling at the other, calmly distract and redirect him.
Finish by calling the dog's name and returning him to his own space. Allow the cat to return to her own sanctuary space, and close the door.

, There are some dogs and cats who should never be left unsupervised together. Be aware that some dogs will never be safe around cats. A cat who continually hisses and growls at all types of dogs won't be happy living with dogs. Some dogs and cats just aren't good matches with each other, though they may be fine around other animals. Even though there's likely to be a difficult period at first, if you don't see improvement in your pet's behavior within 48 hours, you'll likely need to consult with an animal behavior specialist. Warning signs include the following:Warning signs include:


If your dog continues to be overly focused on the cat, not taking his eyes off the cat
If your dog ignores you, and doesn't follow your commands when the cat is present
If your dog lunges at the cat when she moves
If your dog lunges, snarls, growls or snaps at your cat even if she's not moving
If your cat attacks your dog when your dog is quiet and not moving

Watch for signs of stress.,

Be patient with relinquishing supervision.",How to Help Cats Become Friends," You need to carefully consider things like the age, size, and personality of the new cat before deciding to bring it home. Ideally, choose a spayed or neutered new cat of the opposite sex that is younger and smaller than your existing cat. In addition, select a new cat who has a similar personality as your current cat.;
, Take your time in getting to know the new cat before making any final adoption decisions. A cat’s background matters; stray cats tend to be territorial, competitive and aggressive, while an orphaned cat raised in a household is oftentimes appears more fearful and awkward, typically requires more time to adjust to their new life.T

, The normal adjustment period ranges from six to 12 weeks, but it can be longer when the matchup is less than ideal. If there are too many conflicting factors in the matchup, you risk the chance of the cats never forging a friendship, but becoming enemies instead.Take your time in finding the right match to lessen the potential for future problems.

, Cats naturally prefer to be alone and are not dependent on each other for things like hunting and socialization.Keep the new cat in a separate room for about one week so she can get used to her new environment and so both cats can become familiar with the other cat’s scent and sounds.Be sure the new cat has plenty of food and water. You’ll also want to surround him with other things to help him feel at home, such as a litter box, a place to hide, a scratching post, and toys to play with.Make sure you are spending this time to bond with the new cat. You can bond with him by playing games, feeding him treats by hand, and cuddling and grooming him.During this period of isolation, be sure to have the newcomer vaccinated and tested for parasites and diseases by a veterinarian., Once the initial one week period of isolation is over, the new cat is successfully using the litter box, and appears comfortable in his new environment, allow him to explore the rest of the house. However, only do so after placing your existing cat in another room; it is still too soon to bring the two cats together. This exploring opportunity will allow the new cat to become familiar with the existing cat’s smell.


If you prefer, you can exchange the two cats’ bedding overnight. This too will allow the cats to become acquainted with each other’s smell.

, You’ve finally reached the step where the two cats see each other in the flesh! This is an exciting turning point, however, this initial introduction must be done slowly and carefully. Introduce the cats together by placing a barrier between the two of them so there is no way they can come in full body contact.


You can place the cat inside a crate and place the crate in the same room as your existing crate. Another option is to stack two 36” high tension gates in the doorway that separates two rooms and placing each cat in their own room.
A third option is to jam the door separating both rooms with two rubber door stops. Crack the door two to three inches, and make sure that neither cats’ head can fit through the opening. This method will allow for greater physical contact.
Be sure that you are home to monitor the two cats’ interaction regardless of which barrier method you choose. Do not let the cats interact until they both appear fairly calm around each other. Mild aggressive behavior, such as hissing and then walking away, can be normal behavior for cats who have been apart for several weeks. Aggression is one way that cats communicate with one another, and mild aggression is usually okay as long as they are not fighting., It is now time to remove all physical barriers and allow the cats to have their first face-to-face meeting. Remove the new cat from her cage, or remove the gate or door barrier that was used to separate them. Stand close by as the two cats come towards each other.


Be aware that the existing cat may stalk and chase the new cat, or the newcomer may do the same if the existing comes and enters the isolation room. Don’t worry; this is normal. Just be sure to supervise both cats throughout the interaction.Avoid holding either cat in your arms during this introduction . You could end up scratched or bitten if one or both of them becomes aggressive towards each other.If your cats do get into a fight, do not try to reach in and break it up with your bare hands. Instead, grab a nearby squirt bottle, water gun, water hose, or water bottle. Then proceed to dose the cats with water; this will probably end the fight within a few seconds.Remember that this process may take quite some time. It could just a few days if you’re introducing two kittens to each other and potentially several months when introducing two adult cats., Cats can become stressed during the introductory period. Make sure you pay attention for behavior that could indicate that either cat is street. Stress signs include whimpering, hiding, vomiting, excessive grooming/eating/drinking, spraying, and urinating/defecating in inappropriate places., Like people, cats sometimes need an extended break from each other. Keep the cats separate for several days or weeks. Make sure you provide them with the necessary things to keep them comfortable like their bed, food bowl and litter boxes.


Have the cats switch rooms every day so they have the opportunity to smell the other’s scent.

, Use your cats’ feeding time as a way of getting them in close proximity to each other. While the two cats are separated, place their food bowls on opposite sides of the closed door. Determine how far away from the door to place the bowls based on how responsive the cats are to continuing to eat in close proximity to each other. Continue to move their food bowls closer to the door as the separation period progresses. This way, they will associate being in close proximity to each other with enjoyable activities.If possible, have one person on each side of the door to praise the two cat as it eats. This is done as a way of using food to reward the cats for being so close to the scent of another cat. In addition, you are rewarding the cat with praise for eating near another cat.

, Once several days have passed, crack the door open about one inch to see how they both respond. If the response is calm, open the door a little more, continuing this process until they are back in each other’s presence. However, if they react by showing aggressive, return them back to separation and repeat the reestablishing friendship routine over again.You might find that rubbing a little tuna juice on the cats’ body and head helpful, as this will likely cause them to become distracted with grooming themselves, which will lessen their focus on each other., You’ll need to isolate the cats as described above but for a longer time frame. You’ll also need to reintroduce them to each other at a more gradual pace, which can range from several days to a few weeks.

, You’ll want to do a daily reintroduction to cats with an already established history of not getting along. Complete this by slowly moving the cats closer to another each day while you provide close supervision.It might be helpful to have both cats on a harness or lease throughout the sessions, or keep one or both cats confined inside a crate. Keep both cats distracted with food or toys can always help the transition.
Keep the sessions brief, and keep them separate between the reintroduction sessions to improve chances of success.
If the reintroduction sessions prove to be ineffective, consult a veterinarian to determine if behavioral medication should be considered. Behavioral medication such as benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin inhibitors can be helpful in modifying aggressive behavior in cats.

, You’ve been a patient and attentive cat parent throughout this entire process. However, you must keep the new cat in the isolated room for the first few weeks of the reintroduction process. After that, start off by providing the cats with short periods of unsupervised access, then gradually increase their alone time together.Do not leave the cats alone until you are confident that neither cat will display aggressive behavior toward the other. In addition, you can leave the cats alone once they are peacefully eating and playing within a couple of feet away from each other.

You can use your bathroom if you don’t have a spare room.Give the established cat something with the new cat's scent on it to sleep on. The ideal object is a T shirt with your scent on it that the new cat has sat on. This uses your scent as a ""intermediary"" and gives the established cat a gentle introduction.
It may take a few days for your cats to not freak out or avoid your new cat’s bedding. But over time, they should start to get used to the new scent.
As a general rule, it is usually best to introduce a new cat when your existing cat is young. This will allow the two cats to get to know each other over a long period of time and hopefully bond as they grow.;
, If you are planning to get a second cat or to add another cat to your household, it’s important that you ensure they get along by introducing them properly. This means letting the cats see each other before they touch each other or interact.Consider placing the new cat in a cat carrier and placing this on the floor for the existing cat to sniff around and investigate, without the threat of being chased by the new cat.
Alternatively, use a baby gate that is at least 36 inches high. Place it in the doorway of the new cat’s room so she stays in her room and does not interact with your existing cat(s).
Allow the cats to get a look at each other. Then, praise and reward both of them with a treat if there is no attacking or signs of aggression like hissing.
Make sure the cats look at each other five to ten times a row, two to three times a day.

, Before you allow the cats to physically interact with each other, you need to ensure they have grown used to each other by smell and by sight. They should seem relaxed and calm when they look at each other and be okay with being in each other’s presence for an extended period of time.If either cat starts to hiss, growl, or seem uncomfortable, move them out of each other’s sight. Keep the baby gate door closed to the cats cannot interact with each other. Always quit while you’re ahead and don’t force the cats to get along. Patience is key as it may take some time for your cats to accept each other.

, Once your cats seem comfortable looking and smelling each other, you can start to encourage them to interact. Use a fishing rod type toy to play with the cats at the same time. You should also give each cat her own toy to play with. This will help the cats to associate being around each other with play time.If one cat starts to act aggressive, use the fishing rod toy to distract and redirect the cat. However, if both cats display any aggression or tension, separate the cats and return them to their separate spaces. You should never leave the cats alone to play until they seem comfortable and accepting of each other.
If the cats play well together, reward them both with treats and praise. It’s important to always reward both cats so they understand they are equal and there is no preferential treatment.

, Giving each cat her own litter tray, food bowl, and bed will cut down on any feelings of competition and reduce stress among your cats.Try to keep the separate litter trays, feeding bowls, and beds for each cat identical so it does not seem like one cat is being favored over the other. Place the feeding bowls a safe distance from each other so your cats can eat in the same room but in separate areas of the room.

, Cat trees, cat friendly shelves, and tall perches on furniture can help your cats feel comfortable roaming around the space or room without having to share a vertical spot. Cats often feel safer when they can observe things from above and when they can move away from other cats or people on their own.


You can also place separate scratching posts in doorways or at the top or bottom of the stairs so your cats can learn to play in the same area, but on separate posts.

, Cats love to run around and explore on high perches in a playground made of cardboard. You can also use paper bags, with the handles removed, and cardboard tubes to create a fun playground for each cat. Rotate the objects often to keep the playground interesting for both cats.


Make sure the playground has multiple exits so your cats do not feel trapped together or boxed in when playing., Feeding time can be a big source of tension and competition for cats. Reduce any stress or anxiety for your cats by giving each cat food in their own feeding bowls in different areas of the room.

, Avoid letting your cats just fight out their issues. Cats can’t really resolve any problems through fighting and fighting will often make the conflict worse. Interrupt or stop any fighting by clapping your hands loudly or spraying a warning shot from a water bottle or gun.Avoid yelling at them to stop fighting or displaying open aggression by throwing an object at them. This will create more stress and possibly more fighting down the road. Instead, calmly interrupt the fight. You can try to distract the cats with toys to prevent the fight from starting up again.
You should also avoid trying to soothe the cats after they have had a fight. Instead, leave them both alone once they separate and stop fighting. Due to their solitary nature, cats are often best left alone to recover from a conflict.

, Some cat owners have found a calming pheromone spray like Feliway can help to reduce overall stress levels in the living space. You can also get Feliway in the form of a plug-in diffuser that releases the calming pheromone throughout the home.


The spray may not work on all cats to calm them down and it may not stop every conflict from occurring. But it can help to maintain a calm, stress free environment in the living space for both cats.

, Often, two fighting cats will be looking to their owner to help them process the stress and anxiety of having to live with each other. Observe their behavior towards you and if you notice any signs of stress, such as tense body posture, twitching tails or dilated pupils, respond by giving the cats some attention. Do this by playing with both cats at the same time, using two separate sets of toys. You can also groom your cats to give them some love and attention. Rub their bellies and their heads, but avoid picking them up and carried them or cuddling them. Most cats get stressed out when held and prefer to be groomed on the ground.


Some cat owners have found rubbing tuna juice on their cats’ bodies and heads can help to distract the cats from fighting. Your cats may be come so occupied with grooming and licking the tuna juice that they may not pay much attention to each other. In fact, they may start grooming each other to get at the tuna juice and could interact in a more friendly way.

, Sometimes cats can fight due to stress or anxiety from a medical condition or issue. Bring your cats to the vet for check ups to determine if there could be other reasons for their fighting.You can also contact a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB or ACAAB) or a board-certified veterinary behaviorist for advice and guidance on how to encourage your cats to get along at home. You can find a list of CAABs here.
Keep in mind some cats just aren’t meant to live together in peace. Chronic stress and tension in their living space is not healthy for your cats and could lead to some unhappy cat years. If you have exhausted all of your options, you may want to consider separating the cats permanently by finding a new home for one cat or restricting one cat to a completely separate area of the house."

Reinforce good behavior with praise and treats.",How to Introduce Dogs to Cats2," You can purchase dog appeasing pheromone diffusers, collars, and sprays to help calm your dog during a period of transition. These products release a scent similar to the scent that mother dogs release to keep their puppies calm. Using one of these products may help your dog to feel better about coming into your home or meeting a new cat, which may make training easier., Take your dog on a long walk before you plan on introducing him to your cat. Keep him on his leash, and have him sit while you have another person bring in your cat. Reward your dog for ignoring your cat. Repeat this as often as necessary until your dog shows no interest in chasing your cat. Once he is disinterested in your cat, you can give him more line on his leash.

, When your dog is first getting acquainted with your cat, you will need to make sure that you prevent your dog from chasing your cat. You can either distract your dog when he or she starts to chase after your cat or use a leash to control your dog whenever your dog and cat are around each other.Try clapping your hands together once to get your dog’s attention if he tries to chase your cat. Then, command your dog to “sit” so that your cat has a chance to get out of the room.
If your dog is hard to control and does not respond to commands yet, consider a training harness. Training harnesses apply gentle pressure that will prevent your dog from pulling and getting away from you.
Intervene if your dog corners your cat. Even if your dog is only playing he may cause serious harm to your cat.

, If your dog is not already trained in basic commands such as “sit” and “leave it,” take some time each day to teach your dog these commands.Keep training sessions short and focused. Repeat the command four or five times and immediately reward your dog with a treat each time he follows the command.
If your dog has a hard time learning these commands, consider getting help from a certified professional dog trainer. Contact your veterinarian for a recommendation.

, Positive reinforcement is the best way to let your dog know that he has done something good and you want him to keep repeating that behavior. Try to reinforce your dog’s good behavior whenever you notice it by giving him some praise and a treat.For example, if your dog notices your cat walking through the room and does not chase or harass the cat, give your dog some praise and a treat right away to let him know that this behavior is desirable.

To perform a scent handshake, you will need a couple of rags or old washcloths. Use rags or washcloths that you won’t miss in case they get soiled or ripped., Take one of the cloths and rub it on your dog’s back and rear end. Then, take the other cloth and rub it on your cat’s chin and the sides of her face. You may want to use two different color cloths so that you can tell them apart., After you have gotten your pets’ scents on the cloths, give each pet the other pet’s cloth.

Don't allow unsupervised time together until you're confident that they are safe together.The use of baby gates to keep your animals confined is encouraged.
Both animals should have access to food, water, blankets or bedding, and (for your cat) a litter area in their separate spaces.

, To cats, physical space is of paramount importance. To help a cat stay calm, make sure she has a safe physical space. For dogs, the social order is the most important element. To help your dog stay calm, make sure he feels that he's secure in his relationship with you.This is one reason why teaching the dog basic commands and keeping him on a leash for the initial introduction will be important.
Make sure your cat's food is out of your dog's reach. Any dog will happily eat cat food.

, Keep treats in your pocket so you can ""catch them being good."" Whenever you notice calm interactions between your dog and cat, praise them with a cheerful voice, saying, ""Good dog!"" and offer treats.Whenever your dog doesn't bark or chase cats, you'll want to reward this behavior.
Try to avoid situations where you have to tell a dog ""No."" Telling a dog ""no"" results in stress and confusion for a dog, without any real idea of what the ""right"" behavior might be.

, Dogs and cats communicate in very different ways. While they might become good companions, they might only learn to tolerate each other. They'll need to establish their relationship at their own pace.Make sure that you continue to pay attention to your resident cat.

This is the place where the gerbils will be allowed out of their enclosure if needed.;
, It can be as simple as a glass terrarium with toys and a tight mesh lid, or as complex as a ""gerbil playground"" made of clear PVC pipe.

, Your cat will probably enjoy watching the gerbils, but be sure to discipline it if it shows an inclination to attack.

, The best way to do this is to put the gerbils in a smaller cat-proof home, and shut them in the cat-free zone. You can also put your cat outside (assuming this is safe), or restrict it to a large room (make sure to provide food, water, toys and a litter box).

,, It is more likely to ignore the gerbils entirely if you provide it with a variety of fun toys, playtime or other attention.

Pick a quiet room for her to be in when you bring her home. Doing so lets her establish territory over one area and get used to the new surroundings.If you have other animals, make sure to keep them out of this room while your kitten is acclimating.;
, Your kitten will be nervous, and nervous kittens like to hide. Have safe spaces available where she can hide.For instance, you can make a simple hiding place by placing a sheet over a chair; leave a small opening at the bottom of the sheet so your kitten can enter the space. You can also provide cardboard boxes.However, do not have spaces where your kitten can be completely away from you, such as under the bed, as it will take her longer to acclimate., You don't want to lock your kitten up forever. However, a couple of days in this quiet room will help her become acquainted with you and your house without being overwhelmed by your whole house at once., Make sure to have food and water available in the room. Don't forget that kittens need special food while they're growing. Look for food specifically marked for kittens when choosing one.If you have other pets, try placing her food near the door. On the other side of the door, put your other pets' food. That way, they start smelling each other, and they associate an enjoyable activity with the smell.Also, remember to include a litter box in the area, as well., Have a few toys in the room for your kitten to play with. It's also good to provide a place to scratch, such as a post or carpet.Put out a blanket or cat bed where your kitten can sleep.

, Put out some kitten treats around the room in various places. This process will encourage your kitten to walk around the room, as she'll be drawn to the smell., You want your cat to feel like she is able to establish her territory. If people in your house are living in the space, she may not feel like it's hers. Keep everyone out except to go in and visit the cat., If you're kitten won't come out, don't force her. Just spend time in the room, talking out loud as you do so, which will help her adjust to the sound of your voice.Limit the visits to one or two people. If your kids want to visit, that's fine. However, only one kid should be allowed inside the room at once, and he should be supervised. Make sure he stays calm and isn't too loud while in the room. Too much noise can frighten the cat.If your kitten look like she wants to explore the rest of the household, she's likely getting acclimated to your home. Also, if she's starting to seem less scared, such as coming up and rubbing on you, that's another sign she's getting acclimated., Your kitten will learn to recognize that you bring food, which helps earn her trust. Most cats have a finely honed sense of when meal time is, so try to be on time with food., Once your cat seems fine with eating, sit in the room with her during mealtime. Don't make noise or try to approach her. Just sit off to the side. Also, don't try to touch her while she eats, as she may perceive that as a threat., The kitten will likely be interested in you. If she comes up to you, hold out your hand to let her smell you. If she doesn't run, try petting her softly on the head and back., Try putting something a cat would like on your finger, encouraging her to come up and lick it. For instance, you could try chicken and gravy baby food or bit of canned cat food. She'll likely come up to you, and she'll pair the happy taste of the food with being around you., Don't forget to include other family members in the introduction process. Have them sit with the kitten, too, encouraging interaction. However, don't overwhelm the kitten. Make sure only one or two people are in the room at the same time.

, If your cat is not ready to come and meet you, don't drag her out. Let her come out in her own time. Don't try to pick her up or chase her down, as that will only terrify her more., That is, use a toy that will go under the door. Let both your old and new pets play with it at once. That will introduce new smells and get them to (hopefully) play together., Take the bedding of one cat or pet, and switch it out with your new kitten. That way, they can continue to smell each other. You can also just gently rub a towel on each pet, then place it where the other pet can smell it., It's best to only allow your cat to explore one new room at a time. If possible, only give her access to one new room a day by shutting doors. Another option is to provide your cat with supervised visits to the rest of the house, returning her to her enclosed space afterwards., While your new kitten is exploring a new room, let your other pets explore her room. This practice also encourages them to get used to each others' scents., Use a door stop to allow enough space so your pets can see each other. However, don't leave enough space that they can crawl through., Once your cat starts exploring, put out a new litter box where you want it to go permanently. However, don't take away the first one for a few weeks.Another way to change the location is to slowly move it towards it's new location. That is, shift it's position toward it's new location a foot a day. If you don't shift it gradually, your cat may try to go back to the old spot and use the bathroom where there isn't a litter box., Once your cat has become accustomed to most of the house, let her have free reign of the house. Don't forget to cat proof your home to remove any hazards that can pose a danger to your cat.

, Once your new kitten has free reign, she may run into aggression with your other pets. If you see growling or spitting or if one of your animals looks like it is going to attack, break up the fight by clapping your hands loudly. You can also try using a spray bottle with water to distract the cats or throw a pillow near them.If they need a calming down period, separate them out again, then try again the next day."

Give your cats enough time.,
Be sure there is enough space for your cats.,
Have one litter box per cat, plus one spare.,
Make sure your cats each have their own separate water and food dish.,
Own one carrier/crate for each cat.",How to Bring a Second Cat Into the Family and Not Make Your Old Cat Upset1," Both cats will require your love and attention. This means petting them, and also playing with them. Set aside twenty minutes, twice a day to play with your cats. If they can't yet play together, make sure you give them equal time.;
, A studio apartment might not be the best place to keep two cats. Adding vertical spaces, like cat towers, can help to give your cats more room. Cats like to be able to create social distance, and too much crowding can stress them out.


Cats are naturally territorial. These are natural impulses in cats, and so conflict over territory is to be expected, though not guaranteed.About 19 square feet of floor per cat is recommended when housing multiple cats.
When choosing a new adult cat, getting one of a similar size as your old cat (if possible) will reduce the likelihood of one intimidating the other simply due to their relative sizes.

, This means two cats require three boxes. This is to make sure your cats feel comfortable. If one cat feels the litter box is the other cat's territory, they may be likely to go to the bathroom somewhere else. Avoid the mess and ease your cats' stress levels by giving them each a litter box.


Keep a litter box on each floor of your house if you have more than one floor.
Make sure there is at least three feet between the litter box and food dishes.

, Having a food and water dish per cat will help you to be certain each cat is eating well. (For indoor cats, provide some fresh grass for each as well. This helps them digest their food.) Sometimes one cat will eat all the other's food.


Don't feed your cats too close together, or it might cause them to fight.
Especially when your new cat first arrives, place food dishes on opposite sides of the room, or opposite sides of a closed door.

, This is essential not just for transporting them, but it is also important for limiting their ability to physically contact each other. In the event of an emergency, you will need a carrier for each cat. Also, it can help both cats feel like they have a space of their own to hide in and increases their sense of safety.

Choose a cat with a similar temperament to your dog.,
Confine the cat in a separate room.,
Feed your animals on opposite sides of the door.,
Trade the dog and cat's toys.",How to Bring a Cat Home when You Have Dogs1," When adopting a cat, it is best to look for one that will fit the temperament, energy, and age of your dog. For example, if you have a calm, low-energy dog, a calm, mature cat may be a better fit than a young, rambunctious kitten. Choosing a cat that will match your dog’s personality will decrease the chance of conflict in the home.


Older dogs will do better with older cats, but older cats may not be used to socializing with older dogs. At the shelter, ask if there are any cats that are known to live well with dogs.Younger dogs and cats may be able to play together. By raising them together, you allow them to grow accustomed to another animal. Puppies are capable of injuring kittens, however, and may require extra supervision.;
, Before you bring the cat home, choose a room to isolate the cat in for the first few weeks. Place a food and water dish, litter box, toys, a scratching post, and a cat bed in this room.The goal is to let your pets slowly grow used to the other’s smell so that they do not think that the other pet is an intruder in their territory.


Bedrooms work well for this purpose. If you have a home office or a rec room with a door, you might also decide to put the cat in there.
Remember that the dog should not come into this room, nor should you let the cat leave it until you are ready to introduce the pets. Keep the door shut to separate the animals.
Different animals may adjust to their new housemates at different rates. For some situations, you may only need to confine the cat for a few days, while in other situations, you may need to keep the cat confined for up to a month.

, Once you have brought the cat home, you will want to slowly bring their scent to the dog. Place the cat’s food dish near the door of their confined room. Put your dog’s food dish on the opposite side of this door. Keep the door closed as you feed them. The dog and cat will pick up on each other’s scents, but they will associate them with pleasant experiences, such as eating.You may want to set the dishes about a foot or two away from the door and slowly inch them closer. This will slow the process, but it will reduce the chance that either the cat or dog will panic because of the other’s scent.
Your dog and cat may sniff at the crack of the door. You might even notice that both of them are near the door at the same time smelling each other through the space. Watch these interactions closely. If the dog barks or if the cat tries to swat under the door, they may not be ready to be introduced yet. If they move on and ignore the other, you might be able to let them meet.

, Another way that you can introduce your pets’ scents to one another is to give them each other's toys. Take a toy or blanket that your cat has used, and let your dog sniff it. Do the same with the dog’s toys in the cat’s room. This will help normalize the presence of the other pet in the house.


You can also rub a towel on each pet to pick up their scent. This towel can be placed under their food dish."
"
Keep cats separate at first.,
Introduce them by smell.,
Introduce them by sight.,
Switch their positions.,
Allow them to interact.,
Feed them around each other.",How to Bring a Second Cat Into the Family and Not Make Your Old Cat Upset2," Try not to let your cats even come into contact on their first few days. Put the newcomer in a small room by themselves. They will more comfortable in the smaller confines, and they will be unable to come into contact with your current cat. Start by doing this for seven days.This is a slow acclimation process, and you may have to repeat it.
Don't ignore your old cat when you get a new cat. This can cause your old cat to hate the new cat and feel sad.

, Allow the cats to smell each other under a door, but do not let them have physical contact. Bring toys or bedding that both cats use to allow the other to become accustomed to the new scent. This will help the cats get used to the idea that there is another cat around.


Help your new cat to acclimate to the scent of the old cat using footwear. After a couple days have gone by, rub a small clothing item (such as a sock) all over the old cat, to pick up its scent. Then place it in with the new cat. Watch the reaction. Hissing is normal, but if the new cat is okay with the old-cat-scented sock, praise the new cat and give it a treat.
Some behaviorists suggest rubbing the cats separately with the same towel to intermix their scents. First gently rub one cat with the towel. Then rub the other cat. After the towel carries both cats’ scents, bring the towel back to the first cat and rub her with it again , Don't let them come into physical contact. A child or doggy gate will work to separate them in this case. Watch how they interact. Does their body language indicate distress, or do they seem calm and accepting of the other? These signs will inform you as to how long the process should take. Calm, friendly cats do not require as long an acclimation process as ones who exhibit aggression.


Stack two baby gates on top of each other in the doorway to the new cat's room, to ensure neither cat can get to the other.
Let your old cat discover the new cat in the room on its own.
If they both have non-aggressive reactions, praise them and give them a treat. If not, shut the door and try again some other time
Keep the gates up for a while. You can leave the baby gates up and the two can meet and greet as they please.
Watch for defensive postures

Crouching
Head tucked in
Tail curved around the body and tucked in
Eyes wide open with pupils partially or fully dilated
Ears flattened sideways or backward on the head
Piloerection (hackles up/hair stands on end)
Turning sideways to the opponent, not straight on
Open-mouthed hissing or spitting
Might deliver quick strikes with front paws, claws out



, After some time, place your old cat in the room where you kept the new cat, and vice versa. This will let your old cat examine the smells of the new cat, and it will give the new cat a chance to be more familiarize itself with the space from which it was previously excluded. Do this a couple times, before proceeding in the acclimation process., Once they've had time to adequately acclimate to the new situation, let them come into contact with each other. Keep a spray bottle handy, in case of aggression. If your cats get along fine, you may be ready to let them both roam free. Even still, pay close attention to their behavior. The key to having a multi-cat household is preventing territorial aggression.Place them both in a room where you can supervise.
Only allow them about ten minutes or so for the first meeting. You can gradually increase it as the days go on, but you don't want them to become agitated.
Introductions can take weeks, or they can take months. The important thing to remember is to go at the cats' pace. It may be slow, but it's worth it if your cats will live together in peace.
Never physically punish your cat(s) for something like hissing or fighting with each other. This is a very common reaction. If one cat starts being aggressive pick the other cat up instead. And always make sure they are not just play fighting, these can be hard to tell apart.
Watch for offensive postures.

A stiff, straight-legged upright stance
Stiffened rear legs, with the rear end raised and the back sloped downward toward the head
Tail is held straight and stiff, like a classic Halloween cat's posture
Direct stare
Upright ears, with the backs rotated slightly forward
Piloerection (hackles up), including fur on the tail
Constricted pupils
Directly facing opponent, possibly moving toward him
Might be growling, howling or yowling



, When cats are eating from a bowl of food, they are in a non-aggressive state. By feeding them together, even across the room from each other, they get used to being non-aggressive when the other is present. Treats when both cats are calmly together can also help to reinforce good behavior.


Every time the cats see each other, give them treats. They will associate ""treat time"" with each other and feel the positive benefits of being around each other. It also shows them that they don't have to compete for food or attention, and that enough is provided for both of them.
If the cats won't eat, or become aggressive, they are probably too close together.
If they eat and seem relaxed, they can be moved closer together at the next feeding session.
This whole process can take weeks or even months. Signs of anxiety or aggression usually indicate that the introductions are proceeding too quickly. Address signs of outward aggression:

Swatting, striking with paws
Biting
Fighting
Growling, shrieking
Scratching
Preparing for an all-out attack by rolling onto side or back and exposing teeth and claws."

Know that there are many ways in which cat aggression manifests.,
Contain, limit, or restrict them if there is aggression.,
Get medication.",How to Bring a Second Cat Into the Family and Not Make Your Old Cat Upset3," Cats are complex, and not fully understood. But what we do know is that there are a number of distinct patterns of involved with cat aggression. These can be broken into a series of situation-oriented categories that are not mutually exclusive.Play aggression happens when cats take play too far.
Fear/Defense aggression comes from the cat feeling endangered, possibly irrationally.
Territorial aggression is usually just among cats, but can be expressed toward humans and other animals.
Petting aggression is not well understood, and may come from over-stimulation.
Inter-Male aggression relies on the natural competitive nature between toms.
Maternal aggression is the queen cat's instinctual protective response.
Redirected aggression can come from frustration the cat cannot vent, which get redirected toward another target, such as a nearby cat or person.
Predatory aggression derives from cats who predatory instincts are triggered.
Pain aggression results from old or current sensations of pain either from illness or trauma.
Idiopathic aggression is spontaneous, and may be a threat to the physical safety of those who come into contact with the cat.

, It is very important to deal with aggression among cats. Cats do not work out their problems with fighting. In cases with extended aggression, it may be necessary to limit or control the cat's the in each other's presence. This is so that they become accustomed to being in a non-aggressive state when the other is near. Make sure you are prepared to do this if either of your cats become consistently aggressive.


Have room set up with food, water, a litter tray, and cat bed, and put the newest cat in there, as a form of time-out, to let the tension decrease.
Use a leash or harness. This can give your cats more freedom, while still limiting their access to each other.

, If the cats still cannot get along, your veterinarian may prescribe medication for both. Keep in mind that medication is only part of the solution, and your veterinarian may be reluctant to prescribe it before checking you have explored all behavioral options for introducing the cats to each other correctly. Medications are not a magic bullet. It must be used in conjunction with slow introductions and consistent rewards for peaceful behavior. Use medication as a last resort.Benzodiazepines are sometimes used when cats are fearful or aggressive in a highly reactive way. However, benzodiazepines reduce the cat's ability to learn, which makes it harder to teach the cat's to get along.
Tricyclic antidepressants can be used in case where there is extended conflict in multiple cat homes.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) work on similar neurotransmitters as Tricyclic antidepressants, but they work differently and with less selectivity, so they have a more general effect on the brain."

Restrain the pets.,
Let the cat wander.,
Watch their body language.,
Continue supervising interactions.",How to Bring a Cat Home when You Have Dogs2," When they meet each other for the first time face to face, your dog and cat should be held so that they cannot attack the other. It is typically best to do this when there are two people present. Have one person hold the cat while the other keeps the dog on a leash.Your cat should be secure in your arms but not pinned down. The cat may be scared of the dog and react by squirming or scratching. If your cat wants to escape, take them back to their room.
If you do not have two people, you can hold the cat in your arms, and command the dog to sit as you bring them together. You could also let the cat wander free, and hold the dog on a leash. It is better to confine the dog than the cat in this scenario, as a caged or confined cat may become even more frightened., If the dog is calm and ignores the cat, you might consider letting the cat walk around the room freely. Watch where the cat goes and how they behave. If the cat and the dog ignore each other, it means that they do not see the other as an intruder or a danger.


Do not let the dog go off their leash at first. The dog may try to chase the cat.
Your cat may still be scared of your dog. The cat might try to bolt from the dog, hiss at the dog, or hide. In this case, take the cat back to their room, and try again another day., As you introduce the dog and the cat, you should carefully watch their body language for signs of aggression. If either animal seems tense, they may bolt or attack the other.


If the cat hisses, growls, swats, or runs from the dog, your cat may be scared or aggressive towards the dog. The cat may also raise their back while hissing.If your dog stares at your cat for long periods of time and ignores your commands while the cat is around, they may be anxious or worried about the cat. Their body will become tense and stiff, and they may start whining. They may also try lunging at the cat or tugging at their leash. This is a bad sign, as it means that your dog could become aggressive towards the cat.If your dog’s body is relaxed, it may mean that they are comfortable with the cat’s presence. A wagging tail is also a good sign. You should be able to easily distract your dog from the cat.
If the cat and dog are ignoring each other, it means that they do not mind each other’s presence. While they may not be fully comfortable with each other yet, they are not aggressive towards one another.

, Even if the dog and cat appear comfortable with each other, you should keep an eye on them during their first month home with each other. At this point, you should still confine the cat inside of their special room while you are not home. While the dog and cat may be calm at a distance, if one comes too close to the other, there might be a problem.If you notice the dog and the cat playing together or sleeping together, it may be a sign that they have become friends. Be warned that dogs can injure young cats even during innocent play.
Some breeds of dogs, such as Siberian Huskies or German Shepherds, have a high prey drive. This means that they may see your cat as prey or try to hunt your cat.While these breeds may be fine with a cat inside the house, they may start to hunt or attack the cat if they are outside together. If you have a dog like this, you may want to keep your cat inside at all times, and you may want to supervise their interactions for a longer period of time.
If the cat stops eating, drinking or socializing or if the cat refuses to use the litter box, it may be a sign that the cat is stressed or unhappy. Take the cat to a vet."

After you first introduce them, if the dog ignores the cat or acts friendly, you should give them a treat. Continue this while you are supervising their interactions.Do not physically punish the dog for barking, snapping, or growling at the cat. This will not reduce their stress or tension with the cat around. In fact, they may even associate the cat with punishment. Instead, remove the cat or confine the dog until they have calmed down., If your dog is trained to respond to commands, you can use them during the supervised sessions to help keep them calm. If you notice your dog starting to chase your cat, use a command like “halt” or “sit” to interrupt and distract them.If the dog listens to your commands and stops chasing the cat, you should give him a treat.Your dog should be easy to distract from the cat. If the dog ignores you to continue barking or chasing the cat, it could be a sign that your dog does not like cats.

, During the first few weeks, you should not let the pets wander alone together in the house until you are absolutely certain that they have accepted each other. If you want to let the cat wander in the house, you should confine the dog in their crate instead.If you have a kitten, you may want to confine them in their room for a few months until they grow a bit bigger. Small kittens are easily injured. You can still let the kitten out while you are home, but when you are gone, the kitten should go back to their room.

, Your dog may want to eat your cat’s food or feces. This is a natural instinct in your dog, but it can cause many problems. Not only will your cat not be able to eat, but either the cat or the dog may start a fight if interrupted during eating. Place the cat’s food dish on a table or counter where the dog cannot reach it. You should also place the litter boxes in a room, bathroom, or closet where the dog cannot get to it."

If you got the rodent before the cat, be ready to distract the cat with lots of cat toys and other things.,
Make sure your cat can't put its claws or paws through the wires of the rodent's cage.,
Get bedding that won't stick out of the cage easily.,
Make sure your rodent doesn't have rabies or other diseases.,
Move the rodent's cage every time your cat is not looking if it usually gets very close to the rodent.,
Let someone that is trusted or a family member watch your two pets while you are gone.,
Distract your cat with toys or teach it to do some tricks for a while.,
As soon as your cat wants to seem to eat your rodent, feed it if it has not been fed yet.,
Whenever your cat doesn't pay attention to the rodent, give it a treat.",How to Care for a Cat when You Have a Pet Rodent As Well," These may include, mice, rats, hamsters, etc. Cats usually like to eat mice and rats. If you have one of these as a pet, your cat may want to catch it.;
,, Still, you should get a strong cage and medication.

, For hamsters, try not to get a cage that doesn't have strong wires or walls.

, If you do have bedding that does that, either find another bedding that doesn't or just make it not stick out by pushing it in so the cat can't reach. If the cat does reach it, it could get extremely sick if he/she chewed or ate a piece. Rodents do their business on it.

, This can get your cat sick. Make sure your cat doesn't have any diseases either, or it may get the rodent sick if they are very close to it.

, You may not have time to do it every single time, so tell someone else to do it, or move the cage where the cat cannot reach it completely.

, Make sure you tell them exactly what to do. Consider letting someone that is good at caring for cats and rodents or two pets at the same time to do it.

, Give your cat its favorite toy, or teach it its favorite tricks.


Do not distract the rodent, because the cat will get close to the rodent while it's playing, and the rodent can't do anything about it if it's in its cage. When the cat is distracted, the rodent won't have to do anything but mind its own business.

, Try feeding it something it usually likes to eat, like a small snack of meat. Don't feed too much, though.

, This is a method for dogs, but you never know. You can also give your cat a treat to distract it, but only at least 1 or 2 treats a day.

Buy an onion.,
Cut the onion in half.,
Place the two onion halves in the room with the litter box.,
Expect the onion fumes to dissipate.,
Remove the onions when the litter-box smell returns.,
Do not allow your cats near the onion halves.,
Hide the onion halves.,
Put a colander or other perforated object over the onion half.,
Closely watch your cat.,
Have enough litter boxes in your house.,
Locate the box strategically.,
Change the litter at least every other day.",How to Use an Onion to Deodorize a Cat Litter Box," It doesn’t matter what color (red, yellow, white, etc.) or type of onion you purchase. All of them will be relatively effective. However, yellow onions will be the most effective for deodorizing your litter box, as they produce the most potent smell.Red onions are often the most expensive, so buying a yellow or white onion may be preferable.;
, Use a sharp knife to slice the onion down the middle to make two halves. If you wish, you may remove the outer layers of skin to avoid it flaking off and creating a mess. The onion skin plays no role in reducing litter-box odor, so can be discarded without consequence.


If you are using a large onion, you may decide to cut the onion into quarters. This will allow you to put onion sections in more places around the room.

, Place the onion sections in the room soon after you cut the onion. The onion will most effectively dispel unpleasant odors soon after you cut it.


Although it will be simplest to place the onion on the floor, you can experiment with different techniques. For example, try hanging the onion from the ceiling by passing a needle and thread through the onion and hanging it from a plant hanger.
The potent smell of the onion will counteract the urine smell. The onion fumes, which also make your eyes sting and water, will neutralize the smell of the room.While a cut onion will counteract the smells of cat litter, it can remove unpleasant odors throughout your home as well. For example, a sliced onion left out in your basement will remove any musty odors., Although the onion smell may initially be pungent in the room you have placed the onion halves, it will fade with time. Eventually the onions will dry out and lose their aroma.


Don’t worry about scaring your cat off with the aroma of onions. It’s unlikely that cats will find the onion smell unpleasant, as humans sometimes do.

, This indicates that your cut onions are no longer effective and need to be replaced. Experiment with how long the cut onions will last. You may be able to leave a single onion out for a week or longer.


Repeat this process with fresh onions. If you have the time and budget, you could try using different types of onions simultaneously.

, Onions are poisonous to cats. If your cat takes a small nibble from one of the onion halves in the litter-box room, she should be fine—but eating more than that can cause digestive health problems.Any of the Allium species of plants (which includes both onions and garlic) are toxic to cats.Allium species damage cats’ red blood cells, and diminish the amount of oxygen that these cells can carry.In severe cases, this anemia can lead to death.

, Rather than placing the halves in obvious locations that are easy for your cat to reach, look around the room and see where you could hide the onion. Be careful though—it can be difficult to hide things from cats, since they are curious and notorious climbers. Consider if you can:


Hide the onion behind a tall bookshelf,
Hide the onion beneath a tall sofa,
Hide the onion on a high shelf that your cat cannot jump up to.

, Because the smell of the onion needs to waft into the room, you can cover the onion as long as you do not put it under an airtight object.


This cover should prevent your cat from eating the onion. If your cat is persistent, use a heavy object to weight down the colander.

, If you suspect your cat has eaten a substantial portion of the onion, call your vet immediately. If you have reason for concern, look for symptoms caused by onion ingestion:Lethargy and weakness,
Poor muscle coordination and excessive salivation,
Vomiting or diarrhea.

, A standard rule of thumb is to have as many litter boxes as cats, plus one more.This way, you cat won’t have to travel far to find a litter box, and can take its pick between multiple boxes.


If you have 1 cat, you need 2 litter boxes. If you have 4 cats, you need 5 litter boxes.
Keep at least one litter box on every floor of your house.

, While your impulse may be to keep the litter box as much out of the way as possible, if you put it in an inconvenient location, your cat may not be able to find the box or may dislike the location.Follow these general rules when placing the litter box:


Keep it away from loud appliances, which may scare your cat.
Keep it far from your cat’s food and water bowls, for hygiene purposes.
If the litter box is in a room with a closed door, prop the door open or add a cat entrance.

, This is a general rule of thumb, although it can vary, depending on how many cats use the litter box.If you have several cats using the same litter box, you may need to change the litter once a day.


If your cat scratches the floor next to the litter box, this is his way of telling you that the litter needs to be changed. Cats don’t like to use a dirty litter box, and may start going to the bathroom around the house if the litter is dirty.

Outdoor cats are used to the open, and a covered box may make them feel closed-in., The box needs to be large enough for the cat to be able to move around in. Look for something that is the same length as your cat, plus another half.If you can't find a box that is large enough, use a plastic bin instead. Make sure that you cut a hole in the side so that the cat can go in and out. Be sure to leave the lid off., Different cats prefer different types of litter. Most outdoor cats are used to soil, so it might be a good idea to start with something that is similar in texture. Start with something that is fine, sand-like, and unscented. Over the next few weeks, mix in a little bit of litter. After a few weeks, you will be using just litter.


Keep an eye on your cat whenever you add more litter to the soil. If your cat refuses to use the litter box, he or she might not be ready for the change. Add in a little bit more soil.
If you don't know what sort of litter to use, consider buying a few different types and placing each one in a separate box. Choose the one that the cat uses.Consider using a natural litter, such as wood bark pellet, ground corn, or walnut shell pellet. These may appeal more to an outdoor cat.

, You need to have at least one litter box, but you may consider getting an extra one while your cat is learning to use it. If you have more than one cat, you will need one litter box per cat.

, The best places are quiet, such as a bathroom or laundry room. If you place the box in a busy, noisy area, the cat may feel stressed or anxious, and go to the bathroom elsewhere. If you notice that the cat has been going to the bathroom in a certain area, try to place the litter box there.


Never place the litter box in the same room as the cat's food and water. Cats are clean animals, and may refuse to eat if their food is too close to their bathroom area.
Avoid placing the litter box near ""scary"" areas. If a cat has to pass a dog's kennel or a noisy washing machine in order to get to the litter box, he or she may find some other place to go.
Consider placing the box near the door. That way, if your cat tries to go outside to go to the bathroom, he or she will see the litter box and may try to use it instead., If you cannot find a small enough litter box or plastic bin, you may use several sheets of newspaper instead. Keep the newspaper in the same spot and throw away the paper right after it gets dirty. If the kitten starts to go to the bathroom elsewhere, pick the kitten up and move him or her to the newspaper.

, Cats won't use a dirty litter box, so you want to make things as appealing as possible. Use a litter scooper to lift the feces and clumped urine out of the litter.

, Simply scooping out the poop and urine is not enough. Overtime, the litter itself will absorb odors and become stinky. This won't be appealing to your cat, and he or she may find some place else to go to the bathroom. To prevent this from happening, you will need to toss the old litter out once a month, and fill the box up with fresh litter.

, Some cats will understand that this is their new bathroom, while others will need more help. Try lifting your cat up and gently setting him or her down onto the litter. If your cat jumps out, do not force him or her back into it. The cat may need more time to get used to the texture.

, If you see your cat using the box, wait until the cat is done before giving it a reward. Praise the cat, and pet it where it likes to be petted. Be sure to give your cat a treat as well.

, If you see your cat going to the bathroom else where, but still close to the box, pick your cat up and carry him or her to the box. If the cat is too far away, wait until the cat is done, then move the poop into the box. Let your cat see the poop in the box. If you cat went pee, see if you can cut the pee out of the item and move the scrap to the box. If the cat went pee on the carpet or on something that cannot be cut, clean the area immediately using an enzyme cleaner. This will break down the cat urine.


Do not use an ammonia-based product to clean cat urine. Ammonia smells similar to urine to a cat's nose. If you use that to clean, your cat may return to the same spot the next time it needs to go.

, If you punish your cat, he or she may start to grow afraid of you. If you try to force it into the litter box, the cat may also grow afraid of the box and try to avoid it.

, It's a powder that looks a little bit like dried catnip. You add it to the litter box; it helps attract cats to it. You can find litter attractant in the litter or medical section of a pet store.

, Some cats will start using the litter box almost right away, but others will need more time to figure what it is for and how to use it. This can take a few days to a few weeks.

, If the cat is avoiding the litter box, he or she may have a reason. Maybe the area is too noisy, too dark/bright, or too drafty. If your cat keeps going to the bathroom in the same spot, try moving the litter box to that spot.


Make sure that you are cleaning up the places where the cat eliminates. Any trace smell of feces or urine will tell the cat that this is a bathroom spot, and the cat is more likely to return to it.

, Sometimes, cats avoid litter boxes for medical reasons. For example, if the cat has a urinary tract infection, he or she may try to seek out a softer surface to urinate on. Cats are also attracted to their owners, and will seek out their smell when sick, hurt, or frightened. If you find that your cat has been going to the bathroom on your bedding or clothes, there could be an underlying health problem.


If your cat keeps avoiding the box, study its urine and feces. A red or pink tint to the urine usually signifies an infection. If the poop is tarry, or has black or red streaks in it, your cat could be very sick. You should take your cat to the vet immediately.

, If you have a male cat who is not neutered, he may be spraying your house to mark his territory. Neutered male cats do not do this. Ask your vet about getting your male cat fixed; this may help resolve the spraying problem.

Before you bring your cat home, give her a scent introduction. Swap scents by taking a t-shirt with your smell on it to her for her to use as bedding. Likewise, take a blanket she already uses at the shelter and put it in the bed of your established cat.


This allows him to get used to the idea of another cat on his patch but without her physical presence challenging him.;
, This machine gives off a synthetic version of a feline pheromone, which helps the cats feel secure and decreases stress levels. This helps to chill the established cats so they are more relaxed with any changes.


There is a canine equivalent called Adaptil, containing canine pheromones. If you have a dog and are introducing a new cat, the Adaptil will help him feel safe and calm., To introduce a new cat, create a safe room for her. She will be overwhelmed by the sights, smells, and sounds of her new environment, make your new cat feel at ease with one room of the house that is just hers. This way, she can feel safe and take time to adjust to her new environment.Here's what you should put in the safe room:


Ample food and water.
A litter box. Position the litter box as far away from the food and water as possible so the cat has a distinction between the eating and bathroom areas of the home.
Toys. Put in toy mice, dangly toys, little balls, feathered toys, and any other toys that can keep the cat active and entertained.
A scratching post. Cats naturally love to scratch things to mark their territory, so it will help her feel more comfortable in her new environment and will keep her from scratching your furniture.
An old blanket, bed, or toy from her previous home. This will make the cat feel at home and give her a designated sleeping area.Plenty of hiding places. She will want to hide to help her feel safe, which builds her confidence and will help her feel bold enough to explore., Cats tend to like thinly granulated litter, so make sure to bring home litter that doesn't overwhelm your cat with its scent or texture. Place her litter box in a quiet but accessible part of the safe room. This way, she will feel safe using it.


If she is an older cat, she may have a preference for a certain litter. Ask her previous owner what litter she uses. Otherwise, she may reject your new litter.
If the cat obviously dislikes the litter and spends time batting it out of the box, or if she circles the box nervously and shows an obvious distaste for it, you should try a different litter.
Don't punish the cat for not using the box. If your new cat thinks the carpet is a new bathroom, don't put her face in the litter box or punish her by putting her in the box. This may make your cat even more reluctant to use the new box.

, The wrong way to introduce a new cat is to let her roam right when you get her. Do not let her into the main house and let her explore. Not only will she feel overwhelmed and stressed, but your established pets will view her as invading their territory and are likely to chase her. This will compound and legitimize her distress and fear.When you bring her home, put her directly into the safe room to get acclimated before letting her roam the rest of the house.

, If you want to make your new cat feel at home, give her lots of love. Don't constantly pet the cat, especially if she doesn't like it. Instead, spend as much time in the safe room as possible. This will make her more comfortable and less anxious.


Also let her explore you. Lie down on the floor to reduce your height, which makes you less intimidating. Hang out around her and let her smell you, walk around you, brush up against you, or even climb on you. Getting to know you will help transition her to the rest of her environment. Do this before you start hugging her or picking her up.
Have cat treats on you. When she approaches, offer some treats either by tossing them on the floor to land near her, or offering them out on a flat hand.Play with her as much as you can, whether you're playing with a dangly toy or moving a laser pointer around the room. Just wait a few days before you start using interactive toys or she may be overwhelmed.
Avoid looking directly at the cat because staring is a sign of aggression to her. Watch her from the corner of your eye and be sure to blink regularly, which will help to put her at ease., If she is hides often, give her plenty of time before offering to let her explore beyond the cat room. If she seems bold and is regularly waiting at the door, consider leaving the door ajar after a week so she can explore further.This time period can vary. If your cat is rambunctious and clawing at the door after just a few days, you shouldn't make her feel trapped in the one room and let her explore. On the other hand, if she still seems frightened by the new environment and has made no attempts to leave the room in over a week, give her more time to get adjusted.

, If you introduce your new cat to the family in the middle of a hectic time, such as the holiday season, she will be overwhelmed by the sounds and smells of the people and events. If you bring your new cat home when you're too stressed out or too busy to spend time with her, she'll feel very lonely., When you first get a new cat, explain to your children that she needs time and space to settle in. Let them visit the new cat under supervision and for short periods of time. Give the children treats to place on the floor to offer her or else let them take in her food bowls. This will help the children feel part of the situation.


Encourage them to be quiet and still in the cat's room, sit on the floor, and be patient to see if the cat comes to them.
Do not allow the children to pull the cat's tail, ears, legs, or whiskers or mistreat her at all.
Do not allow children to stare at the cat in her hiding place because she will feel threatened. Also, teach the children to respect the cat's body language. If she hisses, hunches up, or her eyes go big and black, she is afraid. If any child sees her do this, he should back off and make sure the cat has a clear, unblocked route to her hiding place., First, bring in things from the rest of the house so she can get used to different smells and sights. Let her smell a pillow from the couch or a blanket from your guest room. Next, open the door and wait for cat to venture out on her own as she explores the sights and smells of the rest of the house. You should be around for this, but don't distract her.


The first few times you leave the door open, do so at night when the house is quiet and she can get her bearings. If she leaves the room of her own, she can find her way back if she feels threatened.
If you're not at home, put the new cat back into the safe room. Wait for her to feel completely comfortable with the rest of the house before you let her roam when you're not around. , Once she gets used to the rest of the house, slowly move her food and litter box to the place you want to keep them permanently. Just make sure the cat knows where you move them, or she will be very anxious.


All of these methods will work for introducing a new cat to your family whether you have other pets or not., For the first week, you should keep your new cat in her safe room and keep your other cat or cats in the rest of the house. Make sure the safe room isn't a favorite room of your other cat, or he will try to go in the room and feel anxious when not allowed inside.Let the cats stay in their separate environments. They will slowly become accustomed to one another's sounds and presences.

, Let the cats get accustomed to each other's smells before they officially meet. Start brushing them with the same brush, petting one cat and then petting another, or introducing one cat to the other cat's favorite blanket or toy.


At first, the cats may feel threatened by the new smell, but they should get used to it.
Start leaving the door to the safe room open a crack, so the cats can start smelling each other.
Rub a towel against the new cat's scent glands on the cheek and give it to the old cats to investigate. Do the opposite thing with the old cat's scent glands as well. This will help your cats learn each other's scent in concentrated form., Put the new cat in her carrier and take her to another room in the house. She will still need her room, so keep it as her territory for the time being. Place the carrier containing the new cat on a safe chair so the cats can sniff and explore the each other without them chasing each other or fighting. Raise the cat carrier off the floor to elevate the new cat and helps her to feel less vulnerable.The old cats will approach your new cat with curiosity, to smell and get to know each other.
If the new cat or old cats are acting very aggressively, end the meeting. Don't rush this process. Just separate the cats and try again the next day. If things didn't go well, make sure to play with each cat separately prior to each meeting so that they are physically tired and less likely to look for a fight.

, Consider feeding your cats on either side of a barrier where they can see but not reach each other. A mesh child gate is a good option. You want to engineer meetings without tension so they accept each other's company without stress.


You should always be around for their interactions, because things could get violent or aggressive.If the behavior remains violent, feed them in opposite parts of the house. Then, slowly bring their food closer together, until they get used to eating side by side.

, Start giving the cats more time to be together each day as your new cat gets used to the rest of the house. Each day, make sure that the cats like each other more and spend more time together. If things seem to be getting worse, bring your new cat back to the safe room.


At first, maintain separate litter boxes for each cat. They need their own resources, which includes litter trays, feeding and water bowls, and beds. To force a cat to share instantly creates friction between the cats.
Make sure that the cats' time together is happy and calm. When the cats are together, you should feed them, give them treats, play with them, and give them lots of love and attention. They should associate their time together with happiness and fun., If you have other pets, introduce the new cat to each of the cats first. Take it one pet at a time, and have the new cat adjust to your cats before you bring in the dog. The cat will hear the dog and will know that there's another pet in the house, but if you introduce the dog first, the cat will be confused and overwhelmed.


If you have multiple cats, introduce the cat to the alpha cat first.

, If you've tried these techniques for over a month and your cats are not getting along, it's time to find a new home for your new cat. If the cats are constantly fighting, hissing, and growling, and they can't be alone together, they never will.


Though this will be very disappointing, remember it's better than living in a home with warring pets, or leaving two cats in a violent environment. You want your new cat to be safe and happy, whether it's in your home or not.

, For the weeks leading up to the introduction, work on the dog's basic training. You want him to instantly obey commands such as ""Sit"" and ""Stay"". This way, you have control over the dog if he starts chasing the cat., Give the cat time to get used to her new environment before she meets your dog. Once she's comfortable in her safe room, let your cat and dog get to know each other., Take the dog for a long walk prior to the meeting so that he is tired when he meets the cat. Keep your dog on a leash when the two pets meet so he is less likely to be aggressive and so your new cat feels less threatened.


Try and make the introductions when a friend or family member is around so there can be one person per animal.
Make sure the cat has a clear escape route so she can leave if it gets too much.
When the dog and cat are in the same room, reward the dog when he ignores the cat. Tell him what a clever boy he is and keep his attention with treats. Let him turn to look at the cat but if he starts to growl or show signs chasing such as his hackles rising, tell him to ""Sit"", and reward the sit. , Consider giving the dog an ultra tasty distraction, such as a stuffed Kong, when the cat is in the room. The tasty treat may override his interest in chasing the cat. Also, it teaches the dog to associate the cat with pleasant things such as a treat rather than triggering his predatory behavior., You can open the safe room and let the cat venture into the environment where the dog is. Let them sniff and circle each other, but always be prepared to act if it gets aggressive. This can take weeks, so be patient and let the cat move at the pace that is right for her., Once they get more comfortable and show no aggression, stop using the leash on your dog. However, still monitor their interactions carefully and don't leave them alone together. If there is any biting, chasing, or aggressive behavior from either pet, break him or her up and call an end to the daily interaction session. Keep monitoring them until you are satisfied that they are used to each other.


Don't leave the dog and cat alone in the same room until you are completely comfortable with their interactions.
Be extra careful if you're introducing a big dog to a tiny kitten."

Be available for your cat.,
Let yourself be claimed.,
Appreciate being chosen.,
Watch for signs of trust.,
Make the first move as needed.,
Recognize signs of affection.,
Play with your cat.",How to Show Affection to a Cat1," Many dogs tend to react to any opportunity for attention by running, yelping, and slobbering in appreciation. Cats are more likely to want to dictate the times and terms of affection, although they may want some prodding from you from time to time.It’s hard to show affection if you are never around, so be a present cat parent when possible. Simply sitting in the same room will present your cat with opportunities to display affection and give clues that it desires reciprocation.
Talk to your cat when you're spending time together. Whether your cat can actually learn to recognize any of your words or not, the act of talking provides an opportunity for interaction that can be reciprocated in the feline's preferred manner.
If your cat has to spend long stretches of time alone, play with your cat before you go out, and provide an environment where the cat can entertain himself, such as having toys available, and a high perch where he can watch what's going on outside. Then, be sure to play with your cat when you do return.;
, While most cats are content with their own company, that does not mean they prefer being solitary creatures. A cat that wants to include you in its circle is in turn seeking proof of your acceptance of this inclusion.The well-known cheek rub (or “bunting”) performed by cats — really often a full-body rub from nose to tail — is a way for them to mark you with their scent. Cats release pheromones from glands in their cheeks, and use this scent marking to in essence claim you. Simply permitting this bunting to occur is an easy way to show affection by accepting affection.

, Cats, like people, like to shower those they love with gifts, although these gifts may be a dead mouse placed on your pillow instead of a bouquet of roses. If you’re lucky, your gift might just be a favorite toy or plaything.A cat’s choice to sleep on or near you is also usually a sign of affection. Cats, like any animal, are vulnerable when asleep, and need to fully trust your affection and protection to sleep so close to you. So, even if you might prefer not sharing the foot of your bed with your cat, doing so shows appreciation and affection on your part., In addition to displaying trust by cozying up next to you, a cat can display affection-via-vulnerability by stretching out and exposing its stomach and underside to you.Be aware, however, that many cats may expose their stomachs without actually wanting you to pet them there. Watch for signs of interest in being petted, or gently stroke the cat’s belly and see if you get away without being scratched and/or bitten.
Here again, sometimes the best way to show affection to a cat is to let them show you affection and to accept it graciously.

, While many cats are not shy about showing affection, others seem aloof because they are waiting for you to show affection to them first — or at least for you to put yourself in a position to be properly shown affection by them. Some cats just want you to make a fuss over them first.Looming over a cat makes them nervous; it is what predators do just before they attack. Take yourself down to the cat’s level. Sit or squat so they can be more or less face-to-face with you. When petting, rather than lowering your hand down from above (too much like a hawk swooping down), bring it in from the side or below, and gradually work your way to the top of the cat.
Don't chase a nervous cat. Many cats will be more likely to approach you if you ignore them. When they finally do come close, let them smell you before trying to touch them. If the cat's ears are moved to the back of its head it means they dislike what you are doing to them, so come back, and try something else that they might like.
Always let your cat sniff your hand, if he/she leans away don't pet them at that moment. If your kitty rubs against your hand, he/she wants to be petted.

, Some cats love being petted, others simply tolerate it, and some just plain dislike it. They best way to find out is to gently pet your cat in a “safe” spot like along the spine and gauge its reactions. Purring, for instance, is a good positive sign. Petting a cat that doesn’t want or like it can cause undue stress and will not be perceived as affection.You can encourage “bunting” by holding out your index finger at about the cat’s eye level, within a short distance away or even across the room. Most cats will interpret this as a sign that you want to be rubbed and marked.“Cat kisses” — slow blinks of half-closed, sleepy-looking eyes — are a typical sign of feline affection and can easily be reciprocated by you. You can also offer cat kisses yourself first and wait for a response from your cat., As with any companion, sharing quality time together and having fun is a universal sign of affection. Cats love to play; figure out what activities yours enjoys most and spend time every day playing together.Most cats enjoy chasing and catching things, so everything from toy mice to wadded up sheets of paper can make a fun game. A ping-pong ball taped to a string or a laser pointer swirling its beam along the floor (but never anywhere near the cat’s eyes) can provide entertaining exercise as well.
Cats love to climb and scratch, so consider a tiered scratching post, perhaps with a target or toy at the top to present a goal/challenge. Many cats like to hide in something such as a cardboard box and pounce out at a moving toy as well.Keep play sessions relatively short, and spread them out throughout the day. Don’t force a cat to play or train, or play time can turn sour quickly. Cats also tend to bore easily, so mix up the games and routines often. But always be mindful of how your cat responds — no two cats are alike in their play preferences.
Spend playtime with your cat, not only to prevent possible injury — such as the choking hazard presented by something as simple as a string — but also to train and create bonding time with your feline friend.
Catnip is completely harmless to cats, and they enjoy it very much!

Ask about special needs for the dog.",How to Dog‐Sit when You Have a Cat," Before bringing the dog over to your house, ask its owner if you and your cat can meet the dog in a neutral location. This location could be in a public park or a pet store—somewhere where your cat and the dog will both be at ease (don’t meet at a busy street corner), but where neither animal will feel like their territory is being infringed upon. A neutral meeting space should prevent your cat from being overly defensive, and the dog from feeling threatened.


Do not leave the animals together unsupervised. Both animals should remain leashed during this initial interaction, in case the dog becomes abruptly hostile or tries to play too aggressively.If the animals seem to get along well—neither behaves aggressively, and they both show an interest in continuing to play together—then allow them to sniff each other and engage in mild play.;
, When your cat and the dog you’re pet-sitting meet in your living space, it’s important that it’s in a controlled environment. Bring the dog in on a leash (so it can’t chase the cat), and slowly walk it towards your cat. Let the two animals slowly examine each other; don’t rush interactions between them.Once the animals have sniffed noses and the dog has calmed down (if it was initially excited), you may let the dog off the leash. Continue to keep a close eye on the dog for the first 30 minutes—make sure it doesn’t become hostile.
If your cat initially runs away or hides, that’s okay. It will take time for your cat to feel comfortable around the dog—but as long as neither animal is aggressive, this is a normal process.

, Especially if either animal is not accustomed to being around different species, it may take them some time to feel comfortable around each other. Assuming that all interactions are peaceful (no barking, biting, hissing, or scratching), you can leave the animals alone to grow used to each other’s presence and smells.The best outcome may be indifference between the animals. Often, dogs and cats want little to do with each other, especially if the dog can play outside while the cat naps.

, When a dog and cat are meeting for the first time, their body language can indicate how well they’ll get along. Your cat will show anger or fear by laying its ears flat back against its head and swishing its tail, or puffing up its fur.If your cat exhibits this behavior, remove the dog from the room. Try to introduce them again later, once they’ve both calmed down.


The dog may exhibit predatory behavior near your cat, indicating that it intends to chase or attack the cat. Signs of predatory intent include: stiffening body, an intent stare, and barking or whining.Remove the dog if it exhibits these behaviors, and don’t bring it near your cat again without putting the dog on a leash.

, Even if your cat and the dog you’re pet-sitting get along reasonably well, your cat will still need a separate space, away from the dog, where it can retreat and eat, nap, and spend time alone. Cats generally have less social energy than dogs, and will be less interested in constantly playing. Set your cat’s food, water, and toys in a room that you can keep the dog out of.Giving your cat space and time to be alone will be especially important if it’s old. Older cats move slower and are less playful, and will quickly become exasperated with a new dog.
If you have child-proof gates or other devices that can block doorways in your home, set these up outside of your cat’s room.

, Bringing a new dog into your cat’s life—even temporarily—will seriously disrupt its daily routine, so you should try to be as consistent as possible with your behavior around the cat. Feed it at the times you usually do, and make sure to give your cat the same amount of attention that you normally do, if not more.


Your cat may initially treat you with suspicion even when the dog is not around, since you’ll likely pick up the dog’s smell.

, If the dog you’re watching starts to growl or snap at the cat, you may need to keep the animals separate. Since your cat is likely used to having freedom to roam the house, you don’t need to infringe on that freedom—try shutting the dog outdoors (if the weather is warm), or shut the dog in a large room with food and water, so your cat can move through the rest of the house.Alternately, if the dog’s hostility is mild, you could distract it with a treat or a new toy.Take the dog outside and throw a ball several times; when you bring it back inside, it may have forgotten about the cat altogether.

, In some instances of dog sitting, the dog may never feel comfortable around your cat, and may continually try to chase, attack, or kill the cat. The dog’s predatory instinct will be especially triggered if your cat frequently runs away from it.Keep the cat and dog separate in your house or apartment: shut the dog in the backyard or another large space, such as a living room, and keep your cat secluded in your bedroom or another small room.


The dog may calm down over time, if given opportunities to smell the cat (from under the door or through a gate) and acclimate to the cat’s smell and presence.If the dog’s aggression and hostility do not diminish, you may need to call the dog’s owner. If you’re concerned for the wellbeing of your cat, ask if the owner can return and reclaim their dog early
If the owner cannot return, ask if there is another individual who can take the dog off your hands. If not, you may need to temporarily take the dog to an animal shelter or a veterinarian’s office, where it can be safely kept in a kennel.

, Even if the dog and your cat got along reasonably well—or were kept apart from one another—the dog’s presence probably disrupted your cat’s typical schedule. To help your cat feel comfortable and “back to normal” after the dog goes home, return it to the feeding and play-time schedule that you kept before house-sitting the dog.


If you restricted or altered your cat’s access to rooms in your house or apartment while house-sitting the dog, return your cat’s normal access to rooms.
Returning your cat to a normal schedule will be especially important if you house-sat the dog for an extended period of time (e.g. over a month).

, Although your main concern may be for the safety and wellbeing of your cat, you still need to take good care of the dog and pet-sit it properly. Keep the dog on a leash, and walk it from room to room within your house, giving it plenty of time to sniff and smell around each room.


Ask the owner if he or she can bring the dog’s bed and favorite toys over with the dog. Having access to familiar bedding and toys will help the dog feel more at home, even in a strange house.

, As much as possible, help the dog adhere to the schedule that it typically follows at its owner’s house. This will increase its comfort with you and around your house, and should result in the dog being more relaxed and easygoing around your cat. Follow a consistent schedule for feeding and exercising the dog: follow the number and frequency of meals and outdoors walks that the owner suggests.In order to find out the dog’s typical routine, you’ll need to check with the owner before they leave town. If the owner keeps to a complicated feeding or exercising routine for their dog, ask the owner to come to your house or apartment and demonstrate how to feed or exercise the dog.
Then, stick closely to this daily routine once the owner has departed.

, If you’re concerned about the dog having too much energy and overwhelming your cat with playful attention, focus on exercising the dog. This will help tire it out and take away some of its energy.Play with the dog in your backyard, take it on a walk or hike, or bring the dog to a nearby dog park so it can play with other dogs.


Check with the owner ahead of time and ask when and for how long they exercise their dog. If they usually walk their dog for an hour a day, you’ll need to do the same; a single 15-minute walk will leave the dog unsatisfied and anxious., This will vary depending on the length of time for which you’re watching the dog. If you’re pet-sitting a long-haired dog, it may need daily brushing and other maintenance, including mat removal.Check with the dog’s owner ahead of time; ask how often they groom their dog, and ask to borrow any specialized equipment that the owner uses.


In addition to grooming, it’s important that you spend time petting and/or cuddling with the dog, especially if it feels separation anxiety from its owners.However, don’t neglect your cat during this time either—it may feel neglected if you only play with the dog. You’ll need to spend time petting each animal separately.

, Many dogs—especially older animals—may have a special diet, or need other daily accommodations. Check with the owner before they drop off the dog, and ask if the dog needs any special food, has unique grooming requirements, or needs to be given medication.Find out which veterinarian or veterinary hospital you should take the dog to if it becomes sick or injured. The owner may take the dog to a specialist, or may prefer that you take the dog to a vet that already has the animal’s health records."

Nourish your cat properly.,
Provide your cat with personal space.,
Take your cat to the veterinarian as recommended.,
Keep your cat well-groomed.",How to Show Affection to a Cat2," If, as they say, the way to a man’s heart is his stomach, the same can be claimed as one way to demonstrate affection toward (and receive it from) your cat.


It is best to talk to your veterinarian regarding your cat’s particular nutritional needs, but generally speaking, most cats need three to four smallish meals per day, preferably of high-quality cat foods. Some human foods are all right for cats, but others are not, and it is best to check with your vet.Give treats responsibly. Take care not to give the cat too many calories so deduct part of their regular food to compensate when giving treats.
Forget about the saucer of milk. Cats have difficulty digesting cow’s milk, and should instead be provided with clean water at all times (that is, keep the dish full of fresh water 24/7).

, Cats are often more sociable than people give them credit for, but they still like having some spots all to themselves.Even if your cat likes to sleep on or near you regularly, provide it with a soft, comfortable, semi-isolated space of its own for sleeping and lounging. Old (but clean) blankets, bedding, and pillows can do the trick.
Likewise, your cat’s litter box should be in a quiet yet accessible space, and should be cleaned daily. If you have more than one cat, add one extra litter box (three boxes for two cats, for instance) to help prevent any “turf wars.”

, Your cat may not see it as such at the time, but what in the long run shows more affection than doing everything you can to ensure your cat lives a happy, healthy, long life?


Veterinary care recommendations for cats will vary according to factors such as age, health history, and vet preference, but one to two checkups per year is common.
Starting as a kitten, make sure you keep your cat up-to-date on its vaccinations.
Refer to How to Care for Your Cat for detailed information on veterinary care and warning signs of cat illness to look out for.

, True enough, cats are quite adept at keeping themselves clean and looking good. But a little help from you, properly applied, will be beneficial and (at least sometimes) appreciated.Most cats will permit themselves to be brushed, if done gently and with the proper tool. Try a pin brush for long-haired cats and a slicker brush for short-hairs. Brush as needed to keep matting of fur to a minimum. There are also specialized brushes and tools for more sensitive areas such as around the eyes.
Brushing also provides an excellent opportunity to check for fleas and ticks.
While less appreciated, brushing your cat’s teeth and/or bringing it to the vet’s office for dental cleanings is good practice as well. How to Care for Your Cat has information on feline dental care as well.

Clean the box daily.,
Use baking soda.,
Dispose of contents weekly.,
Get rid of the box yearly.,
Have one box per cat.,
Figure out what type of box to purchase.,
Consider natural litter.,
Find a room with good air flow.,
Keep it away from main areas.,
Make sure there’s enough light.",How to Prevent Your Litter Box from Stinking up Your House," One of the best ways to keep the odor from your cat’s litter box, from overtaking your home, is to clean the box daily.


Get in the habit of scooping out feces and urine on a daily basis. Determine a set time to do this and make it a part of your daily routine.
If you’re not using litter that clumps, use a large, metal spoon to pull out the big wet spots as well.
Place the contents in a plastic bag and immediately place them outside. Don’t leave the dirty litter sitting in your trashcan, as this will also contribute to the smell.;
, When you’re cleaning out the litter box, consider using baking soda. While there are deodorizers available on the market, the smell may be offensive to cats. The baking soda will act as a deodorizer, without the artificial scent.Another benefit to baking soda is that it is inexpensive. You don’t have to spend a lot of money on a deodorizing product.

, In addition to cleaning the litter box daily, make sure the box is emptied and cleaned on a weekly basis.


Dump out all of the litter and wash the box with unscented soap and water. Make sure to wash the scoop or spoon you use as well.
Let everything dry before refilling the box with litter. Don’t overfill the box, keep the litter only 2-3 inches deep. This will make it easier for you to clean., To further prevent litter box odor from consuming your home, try to replace the box every year. Boxes become increasingly difficult to sanitize as the year wears on, due to scratch marks from your cat’s claws.Consider donating the box to a local shelter if you feel uncomfortable about throwing it away.

, Purchasing the right products is equally as important as cleaning, in the battle against smelly litter boxes. If you have more than one cat, you’re going to need more than one litter box. A good rule of thumb is have one box per cat.


Just like you, cats need some space of their own. More importantly, keeping a litter box clean that is being used by more than one animal will be extremely difficult.If you have multiple cats and can manage it, try having an extra litter box on hand. For example, if you have two cats, ideally you should have three litter boxes. The third should be placed in a neutral area.
The reason for the extra box is that some cats are territorial and/or aggressive. If one of your cats is not allowing the other one to use the box, that cat will have to find somewhere else to go to the bathroom. In short, you could have a very messy and smelly situation on your hands!

, Although it may seem as if any type of box is acceptable, that isn’t necessarily the case. You’ll need to consider the type of material, as well as the size of the box.


Plastic is the preferred material for litter boxes since it’s easy to clean.
In general, it’s better to get a box that is at least twice the size of your cat. If you currently have a kitten, do your best to estimate how big he/she will be when they are grown.Purchasing a box that is covered may be off putting to your cat. These types of boxes trap smells inside, so if you're not good at cleaning the box on a daily basis, the smell may offend your cat. If the cat isn’t able to use the box, they’ll find another place around your home to do their business instead.

, Though there isn’t a perfect litter in terms of odor control, many of the natural litters have good reviews in this particular category.Amongst the top natural litter options - corn, wheat, pine, walnut and paper - all but paper received decent reviews for odor control. As with any type of litter though, none of them have a perfect track record of keeping the smell at bay.
If you’re uncertain as to which one will work best for your cat, try using different types in different boxes. For example, you may use walnut in one and pine in another. See which one the cat gravitates to. If the cat doesn’t seem to have a preference for either, choose the one, which best covers the odor.

, The last thing you want to do is to keep the litter box in a small, closed off room. The smell will not only deter the cat, but will force him/her to find another place to use the bathroom.


It may be beneficial if the room has a window with a screen. That way, you’re able to keep the room ventilated without fear of the cat getting out.
During the summer months, be sure the room is at a comfortable temperature by using a fan or the air conditioning.

, Rooms such as the kitchen or the main living room aren’t recommended spots for the litter box. These are the rooms, which see the heaviest traffic and not only will your guests not want to witness your cat using the bathroom, but the cat won’t be pleased by the company either.


Try not to place the cat’s litter box next to his/her food. This will only serve as a distraction for the cat.
Find a space, which is near to where the cat spends the majority of its time, but at a distance from the main living area.You may want to place the box in a guest room or bathroom, which isn’t frequently used. However, when guests come to stay, be aware that you will have to move the box, which may result in confusion for your cat.

, Just like us, cats don’t prefer to spend time in the dark. If they can’t see where they’re going to the bathroom, chances are you’ll be left with a smelly mess to deal with.


While it’s true that cats are better equipped to deal with darkness, they still are unable to see in the pitch black.Older cats, in particular, struggle with seeing in the dark, so be sure the litter box is well lit even at night.
Consider placing a night light close to the box so that cats can find it at all times.

Hide a stuffed toy under a blanket.,
Let your kitten play in a paper bag.,
Provide your kitten with plush toys.,
Use trial and error to figure out what your kitten likes.",How to Play With a Kitten1," You don't need to stock up on fancy cat toys to have fun. You may have something your cat would love just lying around the house. If you have any ping pong balls, or similar types of balls, your kitten will love playing with these.Bounce a ping pong ball against the wall and allow your kitten to chase it. Ping pong balls bounce easily, so they'll move around fast. This is sure to attract a kitten's attention.;
, A ribbon or a string is a simple toy kittens will love. Kittens love pretending to stalk prey, so dragging a ribbon or string across the ground is sure to entertain them. You can remove a shoe string or cut off a piece of ribbon to play with your cat.You can also tie a small plush toy at the end of a string or ribbon and drag it across the floor.

, Place a small plush toy under a blanket. Wiggle it around so your kitten thinks it's a mouse or other animal. Your kitten will pounce on the toy and get plenty of fun playing a game like this.However, make sure it's an old blanket if your kitten is not declawed. Kitten claws can seriously damage fabrics.
You may not want to play this game if you let your kitten sleep in your bed. This may encourage your kitten to pounce on your feet while you're trying to sleep.

, If you get home from the grocery store, place a paper bag on the ground. Many kittens love playing in paper bags. You can take a small toy and poke the sides of the paper bag with it. This will give your cat something to play with inside the paper bag.You can also set down a paper bag while playing with a ribbon or string with your cat. The kitten will use the paper bag as a hiding spot from which to jump out at their pray.

, Kittens love play hunting. In the wild, play is a form of practice for hunting later in life. Your kitten will love having small plush toys to stalk. Choose toys big enough for your kitten to carry in its mouth.You can throw these toys around for your kitten like a ping pong ball. However, plush toys are also great as your kitten will play with them on its own. This can help keep your kitten entertained while you're out of the house.
Some plush toys are filled with catnip. This can make your kitten extra playful.

, Every kitten has different preferences when it comes to toys. If your kitten doesn't like a certain toy, don't try to force it. Buy a variety of types of toys for your kitten and see what it takes to."

Correct bad behaviors gently.,
Praise positive behavior.,
Ignore your kitten when it misbehaves.,
Do not let your kitten play with your hands or fingers.",How to Play With a Kitten2," Kittens often do not understand boundaries. When young, they may view you as a kitten. They may bite your hand or another body part during play. You should never scold or punish a kitten for this behavior. It's likely to make a kitten nervous. Instead, gently correct the behavior.When a kitten bites you, gently say, ""No."" Then, pull your hand away.
Provide your kitten with a toy to chew on instead.

, In addition to correcting bad behavior, praise your kitten for behaving. If your kitten has been pouncing on your feet when you walk by, and refrains from doing it one day, say something like, ""Good kitten!"" If your kitten sits in your lap without biting or clawing, pet and praise your kitten., If a kitten continues to misbehave after being corrected, ignore the behavior Kittens often act out because they want attention. For a kitten, any response, even a negative one, may be a positive one. Therefore, simply ignoring biting until a kitten stops is often effective., Many people play wrestle with their kitten, or allow their kitten to paw at their finger. This sends a message that biting and scratching are appropriate behaviors. This can become more of a problem as your kitten grows."

Put fishing pole toys away when you're not using them.,
Do not leave bags in areas where they could get stepped on.,
Make sure toys aren't small enough to be swallowed.,
Avoid leaving toys with batteries out.",How to Play With a Kitten3," Fishing pole toys are sold at many department and pet stores. While they can provide hours of fun for a kitten, they should not be used if your kitten is unsupervised. These tend to have a lot of small parts. Put them away when your not there to supervise your kitten.If you use strings and ribbons like fishing pole toys, these should also be put away. While ribbons and strings are generally safe for supervised play, they can actually be deadly if swallowed.

, It can be fun to let your kitten play in a paper bag. However, don't leave a paper bag out where it could be stepped on. Someone could easily step on your kitten inside the paper bag. Much like other toys, it's generally best to put paper bags away altogether when your not there to supervise., Kittens may swallow their toys by mistake when playing. Therefore, you should not get your kitten any toys that are small enough to be easily swallowed. Stick to toys bigger than your kitten's mouth for safety., Battery operated toys can be fun for your cat. However, you may be inclined to leave them out when you're gone so your kitten can play with them in your absence. Battery-operated toys should be put away when you're not present. Cats could potentially get into the batteries, which can be harmful if chewed on or swallowed."

Use furniture covers.,
Spray a scent deterrent on the furniture.,
Lay double-sided tape on the furniture.,
Trim your cat's claws.",How to Protect Furniture from Cats1," If you're mainly concerned that your furniture will become dirty or hairy from your cat, cover it with slipcovers. You can purchase a slipcover for couches, chairs, or recliners in a variety of colors and fabrics. Choose a fabric that you can easily wipe clean or toss in the washing machine.If you don't want to always keep a cover on the furniture, you can lay down a towel where your cat usually likes to rest. Just remove the towel and wash it every day or two.;
, Buy a repellent spray that your cat doesn't like and spray it on the furniture that your cat usually scratches. You can purchase bitter apple or herbal sprays at most pet stores. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to spray your furniture.You may need to reapply the scent deterrent once it begins to wear off.

, Spread double-sided tape on places where your cat prefers to scratch. Your cat won't like the sticky feeling so should eventually stop scratching there. Most commercial double-sided tapes shouldn't leave a sticky residue on your furniture.If you'd rather startle your cat than apply sticky tape, tape a few balloons in places where your cat usually scratches. When your cat goes to scratch, it will pop a balloon. The surprise may stop your cat from scratching.

, Keep your cat's claws clipped close (but not too close) so its nails are dull and won't do as much damage if it scratches the furniture. If your cat resists clipping, try wrapping it in a towel while you trim or get the nails professionally trimmed."

Offer your cat a scratching area.,
Encourage your cat to use the scratching area.,
Reward your cat for good behavior.,
Say ""no"" and be consistent with training.,
Startle your cat if you see undesirable behavior.,
Keep your cat active.",How to Protect Furniture from Cats2," If your cat likes to claw, place a sisal scratching post next to the place it usually scratches. Your cat might prefer this rough, natural fiber as long as the post is solid and won't tip over. If your cat likes to scratch wooden legs of your furniture, use a cedar scratching post. Or if your cat prefers to scratch the soft upholstery of furniture, set out a carpeted scratching post., Rub a little catnip on the scratching posts to attract your cat to them. You might need to occasionally add more catnip to keep your cat interested. You may want to set up more than one post or scratching space in your house, especially if your cat likes to scratch several pieces of furniture.

Try to place them in a variety of places so your cat can choose when and where to scratch.

, As soon as you notice your cat using the scratching post instead of the furniture, reinforce the good behavior. Give your cat verbal praise or put a treat at the base of the post. Or you could give your cat a few belly rubs.For example, when you see your cat scratching the post say, ""Good cat!"" in a friendly tone and rub it behind its ears.

, If you see your cat scratching the furniture instead of the post, make a loud noise (like clapping) to startle them. Remove them from the furniture and firmly say ""no."" Do this every time you see your cat scratching the furniture.Don't yell or get angry at your cat. Remember that cats need to scratch in order to keep their nails trimmed. It's also a way that they communicate with other cats.

, Some cats may keep scratching furniture even if you tell them no and remove them. Try startling your cat every time you see it misbehaving. For example, if your cat jumps up onto a couch where you don't want it, walk towards your cat while shaking a can that contains a few pennies.If your cat doesn't mind the rattling or surprising noises, consider squirting your cat with a little water.

, Cats are more likely to scratch on furniture if they're bored or need attention. Spend time playing with your cat. Staying active and entertained can reduce misbehavior. For example, you could dangle ribbons on a stick, toss small balls or toys to your cat, or hide treats in puzzle balls for it to find.Consider setting up a play area for your cat that includes items it can scratch. For example, buy an indoor play tree that has a scratching post. Place this near your cat's favorite furniture or by a window so it can look outside.

Place a litter box over the spot on the rug where your cat likes to urinate.,
Flip carpet runners and area rugs upside down.,
Apply double sided sticky tape to edges of rugs.,
Play with your cat around her box.,
Talk to your veterinarian again if things don’t improve.",How to Prevent Cats from Urinating on Carpet1," A medical issue, such as a urinary tract infection, may be causing your cat to urinate on the carpet instead of in a litter box. Before you try any other intervention to remedy the situation, you should take your cat to see a veterinarian to treat any medical issues that may be causing the behavior. Getting your cat checked out right away is important to protect the health and well-being of your pet and to prevent a long-lasting litter box aversion.Squatting for long periods of time, blood in the urine, frequent urination and meowing while trying to urinate are all signs that your pet might have a bladder or urinary tract issue or infection. These health problems can cause litter box avoidance. These signs can also indicate a urinary obstruction, which can potentially be life-threatening. Only the veterinarian can tell the difference so it's important to seek veterinary attention.;
, Cleaning up accidents right after they happen will also help deter your cat from using the same spot again. Use an enzymatic cleaner rather than an ammonia based one. Ammonia-based cleaners may cause your cat to urinate more often on the spot because she may interpret the ammonia as another cat’s urine that she must cover up with her own urine.Consider having your carpets cleaned professionally if they are heavily soiled.
Some rugs may be beyond cleaning if the messes were not taken care of right away. Get rid of rugs that have been soiled repeatedly by your cat.

, If your cat has started going to the bathroom on a rug or carpet, place a litter box over that spot to encourage her to use the box instead. After she has used the box for one month, move it an inch per day until it is back where you want it to be., Cats may develop a preference for a specific rug and begin using it as a bathroom. Turning over rugs and carpet runners may discourage your cat by changing the texture of the surface. Try flipping over your rugs and carpets for a few days to see if that stops your cat from urinating on them., Sticky tape can discourage a cat from urinating on a rug because the sensation of the tape on its paws is unpleasant. Try applying double sided sticky tape to the edges of area rugs as well as over the spot where your cat likes to urinate., Your cat may be urinating on the carpet because she has developed a negative association with using the litter box. Negative associations with the litter box may be improved by doing things like playing with your cat around the litter box.

Don't feed a raw diet to your cat.",How to Train a Therapy Cat," It's easiest to socialize a cat when it is a kitten. A kitten is still learning what is ""normal."" If it learns at a young age that being handled and being sociable is ""normal,"" it's more likely to be a sociable cat who's willing to be petted by strangers., Work on petting the cat all over. Start with strokes the cat enjoys, such as pats on the head, and work up to stroking it all over. Try holding its paw for a few seconds, as well as its tail. After holding it for a few seconds, reward it with petting it likes. Keep working on to petting and touching areas it doesn't like as much.If the cat gets mad, it's time to stop and try again later.

, Have strangers (to the cat) come into your home. Let the cat approach them first. When it does, let your friend try to pet it if the cat will let them. You can try to encourage interaction by giving your friend a treat to offer the cat or a toy the cat can play with., Some areas have kitten classes specifically designed to help you socialize your cat. However, if your area doesn't, consider taking your kitten to friends' houses, where you let them calmly hold the kitten. Tell them to pet it softly and talk to it in a calm voice.As an added bonus, this step will help your cat get used to riding in the car, and it won't just associate the car with going to the vet's office.
It also helps to have the kitten meet other animals on these trips.

, A clicker is a device that makes a clicking noise. It works well for training because it is an immediate, consistent response to an action. When you begin clicker training, you just want to get your cat to associate it with good things, so you offer a treat and click at the same time. Keep doing this over and over, until the cat begins to associate the treat with the clicker.If you don't want to invest in a clicker, you can try a ballpoint pen that makes a clicking noise.

, The easiest way to teach a cat to come to its name is to use a behavior already in place. For instance, if your cat always comes to the kitchen when you use the can opener, say its name as you use the can opener. Reward the cat with a treat., Place a bit of moist food on a spoon. You can use tuna, baby food (meat only), cat food, or salmon, for instance. Hold it just above the cat's head, so it has to tilt up to get to the food. That should force its back end to the ground. When its back end is on the ground, click and offer it the treat.As your cat gets better at it, you can add in the command to ""Sit."" Start moving from the spoon to loose treats, using the clicker.

, ""Stay"" only works if your cat has already mastered ""sit."" Tell your cat to sit in a distraction-free area. Say ""stay."" Make a small movement, like shuffling your feet or moving an arm. If the cat doesn't move, click and offer a treat. Keep making small movements and offering small treats if your cat doesn't move. If your cat does move, go back to smaller movements.Keep working up to harder and harder stays. You might walk across the room for a short stay, for instance.
You'll need more patience with a cat than you would with a dog.

, First, you'll need a harness and a leash. Place the harness on the cat in the house, and let it start getting used to it in short spurts. Once the cat is okay with that, you can take it into the yard on the leash. Don't walk it yet.Let the cat explore the yard on the leash. Don't leave it alone.
Once the cat is okay with being outside, try taking it on short walks in the neighborhood.

, Not every cat is going to take to being a therapy pet, just as not every dog is right for the job. If your cat is shy or particularly skittish, for instance, it will not likely make a good therapy cat. Your cat needs to be sociable and enjoy attention from complete strangers., Being part of a therapy team means you'll need to be able to handle your animal in whatever situation that comes up. The certification training will help you with that, but you need to be able to read your cat's body language and redirect it calmly when it is feeling skittish.Ask yourself some questions. Can you tell if your cat is mad? Can you tell when your cat is unhappy with being touched? What does your cat look like when it is happy?
Define what calms your cat. This may be anything from petting, to making calming sounds, to giving it some alone time. Practice calming it down whenever it is angry or frightened.

, When getting your cat ready, you'll need to complete a course sponsored by one of the certification programs. In that course, you'll learn how to appropriately handle your cat, as well as how to best prepare your cat for therapy.You can take the handler's course online, at places like the ASPCA's website. You also may be able to find short workshops in your city that fulfill the course requirements. Check with the organization you're getting certified through. Classes can run to $125.

, If you want your cat to be certified, it usually must be a specific age. Often, your cat must be at least a year old before it can be certified as a therapy cat.In addition, you must have had the cat for at least 6 months.

, Before beginning any therapy, your cat should be evaluated by a vet. In addition to making sure the cat is healthy, the vet should also update the cat on any shots it needs.Often, the organization will require your vet to fill out a specific form. Your vet will likely be familiar with it., Another requirement by some certification organizations is that you don't feed a raw diet. A raw diet increases the chances that your cat will carry bacteria, putting those who are sick or who have poor immune systems at risk."

You can also use warm water moistened cotton balls or gauze to help a kitten poop., Using your thumb and fingers, gently massage the kitten's anal region through the cloth. Your thumb should be doing most of the work, acting like the mother cat's tongue when she licks her kittens' bottoms to make them go., If not, keep massaging the anal area. When the kitten starts to urinate, you will feel some added warmth to the hand that is massaging the kitten's bottom. Keep massaging until the flow of urine stops, then check to see if the kitten is about to poop.


This process should not take more than about 60 seconds. If your kitten is not pooping or peeing after feedings, then you should contact a veterinarian.

, Continue massaging and readjust the cloth as needed. Move the cloth now and then so that the feces does not get the kitten dirty. If you are using cotton balls or gauze, dispose of soiled materials and continue massaging with clean ones.

Completely solid feces will not form until the kitten switches to solid food., After the kitten has finished defecating, give its bottom a good wipe to make sure it is clean. Then using a dry towel or another dry washcloth, dry the kitten's bottom as much as possible. Making sure that the kitten’s bottom is clean and dry will help prevent rash or infections.

, Place the kitten back with his/her litter-mates in the box or cage where you are keeping them/him/her. Repeat the anal massage process with each kitten you are caring for. Make sure that you use a fresh cloth for each kitten.

, If you used cotton balls or gauze, simply throw them away. If you used washcloths, wash them thoroughly afterwards. Your best option is to wash them in a washing machine on hot with detergent and bleach.


Do NOT keep the washcloths in their dirty state for the next time you need to make a kitten poop. Reusing dirty cloths may give your kitten an infection, which could pose a serious hazard to their health.

, Even though you are placing a washcloth between your hand and your kitten’s anus, that does not mean that urine and feces won’t get on your hands. Make sure that you wash your hands with antibacterial soap and warm water after you finish making a kitten poop.

If you don’t have the instructions, search with model name and number online. Often instruction manuals are posted online.;
, Do not place the litter box on an incline. Do not place it where it could fall. You will probably want to place it near a power outlet.Some automatic litter boxes have power cords, others use batteries, and some use both.

Be careful if you live next to a busy road. Cats don’t react so well around cars.Follow your cat in the first days and don’t let it go too far. Your feline needs time to get used to its new surroundings.
Look for other cats. They might consider your garden as their territory and will look at your cat as a threat.
Don’t have too much faith in your fences to keep the cat inside the garden. They will inevitably find a way to escape.
It can be a good idea to keep a collar on your cat, but some cats may become snagged on fences by their collar, which may result in suffocation. Purchase a breakaway collar, which comes off if pulled. A microchip is another option, and most rescuers and veterinarians now scan for them before they proceed with handling the animal.

, Don’t try to detract your cat from hunting birds and mice. Your feline, just like its cousin the lion, is a predator and is wired to kill small animals. Don’t forget to make sure that there is no dangerous animal outside. You don’t want your cat to become the prey!


Your cat will prefer hunting mice and birds. You can also see it chasing flies and other insects.
Never punish your cat if it hunted and killed another animal. The cat will not understand why it’s being punished!
Keep in mind that pet cats hunt for fun, not just when hungry, when choosing whether to let your cat outdoors. For every dead mouse or bird your cat brings you, there are probably many others you don't see.
Don't let your cat outside if you live in an area native to small endangered species.

Select a large litter box.,
Consider an enclosed litter box.,
Buy kitty litter.,
Purchase a scooper and drop cloth.",How to Litter Train a Kitten1," Small boxes are available for tiny kittens, but kittens grow up so fast that you'll have to replace the litter box soon after introducing it. When you replace a litter box you have to retrain the kitten, so it's better to start with a box you plan to use for a long time.


Kittens have no trouble getting into large litter boxes, as long as one side is low enough that they can step inside. If you find a great box but aren't sure whether the kitten will be able to climb inside, use a piece of plywood or another flat material with good traction to make a little ramp. Affix it to the side of the litter box using duct tape, and remove it when the kitten has grown big enough to get inside without it.;
, Some litter boxes have an enclosure (or top) around them. The advantage of the enclosed litter box is that it can contain the litter for an enthusiastic kicker/digger and it may cut down smells if you have the box in a small living area. Some cats also feel protected by the enclosure.Be sure that the enclosed litter box is large; cats need enough room to comfortably turn around inside the box. Most cats have a behavioral need to sniff their feces and then bury them, and the box needs to allow plenty of room for that.Some cats do not like enclosed boxes when initially introduced to them. You can ease the transition by removing the swinging door until your cat becomes acclimated to the box.

, There are many types of litter to chose from, and most types litter are fine for most juvenile or adult cats (8 months or older.) Select a litter that is as dust-free as possible, since dust can irritate cats’ lungs.You might want to keep the following factors in mind as you make your choice:


Do not use clumping cat litter for kittens. If they eat it (which they do) it sticks together in their gut and can cause a serious impaction.
Use unscented litter if possible. Kittens and cats may not like perfumed litter; if the scent is overpowering, they may use bathroom somewhere else.Additionally, some scents could irritate a cat’s nose and eyes or cause problems for cats who are prone to respiratory problems.
Consider a scoopable litter. Scoopable litter has become a popular choice, since it makes removing the kitten's waste quite easy. Be aware that there is some concern that a cat could become sick from ingesting scoopable litter, but that there is little or no evidence of this happening.Select a litter that is widely available. Some cats become accustomed to a specific litter and may not recognize the tray as a toilet unless it contains their usual litter.

, The last things you need to get ready for litter training your kitten are a scooper for removing waste from the litter box and a drop cloth to place under the box to prevent stray litter from soiling your house.

"

Place the box in a peaceful location.,
Place the kitten in the filled litter box.,
Use praise, not punishment.,
Provide enough litter boxes.,
Consider a confinement period.",How to Litter Train a Kitten2," Don't put it in a high-traffic area of your home, like the kitchen or entry hall. The ideal litter box location is easily accessible, offers plenty of privacy, and is free from sudden noises that could frighten a kitten.Though a laundry room is a popular choice for a location because it has less traffic than other areas of most houses, the sudden noises that a washer or dryer can make while switching cycles could frighten a kitten and cause her to fear using the box.The litter box should be in an area that a kitten spends a lot of time. The kitten should be able to see the litter box most of the time so that she can use it if she needs to.
Kittens and cats prefer a little privacy. If they don't have it, they may start relieving themselves behind the sofa or in another out-of-the-way corner.If you start litter training a kitten and it becomes necessary to move the box, do it gradually, a few feet at a time every few days. Moving the box to a different room from one day to the next could confuse the kitten and lead to accidents around the house. It may also help to place the kitten’s food bowl where the litter box used to be, as most cats are reticent to use the toilet where they eat.

, As soon as you bring the kitten home, place her in the box so she can get used to the smell and feel of the kitty litter. Let her spend a few minutes there, even if she doesn't go to the bathroom the first time. Continue to place the kitten in the box after she eats meals, wakes up, or any other time when you predict she may need to relieve herself. In addition, if she squats anywhere other than the litter box place her in it immediately.


Some kittens will understand the purpose of the litter box immediately and require no additional litter training. Others will need to be placed in the litter box as many as ten times a day before they figure it out.
You should avoid attempting to ""show"" the kitten the digging motion that cats use to bury their waste as it may frighten them, so avoid the temptation to take her paws and help her dig into the litter until she catches on., As the kitten grows used to the litter box and starts using it as her toilet, praise her each time she goes by petting her and making comforting sounds. Do not discipline her while she is in the box, or she might start associating being in the box with punishment.Kittens do not respond well to having their noses rubbed in a mess they have made outside the litter box. If she has an accident, let her sniff the mess, then gently lift her and put her in the box, so she knows where to go next time.
Never spank or yell at a kitten to punish her. It will only serve to make her afraid of you.

, If possible, you should have one litter box for each cat in your house, plus an additional litter box.


For example, one kitten should ideally have 2 litter box options. If you have three cats, you should provide four litter boxes.

, When you first introduce a kitten to your home, you may want to confine her to a small area for the first few weeks. This can help her acclimate slowly to her new environment, will give her easy access to her litter box, and can help minimize or confine accident areas.You may want to confine the kitten to an area without carpet to make accidents easier to clean if they do occur.
Keep the litter box and the kitten’s food and bedding at opposite ends of the confinement area."
"
Clean the litter every day.,
Clean the entire litter box frequently.,
Clean accident areas thoroughly.,
Consider removing large potted plants from your home.,
Feed the kitten at regular times.",How to Litter Train a Kitten3," Kittens do not like to relieve themselves in dirty areas. If you don't change the litter, the kitten may find a cleaner place, like the carpet, to do her business.


To clean the litter box, scoop the waste out of the box, place it in a small baggie, close the bag, and throw it away.
You can leave a small bit of feces in the litter box (changing it frequently) during the first few weeks. This helps the kitten recognize what the box is for.

, About once a week, you will need to completely dump the contents of the litter pan and give it a thorough cleaning. Once the pan is emptied out, wash it with a non-hazardous cleaning solution (or warm soapy water), then rinse the pan, dry it, and refill it with clean litter.It can be tempting to leave scoopable litter for longer than one week due to the ease of removing the cat’s waste. However, even scoopable litter needs to be completely emptied and replaced frequently.

, If your kitten or cat uses the bathroom outside of the litter box, be sure that you completely clean the area, removing all traces of urine or feces. This should help reduce repeat accidents in the same area., If you find that your kitten is using the dirt in your potted plants for a toilet, you may need to remove them or cover the dirt with foil during litter training. Kittens instinctively bury their waste, so they may be attracted to dirt or sandy areas. Make sure the litter box is the only place in the house where they want to relieve themselves.

, This will help you be able to predict when she will need to use the litter box. Kittens generally feel the urge to have a bowel movement about 20 minutes after eating. When you think she has the urge to go, take her to the box and let her climb inside.

If you are not cleaning your cat’s litter box every day, this may be the reason that your cat is urinating where it shouldn’t.In addition to scooping out your cat’s litter box every day, once per week you should also remove all the litter and clean the box with warm water and unscented soap or baking soda. When you are finished, dry the box and add fresh litter.
Try a self-cleaning litter box to make it easier to keep your cat’s litter box clean.;
, It is important to have one more box than the number of cats in your household. For example, if you have three cats, then you should have four litter boxes. If you only have two litter boxes and you have three cats, then the number of litter boxes may be the cause of your cat’s refusal to use the litter box., If your cat has to make a long trip to get to her litter box or if the litter box itself is difficult for your cat to get into and out of, that might be the reason why your cat is urinating where she shouldn’t. Place your cat’s litter boxes where it is easy for her to get to them in a hurry, such as one upstairs and one downstairs.Make sure that your cat will be able to see approaching humans or animals and easily get away.

A shallow bed of medium to fine grain clumping litter is best, but you can also try offering your cat different types of litter to see what she prefers.Give your cat a choice of litter types by placing two litter boxes with two different types of litter right next to each other. At the end of the day, check to see which one your cat used.
Provide a shallow bed of litter. Most cats prefer a litter box that has about 1-2 inches of litter.

, Some cats avoid using a litter box because they don’t like the size or shape of it. Liners may also cause your cat discomfort that can make her avoid the box. Remove the liner and hood from your cat’s litter box to determine if they are what is causing her to avoid using the box.Consider the size of your cat’s litter box as well. If it is too small for her, then she may avoid using it.

, Other pets, children, or a noisy environment can all cause your cat to feel stressed and avoid the litter box. Make sure that your cat’s litter box is kept in a place that is semi-dark, quiet, and secluded. If your cat’s box is in a high traffic area, she will be less likely to use it.Try using Feliway diffusers to help your cat feel more relaxed. This product releases a scent that some cats may find comforting.

, Your cat’s medical history may provide an explanation for why your cat has not been using the litter box. If you suspect that your cat is sick, take her to see a vet as soon as possible. Early treatment of an illness by help stop litter box problems as well as save your cat from pain and discomfort. Urinary tract infections and feline interstitial cystitis are common conditions that may cause your cat to urinate outside of the litter box.Urinary tract infections may cause a cat to avoid the litter box, even after the infection has been treated. Your cat may still associate the litter box with pain and want to avoid it.
Feline interstitial cystitis is another common cause of litter box aversion. Cats with feline interstitial cystitis may urinate in the litter box because they feel the need to urinate more often.
Kidney stones or a blockage of your cat’s urinary tract may also result in a litter box aversion. Your cat may meow or howl while using the box and the fear of pain may continue even after treatment.
Keep in mind that prompt treatment of these conditions is essential so that your cat does not develop a long lasting litter box aversion., Urine marking is when your cat sprays a bit of urine on a piece of furniture or other surface to mark her territory. The amount of urine is much less than a cat will eliminate when urinating. If your cat is displaying this type of behavior, many of the suggestions in this article will be helpful, but there are additional things that you will need to do to help stop your cat from urine marking.Urine marking is most common in unneutered male cats but unspayed female cats may also exhibit this behavior, so it is important to have your cats spayed and neutered.
Urine marking is also common in households with more than ten cats, so keeping the number of cats in your home below ten can also help with this problem., If your cat has started going to the bathroom on a rug or other place on the ground in your house, place a litter box over that spot to encourage her to use the box instead. After she has used the box for one month, move it an inch per day until it is back where you want it to be., Cats like to use dark spaces to go to the bathroom, so a closet might be very appealing to your cat. If your cat has started urinating on the floor of a dark space, keep the light turned on or consider a motion light to discourage your cat from urinating in that space., Cats may develop a preference for a certain type of surface and begin using it as a bathroom. Turning over rugs and carpet runners may discourage your cat by changing the texture of the surface. Try flipping over your rugs and carpets for a few days to see if that stops your cat from urinating on them., Sticky tape can discourage a cat from urinating on a piece of furniture because the sensation of the tape on their paws is unpleasant. Try applying double sided sticky tape to the edges of furniture as well as over the spot where your cat likes to urinate., Cleaning up accidents right after they happen will also help deter your cat from using the same spot again. Use an enzymatic cleaner rather than an ammonia based one. Ammonia-based cleaners may cause your cat to urinate more often on the spot because she may interpret the ammonia as another cat’s urine that she must cover up with her own urine., If you have a long haired cat, she may have an aversion to the litter box because she feels dirty after using it. Keeping your cat’s hair trimmed may help her to use the litter box. You may also need to bathe her to make sure that she does not smell like urine or feces.If you are uncomfortable with bathing your cat, look for an experienced cat groomer in your area.

, Negative associations with the litter box may be improved by doing things like playing with your cat around the litter box. Try playing with your cat a few feet away from her box a few times per day to help generate more positive feelings about the litter box.

Cats don’t like to be disturbed while they use the litter box.You can leave treats and toys near your cat’s litter box, but do not keep your cat’s food and water dish next to her box. Cats don’t like to eat too close to where they use the bathroom.

, Encouraging your cat to use the litter box takes time and effort, but it may not always be successful. Some veterinarians undergo special training to help people deal with problems such as urinating outside of the box. If your cat does not improve over time, consider speaking to a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist or a board-certified veterinary behaviorist."

Create an obstacle course out of plastic forks or wooden chopsticks.If cats do not have enough room to move around, scratch, and dig, they will seek another area for a litter box.,
Embed chicken wire in the soil.Lay standard chicken wire (available from hardware stores) down before your plants poke through the soil.,
Lay lattice fencing over the ground.,
Cover the soil with uncomfortable material.,
Cover exposed ground with ""scat mats."",
Create a barrier fence.Cats are persistent, and able to squeeze into many places.,
Use a low-voltage wire.An electric fence surrounding your garden can effectively keep cats out of it.",How to Keep Cats Out of a Garden1," Insert plant spikes, forks, chopsticks, or similar materials (approximately ten inches in length) every eight inches in the soil to thwart cats.


Make sure that the sticks or equivalent materials are inserted to a depth of a few inches into the soil so that they will stay upright.
The points on these utensils are not sharp enough to cause any real damage, but they can be enough of a deterrent to discourage your feline friends from lounging about.;
, Plants can usually grow in between the gaps, but cats will find the texture of the wiring unpleasant to walk on. The chicken wire will be soft enough not to hurt the cats, but strong enough to discourage them from digging in your garden.


If the plants need additional room to grow, you can use wire cutters to cut larger holes directly above the plants needing more room.
As an alternative to chicken wire, you can lay plastic sheeting designed for use in gardens., Lay the lattice fencing over your soil before you even plant your seeds. The gaps in the fencing will make the area unappealing to wandering cats.


Press the lattice fencing into the ground gently so that it is partially covered by the soil.
Transplant seedlings and plant seeds into the soil exposed by the gaps of the fencing. Over time, many common garden plants should grow around the fencing without much difficulty.

, Cats will not like to dig in or play on rough surfaces. You can cover areas of your yard with a thin layer of safe materials like:Rough-textured mulch
Prickly pinecones
Pebbles and stones

, Scat mats (available at garden supply stores) are plastic mats covered in flexible plastic spikes.The spikes are soft enough not to hurt cats, but they will not like the texture and will keep away.


Depending on the brand, you will usually find the mats in packages of two to five mats. Generally, these mats are cut into four pieces, making it easy to fit the mat to size according to the size and needs of your garden.
Do not merely lay the mats on the surface of the soil. You need to press the mats into the soil so that the mat itself is covered, leaving only the spikes exposed. Otherwise, a clever cat can paw the mat up.

, However, a six-foot high chain-link fence, with two-by-two inch mesh can be effective at keeping cats out of your garden. A two-foot overhang can provide additional protection.

, As long as it is low-voltage, it will not harm the cats, only drive them away. The fence can be raised about 4 inches from the ground and still discourage them from entering your garden.


Look for electric fencing at hardware or home supply stores. Carefully follow all installation and safety instructions.
Keep children away from electric fencing.

The theory behind clicker training is that the cat will learn to link a sound (click-clack) with a reward (tasty treat). The nice thing about a clicker is that it is a distinct sound which is only associated with a reward. Thus, the cat is much more likely to respond.Although you can train a cat using just words, it can be more difficult. Because you use words in everyday speech not directed at your cat, the cat probably won't pay a lot of attention to them. Furthermore, if you use a command word such as ""shake,"" the cat will likely hear the word in other contexts and not know when it is expected to respond.;
, Cats can be picky eaters, and a treat that one cat enjoys may be of little interest to another. Training will go faster and more easily if you determine in advance what kinds of treats your cat enjoys most.


You may want to try buying a small amount of several different cat treats to try them out and see what your cat likes best.

, The ideal time for a clicker session is when the cat is relaxed but not asleep, and sitting near you. You can start any time when the cat is paying attention.


If your cat has just woken up, it may be groggy. If this is the case, give the cat five minutes or so before you begin training.

, Once the cat looks alert, press the clicker and give it a treat. Repeat this several times over a period of about five minutes.


Cats only have a short attention span, so don't try to continue your clicker session beyond about five minutes., Later in the day, or the next day, do another clicker session. Continue repeating these sessions regularly until your cat associates the sound of the clicker with a treat.


Each cat learns at a different pace, but most will figure out the link between the clicker and the treat after two or three five-minute sessions.
Be consistent, repeating the clicker session once or twice a day, every day, until the cat makes the association.You will be able to recognize when your cat has discovered the connection, because it will gaze at you expectantly and perhaps lick its lips after your press the clicker.

, Once your cat has linked the clicker and a treat, pick a time when it is attentive but relaxed. Just before you would normally feed your cat is a particularly good time, because the promise of treats to a hungry cat will sharpen its responses.Work in a peaceful place with few distractions so that the cat concentrates solely on you.

, Press your clicker and give the cat a treat to remind it of the connection between the clicker and the food.

, Gently lift one of your cat's front paws. It's a good idea to lift the same paw every time. The cat will learn the trick more easily if you are consistent., While holding the paw in your hand, press your clicker with the other hand, and then give your chosen command-word for the trick, such as ""shake."" Then give the cat a treat.

, Release the cat's paw and give it a couple of nice pets. This further reinforces that you are pleased with the cat's behavior, and makes the training experience more pleasurable for the cat., Repeat this cycle as many times as the cat is willing during a period of about five minutes.


If the cat spontaneously lifts the correct paw at any time during the training, immediately click, say the command and reward. This sends a strong message that the behavior you require is to lift the paw.You want your cat to enjoy these sessions. If the cat seems uncooperative or disinterested, don't force this issue. Let it wander off and try again another other time., Later in the day, or the next day, repeat the entire process. Lift the cat's paw if it fails to do so on its own, and also immediately click and offer a treat when the cat does it spontaneously.


It may take several sessions before your cat starts to raise its paw without you taking it first, and several more before it will do it on command.

, When the cat starts to frequently lift its paw on its own, try giving the command ""shake"" without the click. When it places the paw in your hand, then click and reward.The click promises a reward, and the command tells the cat the required action to get it. Your goal is to get the cat to respond to ""shake"" without the click because it associates the command with a treat.

, Eventually, it will become unnecessary to give a reward each time the trick is performed.However, do reward the cat at least every three to four times so it doesn't get disheartened.Always conclude each session with a treat. Ending the session with a treat gives the cat consistent, positive reinforcement of the desired behavior."

Hold a treat in front of your cat’s nose.,
Lift the treat up over her head.,
Reward your cat when she sits.,
Replace the treat with a verbal cue or hand signal.,
Kneel in front of your cat.,
Direct your cat to swivel her head.,
Move the treat towards the floor.,
Reward your cat when she rolls over to one side.,
Entice your cat to come back up.,
Practice daily.",How to Get a Cat to Roll Over," Getting your cat to roll over is easier when you break the trick down into small parts. The first part of the trick is to get her to sit. When you have your cat’s attention, position a treat at the level of her nose. Make sure the treat is far enough away to prevent her from easily reaching it.The type of treat to feed her throughout the training process must be especially scrumptious to her. Examples of treats include bits of tuna and meat-flavored baby food.If your cat is not in the room with you, you can call her to come to you. Call her using a verbal cue, such as ‘Here kitty kitty,’ and reward her immediately with a treat when she comes to you. This will may take some extra practice if your cat is not used to you calling her.;
, It is important to lift the treat slowly so that she does not stand up on her rear limbs. Lift the treat up until it is between her ears. Your cat will naturally lift her chin up to follow the treat. As her chin raises, her rear end will go towards the floor., Give her the treat as soon as her rear end touches the floor. Your cat may not sit completely down the first time around, but give her a treat anyway for making the motion to sit down. With repetition—and treats with each repetition—her rear end will be completely on the floor.Keep your training sessions (two to three per day) short—about five minutes per session—until she masters the ‘sit’ command.

, When your cat learns to sit with the treat, you can command her to sit with only a verbal cue (‘sit’) or hand signal. To work on the verbal cue, continue to hold the treat in front of her nose, but give the verbal cue as she is sitting.Reward her immediately when she sits.


After several repetitions, give her only the verbal cue without having a treat in your hand. Reward her immediately when she sits.The hand signal will be the same hand movement you have been making, except without the treat. Reward her immediately when she sits by following your hand signal.
With practice, your cat will know to sit by listening to your verbal cue or watching your hand signal, rather than following a treat in front of her nose.If you choose to give her a verbal cue, say the cue in a firm, but not raised, voice.

, When you have commanded your cat to sit, get down on the floor with her so that you are closer to her eye level. Hold a treat in front of her nose, but not so close that she can easily swipe it out of your hand.The ideal times to teach your cat to roll over are when she’s sleepy or hungry. When she is sleepy, she’ll probably just let gravity do the work of lying down and rolling over. If she is hungry, she’ll probably do whatever it takes to get some tasty food., Holding the treat close to her nose, slowly move the treat counterclockwise over her left shoulder. With her interest in the treat, she will swivel her head to follow the treat.Make sure to keep the treat far enough away that she can’t get to it.


Move the treat in a straight line, rather than lifting it up.

, With your cat’s attention fully fixed on the treat, continue to move the treat over her left shoulder and then towards the floor on her left side. Say ‘roll over’ as you are moving the treat to the floor. As her head continues to swivel to follow the treat, she will shift her weight to her left side and eventually lay down on the floor., When your cat is laying on the floor and reaching for the treat with her paws, she will naturally roll over. When you see her roll over, reward her with a treat immediately.In her attempt to paw at the treat, her belly will automatically go up. When her belly goes up, she will roll over.Be mindful that your cat may roll over quickly when she’s down on the floor. Keep a close eye on her movements so that you reward her immediately when she rolls over., With a new treat in your hand, hold it front of her nose when she is rolled over onto her left side. Slowly move the treat counterclockwise until she is laying on the floor on all fours (‘four-on-the-floor’) or sitting up.Reward her immediately when she is in the ‘four-on-the-floor’ position or sitting up.

, Your cat may be a quick learner and master the trick in a few days. Or, she may need up to a few weeks until she can roll over with ease at your command. No matter how long it takes, keep your daily practice sessions short (up to 5 minutes).Limit your training to a few sessions per day. If you practice too much, your cat may actually get bored and simply walk away from the practice session.Once you see that she has mastered the trick with treats, work on commanding her to roll over without giving her treats.

Shut the door to the room you want to keep your cat out of.,
Make a habit of coming in and exiting doors quickly.,
Create an alternative barrier if the room has no door.,
Keep your cat in an outdoor cattery.,
Ignore the cat if it is scratching at the door and you are in the room.,
Place a deterrent at the door.",How to Keep Cats out of Rooms1," This is the most effective way of keeping a cat out of a space you don't want it in. If the room doesn't have a door, put one on as soon as you can.


Be aware that this provides a physical barrier to the cat's entry, yet the cat may still try to get in.
By denying the cat access to a room that it wants to go into, you may increase the cat's stress. This can inadvertently shift bad behaviour to another part of the house.
Ideally, only deny access as an emergency measure whilst seeking the advice of a qualified animal behaviourist or your veterinarian.;
, It can be hard to keep a cat out of a room it wants to get into, so you are going to have to act fast! It's a good idea to try to distract the cat with toys and treats so you can enter the room with enough time to shut the door behind you.

, It may be hard to create a physical barrier that will keep all cats out, but try to make a barrier designed to your specific cat's agility. For instance,e while baby gates will not work for all cats, if your cat is only slightly interested in the room or your cat is old or not agile, a small baby gate may deter your cat from entering the room.

, Only allow the cat to roam inside on your terms, at your convenience, when you can shut as many doors as you'd like. This way, you don't have to worry about the cat's whereabouts when locked away snugly in its own house. However, this is severely limiting the cat's territory which can lead to stress. Stress can manifest itself as destructive behaviour, inappropriate urination or defecation, or indeed some cats will become ill with bladder problems.


To minimize this risk make sure your cat has plenty of room to roam. Provide high perches for the cat to sit on and look around, hiding places so the cat can have privacy when necessary, and litter box, food and water bowls.
If the run is outdoors, also make sure there is adequate protection from wind, rain, and direct sun.
Make sure the cat has mental stimulation, so this includes providing toys, spending a minimum of two, ten minutes play sessions a day with the cat, and giving the cat plenty of attention., If you scold a cat, he or she will do it again. If the ""game"" your cat is playing has no merit, it won't bother again.

, If it is essential the cat does not scratch at the door, try siting a canister of compressed air with a motion detector trigger, beside the door. When the motion detector picks up the cat it releases a blast of compressed air which does not harm the cat, but gives him a fright. The cat then learns to associate that door with an unpleasant experience and will be more wary about approaching.

Plant potent-smelling plants.,
Use dried herbs or scented oils.,
Scatter citrus peels around the garden.Most cats hate the smell of citrus.,
Try coffee grounds or pipe tobacco.Much like citrus, the smells of coffee and tobacco are disgusting to most cats.,
Spray a commercial repellent containing predator urine.Cat deterrent sprays are available at many garden supply stores.,
Spread batches of your own hair around the garden.In theory, many feral cats do not favor the scent of human hair.,
Wash any cat scents away.",How to Keep Cats Out of a Garden2," Cats do not like certain plants, and will stay away from them. Planting them will make the entire area seem disgusting to the local feline population. Try cultivating one or more of these plants near your garden, interspersed among your garden plants, or in other areas of your yard that you do not want cats to disturb:Lavender
Rue
Geranium
Absinthe
Lemon thyme
Thorny roses
Coleus canina, also known as “Scaredy Cat Plant”

, If you do not want to plant herbs or other plants that cats cannot stand, you could scatter dried versions or sprinkle essential oils derived from these plants around your garden for the same effect.Dried rue and lavender are available online or in some garden supply stores. Essential oils of lavender, lemon grass, citronella, citrus, and eucalyptus can be found in some supermarkets or health and beauty stores.
You can also try rubbing essential oils on the edges of containers that you have plants in.
If you cannot find these herbs or oils, you can achieve a similar effect by sprinkling cayenne pepper in the same way that you would dried herbs.

, A quick and easy fix is to scatter fresh or dried peels of lemons, oranges, grapefruits or other citrus fruits over the soil of your garden. The cats will not suffer any harm, but the smell will cause them to seek a more appealing area.

, Simply scatter a thin layer of coffee grounds or tobacco directly onto the soil.c

, Look for a “natural” one that contains an ingredient like the urine of foxes or other predatory animals.


These products contain natural ingredients that may deter other animals such as squirrels and rabbits. Always follow the instructions for use very carefully.

, As a result, you may be able to keep neighborhood strays away by laying batches of your hair around your garden.


Pull the hair from your hairbrushes, and combs, or ask your barber to save hair for you. Lay the strands in bunches around the perimeter of your garden.
This method may not deter domesticated cats (including your own) that are used to the scent of human hair.

, If a cat has already marked its territory in your garden, you might need to wash its scent away before it will consider going anywhere else. Spraying or pouring ordinary white vinegar around an area that a cat has attempted to “claim” can discourage it from using that spot again.

Spray cats with a hose.If you are watchful, you may be able to simply spray cats with a water hose whenever they are trying to use your garden.,
Use a motion-activated sprinkler.Motion-activated sprinklers are available from home supply stores.,
Use an ultrasonic device to deter cats.,
Get a dog.",How to Keep Cats Out of a Garden3," Cats can be trained, so if you are persistent, this may eventually be enough to permanently drive them away.


Be gentle when you are spraying cats with a water hose. Most cats do not like water, so a quick, gentle squirt is usually enough—there is no need for high-powered nozzles, or to thoroughly soak the intruding cats.

, When a cat walks by, the motion triggers the sprinkler, which sprays a burst of water. Most cats do not like getting wet, so this can often be an effective deterrent. Use motion-activated sprinklers to create a border around your garden.


These sprinklers can be installed either permanently or temporarily, depending on your preference and needs.

, These emit a high-frequency sound that cats detest, but which humans cannot hear.These devices are motion-activated, so that when a cat walks by, it is startled by the high-frequency sound and should leave the area. Look for ultrasonic devices at a pet supply store, and use them to create a barrier around your garden.

, Cats will not linger in areas they do not feel are safe from predators. For this reason, a dog that chases cats can effectively keep them out of your garden."

Make a cat sandbox.,
Attract cats to a cat garden.,
Move your bird feeder.",How to Keep Cats Out of a Garden4," You can create an alternative outdoor litter box for cats by using a new or old sandbox that is at least as big as a large litter box.Fill it with soft, fine-grained sand (this can be bought by the bag at hardware and home supply stores), which cats find especially attractive. With luck, cats will be drawn to the sandbox instead of your garden and use it much as they would a litterbox.


Make sure to scoop the sandbox regularly; if it gets too full, cats may return to using your yard.
Keep children away from the cat sandbox, and make sure they understand not to play in it.

, If you want to keep cats out of your garden, but don’t mind them being in other areas of your yard, then try making a cat-friendly area. Cats will be attracted to areas covered by certain plants, and hopefully leave the rest of your yard alone. Create a small plot and grow one or more of the following non-toxic plants in it:Catnip (Nepeta cataria)
Catmint (Nepeta mussinii)
Cat thyme (Teucrium marum)
Valerian (Valeriana officinalis)
Spider-plant (Chlorophytum comosum), If you have a bird feeder near your garden, move it to another area of your yard that is further away. Ideally, you should hang the bird feeder in an area that is too high for a cat to jump to. Otherwise, a bird that visits for a meal might be in more danger than your garden ever was.

Make the room physically uncomfortable for the cat.,
Spray the cat with water from a spray bottle.,
In addition, there are commercial electronic cat detergents that will spray a cat with a burst of air when it approaches the room.You simply place the device in the doorway to the room and let it deter your cat from the area.

,
Place smells in the room that your cat doesn't like.,
Redirect your cat's attention.,
Use positive training.",How to Keep Cats out of Rooms2," Sometimes you can't put a physical barrier up to keep your cat out of a room. In this case, you will need to make the room uncomfortable for it to be in. Make loud noises whenever it enters the room or shoo it away. Note that if you do this, the cat may associate the noise with you and start to avoid you.


You can even employ stronger methods in some cases. For example, spill a small amount of water on the floor of your bathroom if you don't want your cat in there. A cat may hate to get its feet wet on any excess water on the floor.
Another example is to make sure the cat has nowhere to hide in a room. Sometimes a cat likes going under beds or in corners to feel safe. With this type of cat you can block off access to under the bed or any other hiding spaces. This will make your cat uncomfortable in the room.

, Every time it goes near the room, have a spray bottle ready to spray a little water at it. This will make sure it knows that its actions are unacceptable.


However, only use this method if you are prepared to accept damaging your relationship with the cat. It is highly likely the cat will associate the water spray with you, the sprayer, rather than the room. Thus, the cat is more likely to flee and not want to spend time in your company.,, Put a small amount of vinegar at the room's entrance or in areas of the room. This usually helps, as most cats hate the odor of vinegar. This advice is anecdotal, however, as some people find it helps while for others it makes no difference.


Alternatively, fill a spray bottle halfway with vinegar. Fill the other half with lime or lemon juice. Spray at the entrance to the room and on beds and other places the cat usually goes. This will deter many cats from scratching on furniture or spending time in the room. If you go this route, the vinegar spray needs fairly constant reapplication.

, Make a different room more comfortable for the cat. Make another room cat-appealing so the cat will go there instead. Offer the cat several nice sleeping places (although it's likely to chose its own) including a high perch. Provide food, water, and a litter tray, as well as toys., This involves making a big fuss of the cat and making being in the room you want it to be in a pleasant experience. The goal is to make sure your cat associates the room with good things and wishes to return there. You may want to scatter extra tasty treats around the room so that it seems a more appealing place."

Get the biggest litter box you can find.,
Look for a litter box with a tracker trap.,
Place your cat’s litter box inside of another litter box.,
Try a covered litter box.,
Find a top entry litter box.,
Place a scatter mat under your cat’s litter box.,
Switch to a different type of litter.,
Fill the litter box with only one to two inches of litter.,
Vacuum or sweep around your cat’s litter box daily.,
Consider toilet training your cat.",How to Keep Cat Litter from Tracking," Cats bury their urine and feces after they use the litter box, so they are more likely to kick litter out of the pan if the litter box is too small. To reduce the amount of litter that gets kicked out of the pan, make sure that you provide your cat with the biggest litter box you can find.


If possible, get an auto mechanic’s oil change tray to use as your cat’s litter box. These trays have high sides and they are nice and big to help contain more of your cat’s litter.;
, Some litter boxes have built-in tracker traps around the edges that absorb some of the litter on your cat’s paws. Try to find a litter box that has a built-in tracker trap to help reduce litter tracking.

, You can also nest your cat’s litter box inside of another litter box to prevent litter from getting out of your cat’s box. Try placing your cat’s litter box inside of another box with shallow sides.If you can’t find another litter box or just don’t want to buy one, then a cardboard box will also work.

, Covered litter boxes can reduce litter tracking because they have walls on three sides, so your cat will not be able to kick as much litter out of the box. However, these types of boxes do not completely solve the problem because your cat may still kick litter out of the front entrance to the box.


Keep in mind that some cats dislike covered litter boxes because they keep odors inside the box and they are confining. If you have never used a covered litter box with your cat before, try adding one and see if your cat will use it., Getting a top-entry litter box may also be a good solution to the problem. Top entry litter boxes are closed on all sides and your cat has to enter through the top of the box. Just keep in mind that top-entry boxes are not ideal for all cats.For example, if your cat is older or arthritic, then she may have a hard time getting in and out of her box. Some cats also dislike these boxes because they are confining., Scatter mats are like floor mats for cats. You can place a large scatter mat under your cat’s litter box so that he will have to wipe his feet after he leaves his litter box. These mats can help to absorb some of the litter on your cat’s paws and prevent him from tracking litter all over.For extra litter trapping power, try placing multiple mats around your cat’s litter box.
There are lots of different kinds of mats that you can try. You can go with a basic floor mat, a plastic mat, a sisal mat, or even get a mat that looks like fake grass.

, Cats prefer a fine-grained litter, but if it is too fine, then too much may be sticking to your cat’s paws. Try changing to a litter that is slightly coarser than the litter you are using now.Cat litter comes in two basic types (clumping and non-clumping), but there is a lot of variation in the materials used to make cat litters.Clumping litter. Clumping litters are those that form a lump around urine so that it is easy for you to scoop litter out of your cat's litter box. Clay clumping litter is the most common, but you can also find clumping litter that is made from corn. You might find that a corn-based litter will not lead to as much tracking as clay litter.

Non-clumping litter. You can also look into different types of non-clumping litters. Non-clumping litters are available in clay, sawdust, wheat, and pine. Some of these litters come in large particles or pellets, so these might be harder for your cat to track out of the box as well.

, Cats do not need a deep bed of litter. Having too much litter in the pan may even lead to more litter ending up outside of the box. Instead, only fill your cat’s litter box with about one to two inches of litter., Taking a few minutes to vacuum or sweep around your cat’s litter box each day may also help to reduce tracking. Although this creates more work for you, keeping the area around your cat’s box clean will keep her from walking through litter and tracking it to other areas of the house.

, If you are tired of cleaning your cat’s litter box, then you might consider toilet training your cat. As long as your cat is not elderly or arthritic, then you may be able to train her to use a toilet.Toilet training a cat is easier with some special equipment, such as training seats that fit over your toilet bowl.
Keep in mind that the process of toilet training a cat will take lots of time and patience. If you do not have the time to invest in training your cat to use the toilet, then you may want to stick with the litter box.

Train your cat right away.,
Say ""no"" and remove your cat from the crib.,
Be consistent with your response.,
Spray your cat.",How to Keep a Cat out of a Crib1," It's best if your cat gets used to the crib before your baby is born. Try to set up the crib about a month before the birth and begin training your cat immediately. This way your cat will already be trained not to jump in the crib when your baby is ready to use it.Avoid making the crib really comfortable or your cat may want to nap in it.;
, If you see your cat jump into the crib, firmly say ""no"" and take it out of the crib right away. Put the cat down in a place where it's allowed to be. Avoid yelling at the cat.


Don't punish your cat once you've removed it from the crib. It should go off to a place where it's allowed to be.

, If your cat returns to jump in the crib or you find it in there later, say ""no"" and remove it from the crib. You'll need to remove your cat every time you find it in the crib so it associates jumping in the crib with being removed from the crib.


Avoid letting the cat nap in the crib or it will become confused about when the crib is off-limits.

, Another way to startle your cat into avoiding the crib is to spray the cat with water or an unpleasant-tasting spray. Buy bitter apple spray from a pet store or fill a spray bottle with water. If you see the cat jump into the crib, immediately spray it with water or the scent. Your cat will become startled and will begin to associate jumping into the crib with being sprayed.


Some argue that spraying your cat is an effective way to prevent it from jumping in the crib, but others believe that it can damage the bond you have with your cat and increase its stress level."

Create a noise trap in the crib.,
Lay double-sided tape in the crib.,
Keep furniture away from the crib.,
Close the door to your baby's room.",How to Keep a Cat out of a Crib2," Place something noisy in the bottom of the crib. This will startle your cat when it jumps in and the noise will usually scare the cat right out. Noise traps are great for when you won't be home to monitor or train your cat. Remember that you should never place a noise trap in the crib when your baby is in it.Aluminum foil makes a great noise trap. Tear off a long sheet that covers most of the crib and lay it across the mattress.

, If you don't want to hear the sound of a noise trap, you could lay down something sticky in the crib instead. Before your baby is born, lay strips of double-sided tape along the crib mattress where your cat usually lands. Most cats dislike the feeling of something sticky on their paws, so your cat will learn to avoid the space.You may need to lay the tape on the top of the crib rails if you find your cat jumping and perching on them.

, Cats may use bookshelves, chairs and the changing table as launching pads to help them catapult into the crib. Move these pieces of furniture away from the crib to minimize the risk, especially if your baby's crib has side rails that are tall.


This is also good baby proofing that will eventually prevent your toddler from easily climbing out of the crib., Perhaps the simplest way of keeping a cat out of a crib is to prevent your cat from entering the room in the first place. Keep the door to the nursery closed at all times so your cat learns that it (and the crib) are off limits.If you're concerned that you won't hear your baby, set up baby monitors or install a screen door to your baby's room. The screen door will keep the baby out while you can still see and hear the baby.

Create a comfortable space for your cat.,
Clicker train your cat.,
Distract your cat with new toys.,
Keep your cat in another room.",How to Keep a Cat out of a Crib3," Try to understand why your cat keeps jumping in the crib. If the crib seems like a cozy spot, try to make a more comfortable area for your cat. For example, you could set up a small cat bed in an area of your home that's out of the way. This will be a quiet, comfortable spot that your cat might begin to prefer.


Avoid putting blankets, pillows, and stuffed animals in the crib if your baby is under one year old. These are choking hazards and they might seem like comfortable things for your cat to curl up with., Train your cat to listen to your commands with a clicker device. When you click the device, give your cat a reward so it associates the clicking sound with the reward. The reward could be a cuddle or food treat. Do this several times or until your cat associates the click with the reward.Once your cat is clicker trained, you can encourage positive behaviors. For example, reward her when she jumps onto areas where she is allowed, instead of in the crib.

, Your cat may be jumping in the crib if its bored with its surroundings. Offer new toys to distract and entertain your cat. Scatter a variety of toys along the floor. This might also redirect her interest back to the floor and away from the crib. Try offering your cat:Round plastic shower curtain rings
Ping-pong balls
Empty paper bags with the handles removed
Plastic balls with bells inside
Sisal-wrapped tubes

, If you don't want to leave your baby's door closed, consider putting the cat in another room while your baby sleeps. You could keep the cat in an unused room of the house during nap times and bedtimes so it doesn't have access to the crib while your baby is in it.


If your cat is an indoor and outdoor cat, you could give it a chance to play outside while your baby sleeps.

Close all doors and windows.,
Limit access to exits.,
Install an electronic pet door.,
Use a pet proofing spray.,
Train your cat to stay indoors with a pet proofing barrier.",How to Keep a Cat Indoors1," Look around before opening any door to ensure your cat is not nearby, or at the very least, is preoccupied in playing with a toy. If you need to open a window, ensure it has a screen secured over it., If possible, secure the space in which the door leading outside is situated. For instance, if your foyer has an inner door (leading into the home) and an outer door (leading outside), close the inner door and ensure your cat is not in the foyer with you before opening the outer door to leave. When opening windows that do not have window screens, first check the room to ensure the cat is not there, then close the door to the room in which you’re opening the window.If you don’t have a foyer, put the cat in a different room before leaving.

, If you have a pet door in your house that you’re worried your cat might escape through, swap it out for an electronic pet door instead. This will allow you to lock the pet door during certain times and open it during other times. Some electronic pet doors allow you to equip one pet with an electronic signal key that will open the door for it, but not for the cat you want to keep indoors.Talk to a specialist at your local pet store for more information about your options.

, Pet proofing sprays are motion-activated devices that emit an irritating but harmless liquid spray on your pet when it approaches an area you don’t want it near. To keep a cat indoors, place a pet proofing spray near windows and doors that you anticipate your cat might escape through.The exact method for using a pet proofing spray will vary according to the device you choose to utilize. Consult manufacturer directions before use.
Generally, setting up a pet proofing spray unit is as easy as popping in a few batteries and turning the device on.

, A pet proofing barrier is similar to a pet proofing spray, except that instead of getting sprayed by harmless liquid, your cat will hear a loud and startling beep. Place the pet proofing barrier near doors and windows that you fear your cat will escape from. Strap the sensor collar on your cat so that the sensor can detect when your cat is near. Eventually, your cat will learn to avoid the areas where it hears the beep."

Give your cat plenty of toys to play with.,
Make sure your cat can see out a window.,
Give your cat a space of its own.,
Provide a screened porch for your cat.,
Set up a cat tree.,
Position your litter box in a quiet, low-traffic area.,
Clean your litter box regularly.",How to Keep a Cat Indoors2," To compensate for the lack of outdoor exploration and adventure, indoor cats will need toys to divert their attention and provide them with exercise and stimulation. Small, inexpensive toys like stuffed mice and plastic balls are often the most entertaining for cats, and can be played with even while you are away. Other toys – such as fishing-pole style toys that let you dangle a feather or piece of fabric in front of your cat – will require interaction with you.Using toys that require you to interact with the cat will help you to bond and create a better relationship with your pet.

, Indoor cats will be much less bored and anxious if they have visual access to the outdoors. Make sure there is at least one uncluttered windowsill for the cat to sit on. It is best if the cat can access a window that receives direct sunlight, because this will prove more attractive to them and improve their mood., If you have a window with a relatively deep sill, buy a padded perch and place it in front of the window. Alternately, invest in a window frame – a sort of clear, boxy unit similar to a windowsill air conditioner in which your cat can sit, hang out, and watch the world go by. Other cats might feel safest in their crates, so leave your cat’s crate or cage open at all times., If your cat can get some fresh air and survey its domain from an enclosed location, it’s a win-win for both you and the cat. If you don’t have a screened porch, consider building a “catio” – a large cage-like structure with many climbable surfaces. Your catio could be accessible directly from your home (via a side or rear door), or you could place it in your back yard. You can obtain catio building kits from most pet stores., A cat tree (sometimes called a “kitty condo”) is a vertical structure that provides your cat with opportunities for climbing, hiding, and jumping. Your cat will love navigating the cat tree. Set it up in an open space where your cat can freely move through and around it. You can easily obtain a cat tree at your local pet store., If your cat feels uncomfortable for any reason using its litter box, it may attempt to escape outside to relieve itself. Make sure that wherever you place the litter box, your cat will have an unobstructed view of the whole room. In your home, the living room, bedroom, kitchen, or family room might qualify as a good location.Do not, for instance, place the litter box next to a noisy furnace or washing machine. Placing it in the corner of a room, likewise, will not make your cat want to use it.

, If your cat’s litter box is dirty and/or stinky, it might want to do its business outside. To prevent this, scoop feces from the litter box daily. Any time you observe clumping or wet litter, empty the litter and replace it. Generally, you’ll need to do this about twice each week.Don’t place the litter box in a closet or in the corner of a room, either, since your cat will feel trapped when using it.
Additionally, do not place your cat’s litter box near its food dish. After all, just imagine how you’d feel dining right next to the place you go to the bathroom.

Spay or neuter your cat.,
Train your cat to sit and stay away from exits.,
Walk your cat.",How to Keep a Cat Indoors3," This is one of the easiest ways to keep a cat indoors, especially so if you have multiple cats. Neutering and spaying makes cats less territorial and inhibits their tendency to roam. Cats that have not been fixed will not adjust as well to being kept indoors, especially if they used to have access to the outside world.Plus, cats that have been neutered/spayed are more sociable and tend to have better health.

, Place your cat in a location away from any doors or windows through which it might escape. Click a clicker with one hand and, at the same time, use your free hand to administer a treat. Say “Good cat” in a gentle, reassuring way and pet the cat. Repeat three or four times per training session, and hold several such training sessions daily.After a week or so, your cat should begin to associate the sound of the clicker with being in that location. From then on, perform one or two sessions daily for another week.
After the second week, your cat should know where it needs to be when you enter and exit. From then on, click the clicker and administer two or three treats to occupy your cat just before you leave.
Take the clicker with you or leave it right by the door. When you come home, click the clicker and lavish your cat with positive attention.

, Sometimes your cat just wants to satisfy its curiosity about the great big world outside. Place your cat in its harness and connect it to a leash. Take your cat for a walk around the block, or take it to the park to help it get in touch with its wild side. With luck, this will diminish your cat’s urges to go outdoors, at least for a few days."

Having regular meals and a routine can build the kitten’s trust. This can also ensure that the mother brings out all of her kittens for food so you can choose one.Place an item of yours, such as a sweaty shirt, underneath the food dish. The kitten will associate your scent with good things.;
, Trapping is the safest and kindest way to catch your feral kitten. Purchase or rent a humane cage trap and follow the directions for assembly.Secure the trap door with a cable tie so that you can continue to build trust with the kitten before you actually trap it., Place the food bowl at the back of the cage trap. Sprinkle bits of cat food at the entrance of the trap and around the base surface. This ensures that the kitten feels comfortable entering the cage.Hide the cage trap under bushes or in another safe spot so that the kitten can confidently enter and exit it.

, After the kitten feels comfortable entering and exiting the cage, attach a string to the trap door and pull it closed when you’re ready. Stay out of sight of the trap and pull the door shut with the taut string. This can ensure that you don’t trap the kitten in the door or associate you with trauma., Place a dark-colored sheet over the trap cage. Pick it up and set it in a quiet, warm room for the kitten. This can calm the kitten before you take it to the vet and release it into your home., Imagine if you were a young kitten that loves and feeds from its mother and enjoys playing with your siblings. Consider what it would feel like if a larger animal started chasing you and grabbed at you. Steer clear of chasing and grabbing kittens, which can traumatize them and undermine your attempts to gain their trust., It takes time to build trust with feral kittens. Give yourself and the kitten time at least a few days to get used to one another before you trap it. This can ensure that you don’t traumatize the kitten(s) before you bring it home. It also helps build a relationship with the kitten that you can continue once you bring it home., Feral cats and kittens are often exposed to parasites and diseases. They may also have wounds. Ensure your kitten’s immediate and long-term health and wellbeing with a vet visit. Do this soon after trapping the kitten to get another potential trauma out of the way.Tell your vet the circumstances under which you captured your kitten. This can help the vet figure out what tests to run, vaccinations to administer, and provide other treatment the kitten may need.

, Many vets will assume feral cats have internal parasites, fleas, and ticks. Administer any medications your vet prescribes. This can ensure that your kitten gets healthy and minimizes the risk of transmitting illness or parasites to other animals. It may also stop excessive crying or meowing.

Give your kitten the full course of medication to fully treat any issues and prevent recurrences.
Ask you vet about administering medication with as little trauma to your kitten as possible.

, Consider having your kitten spayed or neutered as soon as they are at least eight weeks old and weigh a minimum of two pounds. This can prevent unwanted pregnancies if your kitten goes outside or is around other cats., Give your feral kitten time to get used to its new surroundings. Set up a separate and cozy area where it can sleep, eat, and use the litter box. Use an entire room or provide a partially covered large crate or box. This can ensure your kitten feels safe. It also lets you continue building trust with it.Place a blanket in the area for warmth and comfort. Consider putting a personal item, such as a sweatshirt in the space. This can get it used to your scent., Give your kitten a small amount of canned cat food. Moisten it with milk replacer for up to 10 weeks. The food should be about the consistency of oatmeal.This supports a kitten’s growth and health. It also builds trust and gives you a chance to engage your kitten with petting and praise.Avoid regular milk because this can upset your kitten’s stomach.
Put your kitten’s food in ceramic or metal bowls. Some kittens may be sensitive to plastic.Pour a separate bowl of fresh water for your kitten.

, Comfort the kitten as it lets you by gently petting its head, neck, and under its chin. Depending on how much trust you’ve built, pick up your kitten or sit next to it while you stroke it. This can calm it and provide reassurance., Give your kitten praise and chat with it while you pet or hold it. Maintain a soft voice to avoid scaring your kitten. This can give your kitten further comfort and reassurance.Say your kitten’s name often so it gets used to it. For example, “Hi Matilda, you’re such a sweet baby. Do you like it when I pet your belly, Matilda? Oh, you do! What a good kitten you are, Matilda!”

, Get your kitten simple toys such as a toilet paper roll, toy mice, or balls it can bat with its paws. This can ensure the kitten’s healthy development and strengthen your bond. Avoid any play with sudden movements, which can startle a kitten and undermine your ability to gain its trust., Raised voices or gentle taps can scare any cat. This is especially true of a feral kitten. Avoid yelling at or hitting your kitten. This can traumatize it and weaken your bond. If it does behaviors you don’t like, a firm “no” can let it know to stop."

Use an alternate entrance and exit.,
Don’t give your cat any attention at the door.If your cat thinks that being near the door is a place where you will pet or play with it, your cat will gravitate toward the door.,
Try a pet-proofing barrier or spray.A pet barrier is a small device which emits a loud beeping sound when your cat approaches the door.,

Spay or neuter your pet.If your cat is not spayed or neutered, it will have the urge to wander about looking for potential mates more than a cat who is.",How to Keep a Cat from Running out the Door1," If your cat is constantly hanging out by the front door, waiting to make its escape when some unwitting person opens it, try exiting out a different door. For instance, instead of going in and out through the front door, try using the back or garage door. Another good option is to exit and enter via a door with an antechamber. After passing through the first door, close it firmly behind you and look about to ensure your feline friend hasn’t followed you. If your cat does get past the first door, you’ll notice and be able to put him or her back inside before exiting the secondary door which actually leads outside.


When you have guests over, put your cat in another room until the festivities are over. This way, when people come through the main door, your cat won’t be around to dart through it.;
, If your cat is in the habit of greeting you and getting a friendly hello right when you walk in, break yourself of that habit.


Don’t even look at your cat until after you’ve taken your shoes off, removed your jacket, and moved away from the door. Instead, greet your cat warmly and pat it’s head only in the living room, bedroom, or hallway. This way, the cat will learn to meet you at the place where it knows you’ll give it attention.
Do the same thing when you leave. Instead of bidding your cat farewell at the door, do so at your designated hello/goodbye spot.

, The sound is triggered by a wireless device you attach to the cat’s collar. When the cat approaches to close to the door, the sound will trigger, scaring the cat away. If your cat is insistent on approaching the door, he or she will receive a small, harmless static shock from the collar in order to keep them inside. In time, your cat will avoid going near the door altogether.


A pet-proof spray is similar in purpose, if not design. Place the spray can near the door you want the cat to stay away from. Then, switch it on. The device will emit an irritating but harmless spray whenever your pet approaches the door.Be sure to turn the device off when you’re not expecting to open the door through which the cat might disappear.

, If you do not have a cat door with a lock or sliding latch, you can easily attach one and open it during certain times of the day when you want to allow your cat to go outside.

, A special kitty bed or carpeted perch are good options. Before opening the door to leave, bring your cat over to the designated sitting spot. Use a treat or a toy like a small bell to get the cat’s attention. Once your cat is situated where you want it, say “Sit.” Be firm, but not aggressive. Say it again several seconds later. Repeat this about ten times, and award a treat after three or four times.


Don’t worry about actually getting your cat to sit in a seated position as you would with a dog. As long as your cat removes itself to the place where it will remain when you exit your home upon hearing the command, you’ve accomplished what you needed to.

, Keep a spray bottle filled with water just outside your door. When you open the door to come in, open it just a crack so that you can see your cat waiting to run outside. Put the nozzle of the bottle through the crack and hit your kitty with a well-aimed squirt. It might take a few direct hits before your cat backs up. After a week or so of doing this, your cat will associate the door with getting sprayed by the squirt bottle and avoid going near the door.This method, unfortunately, only works when you’re entering the home, not exiting. If you do it while exiting, your cat will associate you, not the door, with the irritation of getting sprayed by the water bottle, and it could create bad feelings between you.
Alternately, as you enter your home, make loud noises like hissing, stomping, or knocking to get the cat away before opening the door.

, If your cat is fixed, on the other hand, it will have no desire to breed and thus be more inclined to stay home.


It’s typically safe for cats as young as eight weeks old to be spayed or neutered, but you should always ask your vet if and when it is possible for your cat to be sterilized."

Play with your cat.",How to Hug a Cat," Before attempting to hug your cat, get to know your cat's temperament. Not all cats enjoy a lot of physical contact and could scratch or bite if hugged. Make sure your cat is the affectionate type before attempting a hug.


Spend time with your cat. Spend an hour or so a day in the same room as your cat. Pay attention to how she interacts with you. Does she tend to be snuggly and affectionate, rubbing her face on you? Or does she tend to be somewhat standoffish, sitting near you but not wanting much physical affection?Cats that are more touchy-feely tend to be more relaxed about being picked up and handled. It's probably safe to try and hug a friendlier cat, but one that seems standoffish or shy may dislike being handled in this fashion.;
, Even a warm and affectionate cat will lash out when frightened. Take some time to learn about cat body language so you can gauge when a cat is in a positive mood.


When cats are happy, they show it with their body. Ears are generally forward slightly, pupils constricted with eyes half closed, tails straight up and curled on the top, and backs arched with fur flattened. Cats will also purr or meow quietly when happy to see you.Conversely, an aggressive or frightened cat will growl or meow loudly in a lower pitch. She will dilate her pupils, thrash her tail back and forth or tuck it between her legs, and arch her back and stick her fur up. You should not try to hug a cat in this state., Even friendly and affectionate cats might resist being picked up. Cats tend to be more independent animals and often resist feeling confined. However, cats who've lived with young children are often used to be carried around and will allow it. If a cat does not like being held, she might thrash or squirm in your arms. You might still be able to hug a cat who dislikes being picked up, but you'll have to do so without holding her., You should always wash your hands before hugging or petting a cat. You want to make sure your hands are free of any irritants that could upset your cat.


Wet your hands with clean water and lather with soap. Make sure to lather between your fingers, behind your fingernails, and the backs of your hands. Spend about 20 seconds lathering. It can help to sing the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice to keep track of time.Rinse your hands under water. Dry them with a clean towel., You should never sneak up a cat to hug her. You should also not bother your cat when she's sleeping, playing, or eating. Allow your cat to come to you. Sit in the same room as your cat and wait until she decides she wants your attention. When your cat comes up to you and begins purring and pawing at you, it's safe to hug her., Do not go straight into the hug. This can be jarring for a cat. Spend a few moments petting your cat before hugging her.


Pet your cat on the back, shoulders, under the chin, and behind the ears. Cats tend to dislike being touched on the stomach or sides, as these are vulnerable areas.Talk to your cat in a calming, gentle voice so she's relaxed., Once your cat seems calm and happy, you can try to hug her. Do so slowly and if your cat seems aggravated stop.


Some cats might jump up on your chest if you stand in front of them. If your cat does this, try leaning down and see if she puts her hands up on your shoulders. Then, gently lift her towards your chest by raising her back legs with one hand and holding her back in place with the other.
Remember, not all cats like being picked up. If your cat resists being held, try hugging her by just putting your arms around her when she's sitting or lying down by her. Many cats that dislike being picked up enjoy these kinds of hugs.
Cats prefer different hugging techniques depending on their personalities. However, almost all cats prefer their full body be supported during a hug. Make sure her bottom legs are supported. Try to keep one hand on her chest or back and another supporting her back legs., Cats enjoy being brushed. It helps keep their fur free of dirt and debris. Cats also may enjoy the sensation of brushing as it itches places they cannot reach with their paws. Hard to reach spots, like the back of your cat's neck or under her chin, might occasionally need a gentle brushing to keep these areas free of mats. You can get a cat brush at a local pet store., Most cats enjoy being petted. If your cat dislikes being picked up, you can show affection by petting her each day.


As always, let your cat come to you. Cats dislike being interrupted while they're doing other things. Cats will show you they want to be petted by gently scratching at your arms, rubbing up against you, and climbing in your lap.
Make sure to pay attention to where your cat likes to be petted. Some cats have specifics spots on their sides and stomachs they dislike having touched. If your cat growls or shies away, try petting her in a different spot.

, Cats of all ages enjoy playtime. Most cats need 15 to 20 minutes of play time each day.


Cats enjoy toys that resemble prey they would stalk in the wild. Toys with fake fur and feathers can be a lot of fun for cats. Try attaching a toy mouse to a string or buying a bird toy that comes equipped with a fishing pole like device so you can make the bird ""fly.""
Cats tend to be more energetic during the morning hours, so if possible play with your cat when you first wake up.

Call your cat.,
Offer your cat food or treats.,
Lure your cat out with a toy.",How to Get Your to Cat Come Out from Under the Bed1," If your cat is well-acclimatized to you and your home, and is not feeling particularly scared or stressed, getting your cat to come out could be as simple as calling them. If you normally call your cat at dinner time, for treats, or just when you want to give them affection, then your cat probably already associates being called with good things. Call your cat as you normally would for food or companionship., It may be enough just to crinkle a treat bag or tap a spoon on the rim of a food can. If your cat is feeling extremely scared or shy, try setting out food, treats, or catnip near the bed and wait quietly nearby until the cat comes out to eat.If you have a new cat that is still getting acclimatized, this can be a good way to help them get more comfortable in your home. Allow your cat to eat undisturbed and go back under the bed if it desires. After repeating this process a few times, your cat will probably begin to feel safer and start to spend more time out in the open.

, If your cat has a favorite toy, like a “fishing lure” on a string, try dangling it and shaking it around in the cat’s line of sight. Toys that make sound (e.g. toys with bells) may be especially effective for attracting the cat’s attention. Dangle the toy near the edge of the bed. Once the cat starts playing with it, slowly back up to lure them out all the way.

Distract your cat from the door.,
Provide entertainment.There are many forms of entertainment available for cats, though not all will actually capture your particular kitty’s attention.,
Let your cat explore the great outdoors.",How to Keep a Cat from Running out the Door2," When you leave the house for a long period, give your cat a treat. If your cat busies itself with nibbling its treat instead of darting out the door, your problem is solved. You could also give your cat a puzzle feeder on your way out in order to distract it from the fact that you’re leaving.A puzzle feeder is a small device -- often a rubber ball or oblong shape -- with a small hole and hollow middle into which bits of kibble or cat treats are placed. The puzzle feeder gives the cat stimulation -- potentially for hours -- as well as a yummy snack. The puzzle feeder will keep it from running outside.

, Experiment with a variety of entertainment options and see which keep your pet engaged.


For instance, bring a few plants inside. These will provide interesting smells for your cat. Avoid plants like amaryllis, chrysanthemums, irises, lilies, and tulips, which can be toxic to cats.Hide some treats throughout the house. You can hide them in puzzle feeders or just easily accessible in unusual locations.
Offer your cat a variety of toys like rolling balls, scratching posts, and a few wadded-up balls of paper.Your cat might also enjoy watching TV. If you have Animal Planet, NatGeo, or other nature programming, these are best. DVDs made specifically to entertain cats are also available, featuring footage of other animals.

, Create a kitty enclosure or walk your cat regularly.Your cat runs outside because he or she wants to get out and explore. They want fresh air, sunshine, and new, exciting smells! Fortunately, you can reduce your cat’s desperate jailbreak attempts by letting your cat experience a bit of the great outdoors.


If you have a screened porch, give your cat access to it. Ensure there are plenty of perches in it so that your kitty can see outside.
If you don’t have a screened porch, you can easily obtain some plastic or wire fencing and make a small enclosure which allows your cat to spend time outside without running out the front door. Provide access to the enclosure via a back door or open window. If your enclosure’s walls are at least seven feet high, you do not need to include a roof.
Walking your cat is another way to give him or her time to explore the great outdoors.Attach the leash to your cat’s collar or harness and let them drag it around for a bit, getting used to the feeling of it. Give your cat a snack or some wet food while you’re adjusting the harness in order to distract them from the process. Then, head outside and enjoy some bonding time with your kitty. Walking your cat gives it the opportunity to get the outdoor experience, and allows it to exercise its brain in new, healthy ways.

By installing a small cat door, you can make outside a consistently available option to help your cat make the transition when you eventually remove the litter box.If installing a cat door simply isn’t an option, then be prepared to let your cat out early and often. You’ll need to take the cat out as soon as you wake up, after each feeding, and before you go to sleep to give your cat ample opportunities to go outside.;
, Though your cat will ultimately toilet in the spot outside that he or she chooses, you can take steps to make a particular spot seem more inviting and like the most logical choice for your cat. Try to pick a spot with the following qualities:Looser soil where your cat can dig and bury any waste (ensure you have a lid for any children’s sandboxes for this reason as well).
Shelter on one or more sides, such as a wall or fence. Cats don’t like to feel exposed while toileting, so natural shelter on the sides will make it a more comfortable site for your cat.
Overhead protection, such as a bush or tree. Your cat will also feel more comfortable if the spot has some overhead protection as well. It can be a natural spot like a bush or a small canopy you put up. This will also keep the area more comfortable for your cat during inclement weather.

, If the cat will have to share the area with a dog, play children, etc., then you should also choose an enough far enough out of the way for the cat to be comfortable.Your cat won’t take to the spot if he or she has to worry about being startling while doing the business.

, Litter-trained cats can be very particular about where they go—even taking to one specific type of litter more than others. Take some of your cat’s preferred litter and spread it over the spot you’ve designated. This will go a long way toward helping the cat understand that the spot is meant to be his or her new litter box., The following steps are likely to take weeks and several repetitions as you allow your cat to get more comfortable with the new toileting spot. Start by simply taking the cat to the newly designated spot to sniff around. Your cat will understand that it is his or her kitty litter spread over the location, but it will still take time for your cat to understand that it’s okay to go here.

, To help your cat learn that it’s okay to use the new spot, try scooping fresh waste from the indoor litter box and placing it on the kitty litter spread across the designated outdoor spot.Take your cat to the spot again to let him or her sniff around. This will go even further to show your cat that it’s an acceptable place to toilet.

, Food in your cat’s stomach stimulates the bowels, so your cat will likely want to go within twenty minutes of eating. Take your cat outside directly after eating and close the door to keep the cat outside around the designated spot. You increase the chance of making your cat decide to use the new, designated spot this way.Don’t hover over your cat or keep moving the cat back to the spot, and don’t offer praise if your cat starts using the spot. Cats don’t react to positive reinforcement like dogs, and you’re more likely to distract the cat from the toileting process.
If more than twenty minutes pass, your cat might still be holding to use the indoor box. Let your cat back inside if this is the case since you want the cat to begin choosing to use the new spot.
Try taking your cat out after eating several times over the course of a week to see if he or she finally gets the idea.

, As previously noted, cats can be extremely picky about where they go. Your cat might not be comfortable with the mix of litter and earth at the spot you’ve designated. To help your cat adjust to this mixture, add some earth from the spot to the indoor litter box—around one-quarter earth to three-quarters litter.Your cat will still use the litter box and will begin to understand that the new mix is still an acceptable place to go.


Keep taking your cat out several times a week after mealtime during this step as well.

, If your cat still hasn’t caught on, then you can start slowly relocating the litter box to help the process along. First, keep the box inside but move it next to the cat door leading out to the yard. If you don’t have a cat door, then simply next to the door you use to take the cat outside. Ensure that you show the cat that you’ve moved the box so that it’s not suddenly absent when he or she goes to use it in the previous location.You may also want to put a piece or furniture or some other barrier up in the litter box’s previous location. You cat may otherwise try to go on the floor where the litter box was previously located.
Leave the box in the new spot for several days and continue taking your cat outside to the designated spot after meals. The combined shakeup of the earth inside the litter box and its new location might be enough to make your cat begin using the outdoor spot.

, If your cat still hasn’t made the switch after all of the other steps, then you can simply take the tray from the litter box and place it outside. Put it next to the cat door (or the door you use to take the cat out) so that you cat doesn’t have to venture very far outside to use it.Again, ensure that you show the cat the new location of the litter tray to stop him or her from using the floor inside instead.

, Once your cat has finally made the transition to going outside, you can still keep moving the tray farther from the cat door until you’ve essentially placed it on the designated spot.If you do this over the course of a week, your cat will adjust to moving a little farther outside each day to use the tray.


Once you get the tray to the designated spot, take another ten days to adjust the mix of kitty litter to earth in the tray. When the mix is primarily earth and your cat still uses it, then try taking away the tray altogether and placing some of the waste on the designated spot.This should finally do the trick.

If you are trying to acclimatize a new cat to your home, letting them hide for a bit can help them feel more secure. If there’s no urgent reason to make them come out, don’t try to rush them., Your cat may feel overwhelmed if they are in a new space that is larger than what they are used to. Limiting your cat’s “territory” to a single room may help them feel safer and encourage them to come out of hiding and explore., Minimize noise in the room, and keep children and other pets out until your cat is feeling less nervous and overwhelmed. Try playing some soothing classical music to give the cat a gentle sound to focus on and distract them from other, more alarming noises., Purchase a bottle of Feliway or a similar product designed to reduce cat anxiety from your vet or pet supply store. Treat the room with the spray. Put a treated towel in a cardboard box, or spritz a little spray on a cat bed, and put it near your bed., Don’t try to soothe or pet the cat while they are hiding, or you may inadvertently reinforce the hiding behavior. Ignore the cat until they start to emerge, then offer praise, affection, or treats."

Bring the vacuum cleaner into the bedroom, set it up next to the bed, and turn it on. Most cats will bolt at the sound. If your cat is really determined to stay, try sliding the vacuum cleaner hose under the bed and shaking it around., Insert a broom under the bed and gently sweep it back and forth to try to chase the cat out. This may not be effective if your cat is able to climb up into your box-spring.

, There are a variety of devices on the market designed to repel cats with extremely high-frequency sounds that are inaudible to most humans, but unpleasant to cats.Try a handheld device (like the Scatter Cat Pest Repeller or Bestcompu Scram Patrol).


Consider placing a sonic deterrent pad (like Sofa Scram) at the cat’s access points to the bed in order to keep the cat from going under in the first place.

It's important that you remember to set up the trash receptacle close to the litter box, so that you don't risk scattering waste or litter across the floor., Some experts recommend wearing disposable gloves and a dust mask to prevent the spread of toxoplasmosis, a virus that some cats carry which is transmitted through fecal matter.Even if you don't directly handle the feces, cleaning the litter box can cause dust to fly in the air, which can irritate the lungs and may lead to transmission of toxoplasmosis.

, Cat feces should be scooped out at least once every day.Some experts even recommend scooping out solid wastes twice a day for a really clean box.If you let solid wastes build up in the litter box, your cat may refuse to use the litter box, even if the litter was only changed a few days ago.


Use a special scooper, available at most pet stores. These scoopers have a grated bottom, so you can collect solid waste while the surrounding litter falls through the grates and back into the litter box.

, If you use clumping litter, your cat's urine should form solid clumps of litter. These should be scooped on a daily basis, just like feces.If you don't use clumping litter, sprinkle a layer of baking soda at the bottom of the litter box, before you pour in the litter. This can help absorb the odors from cat urine that might get missed during daily scooping., If you're scooping the box out on a daily basis, there's a chance you might have lost some of the litter, either because it stuck to your cat's waste or because it simply spilled out during cleaning or use. Topping off your cat's litter every few days can help keep the box clean and appealing to your cat.

Prepare for setbacks.",How to Toilet Train Your Cat," If you've decided to toilet train your cat, the first step in the process is creating a designated bathroom for the cat to eliminate. Choose the bathroom in your home that your cat has easiest access to. Move the cat's litter box into the bathroom and place it near the toilet., You need a variety of supplies in order to toilet train your cat. Your cat will be transitioning from his regular litter box to a training seat and eventually to the toilet.


A cat training seat is a small contraption placed over the toilet bowl. A small indent in the center of the device will be filled with flushable litter. As you progress in training, you begin by cutting bigger and bigger holes in the training seat until your cat gets used to urinating and defecating straight into the toilet rather than litter. You can purchase a training seat or make one on your own.The Litter Kwitter is one brand of training seat. It has color coordinated training trays of increasing size. As your cat progresses in training, you will swap out a larger tray for a smaller one. Eventually, you'll be able to move the tray altogether and your cat will eliminate straight into the toilet. The Litter Kwitter is highly convenient but can be somewhat expensive. It generally sells for $40 to $50.If you'd rather save money, you can create a training tray yourself. You will need duct tape, plastic liner or kitchen plastic wrap, and an aluminum roasting pan size 12 5/8"" x 10 1/8"" x 3""., If you opt to create your own training tray, the process is fairly simple. You should have know how to create a training tray before transitioning from the litter box to the toilet.


To create the training tray, simply place the aluminum roasting pan over the toilet's rim. Secure in place with duct tape.If the tray is not big enough to fully encompass the toilet bowl, fill in any gaps with plastic wrap., In order to transition your cat from litter box to toilet, you'll need to raise the litter box up near the toilet seat. Eventually, your cat will learn to jump onto the toilet seat when he has to eliminate each week. Using stacks of newspaper, cardboard, or old magazines raise the litter box by 3 inches each day until it's on level with the toilet seat., Once the litter box is on level with the toilet seat, place it on top of the toilet seat. Leave it there for a few days. This is about how long it will take your cat to get comfortable eliminating on the toilet., Once your cat is comfortably using the litter box without any accidents, it's time to use your training seat. Secure your training seat on the toilet.


If you're using the Litter Kwitter or a similar product, use the smallest training pan. This training pan will have no hole in it and you'll simply fill it with flushable litter.If you're using an aluminum tray, simply put the tray in place and fill it with flushable litter. Do not cut any holes in the tray yet., Give your cat a few days to get used to eliminating in the training tray. Once he does so accident free, it's time to start making the transition.


If you're using the Litter Kwitter or a similar product, gradually transition into bigger and bigger training seats. Training seats will have small holes in them that get larger as your cat moves through his training.
If you're using an aluminum, use a screw driver to cut a hole in the bottom of the pan. Every day, make the hole slightly bigger.Gradually decrease the amount of litter you're using as well. Each time your cat eliminates in the pan, replace the litter with a slightly smaller amount than before., After about two weeks of increasing the size of the hole or training trays, you can remove the training seat completely. Your cat should now be comfortable eliminating straight into the toilet rather than a litter box., Toilet training is not for everyone. If you and your cat do not have the right mentality, you might be better off sticking to the litter box.


If your cat is very young, less than six months old, or already has issues using a litter box, toilet training might not be the best option. Cats who are older and are already comfortable with their litter box are easiest to toilet train.If your cat is skittish, he might struggle with litter box training. Shyer cats generally prefer to cover their feces and urine to protect themselves from potential predators.Toilet training takes time, organization, and dedication. If you're not generally a well organized person or if you're very busy, you might be better off sticking with litter., Many vets advise against toilet training cats. Familiarize yourself with the criticisms of toilet training so you can make a well informed decision about whether it's right for you and your pet.


First off, toilet training goes against a cat's natural instincts. Cats have a natural tendency to dig and bury when eliminating. Using the toilet, even after proper training, can cause stress for a cat. You do not want using the bathroom to be a stressful event as it can lead to behavioral and health issues for your cat.The toilet lid must always be left open. If you or a house guest accidentally closes the toilet lid, your cat will eliminate elsewhere.Older cats or cats with joint problems will have trouble reaching the toilet and maintaining balance on the rim. There is a risk for injury with toilet training, especially for senior cats., Toilet training, even when done properly, frequently causes setbacks. If your cat is resistant to a step in the process, he might begin eliminating elsewhere. If this occurs, take a step back in toilet training and see if this helps. It's a good idea to have a lot of cleaning supplies on hand when toilet training. In all likelihood, there will be at least one accident along the way."

Empty out the old litter.,
Scrub the empty litter box.,
Dry the litter box thoroughly.,
Consider adding baking soda.,
Choose the right litter.,
Pour in clean litter.",How to Clean a Litter Box2," While scooping will do on a day-to-day basis, you'll need to completely empty the litter and scrub the box at least once every week. Some cat owners may have to clean the litter box two or more times each week if there are multiple cats using the same litter box.Keep a waste basket or trash bag close by, and dump everything out of the litter box before cleaning it., Once the litter is removed, you'll need to scrub the litter box, either in a sink or with a hose outside. Some experts recommend scrubbing the box at least once every week, while other experts recommend scrubbing at least once each month.How often you wash your cat's litter box will depend on how many cats use the box and what kind of litter you use.


Use warm water and a mild detergent, like dish soap, that won't leave any harsh chemical smells or residue behind.You can make an effective cleaning agent by scrubbing baking soda and a little warm water on all inside surfaces of the litter box.Make sure that you rinse away all of the soap. Your cat may not use the box if it smells like soap or detergent.Note that any cleaning agents that smell like ammonia or citrus will repel cats. Using a cleaning agent with these smells may result in your cat being reluctant to use the litter box after you've cleaned it., It's important to ensure that the box is completely dry before you add new litter, as the litter will stick to the wet sides and bottom of the box. If you use clumping litter and fail to dry the box, it might even render the whole box full of litter unusable. You can let the box air dry, or use paper towels or napkins to wipe the box dry., Some experts recommend sprinkling a thin layer of baking soda on the bottom of the box, before pouring on the clean litter. This can help absorb smells, and may help absorb some of the urine, if you don't use clumping litter., Cats generally prefer clumping litter over non-clumping litter. Most cats find that it's more comfortable to walk on clumping litter because it's made of finer-grained material, and it's generally easier for your cat to bury his waste in. Plus, clumping litter will make it much easier for you to keep the litter box clean.However, some cats do prefer traditional, non-clumping clay litter. Take note of what your cat seems to prefer, and try to cater to his choice in litter.Do not use a clumping litter if you have a kitten. The curious kitten may investigate the litter with their mouth and accidentally swallow some. Clumping litter can cause a dangerous bowel obstruction in your kitten's intestines, requiring emergency care.
The Humane Society cautions against using litter with perfume or deodorizer added to it, as this may irritate your cat or trigger an allergic reaction. If odor is a concern, adding baking soda to the litter box is a safe, odor-absorbing alternative to scented litter., Once the box is completely dry, you'll need to refill the litter. However, you'll want to be sure to add the correct amount of litter. Too much litter will make a mess when your cat steps in and out of the box, and some cats (especially long-haired cats) are actually reluctant to use a box that is too full of litter.But using too little litter can make your cat feel like he won't be able to bury his waste, which can lead to out-of-box elimination. Insufficient litter can also lead to odor problems in your home.Most cats only need about two inches (about five centimeters) of litter.Don't pour more than four inches (about 10 centimeters) of litter, or your cat may not use the box.Whatever depth you choose to use, be consistent. Your cat may become stressed or confused if he suddenly has a lot more or less litter than he's used to."
"
Learn your cat's preferences.,
Clean out-of-box waste thoroughly.,
Keep track of your cat's bathroom habits.",How to Clean a Litter Box3," If your cat is eliminating outside the box, he may not like something about his litter box situation. Whether it's the wrong kind of litter, the wrong depth of litter, an unclean litter box, or even a poorly placed litter box, your cat may be trying to send you a message.If your cat doesn't like traditional clay litter, try a clumping litter. If he doesn't like scented litter, try unscented litter. With a little trial and error, you'll be able to figure out your cat's preferences.Be sure your cat's litter box is in a quiet, low-traffic area. If there's a lot of noise, like in a laundry room, or a lot of traffic coming through, like your home's living room, your cat may become reluctant to use the litter box. Choose a place that's quiet and relatively undisturbed, but not so undisturbed that your cat has to make a long journey through the house to get there., Use an enzyme-based cleaning product to treat any household furniture or carpeting that your cat has eliminated on. This will break down any residual odor on the furniture, ensuring that your cat won't come to see it as an acceptable place to relieve himself.If your cat leaves solid waste on the floor or on any furniture, use a paper towel to move the feces to his litter box, rather than throwing it in the trash. This will help remind him to use the litter box next time., If your cat isn't using the litter box, it's important to check around the house to look for out-of-box elimination. If he isn't urinating anywhere, it's a sign that he may have a urinary tract infection, bladder/kidney stones, or a partially- or fully-blocked urethra. If you believe your cat is not eliminating, or if he is eliminating with blood in his urine or stool, take him to a veterinary emergency clinic immediately.This is another reason why it's a good idea to scoop the box on a daily basis. Scooping your cat's waste allows you to monitor his health, as you'll see signs of digestive or urinary problems right away and be able to act fast."
"
Scoop it once a day.,
Place the materials in a trash bag.,
Consider a self-cleaning box.",How to Clean Your Kitty Litter Box1," Your kitty likes a clean litter box, and while you probably don't want to change the litter completely every day, scooping it daily will help keep your cat happy. You should definitely scoop out out any feces, as well as any pee clumps if you're using a clumping litter.To scoop it, use a litter shovel to remove the clumps. These scoops are slotted, the clean litter falls below, while the scoop keeps any clumps.Consider wearing gloves when scooping the litter, or at the very least, wash your hands thoroughly after scooping.;
, While some litters are technically flushable, it's a better idea to just throw anything you clean out into a trash bag. Flushing it can cause plumbing problems over time, as litter doesn't break down as easily as toilet paper. Plus, some cities prefer that you don't flush any type of litter.Scoop anything out into its own bag. It's best if it seals or if you can tie it up. Then place it in your trash.

, If you don't like scooping once a day, you can use a self-cleaning box instead. These boxes can sense when your cat has used the bathroom (and left the area). Once the cat is done, the box has a slotted bar that slides across, scooping out any lumps. You still need to clean out the collection regularly, but you won't need to do it quite as often."

Repeat these steps as needed if the urine stain is tough.",How to Clean Cat Urine," It's easiest to clean fresh stains that are still damp, since you can lift much of the urine from the affected spot. However, you may also come across dried stains. In these cases, the same procedures should be followed, even though the urine has had more time to break down and soak into the surface.


The smell will usually lead you directly to the area where your cat has urinated, though you might have to feel around with your hands for a wet spot if it is on carpet or cloth-covered furniture, or a sticky spot if it has dried on tile, linoleum or hardwood floors.You can also try using a black fluorescent light. These lights will show stains on furniture, walls, or carpet as yellow spots. You can purchase a black light rather inexpensively from pet stores or online.;
, Using paper towels, blot up as much of the urine as possible if the surface is fabric or carpet. With these surfaces, there is a danger of the urine soaking into the fibers of the material. Use a gentle dabbing motion to blot up the urine.If you're concerned about using a lot of paper towels for environmental reasons, use a cloth towel or rag or even old clothes that can be thrown away.You can also use a wet vacuum to ""suck up"" the urine if you have one on hand. This will lift more of the cat urine than blotting. Do not use a steam cleaner as at this point in the cleaning process the heat can cause the odor to last much longer and be more difficult to remove., Scrubbing away at the stain at this stage will only cause it to sink in deeper.


If the stain is already dry, pour cold water on the stain, and blot., Remember to wear shoes. This will help to bring up the stain from the surface., You can either use a commercial product or make your own stain-removing solution using common household products. See below for instructions for both cleaners.

, Look in particular for an enzymatic cleaner. Enzymatic cleaners are specifically designed for cleaning urine-soiled areas. These types of cleaners break down the enzymes in the cat urine and neutralize the odor. They can usually be purchased at any pet store. Well-known brands include Knock Out, Urine Off, and Anti-Icky Poo.


Enzymatic cleaners break down the uric acid in cat urine into carbon dioxide and ammonia. These are both gasses that will then easily evaporate and thereby neutralize the odor.These cleaners work on both fresh and old urine stains., Some cleaners may have their own specific instructions for use so make sure to go over these carefully before applying the cleaner to the soiled area.


Always follow any instructions that come with the specific cleaner you have purchased. Failure to follow the proper instructions could result in permanent damage to your furniture or surface.

, Always test out the product on a small, out-of-sight area to see whether the product results in any damage or discoloration to the area.If you notice anything unusual, stop using the product. Either purchase a different commercial product or try the homemade solution below.
If you don't see anything, then go ahead and apply the product to the soiled area.

, Let the cleaner sit for 10-15 minutes so it can soak into the stain. Then blot up as much of the cleaner as you can using paper towel or a rag., This is very important because the cleaner needs this time to effectively break down the uric acid salts and then allow the gasses to evaporate.


Close off the affected area. Cats are naturally attracted by the enzymes in urine and will be drawn to urinate in areas that have previously been urinated in. Cover the area loosely with something like aluminum foil or an upside-down laundry basket. This will not only keep the cat from attempting to pee in the same spot while the cleaner does its job but also keep any members of the household from stepping on the area.

, Be aware that if you are dealing with an old stain, you may need to apply the enzymatic cleaner two or three times (and being sure to let it completely dry between applications) in order to fully get rid of the stain., While enzymatic cleaners are ideal, you can substitute a homemade cleaner that uses white vinegar, baking soda, liquid dish detergent, and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Vinegar helps to kill any bacteria and neutralize the odor.This mixture works well for treating both old and new stains.

, Pour this mixture over the stain and soak for about 3 to 5 minutes. Then blot the area to soak up the excess liquid.Note that vinegar should not be used on marble or stone surfaces.

, Be generous in your application of the baking soda. It helps to draw out the urine., Sprinkle this solution over the baking soda. Scrub this solution into the soiled area with a cloth. Rinse the cloth several times as needed. Scrub in several different directions to make sure the solution is thoroughly penetrating the soiled area. Blot the area again. , Once the spot is good and dry, vacuum up the excess baking soda.


If the surface of the affected area feels hardened or crunchy, try rinsing the area with some warm water and letting it air dry.

, Once you have cleaned the soiled area and are giving it time to dry, close off the area to prevent your cat from having access to it. This will give you time to be sure that the stain and its odor have been eliminated. Then you can open the area again.

, Remember to keep your eye on your cat and your nose attuned to any smells of urine."

Pick a private space for the litter box.,
Give your cat easy access to the box.,
Install kitty doors to give your cat litter box access.,
Store the litter box away from their food and toys.,
Choose a location that's quiet.",How to Hide a Cat Litter Box1," Think of your cat's needs when you decide where to put the litter box. Cats prefer privacy and quiet when they use the litter box, so find a space that's not heavily trafficked in your house. For example, you could place the litter box in the:Spare bathroom
Quiet corner of a storage room
Closet or unused cabinet
Basement
Garage;
, Make sure your cat can easily access the litter box. Your cat should be able to get to the litter box whenever it needs to and without your assistance. If your cat feels like it can't get to its box or doesn't like where the box is at, it may begin having accidents throughout the house.Ensure that your cat doesn't feel like it's trapped when it uses the box. For example, don't put the box in a cabinet inside a closed-off closet or it may feel like it's going to be ambushed.

, If you plan on storing the litter box in a room that you normally keep closed off or in a cabinet or closet, you'll need to keep the doors open or install kitty doors. You can simply cut a space in the bottom of the cabinet or door to give your cat access. Or you can cut a hole and install a little flap that will also give your cat a little extra privacy.Ensure that the kitty door is large enough to accommodate your cat. If you have a kitten, anticipate how big it will be as an adult and purchase a kitty door that will be large enough for your cat when it reaches maturity.

, While it might be tempting to create a little cat space that contains your cat's litter box, toys, food, and water, most cats dislike having their food and water near their litter box. Try to place these away from each other so your cat will use the litter box.Your cat will appreciate having a space that it can go to when it feels overwhelmed.

, You should also take noise into account. Even if you find a space that's out of the way, if there are loud noises, your cat may not like to use the box. For example, while your laundry room might be a pretty quiet space, it may become too loud for your cat if you're running the washer and dryer.

Consider how your daily activities in the space contribute to the noise. If you have an office that's out of the way and you quietly work there, it may be a good place for your cat.

Clean the litter box daily.,
Wear gloves when scooping litter.,
Wear a mask.,
Wash your hands after cleaning the litter box.,
Sweep up any spillover.,
Clean the scoop.,
Dispose of the cat litter properly.",How to Avoid Germs when Cleaning a Litter Box1," Your cat will use the litter box daily. This means you should clean the litter box daily. You should not leave feces in litter boxes because they contain bacteria and parasites.If you have more than one cat, you should clean the litter box twice a day. Consider cleaning the litter box once in the morning and once in the evening.
Clean litter boxes help keep cats from messing in other parts of your home, which will reduce the spread of germs.;
, One way you can avoid germs when you clean your cat’s litter box is to wear gloves when you clean the litter box. Put on rubber gloves or disposable latex gloves before you go to the litter box.Keep the gloves on while you handle any waste or soiled litter.
Throw the gloves away afterwards. If you are wearing reusable rubber gloves, wash them in scalding hot water and detergent, or a mild bleach solution.

, If you are concerned about the spread of germs, wear a mask when you clean your litter box. Wearing a mask can help protect you from inhaling any airborne germs. It may also help reduce the amount of litter dust you inhale.If your litter has a lot of dust, you may consider wearing goggles, too.
You may consider using a mask if you are immunodeficient or undergoing chemotherapy for cancer.

, If you don’t want to wear gloves, or even if you have worn gloves, you should wash your hands thoroughly after cleaning the litter box. Never skip washing your hands because that can lead to the spread of any infections or parasites.Wash your hands if you touch any dirty litter, or if you touch any feces or urine.

, If your cat has kicked any litter out of the box, sweep up the litter and dispose of it. If any waste has also been pushed out of the box, disinfect the area.You should disinfect the area around the outside of the litter box periodically. This includes the floor and the spill mat.
Disinfect with hot water and detergent or a mild bleach solution.

, The scoop you use for cleaning the litter box should be used only for that purpose. Periodically, you should clean the scoop with hot water and detergent or a mild bleach solution.You should never wash the scoop in a bathroom or kitchen sink.
Make sure to remove any feces that is left behind on the scoop.
When you are not using the scoop, consider keeping it in a plastic bag or covering the head another way. This helps prevent any germs on the scoop from spreading.

, After cleaning out your litter box, you need to dispose of the cat litter in a hygienic way. Don’t just toss it into the trash can. Instead, place it in a separate plastic bag. Then, tie the plastic bag shut to keep the contents from spreading. Place it in your trash can.Don’t flush cat litter down the toilet, even if it says it is flushable.Don’t place cat litter into your yard waste piles.Consider buying a litter disposal system to help make disposal easier and more hygienic.

Know when to change out your litter.,
Dump the litter.,
Scrape it out.,
Dispose of the litter bag.,
Clean out the box.,
Dry the box.,
Clean around the box.,
Add your liner and litter.",How to Clean Your Kitty Litter Box2," How often you change your litter depends on the type of litter you have. However, you should never leave it longer than a couple of weeks because your cat is sensitive to the smells and doesn't enjoy using a smelly litter box.Change out non-clumping litter biweekly. With non-clumping litter, you need to change it out frequently because the pee stays in it. You should change the litter completely twice a week, though you can do it more often if it starts to smell.
Change clumping litter bimonthly. Clumping litter does not need to be changed as often. That's because the litter soaks up the urine into clumps, so you can scoop it out. That means it doesn't sit in your litter box, stinking up the house and making your cat want to use the bathroom elsewhere.

, If you have a liner, you can simply just lift it into a new trash bag. Since many cats don't like liners, you may just need to tip the box into a bag. It's probably best to take it outside so you don't accidentally dump dirty litter in the house.The best way to dump litter is to slide the whole box into the bag, then turn it over so it dumps into the bag. Otherwise, you risk dumping it everywhere.
You may want to wear gloves and a respiratory mask. The gloves will protect your hands, while the mask will protect you from the powder that flies up. Cats carry toxoplasmosis, a protozoa that can pass to humans, so it's important to protect yourself. This protozoa can be especially dangerous to pregnant women., While dumping will get most of the litter out, you may need to scrape more of it into the trash. Use the scoop to scrape out the bottom of the box into the bag, until all or the majority of the litter is out of the box. Keep the box in the bag while you're scraping it out., Tie up the bag so the odors can't escape. It's best to take out the bag immediately, so it's not sitting around your house. Plus, your cats will smell it, and they may think it's a new place to use the litter box, which of course you don't want., Now, you need to thoroughly wash out the box. You can use a laundry sink or a bathtub, but you definitely don't want to use a kitchen sink because you'll be cleaning out germs from urine and feces. Outside is a better option, even if you need to use a bucket of water. Scrub the inside clean with soap and water. Make sure to use sponges or scrub brushes that are dedicated to the litter box.For soap, use dish detergent. Pick one that doesn't have a citrus scent. Cats are turned off by citrus smells.Rinse out the box thoroughly when you're done. If you used an inside sink or bathtub, make sure to scrub it clean afterwards.

, Once the box is completely clean, make sure to dry it thoroughly. If you don't dry it thoroughly, the litter could stick to the bottom of the box. Also, make sure you use an old towel or paper towels for this purpose. You don't want to use towel that your family uses for showering., When cleaning out the box, you should also tidy up the area round the box. Sweep up any litter that's on the floor. If you have a mat under the box, pick it up, and shake the litter into the trash bag you used for the box. Mop the floor with a cleaner to make sure it's thoroughly clean, and then let it dry., Once everything is clean and dry, you can set it all back up. Add your liner, if you're using one. Pour the litter on top, and set the box back in place. Don't forget to put the mat back under the litter box if you're using one.Don't put too much litter in. It may seem like a good idea to put a huge amount of litter in the box. You may think that you'll need to clean less. However, most cats aren't a fan of that much litter. You should keep the layer to less than 2 inches of litter."

Have enough litter boxes.,
Replace the boxes yearly.,
Rethink liners.,
Find the right litter.,
Skip the smelly litters.",How to Clean Your Kitty Litter Box3," Your kitty likes a clean litter box, and even if you clean it daily, you need to make sure you have enough in the house. You should have one litter box for every cat, plus one more. That ensures your cats have enough space to go to the restroom. Plus, some cats like to use one litter box for urinating and one for defecating, and having that many makes sure your cats can do that., Since most boxes are plastic, they are prone to scratches. Kitties scratch the bottom of the box when using the litter, leaving little grooves. Therefore, it's a good idea to change out your boxes at least once a year, to keep them from harboring too many germs., Liners usually come in the form of plastic bags that fit over the litter box, much like a regular bag in a trash can. They can make it more convenient for you to pull the litter out. However, many cats don't like the way they feel. Even if they do, some cats will scratch them up as they try to cover up their business. You can try them with your cat, but be aware that he or she may not take to them.If you want, you can put a layer of newspaper on the bottom to help absorb any extra urine.

, Every cat is a little different when it comes to litter preference, so you need to find the right litter for your cat. Some cats prefer finer litter. Most clumping litters are fine grain, and some clay litters are, too, which are non-clumping. However, you have several categories of litter to choose from to find the right one for your cat.Clumping litter makes it easy for you to scoop, as you can scoop out both urine and feces.
Clay litter is cheap and easy to find, and it does absorb urine and therefore, odors. It's also relatively cheap. However, you do usually need to change the whole box of litter once or twice a week.You can also find other types of non-clumping litters that are made of materials like pine, newspaper, and corn. These litters are sometimes biodegradable.
Another option is crystal litters, made from silica gel. These litters are very absorbent without as much dust as other litters.

, Cats generally don't like litters that have a scent. While they may smell good to you, they may be too strong for your cat, discouraging him or her from using the litter box. A better option is to sprinkle a little bit of baking soda under the litter to help control odors."

Install the box in a storage bench or dresser.,
Modify a cabinet.,
Place a screen in front of the litter box.,
Buy or build your own litter box disguise.,
Surround your litter box with houseplants.",How to Hide a Cat Litter Box2," Place the litter box inside a large storage bench or dresser. You can use wood, plastic, or wicker. Cut holes in both ends of the bench or dresser so your cat can easily get in and out.

The storage bench or dresser should be large enough to easily hold the litter box and give your cat enough space to move around in.

, Try placing the litter box inside a cabinet. You can cut an opening in the existing cabinet so you can still open the doors to get to the litter box. Or install a sliding ledge in the bottom of the cabinet. This will let you pull the litter box out when you need to clean it.If you'd like to give your cat the easiest access to the cabinet, consider leaving the bottom of the cabinet open. Just hang a curtain from the top of the cabinet, so it covers the litter box.

, If you'd like to hide the litter box while dividing the room into a space for your cat, set up a large screen in front of the litter box. Or if you'd like something to just hide the litter box, buy a small tri-fold screen that you can put right next to the box.Consider using a Japanese shoji screen if you want a large screen. You can find a design that will work with your space while hiding the litter box area.

, There are dozens of “kitty litter box houses” available online and in pet stores. Many of them also serve as a functional piece of furniture, such as a bench or a wash basin cabinet. Or build a simple one by making a rectangular box with an opening. You can then lower the box over the litter box and simply lift it out of the way when you change or clean the litter.

, Once you've decided where to place the litter box, surround it with large and bushy potted houseplants. These can make the area seem fresh and disguise the litter box. Just ensure that none of the plants are toxic to cats (like charming dieffenbachia, jade, lillies, coleus, and ivy).You can even buy large potted plants that have a hidden litter box in the base of the pot. There's an opening for your cat to get in and use the box.

Disinfect the litter box every few weeks.,
Scrub the litter box if it gets soiled on the sides.,
Clean the litter box frequently if the cat is sick.,
Locate the litter box on a hard, easily cleaned surface.",How to Avoid Germs when Cleaning a Litter Box2," To keep the germs and odors down, plan on disinfecting and scrubbing your litter boxes every few weeks. You should do this with a mild bleach solution.When you disinfect the litter box, remove all the cat litter. Scrub the bottom and edges of the litter box with a mild-bleach solution. To make a mild bleach solution, add ½ cup of bleach to one gallon of water.
You can also clean the litter box with hot water and detergent.Make sure to clean the area you scrubbed the litter box after you finish cleaning the litter box to decrease germs.
Never clean a litter box in the kitchen or around any place you prepare food., Sometimes, your cat may end up pushing her waste around so that it gets smeared or caked on the sides of the litter box. If you see feces or urine sticking to the edge of the litter box, scrub down the litter box.Remove all the cat litter from the box and remove the waste with a mild bleach solution.

, Since your cat can spread germs, parasites, and bacteria through her waste, you want to make sure to take special care when your cat is sick. If your cat has an infection that can be spread through waste, or has something like worms, you should clean the litter box more often.If you have other cats, you may want to clean the litter box every day or every few days until the infected cat is better. This can help reduce the risk of your other cats from getting sick.

, You should place the litter box on a floor surface that is easy to clean. This may be tile or linoleum. You want to make sure you can easily remove any mess if there are accidents or waste gets on the floor.Don’t set the litter box on carpet. Cleaning waste out of carpet is difficult, and the fibers may hold bacteria. The same is true about hardwood floors.

Avoid cleaning litter boxes if pregnant.,
Consider disposable liners or trays.,
Provide an adequate number of litter boxes.,
Place a spillover mat.,
Refrain from placing the litter box near the cat’s food.",How to Avoid Germs when Cleaning a Litter Box3," Women who are pregnant should not clean litter boxes. Cats may carry a parasite that causes a condition called toxoplasmosis, which may cause birth defects.If a pregnant woman does not have someone to change the litter box for her, she can wear rubber gloves while changing the litter box. After changing the litter box, the pregnant woman should wash her hands afterwards well., If you don’t want to worry about cleaning and disinfecting the litter box, consider using disposable liners for the litter box. These liners are removed when you change the litter. You can also get a disposable litter box that you throw away every few days.This choice may be a good idea if you are immunocompromised or undergoing chemotherapy.

, Cats like to bury their waste under dirt or litter. Because of this, cats tend to like their own litter box. A good rule is to have one more litter box than the total number of cats that you have.For example, if you have three cats, then you should have four litter boxes.


Sometimes, cats may share litter boxes. For example, if you have three cats, you may get away with two litter boxes, or be able to use three litter boxes for four cats. However, some cats may find this stressful and prefer their own box.
Watch your cats to see if the litter boxes you have provided is adequate. If your cats go to the bathroom outside the litter box, you may need another litter box. Going to the bathroom outside the litter box may also be an indication that the cat needs to go to the vet.

, To help keep germs and mess at a minimum, consider placing a spillover mat under or in front of the litter box. This can catch any litter your cat pushes out of the litter box or that gets stuck on her feet.Choose a mat that is easily cleaned. Consider plastic or another surface that you can wipe down easily with a disinfectant.

, You want to place the litter box in an area of your home separate from where you feed your cat. Cats generally don’t like it, and there is a higher chance of cross-contamination between food and the litter box, increasing the risk of spreading germs.Consider putting the food in the kitchen and putting the litter box in the bathroom or laundry room.

Move the litter box to the right location.,
Play with toys near the litter box.,
Keep the litter box clean.,
Switch to new litter gradually.,
Troubleshoot new litter boxes.,
Clean up urine and feces with an enzymatic cleaner.,
Make soiled areas less appealing.,
Place litter boxes in the problem areas.,
Use your cat's preference to your advantage.",How to Retrain a Cat to Use the Litter Box1," Cats may stop using the litter box after a scary experience in the area, such as a loud noise or harassment by another pet. They may also dislike the spot you chose after moving the litter box, or moving to a new home. Keep the litter box in a quiet, low-traffic spot where the cat can see people coming. Choose a room with at least two exits so the cat doesn't feel cornered.Keep litter boxes away from food and water bowls. Cats do not like to combine these two areas.
Signs that your cat may have had an unpleasant experience in the litter box including running quickly in and out of the litter box, or using an area near the litter box.Try moving the box to a new room if you notice this.
Keep at least one litter box on every floor of a multistory home.;
, Play with your cat in the same general area as the litter box. Leave toys (but not food) in the room so the cat spends time there and develops positive associations.You can bring the cat to the litter box to investigate on its own, but do not drop it inside or reward it with treats for using it. These tactics can backfire by making the cat uncomfortable or afraid.Unlike dogs, cats should choose the litter box on their own, especially if they used one in the past.

, If your cat perches on the edge of the box or eliminates right next to it, the box might be too dirty for it.Remove clumps and top up with fresh litter at least once a day, preferably twice. Rinse the litter box once a week with baking soda or unscented soap.If you use non-clumping litter, change the whole box every couple days to prevent odor build up, which can drive away the cat.Do not clean the litter box with scented products. Do not use a disinfectant unless it is specifically made for litter boxes, as many of them contain chemicals toxic to cats., If you bought a different kind of litter, introduce it slowly. Mix a little of it in with the old type, and gradually increase the proportion each time you change the litter box.Cats usually find it easier to adjust to unscented litter with a similar texture to their old litter.If the old type of litter is no longer available, buy two or three new types. Put them in separate litter boxes side by side and let the cat choose its favorite.
Try adjusting the depth of the litter, especially if it has a different texture than the cat is used to. Many cats prefer a shallow layer of litter, less than two inches (5 cm.) deep. Long-haired cats often like an extra-shallow layer so they can dig to the floor of the box., If your cat hasn't responded well to a recent litter box replacement, try these adjustments to make it more appealing:Some cats prefer covered boxes, and other prefer open trays. Try adding or removing the hood.
Remove plastic liners from the litter box. These can snag a cat's claws.Most cats adjust well to self-cleaning litter boxes but not all. There is a risk of an anxious cat being frightened by the motor, and refusing to use the box as a result. If in doubt it’s best to stick with a regular litter box.
If the box is smaller than the old one, you probably need to replace it with something larger. A large box with low sides works best; some people use a plastic sweater box., When the cat fails to use its litter box, clean the area with an enzymatic cleaner designed for cat urine (or a 10% solution of enzymatic washing powder in water). Rinse with cold water. This removes the smell of urine that can attract a cat to return to the same location.For best results, lightly spray the area with rubbing alcohol after the water has dried. Scrub gently and let it air dry.

, If your cat has developed a habit of going in certain locations, block its access to those areas, or find temporary ways to discourage it until it has relearned good habits:


If the cat uses a dark hiding spot, install a bright light, preferably motion-activated.Make rugs or other areas unpleasant to stand on with tin foil or double-sided tape.If the cat urinated on curtains, pin them up out of reach until the cat is back to using its litter.Cover targeted furniture with plastic sheets or shower curtains.Fill bathtubs and sinks with a shallow layer of water when not in use., One solution is to give in to your cat's preferences and add new boxes in the areas it's using as a bathroom. Clearly this isn't ideal if your cat is using the center of the living room rug, but it's worth considering if the cat is soiling an out-of-the-way corner of your house.


Another option is to move the cat's food bowl to this location. Most cats will not eliminate and eat in the same place.

, If none of these adjustments work, you may have to resort to a slower transition. For example, if your cat prefers to urinate on carpet, place a piece of similar carpet in the litter box. If the cat is willing to use that option, add a small amount of litter on top of the carpet the next day. Continue adding more litter and replacing the carpet when it gets too dirty, until the cat is transitioned to litter completely.


You may have to confine the cat to a non-carpeted area of the house for a while to get this option to work, or to roll up your carpets temporarily. Confinement can backfire if the cat is stressed or bored.
Similarly, if your cat is indoor/outdoor, or if your cat used to eliminate mostly outside, add garden soil or sand (without any fertilizer) to the box. Again, transition slowly from sand/soil to litter by adding small amounts of the new substrate to the preferred substrate a little at a time.

Watch your cat.,
Don't encourage your cat by showing her things on your computer screen.,
Do not leave your cat with unattended opportunities to find your keyboard.,
Consider creating a barricade that either stops your cat from getting onto your desk area or that stops your cat from reaching the keyboard zone.,
Make jerky arm movements while typing.,
Distract your cat.,
Create a comfort zone for your cat situated near the workspace but not anywhere near your keyboard.,
Deter her quickly.,
Use keyboard leaps as a reason to take a break.,
Consider purchasing a computer stand.",How to Get Your Cat to Stop Jumping on Your Keyboard," The initial resistance begins with paying attention to your cat's interest in your keyboard. Know that feeling when there are eyes boring in the back of your head? That's kitty watching you furtively… Be alert to her interest in the keyboard so that you can spot any readiness to spring and pounce. This provides you with the opportunity to either move the keyboard should she act quickly or to move the cat if she appears to be hovering by too closely. You could also use this opportunity to adopt your authoritative tone of voice to tell her: ""No! You are not going to sit on my keyboard.""


Commands to stop doing something are something that you should get your cat used to early on. Use a soft but firm voice that means business, using such words as ""No!"" and ""Get down"" whenever the cat does something you don't want her to be doing. With the right tone of voice, she'll know very well that she is not permitted to persist.
In some cases, simply repeatedly removing the cat from your desk gently may work after a few rounds. She'll get the message that every single time you will put her straight down on the ground again.;
, As tempting as it may be to show kitty the latest cat video you think is just hilarious or to find interesting pictures of swimming fish to entice her with, don't do it unless you want her to think it's okay to hang around your workspace. She will assume that it's okay to be there if you allow her to do this., When you leave your computer terminal, for whatever reason and length of time, put the keyboard out of reach. Should your cat's curiosity cause her to investigate, you won't have her padding across the keys and leaving gibberish for your email buddies. Wireless keyboards can be placed well away from the computer, while attached keyboards can be hung on the monitor, pushed to one side, pushed under if on a tray contraption or hidden underneath something. If you can lock your keyboard, this is another alternative, so that any pressure placed on the keys does not result in text being typed into any program.


Train yourself to put the keyboard away regularly so that it becomes a habit each time you move away from the desk.
Programs exist that recognize cat paws on the keyboard. Paw-typing recognition software will put the cat's work into a window of its own and can even be programmed to make annoying noises to scare off your curious feline pal., The utility or feasibility of doing this depends totally on the type of workspace you have and your work style––some people have such cramped desk space already that any sort of barricade would leave no room for the keyboard itself. The purpose of a barricade is to present a hurdle that the cat considers not worth the challenge. Alternatively, a barrier may be used to prevent the cat from seeing the keyboard and your finger movements, thereby removing the stimulus for investigation. A kitty barricade could be made in one of the following ways:


Make piles of books either side of your keyboard area. This can work well if you have a lot of desk space. However, if your space is small, there is a risk that doing this will leave you feeling like you're inside a fort, with nowhere to lay down the books or papers you actually need to work off. Nevertheless, for short stints, the book barricade might solve a problem long enough to deflect your cat's continued interest.
Try making a barricade from cereal boxes that encircle your computer and keyboard zone. These could be used either as walls when ripped apart or as bricks if heavy items like books are slipped inside the boxes. If your cat decides to rush the flimsy wall version, be aware that she'll quickly discover it's easy to knock over and won't hesitate to keep going.
Place duct tape, sticky side up, around your workspace area, either attached outwards on the barriers you've created or even laid flat on the desk. Cats don't like getting sticky paw pads (you won't either if your skin gets stuck to the duct tape), so it'll put her off trying to get any nearer. Naturally, this method can get quite messy as all your pens, pencils, papers and even you get caught by the sticky tape too!
Shut the door to your room and keep your cat out. Obviously, this depends on where your computer is located––if it's an open space, you won't be able to do this but if you have a discrete study and there's a door that can be closed, consider the ultimate barrier of shutting her on the other side.

, This could be a quirky form of exercise for you if you're glued to the keyboard but it might also work to deter the cat. As you type, move your elbows up and down whenever the cat threatens to come near. The constant movement of your arms might make her feel uncomfortable and cause her to hop down and do something else for a while. On the other hand, a patient cat might just wait it out until your arms tire (which won't be long if you've got to get on with typing).

, The time-honored tradition of distraction is probably one of your best offensive tactics when it comes to deterring your cat from the keyboard. Keep a basket of cat toys near the desk for her to play with. You could even set up her kitty condo or play area near your computer so that she's near you and you can keep an eye on her as she plays.


Rotate toys for added interest. Keep her interest by only putting out one or two toys at a time or tie a string to your office door handle to provide her with the opportunity to bat it around.
Consider adding a toy with catnip depending on how she typically reacts. Some cats get extremely excited during initial interaction but then tire out quickly. If you can get your cat revved up and then sleepy, you may be able to keep her away from your keyboard at least for the short term.
Get a laser pointer. Every time your cat threatens to jump up on your workspace, grab it and start playing laser tag across the floor, to lead her away from your work area and into the ecstasy of play.
Feed her. Get up and go to her food bowl and sprinkle some treats or other food into it. It might be enough to make her forget what she was doing before and she may even like to sleep after.

, Very often your cat just wants to be near you while you work or play on the computer––indeed, the longer you're stuck there, the more she wants your attention and will be likely to put herself right in your face to get it. By placing a bed or comfy sleep spot near you as you work or play on the computer, she may be satisfied enough that she can see you (and get the occasional stroke) to avoid feeling the need to attack your keyboard.


The comfort zone may not work with a kitten. Kittens think that everything is an invitation to play and that sleep just gets in the way. All the same, the earlier you can train your kitten to like sleeping near your workspace rather than pawing all over it, the better.
For really active cats that don't get the message, getting locked inside the cat carrier/crate, facing you, can work for a time. How successful this will be depends on how much meowing results from locking her away. Be sure that she can see you and seems comfortable, otherwise don't persist with this method.

, If your cat insists on continuously jumping up onto the keyboard and walking all over it, it might be time for some water or noise deterrents. She won't like this, but that's the whole point. Here are some solutions:


Fill a squirting water bottle with water. Keep it on your desk within reach. Whenever your cat shows signs of wanting to come too close, give her a quick squirt to deter her. A few experiences of this and she won't see your keyboard zone as worth the effort anymore. Obviously, don't be so eager that you spray the keyboard and computer too––that could be an expensive mistake.
Fill a jar or can with coins to make a noisy rattle. An empty beer or soda can works well for this purpose. Seal the top with duct tape or screw on the lid if the container has one and shake away whenever the cat tries to get near the keyboard. As with the water squirt, it won't be long before your cat is habituated to staying away.

, If you're the kind of person who falls into your computer and forgets how much time is passing, your cat's keyboard antics might well be a blessing in disguise. Perhaps she is letting you know that you've done enough for now and it's time to play. Heed her message and go and play for a bit––you need the break and she deserves the attention.

, When the computer is at an angle, your cat won't be able to sit on it. This trick works instantly and involves no negative reinforcement. In addition, it is ergonomic and helps to cool your computer.

This is what your stained carpet might look like under normal lighting.,
Clean the stains as you check.",How to Find Cat Urine With a UV Light," Look for a long bulb (preferably longer than 12 inches) so you can cover more ground at once. Cheap bulbs with the housing included can be found at most hardware stores. Although pet stores sell the lights as well, they're usually smaller and more expensive. They can also be purchased at a reasonable cost online, depending on how much time you have to wait around living with the odor.;
, Cat urine can be difficult to see, especially when old, so maximize your search efforts by taking advantage of darkness. Either wait for night, or make the room as dark as possible.

, The cat urine that you're looking for should show up as a yellow/greenish color. You may be surprised to find a stain farther away than you thought. Don't just check the floor; cats are inventive! Try the following areas:


Bookshelves
Furniture
Cloth decorations
Inside vents
Objects that appear to have ""holes,"" such as inside portable heaters
Clothing that your cat may be able to access
Other small areas your cat could squeeze into
Anywhere else you can think of - if you can see it, it could be your source.

,
Fresher urine stains will show up like this under the blacklight.
Older urine stains will be fainter under the blacklight.

, If you can, clean the spots when you find them. If you prefer, you can mark the spots using tape, item placement, etc., and clean once you've found them all.

Work out where the electrical hazards in your home are.,
Keep the gaps between any cord protection and the termination points as small as possible.,
Unplug unnecessary appliances and put them away in a safe, cat-free space until needed.",How to Keep Cats from Chewing on Electric Cords and Chargers1," Every electrical item at cat level is a potential hazard, as are items the cat can reach and jump to. Be especially careful of cords from appliances, cords from computing and printing equipment, cords used temporarily for such things as Christmas tree lights, cords in places you can't reach but your cat can (for example, behind heavy items such as fridges, freezers, heaters, and televisions), and all electrical outlets., The most vulnerable parts of the cord are where the wire joins the plug or appliance. These sections are not easily protected by cord protection kits. Check them regularly.If the gap between an appliance like a fridge or is wide enough for a cat to slip down or into, then you need to take precautions to guard the relevant electrical cord and outlet.

, When needed, do not leave them unattended, or confine their use to safe, cat-free spaces. There is no point leaving unused appliances out gathering and taking up space when they could be neatly tucked away, unchewed and dust-free."

Spay or neuter your cat.,
Reduce stress in your cat.,
Respond to vertical spraying.,
Replace small boxes as a kitten grows.,
Clip away matted fur in long-haired cats.,
Minimize damage when the owner is away.,
Improve behavior in multi-pet households.,
Separate animals if bad behavior continues.",How to Retrain a Cat to Use the Litter Box2," This is not a requirement for litter training, but it does make urination outside the litter box much less likely. Unneutered males are especially likely to spray urine when they're stressed, not getting along with another male, or demonstrating their availability to a female cat.The sooner this happens, the more likely the behavior will stop. If it goes on too long, the habit can persist even after surgery., Just like humans, cats may experience stress from changes in their environment or schedule. Your cat may stop using the litterbox after a person or other animal leaves the household, or when a new one moves in. Some cats even respond badly to redecoration. Here are a few ways to help:


Provide private places where the cat can be on its own, including hiding spots and high perches.
If your cat is allowed outside, let it come and go whenever it likes.Let your cat initiate contact, and be calm and consistent in your response. Some cats are stressed because they aren't getting enough playtime, while others dislike being pet or picked up whenever the owner feels like it.
If the cat's behavior continues, consult a veterinarian or animal behaviorist.

, If your cat backs up against a vertical surface, wiggles its tail, and releases a spray of urine, your cat is spraying. If you don't see it in action, look for roundish areas of strong-smelling urine a little higher up than the height of your cat's rear end, with streak marks running down to the baseboard or floor. Any cat can perform this territorial behavior, but it is most common in unneutered, male cats. Here's how to respond if your cat is spraying:


Spraying is often a response to stress or the presence of other cats.Follow the advice above to address this.
Spraying can be a response to a new neighborhood cat, especially if the spray is focused on a door, window, or air vent. Try to keep the cat out of your yard, or close the blinds so your cat can't see it.
About 30% of cats that vets examine for spraying have a medical condition.It's a good idea to have your cat examined, especially if you cannot find a solution.

, If you adopted your cat as a kitten, it may need a larger litter box once it grows up. The cat should be able to turn around comfortably, and still be able to find a clean spot if you miss a cleanup.Cats dislike change, and may take a while to adapt to the new box. Follow the instructions above if problems continue.

, Some long-haired cats dirty the fur around their rear when they eliminate. This can cause painful or unpleasant experiences that the cat learns to associate with the litter box. If you notice this happening, carefully clip away matted fur from the area., Some cats react poorly when their owner is away. They may try to urinate somewhere with a strong scent of the owner, usually the bed. Instruct the pet sitter to keep the bedroom door shut, and provide extra litter boxes so the cat can always reach one without walking by the pet sitter.If possible, hire a pet sitter the cat already knows, or at least introduce them before you leave.

, Urine marking is a common reaction to conflict with another cat or dog, which can happen even if the animals got along in the past. For best results, make sure each animal can access resources without approaching the other:Keep one litter box for each animal, plus one extra. Put each one in a separate location with at least two exit routes if possible.
Give each animal its own bed and food bowl. Keep these resources away from litter boxes and from each other.
Provide plenty of perches and hiding spaces for each cat.

, If your cat still won't use the litter box, or still acts aggressive to the other animal, try a stricter method of separation. This is often necessary when bringing a new cat into the household:Separate the cats into rooms with a closed door in between, so they can smell but not see each other. Expose them to each other's scents by feeding them on the two sides of the same door, or by switching their rooms daily.
After a few days, crack open the door. If they do not react badly, let them approach each other.
If they act aggressive, use leashes to keep them in the same room safely for short sessions. Let them play or eat during these sessions, and gradually bring them closer to each other each time.
Once the cats are calm, try rubbing a little tuna juice on their heads. This encourages relaxation through grooming, potentially even with each other.

Assess whether your cat is having a hard time urinating.,
Evaluate whether your cat is having fecal issues.,
Improve physical access to the box.,
Talk to your veterinarian to rule out other medical problems.",How to Retrain a Cat to Use the Litter Box3," If you see your cat straining while trying to urinate, or spending a long time trying with no result, take your cat to the vet immediately. Male cats in particular can develop urinary conditions where the urethra (the tube from the bladder to the penis) narrows or gets blocked. Typically small amounts of urine can pass until the cat is completely blocked and cannot urinate at all. This is a life threatening situation and needs immediate medical care. Blockages can also occur in the intestinal tract.


Some cats with a urinary infection or blockage spend a lot of time trying to urinate, licking their genitals, or crying at their owner., Fecal constipation does occur in cats and can lead to chronic issues requiring special diets and laxatives. Diarrhea is not uncommon either, including chronic diarrhea related to inflammatory bowel disease. Any of these conditions are uncomfortable for the cat and may cause the cat to be afraid of the litter box or unable to get to the litter box in time to avoid an accident.


Many cats with inflammatory bowel disease only have occasional symptoms for no obvious reason. Appetite changes, lethargy, vomiting, or increased hairball production can be signs of intestinal discomfort., If your cat is older or has an injury, it may not be able to get into the litter box as comfortably as it once could. Does your cat limp, need help jumping up to a chair or bed, have episodes of shaking legs, or seem painful around its spine or tail? If so, take the cat to the vet immediately! You may be able to make the cat more comfortable by getting a litter box with lower sides, or with a ""doorway"" cut into the side. You may need to consider a larger box so that the cat can turn around easily once inside.


An overweight cat may not fit comfortably in the box any longer. Get a larger box and place the cat on a diet. Consult with your veterinarian about safe weight loss strategies for your cat.

, Urinating outside of the litter box often results from a feline medical issue, including urinary tract infections, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, hyperthyroidism, bladder inflammation with or without urinary crystals, and intestinal issues (IBD). When in doubt, have a veterinarian conduct a medical checkup.


Observe your cat so you are prepared to answer your veterinarian's questions. Possible questions include: Does the cat urinate right by the litter box or further away? How large is the spot of urine? Does the cat ever try to urinate in the litter box? Does the cat vocalize when urinating? Is there an increase in water consumption? Can you tell if the urine is almost clear, normal color, or dark? How frequently is the cat urinating?
Even if there is no medical cause, your vet could prescribe anti-anxiety drugs to prevent spraying. This is not a guaranteed or risk-free solution, so talk to your vet about the pros and cons."

Rearrange your furniture to provide protection for hanging cords or cords that tend to move.,
Put small appliances or chargers in boxes or drawers.,
Tape all dangling cords down so that they don't dangle.,
Buy cord management covers.",How to Keep Cats from Chewing on Electric Cords and Chargers2," Block the base and/or back of tables or book cases that have a gap between the floor and the bottom of the unit or the wall and the back of the unit. Remember that cats can slink into openings smaller than your fist, depending on the cat's size. Your cat can also move objects that aren't firmly fastened or are heavy. Hide as much of the cord from your cat as possible. Tidy up unnecessary corded appliances and put them away in a safe, cat-free location.Consider using wireless technology wherever possible, confining the cords to the transmitters to protected or cat-free areas.

, If you can create a charging station in a drawer, the cat will be unable to get at many of the smallest and most attractive cords. Putting items with cords in boxes (with a hole cut out the back) can also disguise their true function and make it less likely that a cat will pounce., It's the dangling that often attracts the cat; once taped firmly to a table leg or wall, the cord blends in and ceases to provide the same attraction. You can also purchase velcro attachments or special cord clips to keep cords attached flatly to another item., These are available at a hardware store in a variety of formats and colors. Some attach to the wall or furniture, while other just bundle the cords together. Regardless of the kind you choose, they are a plastic cover for your cords that a cat cannot bite through."
"
Make the cord distasteful.,
Cover cords with something solid that deters chewing.,
Disguise cords with tape.",How to Keep Cats from Chewing on Electric Cords and Chargers3," Spray or wipe down cords with something distasteful to the cat. There are commercial product solutions and homemade solutions. If making your own, consider using such things as hot sauce; lavender oil; a homemade citrus or vinegar paste; garlic, cayenne pepper, Vicks, dish soap, lime juice,or chili oil or paste. Some people use a light coating of sports ointments (the really strong menthol sort) or deodorant . Be sure to let the applied substance dry completely before re-plugging the cord into the wall and you'll need to reapply homemade fixes periodically. Avoid using anything salty because cats love licking salt., Commercial products include ""Chewsafe™"" and ""CritterCord™"", which are clear, flexible protective cord covers infused with a citrus-scent to keep the cat away from the cord. These are easy to add and don't require topical re-applications., Both foil and double-sided tape can work. These can be purchased from the hardware store and are easy to wrap around the cords. With the foil tape, cats dislike the alkaline taste in their mouth and will refrain from chewing anything coated in the tape. With double-sided tape, cats hate anything sticky and won't touch it. The problem with this method is that it is sticky, and therefore tricky, and will also collect a lot of fluff for you."

Another is to keep a water-gun handy for squirting your cat when it gets too close to places you don't want it going. Obviously, be careful not to hit electrical or electronic equipment with the water., If you can find a motion-detector toy that makes a noise as soon as it spots motion (for example, a frog that croaks), consider placing it strategically to go off every time the cat gets near certain vulnerable cords, such as under the computer desk. It will need to be loud and sudden enough to scare off your cat, and there is a chance that he'll just get used to it and ignore it., Cord chewing can be a sign of boredom, a sign of practicing prey hunting, or just a need to play. Try new items at home to keep your cat interested -- a carpet square, cardboard boxes to shred, or even a rubbery dog chew toy., Purchase or grow some cat grass grown from oats or wheat. Many cats feel the need to chew on grass, and without grass, the next closest thing is string and wires. Cat grass is available in pet stores and on the internet, and you can buy seeds of oats and wheat and grow them yourself in a pot with a little soil. You can even dig up a little sod from a yard that is not treated with pesticides or herbicides. Look to make certain the sod only contains grass leaves, no weeds. Place the clump of sod in the pot on the floor and let the cat chew on it. Release the sod to its original place when the cat is done chewing on it. Repeat frequently, as needed., When cats chew cords, they're often looking to create small toys for themselves. Short wires skitter across linoleum and hardwood floors quite marvelously when batted by a furry paw. You might try distracting your cat with a different sort of toy. Just be sure to avoid any toys that encourage wire-chewing behavior (such as toys which are wire-like using string, yarn, etc.)., There are some activities where cord movement is inevitable and it is probably best to keep your cat locked out of the room or space where you're using such appliances rather than risk chewing and the potential for electrical shock to both you and your cat, as well as the potential for a heavy item falling on your cat if the cord is pulled down too much.

Discourage your cat from running outside.",How to Change an Outdoor Cat Into an Indoor Cat," Your cat will always want to scratch on things, and if it doesn’t know how to use a scratching post, it will use your furniture instead. Before bringing your cat inside, place a scratching post in a dry spot, near your cat’s food. Give your cat at least a week to become accustomed to using a scratching post before bringing it inside., Before bringing your cat indoors, place a little box outside in a dry location. Fill the litter box with fine-grain, clumping litter. Give your cat approximately a week to get accustomed to the litter box before bringing it inside.Make sure to clean the litter box every day. Outdoor cats tend to like to use clean areas to eliminate waste. If the litter box is not clean, they are likely not to use it.
Put the litter box in a safe and quiet area. Otherwise, the cat might be too scared or hesitant to use it.

, Before bringing your cat indoors, you should be sure that it won’t be bringing disease with it. If your cat hasn’t already been microchipped, a process that allows it to be identified, your veterinarian should perform this procedure as well. A wild cat will also need to be vaccinated and neutered.Before the cat is spayed or neutered, the vet should perform a test for Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV). FeLV is highly infectious between cats and can be deadly if untreated. The vet will do two blood tests to see if your cat has this disease.The vet should do a complete check-up of the cat. This includes checking for ear mites, fleas, lice, and other parasites. The cat should also be dewormed.

, Your cat isn’t likely to adapt immediately to living indoors. To prevent it from doing damage to your house, you should let it outside periodically, until it seems to be comfortable inside.Begin by allowing your cat indoors for brief periods of time. Then keep it inside for progressively longer each time.

, While you might still allow your cat outside periodically, you should only give it food and water inside. This way, it will come to associate food with being inside. This will create positive associations with your home., Place one litter box in a place that is convenient for you. Place the other near the door your cat takes to exit the house. This way, when your cat wants to go outdoors to use the restroom, it will see the litter box and use it instead. As your cat gets accustomed to the litter box, move the one near the door closer to the interior litter box. When the two litter boxes are next to each other, you can remove one.


Use litter boxes that are large, but not very high. To encourage your cat to use the litter box, you should remove all obstacles. Thus, you should avoid boxes with tops or boxes that require your cat to jump up high to get inside of. The cat should feel secure when using the litter box. Place the litter box in a quiet area of the house where other animals and humans won't bother it too much.

, Don’t allow your cat to decide for itself when it leaves your home. If you have a screened-in porch, you can allow your cat onto it periodically. You can also purchase a harness designed for cats and take your cat outside on walk. Some cats are resistant to walking on a leash but if you can leash train your cat you will both find it to be a rewarding experience. , Your cat will feel less of a need to break out to hunt, if it has plenty of opportunities to express its hunter’s instincts inside. You should have several balls, fake mice, and other toys for your cat to play with. Most importantly, you should play with your cat to give it something exciting to do in your home.If you roll a ball along the floor, your cat might chase it and swat at it.
Try getting a toy mouse attached to a stick. Drag the mouse on the floor or dangle it over your cat’s head. Your cat should try to attack it.
Cats also like feather toys. These are often feathers that are attached to the end of a string or a stick. Drag them on the ground or dangle them in the air.
Try rotating new toys into the home every couple of weeks to keep your cat interested.

, Many cats enjoy the smell of this herb. Buy some and place it in strategic spots where your cat likes to spend time or where you would like it to spend time. Placing it on a scratching post, for example, can encourage it to begin sharpening its nails on the post, instead of your furniture., Cats enjoy looking down on humans and jumping to high lookout spots. At the pet store, you can buy “cat trees” with multiple platforms for your cat to jump on and climb around.Cat trees can be expensive. Alternatively, you can clear off some shelves or arrange your desks and bookshelves so that your cat has nice perches to jump to.

, A warm, comfy cat bed can be a great way to entice a cat indoors during cold and rainy months. If you don’t want to buy a special cat bed, try to arrange some blankets on your bed or couch in an inviting way. If your cat finds a spot that it seems to like, set the space aside for it., Cats love to sit in the sun and providing an indoor sunning spot will decrease the incentive for your cat to run outside. If you don’t have a windowsill that is an appropriate sunning spot, place a table next to the window for your cat to lay on. Leave your blinds up near the bed, so your cat can catch some sun on a warm bed.


If you open the window, be sure that the screen is secure so that your cat can’t bust out., Pet stores and even some grocery stores sell cat grass that can grow inside. The grass is a nice snack for your cat and will remind it of being outside., If your cat is scratching or refusing to use the litter box, put it in a small room with all its toys, scratching posts, and litter boxes. There will be less furniture for your cat to damage here and your cat is more likely to learn to use the litter box if it is confined to a small space with it., SoftPaws are pieces of plastic that can be glued onto a cat’s claws to prevent it from scratching. To place the soft paws on the cat, one person will need to hold the cat. Another person will clip the cat’s nails and then glue the SoftPaws on.


Squeeze the cat’s paws gently to encourage it to show its claws. Then use a clipper to trim the claws. If you do not have experience trimming a cat’s claws, cut only the end, to avoid cutting too deep and hurting it.
Squeeze the glue that comes with the SoftPaws into the SoftPaws. Then place the SoftPaws on your cat’s claws and push until the plastic covers the entire claw.
Cats can have their claws permanently removed, but declawing is generally considered inhumane and should be avoided if possible.

, Even if your cat still periodically leaves your home, you should be in control of it when it leaves. Watch the door closely to ensure that it does not sneak out. If it does, do not hit it, because that will make it less likely to want to stay inside. Use moderate reinforcement to encourage it to behave better.


If your cat tries to make a run to the door squirt it with a water bottle or rattle a jar of coins.
Throw a treat or a toy in the opposite direction when you open the door. This will encourage your cat to run away from the open door and break it of the habit of running away."

Go for traditional clay-based litter.,
Look into plant-based or recycled litters.,
Try silica crystal litter if you live in a small space.,
Pay attention to how your cat responds to different materials.,
Choose a lightweight litter.,
Look for multi-cat variations of common litters.",How to Choose a Kitty Litter1," Traditionally, cat litter is clay-based. Clay is one of the most popular brands of litter on the market and is a simple choice that works for most cats. It absorbs water quickly, making cleaning out urine easy, and is easy to find at most grocery stores. It may make sense to start with a clay-based and see how your cat takes to it.The one downside to clay-based litters it that they can be dusty. If your cat is prone to sneezing or coughing, or has an underlying condition like asthma, stay away from clay-based litters.;
, If you're environmentally conscious, or if your cat does not take to clay-based litter, look for more natural options. Many litters are made from plant-based or recycled materials. Try something like wood pellets, wheat, corncobs, or litter made from recycled materials.The major advantage of these litters is they're more environmentally stable and some cats may respond better to natural litters. If ingested, these litters may be safer than other brands.
However, natural litters tend to be more expensive. If you're on a budget, it may be difficult to keep up with natural litters.

, Silica crystal litters are litters made of synthetic materials. They're good at soaking up urine and dehydrating feces so it's easier to clean. Silica crystal litters make most sense if you're living in a smaller space as they absorb odor very easily.The one downside to silica crystal litters is that many cats dislike the texture. If your cat starts eliminating outside the litter box after you get a silica crystal litter, opt for a different litter type.
Silica crystal litter is also more expensive and non-flushable. If you want a flushable litter, check the label to see if a litter is flushable. In general, natural cat litters tend to be flushable. Plant-based litters made from natural materials like corn and wood are more likely to be flushable than synthetic litters., Trial and error may be necessary to pick a litter that works for your cat. Cats have preferences about their litter and may dislike the texture or feel of a particular brand of litter. If your cat stops using their litter box after you purchase a litter, try a different brand. With some experimentation and patience, you should be able to find a litter your cat will use., A lightweight litter may produce less dust. It can also be easier to carry back from the grocery store if you have a long walk. Some litters are specifically labeled as ""lightweight"", but some materials are naturally light weight. Corn and grass-based litters tend to be naturally lighter weight than other varieties.Grass-based litters are particularly good at absorbing odor, in addition to being lightweight. They can work great in small places where smell may become a problem.

, Most common litters have special blends made for multi-cat households. If you have multiple cats living in the same house, opt for multi-cat litter. These often help better suppress odor. If your cats are having litter box issues due to sharing a litter box, opt for a multi-cat variety of your chosen litter.

Look for an odor-absorbing litter.,
Decide between clumping and non-clumping litters.,
Avoid scented litters.",How to Choose a Kitty Litter2," Whichever material you choose, look for a litter that's odor-absorbing. This will prevent the smell of a litter box from seeping into your home. If a litter is odor-absorbing, it should say somewhere on the label., The question of clumping and non-clumping litter depends on your personal preference and which litters your cats take to. Clumping litter can make cleanup easier, as it absorbs urine. With clumping litter, you can scoop out the litter box rather than replacing all the litter each time you clean it. However, the major downside of clumping litter is that some cats simply do not like it. If you notice clumping litter gets caught in your cat's paws, switch to a different brand.You may notice litter on your cat's paws after the use clumping litter. You may also see a lot of litter scattered throughout your home after trying clumping litter.

, Odor-absorbing litters are fine, as they keep odor away. However, scented litters are not recommended. They can cause irritation for cats and many cats are repelled by the smell of scented litter. A cat is more likely to eliminate outside the box if you use scented litter.If the smell of your cat's litter box is very strong, try putting up air fresheners near the box instead of using clumping litter.

Try to find dust-free litters.,
Watch for signs of an adverse reaction.,
Contact your vet if your cat swallows litter.",How to Choose a Kitty Litter3," Dust-free litters are generally safer and more comfortable for your cat. Dust can cause respiratory problems in cats like sneezing and coughing. When possible, opt for a dust-free litter., Cats may occasionally react poorly to a particular type of litter. If you notice reactions like sneezing, coughing or general irritation, switch litter brands. Commercial litters are usually safe for the majority of cats. However, there is always a slim chance your cat may have an allergic reaction to a litter., Cats may sometimes eat or swallow litter. If you notice a substantial amount of litter is gone from the box, your cat may have eaten its litter. Contact your vet right away and make an appointment for evaluation. If treatment is necessary, your vet will make a recommendation.Some cats develop a syndrome called pica, in which they eat non-edible items.

Look for a long growing cycle.",How to Identify a Maine Coon1," Maine Coons have a long, shaggy coat. The fur is not thick, but it is plentiful. Its paws, tails, and ears are covered in fluffy tufts of fur.The fur on the cat’s back should be shorter toward the front of the cat and longer toward its rear. Fur on the cat’s sides, likewise, should gradually get longer from front to back.The brown tabby pattern is the most common color pattern for Maine Coons.However, Maine Coons are available in 75 different color combinations.;
, Maine Coons are the largest of all cat breeds. They have a sturdy and rugged look about them. Some people have even likened them to small bobcats. If you have a cat that seems unusually large, it might be a Maine Coon.Male Maine Coons tend to weight 15-25 pounds. Females tend to weigh 10-15 pounds. If your cat falls within these weight ranges, you just might have a Maine Coon.
Males are usually 10-16 inches (25-41 centimeters) tall and 40 inches (101 centimeters) long. Females tend to be 8-14 inches tall and around 40 inches (101 centimeters) long. Use a yardstick or tape measure to obtain your cat’s length and height.

, Maine Coons have a coat that has been variously described as silky or oily.The fur should be fine. Their bodies are firm and muscular.Maine Coons tend to be oily to keep their fur from getting too wet in the snow.

, Maine Coons have muscular legs that are medium in length. The legs should be proportional to the body. Maine Coons have tails that are wide at the base, then narrow gradually. The tail should have long, flowing fur. Finally, look for tapered ears. The two ears of the Maine Coon are wide at the base and taper to a point. They will be positioned relatively close together, with no more than one ear’s width between them.The ears will have tufts of fur growing inside them.
The cat will wrap its tail around itself to stay warm in cold weather.

, The Maine Coon’s eyes are slightly oblique (slanted), not perfectly round. They are typically green or gold, though they might be blue, too., Most cats reach their full size when they are nine to 12 months old. Maine Coons, however tend to grow for at least two years. Some have been known to grow for four years. If you’ve a cat that just seems to keep growing, it might be a Maine Coon."

Look for a friendly demeanor.,
Check for a love of water.,
Look for “dog-like” behaviors.,
Get a genetic test.,
Monitor the cat’s health.",How to Identify a Maine Coon2," Maine Coons are well-known for their friendly, relaxed personalities. They get on well with children and other pets. If this sounds like your cat, you might have a Maine Coon., Maine Coons enjoy splashing and spilling water. They’re even known to splash about in toilets. If your cat seems to have a special fascination with water, it’s possible the cat is a Maine Coon., Most people know that dogs are generally extroverted and faithful. Maine Coons, likewise, are renowned for their reliable and outgoing behavior. If your cat greets you in the morning and when you arrive at home, it might be a Maine Coon., Another way to identify a Maine Coon is to get a genetic test. This involves a vet or other medical professional taking a DNA sample from your cat. Typically, this is done by swabbing the inside of your cat’s cheek for skin cells or clipping a bit of its fur. The vet will then use this biological sample to compare your cat’s genome against known Maine Coon DNA and look for a match.Genetic tests are about 90% accurate.

, Maine Coons typically have good health. However, they are susceptible to two conditions. One is HCM, a condition that causes the walls of the heart to thicken. The other condition is feline hip dysplasia. This condition causes the hip to buckle under the Maine Coon’s own weight, causing pain and arthritis.The breeder you obtain your Maine Coon from should screen for HCM before you purchase it.
Because Maine Coons are naturally large, there is little you can do to prevent hip dysplasia. Your vet will help you treat your cat should it develop this condition.

Decide if a cat is right for you.,
Choose a reputable breeder.,
Consider alternatives.,
Visit the cat before you buy it.,
Be patient.",How to Identify a Maine Coon3," Like all cats, Maine Coons are an investment of both time and money. They can cost anywhere from $400 to $1,000, and they also require ongoing costs like cat food, cat litter, and vet visits. Plus, since Maine Coons are relatively outgoing, they require some attention and affection every day. If you are a busy person, consider a pet that requires less energy.If you want a less energetic Maine Coon, think about getting a full-grown cat instead of a kitten.

, Reputable breeders will not have Maine Coons (or any other breed) available year-round. They will also not accept purchases online or have multiple litters on their premises. Instead, they’ll insist on a strict contract that describes what happens in case you can no longer take care of the cat, and provide as much information as possible about the cat’s pedigree and health.Contact the Maine Coon Breeders and Fanciers Association for a list of reputable breeders in your area.

, Buying your Maine Coon from a breeder is the most common way to get one. But you could also get your Maine Coon from a rescue organization like Maine Coon Adoptions or Maine Coon Rescue. Contact one of these organizations or a similar group about getting a Maine Coon., Reputable breeders or cat sellers will welcome you to visit the cat in the location where the cat was raised. The cat should be raised indoors. Be wary of breeders who try to meet you in a location that is not the place where the Maine Coon was raised (typically the breeder’s home).If you see that the Maine Coon was raised in a small, dirty, or crowded pen, choose another breeder. These conditions suggest that the cat might have fleas or illnesses.
Likewise, do not obtain a cat that was raised in isolation, as it may have difficulty socializing with other pets or people when introduced to your home.

, Maine Coons will probably not be available right away. Cats raised properly need to be about 12 to 16 weeks old before they can be separated from their mothers. Additionally, many breeders have wait lists that prevent quick and easy purchase of a Maine Coon."

Distinguish Japanese Bobtail from other short-tailed cats.",How to Identify a Japanese Bobtail1," The most recognizable characteristic of Japanese Bobtails are their tails. Their tails are very short, and are kinked and curved. For this reason, their tails often look as though they have been docked, but this “bobbed” appearance is entirely natural.Their tails can either by flexible or rigid. They rarely extend more than three inches from the cat’s body.
Japanese Bobtails' tails are covered in tufts of hair. This makes their tails look more like rabbit tails or pom-poms than most other cats' tails.;

You may think your cat’s litter tray is in the perfect location, but your cat may think otherwise. If you placed it somewhere far away or unpleasant, like behind a noisy appliance or way down in the basement where she your cat can’t easily access it, she will avoid it. She’ll also stay away if the litter tray is in a high-traffic area where she won’t have adequate privacy.


Move the litter tray to where she is currently eliminating, since that location is clearly her preference. After about a month, move the box—literally inch by inch—to an area that’s more appropriate.Your cat may not be using the litter tray because it’s close to her food and water—she does not want to eliminate where she eats and drinks. Move the litter tray as far away from the food and water bowls as possible.Ideally, the location for her litter tray should be in a private, low-traffic area that is easily accessible to her (but not children or other pets). If she hears someone coming, she should be able to exit the area quickly.If your cat has mobility issues, or is incontinent, move the litter tray closer to an area where she frequents.;
, This is especially important if you have an old, arthritic, or injured cat who has mobility issues. Find a litter tray that has low sides.If purchasing a new litter tray is not practical for you, you could try cutting the sides of the litter tray you have to make the entrance lower for your cat.


Covered litter trays, while adding privacy, can be challenging for a cat with limited mobility to use.
If you have a small cat, you may need to purchase a smaller litter tray. Similarly, a larger cat will need a roomier litter tray.

, If you have a multi-cat household, an insufficient number of litter trays could cause one cat to get bullied away from the available trays. Now you have two problems: inappropriate elimination and stress. To address these problems, have one tray per cat, plus one extra.Each litter tray should be placed in a different location, ideally in a different room.
To help the bullied cat feel less stressed, place her tray in the area where she spends most of her time.Consider putting litter trays on each level of your home, if applicable.

, Although humans might like deodorized litter with the sweet smell of lavender, your cat's sensitive sense of smell might have her thinking the complete opposite. Any litter with a strong scent has the potential to put off a cat from using it. If you are currently putting scented litter in her litter tray, switch to an unscented litter.The type of substrate is also important. Some cats prefer grass or dirt, similar to what they would use outdoors. Other cats may prefer smooth or soft surfaces, like bedding or carpeting.Some cats prefer non-clumping litter, since clumping litter can get caught between their paws and claws.
Consider leaving out multiple litter trays, each with a different litter type, so your cat can choose which one she prefers.If you switch litters, due so slowly. Any change can cause your cat to feel stress, which itself can cause litter tray issues.Whichever litter type you choose, put only 1 to 2 inches of litter into the tray.Any more than that, and your cat could have trouble maneuvering within the litter to eliminate.

, Your cat may be avoiding her litter tray because the litter is too dirty. In fact, she may be eliminating somewhere else because that location is cleaner than her litter tray.If this is the case, establish a more frequent cleaning schedule for her litter tray.


Scoop out and change the litter on a daily basis, and give the entire tray a thorough cleaning with baking soda and unscented soap once a week.Daily litter scoops and changes are especially important if you are using clumping litter.
Self-cleaning litter trays are also available.Litter tray liners help keep litter trays clean, but not all cats like them.You may want to wear a mask so you don’t breathe in the dust from the litter.Keep in mind that the paws that walk in the litter tray are going to be on your lap soon.

, Since stress can lead to litter tray issues, try to identify and remove potential stressors in your cat’s environment. For example, keep her routine as steady as possible. Other ways to reduce her stress include keeping her food and water bowls full and in the same place and closing blinds and windows to block her sight of outside cats.If your cat is stressed because of conflicts with your other cats, give each cat her own resting area and make sure each cat has her own supply of toys and scratching posts., If your veterinarian has identified a disease that’s causing the litter tray issues, then treating that disease will resolve (or at least reduce) the issues. For example, if your cat has a urinary tract problem, your veterinary may prescribe antibiotics or other medications to treat the condition.For mobility issues like arthritis, your cat may need medications to relieve pain and inflammation.


Some diseases, like a urinary tract infection, are easily treatable. However, other conditions like kidney failure or diabetes require long-term management.
Even after treating the underlying medical condition, your cat may not immediately go back to using the tray.This may be because she has a negative association with the litter tray—she may associate the pain of her medical condition with the litter tray.

, As you can see, resolving your cat’s litter tray issues takes a lot of work. After all of that effort, you would not want your cat slipping back into old habits by revisiting the area of inappropriate elimination. To make this area undesirable, clean it thoroughly with an enzymatic cleaner that is specific for removing pet odors.Enzymatic cleaners are available at your local pet store.Do not use an ammonia-containing cleaner. The ammonia could actually attract your cat back to the area.It may take multiple cleanings to remove your cat’s odor from the area.

, To discourage your cat from going back to her old elimination spot, make it difficult or uncomfortable for her to find her footing on that area’s surface. Place double-sided tape on the floor. You can also put tinfoil or upside-down carpet runners in the area.If your cat can’t get comfortable, then she won’t go back to that spot to eliminate.

, Your cat will probably want to eliminate in an area that does not have any of her other creature comforts nearby. To make the area of inappropriate elimination more undesirable to your cat, place a food bowl or water bowl in that spot. You could also place her bed or toys in the area to discourage her from eliminating there., You may be frustrated with your cat when she eliminates outside of her litter tray, but you should never physically punish her. Physical punishment includes rubbing her nose in her urine or feces and dragging her to her litter tray.This type of negative reinforcement will not correct her behavior, and will make her more fearful of you and stressed.


Remember your cat’s perspective: it is stressful for her that she can’t use the litter tray, especially if a medical problem is keeping her from doing so.Do not make her stress and suffering worse by punishing her.
Do not scold or yell at your cat.

, You may think that keeping your cat in a small, enclosed room with a litter tray will encourage her to use it. Without addressing the underlying problem of why she is not using the tray, confining her in a room with it will not solve the problem.Do your due diligence to identify and address the underlying problem.

, If your cat has developed some type of aversion to her litter tray, treats will not make it look more appealing to her. She will not want to be disturbed, much less eat, when she is trying to eliminate.Making the litter tray more appealing in general (e.g., adequate privacy, comfortable litter, low entrance) will be more effective than enticing her with treats.

Anticipate a low activity level.",How to Identify a Himalayan Cat2," Himalayans are quiet, calm cats. They can be quite sedate, and are very affectionate and love sitting in a human’s lap. Though they like to be around their humans, they don’t require a lot of attention and do well alone.Himmies like to play, but they do it in their own calm, slow way.

, Unlike many cat breeds, Himalayans aren’t big climbers or jumpers. This is due partially to their shorter legs. Instead of jumping onto counters, tall furniture, or cat trees, they stay lower to the ground.Himmies prefer to sit on chairs and couches than high shelves or platforms.

, The Himalayan cat is not an extremely active or energetic cat. Most of the time they are calm and placid, but occasionally they will have bursts of energy.

Assess the cat for a muscular build.",How to Identify a Chartreux Cat1," The coat of the Chartreux is distinctive. It is a grey color that is sometimes described as silver. The fur itself is napped in appearance, meaning that it shows breaks in the fur due to it being a double coat.The Chartreux is always grey. If your cat is a different color, then it is not a Chartreux.
The Chartreux is one of only three cat breeds that is always grey. The two others are the Russian Blue and Karat.;
, The face is often a good indicator to help tell cats apart. In the case of a Chartreux cat, you will see an apparent ""smile."" This smiling style of face is the result of how the tapered muzzle of the cat is structured.

Discuss your cat's breed with a veterinarian.,
Talk to an expert in Chartreux cats.,
Have DNA testing done.",How to Identify a Chartreux Cat3," Veterinarians tend to see a wide variety of types of cats. If you want verification about your cat's breed, talk to your veterinarian. They should be able to identify common breeds.

If your veterinarian doesn't know your cat's breed off hand, they may be willing to do some research for you.

Gather your materials.,
Soften the hooves.,
Restrain the goat.,
Clean the hooves.",How to Trim Goat Hooves1," Before you begin the trimming process, make sure you have all your materials ready. Goats may dislike having their hooves trimmed. It may be difficult to grab brushes and clippers if your goat is agitated.


You will need a brush to dust off the goat's foot before trimming. You will also need something called a rasp, which you can purchase online or at a livestock store, which you can use to flatten out the hooves so they're level to the ground.You will need gloves to handle the goat's hooves. Goats feet can get messy.You will need two different types of clippers: hoof shears and a hoof knife. Both should be sharpened.While optional, it's a good idea to have blood stop powder. If you accidentally cut too deep, your goat's hoof may bleed slightly and require treatment. You can buy hoof stop powder at a local livestock or hardware store.;
, It's much easier to trim a goat's hooves when they're soft. If possible, trim your goat's hooves after a rain or snow fall. Rain and snow naturally soften a goat's hooves. If you live in an area where rain or snow is unlikely, try dampening some grass with a hose. Allow your goats to play in this portion of the yard., To begin the trimming process, you will first need to restrain your goat. How you choose to restrain your goat depends on his temperament.


You can place your goat on a milking stand if he's generally docile and unlikely to kick or fall off. This makes it easier to reach your goat's hooves.If your goat is fidgety, or if you do not have a milking stand, you can also tie your goat to a post or fence. It may be helpful to have someone hold your goat as you lift his feet to trim and clean them., Once your goat is adequately restrained, you should clean his hooves. It can be hard to tell where to trim if your goat's hooves are covered in dirt and grime.


Use your brush to dust any dirt off the exterior of the hooves. Any manure, dirt, or grime should be removed regularly.Next, lift each hoof up and pick out any rocks, dirt, and mud trapped inside the hoof. It's vital to remove such debris as such materials can obscure your vision. This can make it difficult to see where you're trimming."

Arrange the stirrup leathers so they hang straight down.,
Pull the stirrup to the top of the inside leather band.,
Put the dangling loop through the stirrup.,
Pull the loop snug.,
Lock it in place (optional).,
Repeat with the other stirrup.",How to Run up Stirrups," Allow the leather to lie flat against the saddle without twisting in either direction. The two sides of the leather should be on top of one another. Your stirrup leathers will hang straight down with the stirrups dangling at the ends. Make sure that there are no knots or messes and that the leather straps are smoothly hanging on the stirrup bars.;
, The stirrup iron hangs from a loop of leather or webbing which is pulled flat by your weight during the ride. Hold the leather in one hand and the stirrup iron in the other. Slide the stirrup iron up the inside band of leather (the inside being the piece of leather next to the saddle). Keep going until it reaches the top. The top of the stirrup should be touching (or almost touching) the stirrup bars.


The inside piece of leather usually has the rough side of the leather facing up.

, Hold the stirrup in your left hand while your right hand feeds the leather straps through the middle of the stirrup iron. Now feed the leather straps down under the base of the iron.

, Pull the loop of leather so it lays flat underneath the bottom of the stirrup. It should be against the saddle flap. This is usually enough to secure the stirrups. The straps should lie flat against the saddle, pointing towards the ground.

, If your stirrups slide down again, take the steps below to secure them with another loop. Even if they don't slide, this is important to do before lunging.


Hold the leather, making sure it isn't twisted.
Move it to the front of the stirrup.
Fold it over the front side of the stirrup and under the backside.
Use the end of the strap to pull it through the bottom of the strap loop and through its holder. This keeps the strap from becoming loose when the horse trots and keeps the stirrup from sliding down.

, The process is exactly the same.

Nip away the front nail.,
Cut along the sides of the nail.,
Level the bottom of the hoof.",How to Trim Goat Hooves2," Once you've cleaned your goat's hooves, you can begin the trimming process. Start with the front of the nail, using your hoof shears to trim. Goats nails become overgrown easily when they're kept domestically. In the wild, their feet would get worn down by climbing and jumping.


Clip at the tip of the front nails. Keep clipping until you see a white surface emerge. Do not clip further than this. If you clip into a pink surface, this can make your goat bleed.Try to clip in a straight line. You want your goat's hooves to be level to the ground., Once you've clipped the front nails, move on to the sides of the nails. Keep using the hoof shears. Goats have two toes on each foot, as well as two heels on each toe. Clip on the sides around these toes, once again clipping until you reach the white part of the hoof. Clip around the heel as well., Remember, you want your goat's hooves to be level with the ground. This helps your goat walk smoothly. Now, you'll be using your rasp or knife to level the bottom of the hoof.


If you use a knife, move from the toe to the heel. If you use a rasp, move from the heel to the toe.Use multiple strokes, trimming off a very thin layer with each stroke. Keep trimming until the goat's hooves are flat and level with the ground. Stop if you start to see pink."

Use blood stop powder, if necessary.,
Prevent hoof problems with foot baths.,
Trim regularly.",How to Trim Goat Hooves3," If you move slowly and avoid trimming into the pink, your goat should not bleed during the trimming process. However, everyone slips up on occasion. If you do end up causing droplets of blood to appear, applying blood stop powder can help correct the problem. You can sprinkle some powder on the infected area to help stop the bleeding. Read the instructions on your packet before use to make sure there are no warnings or special considerations relevant to your goat's issues., Try installing a walk through bath in your goat's pen. This can allow your goat to wet his feet regularly, preventing a buildup of bacteria that can cause a condition known as foot rot. Foot rot eats away at a goat's hooves and must be treated with trimming and antibiotics.You can add copper or zinc sulfite to your foot bath. These chemicals help fight bacteria that can cause foot rot. Goat's feet are particularly prone to bacteria as they walk through mud and feces throughout the day., A good way to prevent foot rot and infections is trimming your goat's feet regularly. You should seek to trim at least four times a year. However, it does depend on the individual animal. Some goat's feet may grow more quickly. Keep an eye your goat's feet and if you notice the hooves look a bit overgrown, schedule a trimming session.In the wild, goat's feet are worn down by rocks and terrain. Providing a large rock for your goat to play on can cut back on the need for trimming."

Identify a round head.,
Look for widely spaced ears.,
Observe large, round eyes.",How to Identify a Cymric Cat1," A Cymric's head is round in shape, resembling a circle. This is in contrast to other breeds. Other breeds are more likely to have a round head that narrows near the chin and mouth, similar to an upside down triangle., Its widely spaced ears stand erect on top of its head. In terms of shape, its ears are wide at the base and gradually taper to a rounded tip.Its ears may have wisps or tufts of hair., Its eyes are also positioned at a slight downward position toward its nose. In other words, the inner corners of its eyes are slightly lower than the outer corners.A Cymric may have hazel, green, amber, copper, gold, yellow or orange eyes.

Identify a compact body.,
Assess its size.,
Look for a knob tail.,
Examine its patterns.,
Identify a double coat.",How to Identify a Cymric Cat2," Unlike other cats that may appear big but weigh very little, the Cymric is both big and heavy. This is because the Cymric has a very sturdy and solid bone structure.Its well-developed hindquarters enable it to jump and balance on very high ledges despite its absence of tail.

, Cymrics are medium to large-sized cats. Male Cymrics can grow to be 12 to 15 pounds (5.4 to 6.8 kg) at maturity. On the other hand, female Cymrics can grow to be 8 to 12 pounds (3.6 to 5.4 kg) at maturity., It is usually made up of only one or two vertebrae. In addition to a knob tail (also called a rumpy-riser), the Cymric may be tailless (also known as rumpy). These short tails give the Cymric’s rear end a rounded appearance.Cymrics may also have a tail that is slightly longer than the knob that may be kinked, knotted, or curved (these are known as stumpies).

, Cymrics are typically multi-patterned cats. They may have a tortoiseshell, calico, bicolor, tabby, or ticking pattern. However, they can also have a solid, smoke, or shaded pattern., For a Cymric, long guard hairs stand out from a thick, downy undercoat. The long hair that stands out from its undercoat is what distinguishes it from a Manx cat."

Look for dexterity.",How to Identify a Cymric Cat3," Cymrics love to play and their intelligence makes them well-suited to learn tricks such as playing fetch. Similar to dogs, Cymrics may also bury their toys and carry them in their mouth as they walk around., Cymrics are very loyal to their owners and will follow them around the house, assisting in whatever tasks they are doing. They also like to spend a lot of quality time with their owners. However, they are not pushy or overly demanding of attention., If talked to, a Cymric cat is known to reply with quiet trills. They may even hold a conversation with their owners. Additionally, you may find Cymric cats talking to themselves as they walk around the house., Their dexterity allows them to open doors and cabinets. Therefore, if you do not want your Cymric getting inside a room or a cabinet, make sure to lock or secure the door."

",How to Harness a Horse1," These items include a bridle, reins, saddle, breast collar, and breeching.


The bridle allows the rider to communicate direction to the horse. The bridle may have a bit (an aluminum mouthpiece) attached and blinkers. Blinkers are square pieces of leather attached to the bridle above the bit and are placed over the horse's eyes to keep its focus forward.
The reins are very long straps of leather that reach from the bit to the driver. They are brown in color and not attached to the bridle.
The saddle is a strap of padded leather that sits just below the horse's withers. It has rein guides and a girth that wraps around the horse's belly to hold it in place. Also on the saddle are shaft tugs to hold the shafts of the cart.
The breast collar is a flat piece of leather attached to the traces. It lays flat against the horse's chest and allows the horse to pull the carriage or implement. Sometimes this part of the harness is a large collar that fits around the wide part of the horse's neck as seen with some draft horse hook ups.
The breeching is the harness's braking system and has a wide strap that lays across the horse's hindquarters and smaller straps the lay across the croup. Hold back straps attach to rings on the shaft of the cart. The breeching also has a stuffed crupper that goes underneath the horse's tail.;
, Ask the horse to lower its head, and place the bit into the horse's mouth. If the horse won't open his mouth, slide your thumb up past his front teeth to the gap, and gently but firmly leverage his mouth open. If it's cold weather, you should also let the bit heat up in your hands or under your arm before you bridle him.


Tighten the noseband gently. Make sure it is 2 finger's width below the horse's prominent cheekbone.
Adjust the blinkers so they are not touching the horse's eyes.
Fasten the throatlatch. Leave it loose enough that 2 or 3 fingers can fit between it and the horse's neck.

, If the traces are attached, make sure they are out of the way of the horse's feet. Adjust the position of the breast strap with the neck strap so it falls on the widest part of the horse's chest.

,


Tighten the girth snugly. Do not over tighten. It is best to wait for the horse to relax and move out before tightening the girth all the way.

, Move the tail so the breeching can rest smoothly against the horse's hindquarters.


Lift the tail, and slide the crupper under the tail. Buckle the crupper in place. Take extra care that the crupper is smooth, clean, and that no hair is trapped under it.
Attach the breeching to the saddle with the loin strap.

, Have an attendant hold the head of the horse.


Run the shafts through the loops on the saddle.

,, Wrap and buckle it.

,,"
"
Harness a single horse from the front first.,
To correctly fit the winkers (bridle), the horse’s eye should be in the centre of the winker blind, this should not be pressed close against the eye.,
Consider use of the bits.,
Use open bridles.,
Place the breast collar sitting above the point of the horse’s shoulder, to allow freedom of movement, and below the windpipe, for your horse’s comfort.

,
Let the saddle sit behind the wither.,
Carefully fit the crupper under the tail.,
Reach the breeching seat around behind the horse from stifle to stifle.,
Adjust as required.,
Harnessing to the single carriage, reins held in the crook of your elbow, bring up the carriage.,
Slide the shafts into the tugs.,
Hold the reins as you walk around behind the carriage to get to the other side if you do not have a groom to assist you.,
Check again.,
To unharness reverse the order; loosen belly band, undo breeching straps and then traces off last.",How to Harness a Horse2," If you follow this you should get it right every time.


Personal habits such as collar (or breast collar) first, considered to bring good luck in coaching days, are acceptable, followed by saddle, girth only, and breeching and then bridle/winkers (so that naughty horses do not rub them; this puts scratches on your patent leather blinds, (showies all know this) and finally attach the reins.

,


Make the throat latch a little tighter than a ridden horse. Or, the top of the bridle may be secured to the horse’s mane; many ponies or pairs of horses can remove their bridles easily by a shake of the head or by rubbing against their pair.
Check the throat latch again once your horse is on the move, to ensure that it is not too tight.
The noseband helps to stabilise the bridle and keep the winker blinds from bulging out and allowing your horse to glimpse the carriage.

, Bits are optional but it is prudent to err on the side of caution, a more severe bit used with a light hand is better than to be ‘wanting a pound’ and not having it if your horse takes fright.

, Open bridles are allowed at all times except in the show ring (standardbred turnouts excluded).

,, The girth secures in the same position as a ridden girth, firm but not too tight.

, Lift the tail and ensure that all hair is free of the crupper dock before buckling it. Then lift the crupper back-strap at the croup, above the hips, you should be able to slide your hand sideways (4”/10cm) under this strap.

, Hang close to that level, halfway between the tail dock and the point of the hock.


Breechings are not always used in light jog carts and also some 4-wheeled carriages if these are fitted with brakes.

, All of the harness should be on the horse and adjusted for fit before you bring the carriage to the horse.

, Be careful to clear the horse’s rump.

, Both traces are attached first and then the breeching straps––these lay under the traces in most carriages, followed by the belly band.

, You may need to stop the horse from rubbing his bridle off or from moving around, holding the reins will help make this possible.

, Each piece of harness is checked again for correct adjustment; there should also be a hand’s width (4”) between the horse’s rump and the breeching seat when the carriage is pulled backwards into draft, the girth should be secure but does not need to be as tight as a riding saddle.


Tightening the belly band may depend upon how your carriage rides but generally it should not be too tight or too loose.

, Make sure that all straps are released before removing the cart, a forgotten breeching strap, still attached, can mean that you have the cart halfway off and both hands full, a tricky situation that can be dangerous.

Figure out what type of boots you want.,
Measure the front leg with a tape measure.,
Estimate from weight.,
Check for more specific sizes.,
Try before buying.,
Have a custom boot made if necessary.,
Clean the horse's leg.,
Carefully put on the boot.,
Fasten the boots.,
Check the fit using your finger.,
Watch the horse walk.,
Get a second opinion.",How to Fit a Horse for Support Boots," There are boots made for cross country jumping, open front jumping, dressage/flat work, as well as support boots and all-purpose splint boots. Research each type of boot and decide which type suits your riding and horse's needs.


Young horses should not be doing any work that needs support boots. Until its body is fully mature, between five and eight years old, the horse should stick with simple, straightforward exercises. Consult a veterinarian for more advice.;
, Measure the length from the horse's knee, running the length of the cannon bone to the top of the ankle. The back boots are usually sized to match the front boots they come with. Choose from the three common sizes of support boots based on your results:


Small: 7-1/4” - 7-3/4” (18.4–19.7 cm)
Medium: 7-3/4” - 8-1/4” (19.7–21.0 cm)
Large: 8-1/4” - 8-3/4” (21.0–22.2 cm)

, This ""cowboy sizing method"" isn't the most accurate, but it can work all right. Weight and bone structure does make a difference, so take it into account if this gives different results than the tape measure.


Small: Fine Boned / Under 900 lbs (under 400 kg)
Medium: Medium Boned / 900 - 1100 lbs (400–500 kg)
Large: Big Boned / Over 1100 lbs (over 500 kg)

, Typically, support boots come in small, medium, and large. Some manufacturers sell boots that are scaled to fit ponies, cobs, and horses exclusively, or provide more specific size charts. These charts may help you decide based on the breed and leg circumference as well as your measurements above.

, It is best to try on the boots before buying. Maybe someone at your stable owns a pair and will let you try them on your horse. If you can't find someone who will let you use their boots, look for an online store or tack shop with a return policy. Every pair of boots fits a little differently, so you can never be sure just from the label.


Ask the owner of the boots whether he likes them, and how they've held up.

, This will be much more expensive, but all the fitting will be done for you. This may be necessary if you have a horse with an unusual shape or height/weight ratio.

, Make sure the horse's leg is clean and free of any debris. If debris is trapped inside the boot, it can cause irritation from rubbing.

, This process varies based on boot design. For open front boots, open the boot, put it on near the horse's knee, and slide it down until it falls into place on the cannon bone. For other types of boots, ask a trainer or look for videos online. It may take several tries to get the boot lined up properly when putting it on. Typically, the leather support pads go on the inside of the leg, and the straps are on the back of the leg.


You must be extremely careful when putting on the boots. Getting the boot too tight around the leg can cause serious problems.
Remember, always work from the side of the horse. You need to be able to get out of the way if the horse tries to kick.

, Most boots fasten using a buckle with loop and holes, keyhole snaps, or Velcro. Start with the upper strap, pulling it snug. Move down, fastening each strap with equal pressure.


Fasten until snug, but don't overdo it. The top of the boot should fit snugly, but not press into the leg.
Some boots use a different design for the lowest strap (The sling strap). Bring this strap around the base of the horse's fetlock and around at a 45º angle. Do the same for the strap on the other side, attaching it at a 45º angle as well.

, Slide your finger between the boot and horse's leg. If you cannot easily fit your finger into the gap, the boots are too tight and could damage the horse's tendons. If you can fit more than two fingers or can wiggle your fingers a great deal, the boots are too loose and could fail to provide support, or could let dirt inside and cause abrasions.


The front boot should cover most of the horse's cannon bone and the inside of the fetlock. The back boot should cover the tendon fully, reaching about 1-3 inches (2.5–7.5 cm) below the hock.
Some less common types of boots may fit over different areas. Ask the manufacturer or an experienced horse owner for advice.

, The boots should not slide around on the horse's legs, but they should not be so stiff that it is hard for your horse to move freely. If the boot is too big, it will rise to the back of the knee and cause the horse trouble while working.

, If the boots fit correctly to your opinion, get an experienced horse person to check them, or even a trusted vet. You can never be too careful when it comes to you and your horse's safety. Remember, one misstep can cause an injury, even a fatal one. Be extra careful when it comes to properly putting on the boots, and ensuring they are high quality and will not come off."

Tie the ends of 10 lengths together (or more for a bigger net, but make it an even number) of 7 feet (2.1 m) long strings.,
You should ask someone to hold the net up by the knot or nail the knot up or you'll get very confused and the string will get very tangled.

,
Measure 4 inches (10.2 cm) down (or less for a smaller-holed net) and mark with a felt-tip pen.,
Mark 4 inches (10.2 cm) down again from the row of knots that you just tied.,
Mark, pair, tie and continue this for each row.,
Make sure you have 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) of string left after your last mark, when you get to your last row.,
Thread a strong plastic drawstring through the loops.,
Finished.",How to Make a Haynet," Make the knot as tightly as possible.;
,, Divide the strings into pairs (paper clips, or clothes pins, will be used to keep pairs together temporarily, until tied). Make a knot by tying each pair of strings together at your marks. Take the original paper clip off before you tie each pair.

, Take two knotted pairs right next to each other, and choose one string from the pair of knots, and paper clip the pair of chosen strings together, for getting them paired correctly.
Before tying the row of knots, check the pairs and the net. If any string is across any of the space inside the net, meant for the hay, then you've paper clipped strings together that aren't next to each other, or tangled them. To fix that, you probably need to start again and pair them. Tie knots where you have marked them. Do the same for the other pairs going around; so, now each pair is ""holding hands"" with the two pairs on either side of it. Spread the net -- and you should be able to see diamond shapes.

, Remember to check the net, as you have it clipped together, before you start tying each row of knots.

, Instead of tying a standard knot, tie a quick-release knot (the same as when you tie up your horse) you will then have a loop. Secure this by tying a double knot with the loose ends. Trim the ends, if you need to and then burn/melt the ends to stop their fraying (using a cigarette lighter), but have water on hand! (Don't forget to melt ends of strings from the big knot at the bottom of the net.)

, (This can also be made from bailing twine by plaiting three pieces together)

, You can (very carefully) melt each knot somewhat, to prevent knots from loosening, with water available for any fire emergency. Fill it with hay and hang it securely.

Take the horse out of the stall.,
Choose your tools.,
Check for problems.,
Remove obvious piles of manure.,
Rake up and remove wet shavings.,
Sort out manure flakes from clean shavings.,
Change the hay and water hay.,
Deodorize (optional).,
Level out the shavings.,
Return the horse to the stall.,
Compost the waste.",How to Muck out a Stall With Shavings," Tie him up or put him in an empty stall or exercise area while you are working. A stall is a small place and you will need room to use your tools.;
, You'll need need a manure rake, also called a manure fork: not the four-pronged fork used toss hay, but one with many prongs close together to prevent spills. Bring along a flat-tipped shovel for the shavings. Finally, grab a large muck bucket with a wide mouth for easy filling, or a wheelbarrow.


A plastic shovel is lighter, making the job less work.
For more room, keep the manure (muck) bucket or wheelbarrow outside the stall, as long as it does not impede the flow of horse traffic and become a hazard.

, Take a minute to look around for anything that can cause a problem. Has a bucket been over turned? Can the horse reach the salt block? Has a nail worked its way out of a board? Is there anything laying around that should not have been left in the stall? Fix these problems before you start cleaning.


You can also check on the horse's health. Has he been drinking the usual amount of water, and did he eat his hay? Was he hot and sweating when he came out of the stall? Limping?

, Using a pitchfork, lift any large manure piles into your wheelbarrow. You can gently shake the pitchfork or toss it, similar to a chef tossing a pan, to sift the clean shavings back onto the floor of the stall. Try not to take too many shavings, since they cost money.


For large piles, and wet piles especially, take care not to damage your fork. Only take part of the manure pile per scoop, starting at the top or sides. Slide the prongs forward until the manure is resting closer to the base of the prongs, where the weight has less leverage.
The manure should be well formed greenish-brown lumps of digested matter. If they are liquid ""cow pies,"" there could be a diet or medical issue.

, There might be just one or two clear wet spots which are dark in color, or maybe the whole stall is one big stirred-up darkish mess. Dig all the way down to the floor of your stall to make sure you got it all, since the urine usually covers a much wider area than the surface darkening suggests. Rake back the shavings from the sides and corners to check for places you might have missed. You can use the back or side of the fork to push the bottom layer of wet shavings into a pile for scooping.


Be liberal when taking out wet shavings. Ammonia smell from urine can contribute to lung problems such as heaves, and standing in wet muck can give your horse foot problems such as thrush.
Leave the wet floor uncovered to dry while you continue cleaning out other wet areas.
Take note of each horse's ""favorite spots."" Geldings tend to urinate in the center of the stall while mares tend to urinate along the sides.

, There are several methods of doing this. Some people like to pull all of the shavings into a pile in the middle of the stall and sift it out one scoop at a time, shaking clean shavings onto the sides and tossing out manure. Other people like to toss a mixed scoop of shavings at the wall, so that the manure pieces roll out and separate themselves. Or you can just shake the fork like a tambourine or use the ""chef's toss"" to sort it. Again, be sure to sift all the way down to the floor so you don't miss any buried pieces. Manure can give your horse thrush, and host fly and parasite larvae.


Sometimes old shavings will start getting darker colored, but remain dry and odorless. You can remove these to make your stall look crisp and fresh. Alternatively, move them to the horse's usual urine area so they can absorb the urine instead of the cleaner, fresher shavings.
Replace any shavings with mold or significant amounts of dust.

, Remove any hay that is dusty, mostly stems, or covered in shavings, urine, or manure. Add new hay and water if necessary. Clear shaving away in a small area around the hay and the water bucket. This prevents the horse from inhaling or eating shavings, and minimizes the amount of shavings ruined due to spilled water.

, Hydrated lime or baking soda will remove odors from wet patches on the floor. Sprinkle a little over them and let sit for at least a few minutes. Sweep up the lime or baking soda and drop it in the dirty muck bucket or wheelbarrow.


Use this sparingly, as it can irritate the horse's skin.
The longer you wait, the more moisture it will absorb.

, Spread the shavings around using your rake or shovel. Add a fresh layer on top if necessary, and use the back of your fork to make it extra smooth. A good thick bed of shavings should be about 2 inches (5 cm) over a rubber mat, as much as 8 inches (20 cm) over a dirt floor, or as much as 14 inches (36 cm) over cement.


If your horse keeps parts of the stall clean, pile shavings up higher on the sides, where the horse likes to lie.
Be careful not to kick the shavings. If floating in the air, they may irritate your lungs or the horse's.

, Check the stall one more time for any problems. Bring your tools out of the stall, and bring the horse back in. Step out of the stall, making sure the doors are well locked behind you.

, Deposit the waste in a proper compost pile. Make sure this is a place outside and away from humans and other animals. Let it break down and act as fertilizer, to use on crops or to sell. Make sure it breaks down to a well-rotted mixture before you use it as fertilizer.


If the horse is sick, be sure to rinse your tools with a bleach and water mixture. Take special care to haul the shavings far away from the rest of the horses.

Get any other accessories needed:


Gloves are usually optional, but are useful when the weather is especially hot or cold, or when you are riding a horse who is heavy on the forehand or likes to pull.",How to Choose Horse Riding Gear2,"  Clothes should be conservative, fitted, and weather-appropriate.  It is appropriate to tuck shirts into breeches and accessorize with a belt.

, Options for shirts:


For casual lessons, solid-colored tee shirts may be appropriate, though very casual, so not always advised.
Collared polo shirts are very popular and are universally appropriate.
For warmer months, long-sleeved, breathable, quarter-zipped shirts are a smart choice. They can be purchased through equine retailers or tack stores.
For cooler months, a great formal lesson look is a button down layered with a color-coordinating sweater.
Jackets or coats are appropriate when the weather is cold, but make sure that they are fitted.

, Breeches with knee patches are common across disciplines, whereas full seat breeches are typically reserved for higher level riders and dressage disciplines.
Opt for solid, conservative colors. Tan, black, navy, and grey are all safe choices.
Be sure that your breeches have belt loops.

,  There are a wide variety of styles and brands to choose from.  It's best to go to a tack store and try different combinations until you find a fit and style that you like.
If you are interested in showing or are willing to make an investment in your boots, tall field boots are ideal.  It is important to get fitted at a tack store so that they can help you find a pair that fits you well and suits your needs.

Make sure it compliments your shape, fits under your jacket, is long enough to tuck into your breeches, and does not ""gap"" in the front. There are different colors available, but white is the best option.


Choose a shirt with a wrap collar rather than one with a traditional choker collar. If you decide to monogram the collar, make sure that it is small and conservative. In certain rings, riders can be disqualified for having visible monograms.

, Choose a coat that fits well, is long enough, and has long enough sleeves.


Choose a coat which is conservative in color. Navy is the most common color in hunter-jumpers/equitation, but black is becoming popular (black is traditional in the dressage arena).
Three-buttoned jackets are traditional.

, Tan or khaki breeches are the only acceptable colors in hunter-jumper/equitation.  Be sure that your breeches are mid- or high-rise so that there is no gaping in the back. One of the most popular brands for show breeches is Tailored Sportsman.

, These are essential in the show ring. Boots must be black. Boots should be tall enough to create a clean line from the top of your knee down and should be fitted through the ankle. They should be field boots (zipper in the back with laces in the front). Be sure that your boots are cleaned and polished for shows.

Look for signs that your horse has a bruised sole.,
Check to confirm that your horse has a bruised sole.,
Look to see if your horse is showing signs of foot soreness.,
Check your horse’s hooves for causes of the soreness he is experiencing.",How to Know if Your Horse Needs Shoes1," Shoes have a thickness to the steel that physically lifts the hoof from the ground. Thus the depth of the shoe reduces the impact of stones on the sensitive sole of the hoof. When a horse is barefoot he is more likely to tread on stones and cause bruising to the sole or frog of his hoof. If you recognize symptoms of a bruised sole, it means that your horse should most likely get shoes.Symptoms of a bruised sole include:


A mild lameness on rocky ground (on a score where 10 is holding the leg up, and 0 is sound, the lameness is around 2 to 5 out of 10). This is because stones making contact with the bruised areas and cause him pain and discomfort.
When standing, the horse carries his weight evenly spread over all four legs. This is because the sole does not contact the ground and so any discomfort is minimal.;
, To test for a bruised sole, lift the hoof and use a hoof pincers to probe for tenderness. Pincers use a scissor-like action to apply blunt pressure to a particular area. Place the pincers so that one head of the pincers is in contact with the sole and the other is over the hoof outer wall so that when pressure is applied, the sole is compressed.


If pain is present typically the horse reacts by pulling the hoof away or vocalizing. If this occurs it means your horse should get shoes.

, An unshod horse has the potential to be sore on all four legs at the same, which can make it difficult to spot lameness (he is equally lame on all legs which make him appear sound).However, signs may include:


At rest he may keep shifting his weight, resting different feet in turn.
Never staying more than a few minutes on each foot.

, Test each hoof for signs of discomfort. If an unshod hoof is sore, then the likelihood is that he needs shoes in order to protect the soles of his hooves. To test for soreness:


Pick up each hoof and inspect the sole, frog, and bulbs of the heel for red, inflamed, or bruised areas.

Understand what hoof wear refers to and how it relates to shoes.,
Understand that some wear is normal.,
Look for signs of excess wear.,
Take care of hairline splits caused by hoof wear.,
Look for disintegrating hooves.",How to Know if Your Horse Needs Shoes2," The outer hoof is made from keratin, the equivalent of our finger nails. Just as a broken nail does not hurt, so cracked or flaking hooves are not painful. However, cracked hooves can be a potential problem if the crack travels up toward the coronary band (the area the hoof grows from, the equivalent of our nail bed). If the hoof splits then the sensitive nerves, blood vessels, and bone inside can be exposed and this is painful.


Shoes can protect the bottom edge of the hoof from cracks and chips, and even hold a split hoof together. Thus an unshod hoof needs regular inspection for the signs of wear that require the support of a shoe to stop a crack traveling upwards.

, Much like our fingernails, the hoof grows continually. The ideal situation is one where the rate of growth is exactly balanced by the rate of wear. However, this is unlikely to happen, and indeed nature takes account of this with the unshod foot by allowing small pieces of weight bearing hoof to chip away, as a means of ""trimming"" back excess growth.

, The owner of an unshod horse needs to be alert for signs of excess wear. These include excessive chips or cracks on hoof surface where it contacts the grounds.Signs of excessive wear include:


More than 50% of the circumference of the hoof being chipped.
If cracks extended up beyond the level of the sole.

, If a hairline split is spotted the length, depth, and width need to be monitored on a daily basis. If it widens to a crack, or extends up past the sole, then seek the advice of a reputable farrier who specialists in hoof care in case shoeing is advisable.


While waiting for the farrier to visit, do not work the horse and put him onto soft-going land.

, The keratin of some unshod hooves is not strong enough to take the wear and tear of being in direct contact with the ground. In this case the hoof starts to disintegrate and is a strong indication that shoes are required.


In the earlier stages the hoof wall peels and crumbles, and if ignored some hooves deteriorate to the point that they look like the end of an exploded cigar. This is a sure sign the hoof is not tough enough and needs the protection of shoes.

Be aware that agile movements are easier to do when your horse has shoes.",How to Know if Your Horse Needs Shoes3," There are some conditions, such as rough terrain or difficult work, that can cause your horse problems if he does not have shoes on. These conditions are discussed in the following steps., Rocky ground is more likely to bruise the sole of an unshod hoof. A shoe elevates the hoof slightly and decreases the impact of uneven ground on the underside of the hoof.

, Roadwork is very abrasive and wears the hoof down faster than it grows. This results in the horse walking on his sole and the bulbs of his heel, which is very painful. If your horse works on the road frequently, he should most likely be shoed.

, Unshod hooves are best equipped to deal with the natural landscape such as pasture, soil, or grassland. There are many other surfaces horses are expected to work on which do not provide good grip. Shoes will give your horse the grip he needs.


Examples include icy ground and pavements.

, When demands for extreme agility are placed on your horse, such as twisting and turning, or jumping, shoes can come in very handy. In these circumstances shoes are advisable because studs, or cork, can be inserted into the shoes to give your horse extra purchase and prevent him from slipping.

"
"
Check to see if your horse’s toe grows faster than the heel.,
Know that horses with small hooves are good candidates for shoes.,
Consider getting your horse orthopedic shoes.",How to Know if Your Horse Needs Shoes4," Some parts of the hoof grow faster than others. If the toe grows faster than the heel, the angle of the unshod hoof changes and throws weight backwards. This causes the bulb of the heel to bang against the ground with each step and cause pain. A horse with this tendency has a long, slipper like hoof, rather than a blocky, upright one.


Putting a shoe on these horses elevates the bulbs of the heel off the ground. Now when the horse takes a step he no longer knocks this delicate structure so his pain is relieved.

, Some horses have small hooves relative to their body size, or weight. In these cases there is more pressure per square inch on their hooves than nature intended, and the hooves wear down more quickly than they grow. These animals require shoes.

, A horse with a physical problem with the bones or joints in the lower leg or hoof can be helped with orthopedic shoes. These shoes are fitted by expert farriers and involve creating bespoke shoes that alter the distribution of the horse's weight when standing. This can relieve pressure on a sore joint and make the animal more comfortable.For example, if your horse has long toes and short heels, these orthopedic shoes can help him to walk more easily. Fitting this horse with a shoe that raises the heel can help to ease the pressure on the navicular bone, and encourages more weight bearing on the toe.

Make sure it has a short, wavy coat.,
Check for graceful body curves and arches.,
Look for long, slender legs with muscular thighs.,
Look for a long, tapering tail.",How to Identify a Cornish Rex1," The most distinctive trait of a Cornish Rex is its short, curly coat. The coat should be soft and fall in tight, uniform waves. The breed comes in a variety of colors and patterns, including solid colors, bicolor (one color and white), and tortoiseshell.The wavy coat results from a genetic mutation that originated in 1950.;
, The Cornish Rex is long and slender with curved body contours. Its naturally arching back and deep chest make its profile dramatically curvy. Its body shape is often compared to that of a Whippet., A Cornish Rex has thin legs and dainty paws. It stands high on its legs, which appear to be unusually long in proportion with the rest of its body. Its thighs and hips also appear disproportionately muscular for its slender frame., The arched back and tucked up hips flow into a long, thin tail. The tail should be whip-like and flexible. It should taper, or slightly narrow, toward the end. "
"
Understand that keeping your horse unshod means you need to take extra care of his hooves.,
Schedule regular appointments with the farrier.,
Understand the purpose of filing and rasping.,
Be aware of the process of filing and rasping.",How to Know if Your Horse Needs Shoes5," Keeping a horse unshod is not a means of saving money; an unshod horse needs just as much, if not more, hoof care than a shod animal. The hoof needs regular expert filing in order to smooth away chips and cracks before they spread and become a major problem. The hooves also need regular rasping to even out wear and maintain a healthy weight-bearing surface., A barefoot horse requires the farrier's attention every four to eight weeks to ensure the hoof stays in tip-top condition. Much like our own finger nails, hooves grow all the time and require trimming to remove snags and cracks.

, The aim of filing and rasping is twofold; it maintains a healthy hoof by getting rid of damage, plus it helps keep a good shape to the hoof. Think of the difference between a lady wearing stilettos or flat pumps. Heel height changes the angle of the ankle and how you walk, and for the horse, careful trimming will help to reduce stress on the horse’s legs.

, The farrier with use nippers to trim away excess horn where it has grown faster than it was worn away, and then a file or rasp to make sure the surface is even and buff away cracks. His or her aim is to make the wall of the hoof an even thickness all the way round and keep the fetlock at the correct angle.

Look for curly whiskers.,
Check for large ears and eyes.,
Make sure the head is egg shaped with high cheeks.,
Look for a strongly bridged nose and well-developed chin.",How to Identify a Cornish Rex2," The same gene that gives the Cornish Rex its characteristic coat causes its whiskers to curve. Their whiskers can be very curly or just gently curve at the ends. The whiskers are often brittle or prone to breaking because of their curled shape., The ears should be large, bat-like, and sit on top of the head. The eyes are also large and oval in shape. The eyes should be set one full eye’s width apart., Compared to the rest of its long body, the head of a Cornish Rex appears somewhat small. The head is egg-shaped, and its length should be about one-third greater than its width. Its cheeks should be high and well-defined., The bridge of its nose should be strong and appear to be a straight line when viewed in profile. The chin should also be well-defined. In combination, these features gives its face a squarish appearance when viewed from the side."
"
Look for social, highly active behavior.,
See if it likes to fetch.,
Notice if it loves warm places.",How to Identify a Cornish Rex3," Most cats of this breed enjoy being petted and interacting with people. Their well-muscled thighs make them agile, powerful leapers.With such a social personality, these cats make great family pets.

, The Cornish Rex is often described as “dog-like”. This breed loves to play, and is known to fetch and return objects. If you suspect a cat is a Cornish Rex, toss a toy and see if it brings the toy back to you., Most cats like to bask in sunlight, but the Cornish Rex is especially fond of warm places. A Cornish Rex will constantly seek out warmth due to its short, thin coat.Because of its thin coat, a Cornish Rex also feels surprisingly warm to the touch. If you’re caring for one, consider buying it a sweater to keep it warm.

"
"
Check the cat's breeding papers.,
Get a DNA test.,
Observe common illnesses and conditions.",How to Identify a Cornish Rex4," If a cat came from a breeder, check its pedigree, which is a document the breeder supplies to identify the cat's breed and parentage. If you're purchasing a kitten from a breeder, make sure they provide its breed registration numbers and information about its parents.You can find a breeder using The International Cat Association's listing., There's an affordable test available that identifies the recessive gene that causes the Cornish Rex coat. If you want to verify that your cat is a Rex or was cross-bred with a Rex, you can order a test online and send a sample to a lab, or just talk to the cat's vet about administering the test.A Cornish Rex coat test costs around $40-50 (U.S.) per animal., The breed is prone to specific health conditions that don't affect most other cats and is at a higher risk for other species-wide issues. The most easily recognized health condition is hypotrichosis, or hereditary baldness. Look for patches of thin hair or bald spots, which are signs that your Cornish Rex is hypertrichotic.Other common issues include thickening of the heart muscle, which can only be detected with an echocardiogram, and patellar luxation, in which the kneecaps slide out of place and make it difficult for the cat to walk.The thin coat also offers little protection against UV light, so the breed is also susceptible to sunburn."

Check your equipment.,
Lay a pole on the ground in the position that you want the jump to be.

,
Place the wings on either side of the pole.,
Line up another set of wings directly behind the first wings, if you want a spread.,
Attach the cups to the wings at the required height.,
Position the poles and other components depending on the type of jump you want.",How to Build a Horse Jump1," You need to make sure that each article has no nails or sharp pieces protruding outwards, and is sturdy and undamaged. Equipment should include only safe obstacles, such as pre-built jumps, cavaletti, etc. You should use old tires, buckets, bales or anything that can hold up a jump bar. Remember that the jump you construct for training should be safe and come down easily if the horse should hit it.;
,, If they are makeshift, you may have to position them forward of the pole and slightly closer together so the pole overlaps by a couple of inches.

, If the wings are not identical, it can be difficult to line them up accurately with the first jumps. In this case, use another pole to measure the correct distance between the wings.

, Do not add more cups then you will be using. Not all types of wings have cups and some that do aren’t removable.

, You can keep the pole you use to measure the distances between wings, where it is as a ground-line or use it to construct the jump.

"
"
Decide on what you want to make, you might like to read about a few of the typical jump designs and styles so you can decide what would best suit your riding.",How to Build a Horse Jump2,"


A Cross Rail: This is a type of upright fence. The jump is made with two poles, each with one side resting on the ground so they form a cross at the centre. It can be used to improve straightness as it encourages the horse to jump in the centre of the jump and are therefore useful as the first element of a spread or combination. It makes the horse want to jump in the center and it helps get your horse ready!






Ascending Oxer (Staircase): This is a type of spread fence. This is can be double or treble bar, with need 2 and 3 pairs of wings respectively. On each pair of wings, an upright fence is constructed. The bar(s) in front must be lower than the one behind it. This is a nice jump for the horse as it follows the shape of the jumps. This jump must only be jumped one way as it has a false ground line the other way.






Pyramid (Tiger trap): This is a type of spread fence. This will have 3 or 5 wing set closely together. On each pair of wings, an upright fence is constructed. The middle bar must be the highest and the bars either side ascending or descending similar to the ascending oxer. This is a nice jump for the horse as it follows the shape of the jumps.






Upright (Vertical): This is a type of upright fence. This consists of a jump with a vertical bar along the top. If the jump is very low, only one pole is needed, other poles under the top one will fill in the gap and make in jump look more solid. These jumps may or may not have a pole as a ground line.






True Parallel (Square Oxer): This is a type of spread fence. This has two or more pairs of wings. On each pair of wings, an upright fence is constructed.






Combinations: These can be doubles, trebles, or quadruples. They are a set of two, three or four jumps respectively, set a few strides apart, more than three strides. They can include any of the other jumps.







"
"
Measure the distance between jumps in a combination in strides.,
Measure your own stride and pace the distance from the middle of one fence to the middle of another.",How to Build a Horse Jump3," Each horse's stride will be different. If you don't know your horses stride you can use 12 feet (3.7 m) for a horse and 10 feet (3.0 m) for a pony.

, You can measure the distance with a tape measure if you prefer.

"
"
Put a pole on the ground in front of the jump to make a ground line.,
Lean a pole against the wing to make false wings.,
Add Fillers and planks to make the jump look more solid.",How to Build a Horse Jump4," Horses look at jumps from the ground up, so a ground line helps the horse work out where the jump is.

, If necessary, you can bring the end of the pole forward. Proper wide wings help guide the horse into the jump and avoid running out (the horse going around the jump instead of over it.) False wings do the same.

, Colourful fillers also help desensitize the horse to the type of jumps he might see at competition. An old carpet over the jumps can make it look very solid too.

Isolate the affected goat(s).,
Dry off the teat.,
Use an effective teat dip.,
Identify the pathogen causing mastitis.,
Administer medication to your goat.,
Look for the clinical signs of mastitis.,
Run tests on the affected goat.,
Extrapolate information based on the herd's history and behavior.,
Improve pre-milking hygiene.,
Reduce the amount of time goats are milked.,
Identify and segregate or cull affected goats.",How to Treat Mastitis in a Goat," If one or more of your goats has mastitis, you'll want to separate the affected goats from the rest of the herd. Some farmers go so far as to cull affected animals to further reduce the chances of a mastitis outbreak.Keeping affected goats in the herd risks the health of other goats and increases the chances that you may accidentally collect milk from a goat with mastitis.;
, If your goat has mastitis, the first thing you'll need to do is dry off the teat. Drying off a teat means inducing a period of non-lactation so that the infection can be treated and the mammary tissue can rest and regenerate.Drying off should ideally begin about two weeks before the desired dry-off date, but since mastitis probably came on unexpectedly you can begin drying off right away.
Gradually reduce the energy content of the goat's diet and replace it with a high-fiber diet. The goat's body will recognize that there are less nutrients available and milk production will slow down.
Try cutting out grain from the goat's diet and replacing alfalfa with grass hay. High-production goats may need an even lower-calorie diet like straw and water, though grass hay is usually sufficient.
Don't limit the amount of food or water your goat has. When livestock have less access to food and water they tend to seek out any other food sources they can find, which may lead to eating toxic plants or fighting over resources.

, The goat's teats should be cleaned with an antiseptic to kill any external pathogens living on the udder. A product containing either iodine or chlorhexidine is considered the most effective treatment, as well as one of the most common.If using chlorhexidine, choose a product with a 2% concentration.Apply the antiseptic twice at 24-hour intervals for maximum effectiveness.

, Your vet will most likely run tests on the goat's milk and/or blood to identify the specific pathogen causing the infection. The pathogen affecting your goat will determine which (if any) medications your vet may prescribe, and it may influence your vet's outlook on the goat's recovery period.Coagulase-negative staphylococci are one of the most prevalent pathogens that cause mastitis.
Staphylococcus aureus infections are fairly uncommon, but when they occur they tend to be persistent and do not respond well to treatment.
Streptococcus agalactiae infections are very uncommon and are generally not thought of as a risk for goat mastitis.
Mycoplasma infections can cause significant problems in goats and may lead to more severe health problems like septicemia, polyarthritis, pneumonia, or encephalitis.

, Depending on the results of a milk culture, your veterinarian may recommend a course of medication to treat the mastitis. Antibiotics are commonly prescribed, but you will have to discontinue use once the infection clears and test the milk to ensure there are no antibiotics present before you resume milking.Antibiotics like benzylpenicillin, cloxacillin, amoxicillin, cephalonium, cefoperazone, erythromycin, tilmicosin, kanamycin, penicillin, ampicillin, or tetracycline can all be used to treat mastitis.
Glucocorticoids like dexamethasone may be administered to reduce swelling.
Intramammary antibiotic ointment may also be administered to the teats, but you'll need to keep an eye on the goat to make sure her skin does not get irritated.

, Mastitis usually comes on as either a systemic form or a chronic form. The systemic form develops very quickly and presents symptoms like high fever (above 105 degrees Fahrenheit, or 40.5 degrees Celsius) and an elevated pulse. The chronic form of mastitis typically develops as a persistent and often-incurable infection.Acute mastitis is marked by hard, swollen, reddish mammary glands, as well as milk secretions that are watery and yellowish (due to the presence of white blood cells).
Chronic mastitis is usually marked by hard lumps on the udder and may be accompanied by an inability to produce milk.

, Common tests your vet may order include a microbiologic milk culture, a somatic cell count (SCC), the California Mastitis Test (CMT), or an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) test. The SCC and the CMT are the two most frequently-used tests to identify cases of mastitis.Be aware that negative bacterial cultures do not necessarily mean that there is not a case of bacterial mastitis. Many types of bacteria are shed cyclically and therefore may not show up in a milk sample., If one or more goats in your herd have mastitis, it's very likely that other goats have been exposed to mastitis as well. Once you've identified and isolated an affected goat, you may want to keep a regular checkup of your other goats' udders, milk, and body temperature to watch for signs that the infection has spread., Improving the hygiene of pre-milking and milking conditions can significantly decrease the rate of mastitis transmission.This includes better sanitation and cleanliness in the goats' housing and in the milking area.Goats should not be overcrowded. Every goat should have sufficient room in the barn as well as in the yard.
The paths between your milking area and the goats' housing or fields should be kept clean. The paths should be free-draining and should be kept clear of feces and slurry.
Do a dry wipe and a thorough washing of the udders and teats with clean, potable water. Make sure you also wash your hands before and after milking.
Use teat dips and sprays to disinfect the mammary glands before milking, and keep any milking equipment you use clean and sanitary.

, Some preliminary studies suggest that there may be a link between mastitis outbreaks and the amount of time that goats are attached to milking units.Though this may not conclusively prevent cases of mastitis, it is worth further consideration and it may warrant minimizing the time spent hooked up to a milking unit.

, If any of your goats have mastitis, they should not be kept with the rest of the herd. Most sanitation and mastitis-prevention regimens recommend either isolating the affected goats from the herd or culling them to prevent recurring outbreaks."

Cut your 2X8 8' board into 8 equal lengths of 12"" each.,
Screw the feet onto the bottom of the post.,
Create holes to accommodate the jump cups.,
Center the holes.,
Start drilling!,
Apply 2-3 coats white exterior house paint for a polished look.

",How to Build a Horse Jump 1 Pair Schooling Standard," These will be the feet. (If you'd like, cut a triangle off one corner of each board. This creates the fancy tapered look on the feet. It's not necessary, though.);
, To do this, make the end of the first 12"" board flush with the back edge of the post. Then the second 12"" board will butt against the first. And they'll continue around this way, whirly-gig fashion. Use four screws for each foot.

, This is trickier than it may seem! The holes must be *completely level and centered* or your jump cups won't fit. Companies that make jump standards use a drill press which automatically makes a level hole that's centered. But since you're using a hand held drill, you'll need to level the holes manually. First, make sure your post is standing on a level, flat surface. Your post must be as level as possible. Measure up the post 12"" from the ground and make a mark in the center of the post. Using the level, draw a horizontal line through the mark and continue it around all four sides of the post. Repeat this up the post every 3"" until you have 9 lines drawn.

, If you have jump cups, use one as a template to make your hole marks on the lines. If you don't have jump cups, keep reading. Measure in from the right side of the post 1 1/2"" and make an X on the first line. On the opposite side, on the same line, measure in 1 1/2"" from the left side, to give you a straight shot through the post. Repeat the marks up the post.

, When drilling the holes go slowly, aim for the X on the back side to try to stay level, and stop often to check your aim. Chances are you'll mess up on the first few, but you'll get the hang of it.

Set up the trailer.,
Make your trailer look inviting to your horse.,
Prepare your horse for the ride.,
Loading your horse into the trailer.,
Secure your horse inside the trailer.,
Hit the road.",How to Transport a Horse1," Make sure that your trailer is correctly fitted and secured to your towing vehicle is well suited to towing the weight. Run a total safety check, including brake lights, tire pressure and the amount of gas in your tank. Make sure that a cell phone, horse's legal and medical documents and a map or directions are in the towing vehicle. Always be prepared for problems that might occur.;
, Horses are fundamentally claustrophobic and will rarely, if ever, walk into a small dark space. If you have a loading ramp, lower it and sprinkle some bedding over it to make it seem more familiar to your horse. Open wide all other doors and windows to let in as much light as possible. If you can, try to put some hay in a place that is clearly visible to your horse from outside the trailer.

, Always use a breakaway-style halter with a protective head bumper, protect leg wraps with shipping boots. You can brush your horse but it is not necessary. If it is a hot day you may want to put fly spray on your horse so your horse doesn't stomp as much, minimizing the possibilities of injuries. Blanket him if appropriate, keeping in mind that it could be significantly warmer in your trailer than it is outside. If you have windows in your trailer open them, but leave the screen up so the horses heads are not out of the trailer. Be sure to stay calm throughout the process, as your horse will pick up on any stress.

, Lead him calmly up the ramp or up the step and into his individual chute. If he is nervous, have a calm horse go before him or even go in first yourself. The idea is to show him that the trailer is a safe, non-threatening environment. Always make sure the heavier horse or a horse traveling alone is on the drivers side of the trailer. The second or empty space should be on the passengers side. If you have any further issues, consult your trainer or an experienced horse person.

, Close all doors and latch or lock them. Double-check that there is no door or window that could swing our into a neighbouring lane. Never tie a horse while in a trailer, so if the trailer flips, the animal does not snap its neck. Horses should never be able to touch noses while unsupervised in a trailer, this could cause a fight, unless you are positive the horses get along.

, Remember to try to avoid highways and to always drive at or slightly below the speed limit. Keep in mind that any decision you make could put your horse's and your lives at risk. It may help to have another driven in another car behind the trailer so the driver with out the trailer can change lanes behind you leaving you plenty of space to move around.

Perform a safety check on the truck.,
Prepare the horse for the trip.,
Prepare the Truck for travel.,
Load the horse on to the trailer, though take into consideration, that many trucks don’t have spacers of dividers, and multiple horses should be happy to share the close proximity of each other.,
Hit the road.",How to Transport a Horse2," You should ensure that the truck is registered and road legal. A specialised truck mechanic is able to inspect your vehicle, or you can get the vehicle inspected by the Roads and Traffic Authority. You can also do a basic safety check on the truck, you should check the following:-Break lights, Indicator lights, Tire pressure and tire tread, Gas or fuel, Water and any necessary fluid or oil

, Ensure that the horse is ready for the haul, many horses will baulk the first time they travel on a truck, as many are used to the common two and 3 horse floats. Keep everything familiar, by doing the same preparation procedures to what you would do with a horse float. In horse floats, they can become quite warm inside, and horses only require a light travel sheet, however, with trucks, many of them are not fully enclosed and can be quite drafty. This means that a light sheet would probably suffice, but be prepared by having a heavier rug available for when the weather cools down. Travel boots are essential, as the ramps or tailgate of a truck is much steeper and larger than a common horse flat, if a horse was to slip off the edge, worst-case scenario, then the horse would injure its legs. A breakaway halter is best suited for travelling; however, a good quality halter will suffice. You should however, make sure that the lead rope is good quality and longer than a normal lead. Because in Trucks the tie up access loops will be in a different position to a float, (more often they will be higher) a longer lead is needed to ensure the safety and comfort of the horse, however the horse should not be tied.

, If you have a steep ramp or tailgate, then it will be necessary to put some wood shavings on the ramp to make it more inviting and so the horse doesn’t slip. Most trucks will have open rails, or windows for ventilation, open these to make the truck brighter. This will make it more inviting for the horse. Horses are easily bribed by using a feed temptation. To temp stubborn or nervous horses, place a hay net or feed bucket on the floor of the truck. For horses that easily travel and float, simply have a hay net or feed bucket available for the trip. Because most trucks have mechanical ramp devices that can be quite loud and noisy, it is better to lower the ramp prior to the horse coming to the truck, this way, there is a lesser chance of the horse becoming agitated or nervous from the sound. Make sure that you have all necessary equipment for the trip, including:- Registration papers and horse documentation, a first aid kit for both humans and horses, a mobile or cell phone, a torch, spare tyre, mechanical equipment, such as jack, wrench etc. As well as water and food for both parties. Ensure all or most equipment is stored within easy access, such as in the glove box or in the cab.

, If you have a horse that is green to travelling, load an experienced and gentle horse first, the greener horse will get confidence from the first horse, and will be less likely to baulk or become agitated. If you have only green travellers, ensure that the greenest horse goes on first, as if a horse gets agitated, it may spark a chain reaction amongst the other horses. If travelling with multiple horses, load them as normal, but try putting the easier to handle horses towards the rear, if there should be a problem during the trip, you can take them off and you will have less of a problem if you have to stop on the side of a road, because the horses will be easy to handle. Again never tie your horse when in the trailer.

, Many people simply drive away and don’t worry about the load until they get to their destination. If you are travelling for a short time, then this will probably be the case, but if you plan to travel for longer than 2 hours, then it is best to plan for stops along the way. The horses will probably be ok, but if you become tired you may be putting you and your horses in danger. Plan your stops, and if you are going to a show, allow extra time for stops or breaks. If your are travelling extreme distances, make sure that you let your horses off the truck and walk them around, like humans, they need blood flow to the legs and body. If you were to sit for hours on end, you legs may become numb and fall asleep, horses are the same, and require movement for blood flow. You may be fortunate enough to be able to have a stop over at a friend’s house, or at a horse motel, but if not, plan your trip and allow time for stops.

Keep everything familiar, by doing the same preparation procedures to what you would do with a horse float. As with horse floats, the horse can become quite warm inside, and horses only require a light travel sheet, however, Goosenecks can also be drafty if they have open vents rather than closed windows. A light sheet would probably suffice, but be prepared by having a heavier rug available for when the weather cools down. Travel boots are essential; the ramp of a Gooseneck is quite flat with not a steep slope, mainly due to the back also having an additional swing-open door. Take all safety precautions; if a horse was to slip off the edge, worst-case scenario, then the horse would injure its legs. A breakaway halter is best suited for travelling; however, a good quality halter will suffice. Again leave the horse's head free.

, If you have a steep ramp or tailgate or a horse is used to being stabled, then it will be necessary to put some wood shavings on the ramp to make it more inviting and so the horse doesn’t slip. Most Goosenecks will be enclosed, and have windows for ventilation, open these to make the inside brighter. This will make it more inviting for the horse. Horses are easily bribed by using a feed temptation. To temp stubborn or nervous horses, place a hay net or feed bucket on the floor of the Gooseneck. For horses that easily travel and float, simply have a hay net or feed bucket available for the trip. Because a Goosenecks ramp is not very steep, a horse will usually walk on without difficulty, but make sure that the ramp and swing door are opened prior to bringing the horse to the rig. Make sure that you have all necessary equipment for the trip, including:- Registration papers and horse documentation, a first aid kit for both humans and horses, a mobile or cell phone, a torch, spare tyre, mechanical equipment, such as jack, wrench etc. As well as water and food for both parties.

, Before loading the horse, be sure the trailer and tow vehicle are in perfect order.Check for broken rivets or screws or any other sharp metal edges.
Make sure there the floor of the trailer is sound with no rotten spots a horse’s foot might punch through.
Make sure all bolts and fasteners are in good working condition.
Replace or tape down any loose floor mats that might trip the horse.
Check brakes and other mechanics.
Check the hitch to make sure it is functioning properly at both the trailer and tow vehicle ends.
Make sure all taillights and other lights are working

, Having the appropriate emergency gear is crucial even when hauling a short distance.


Human first aid kit which should include bandages, antibiotic cream, pain reliever tablets, scissors, and sterile alcohol wipes.
Horse first aid kit which should include gauze pads and bandages, electrolytes, leg wraps, hoof pick, Phenylbutazone paste (pain reliever), Betadine solution (antiseptic).
Horse blanket.
Fire extinguisher.
Road flares and reflectors.
Fully charged cell phone.
CB radio if possible.
Emergency water for you and the horse (enough for 24 hours).

, Shavings help reduce shock and absorbs moisture from horse urine, helping to keep the trailer floor less slippery.


Use rubber mats to provide additional shock absorption, especially for long distances.Spread shavings on top of the mats.
Straw can also be used but it tends to become more slippery than wood shavings., This might include tack, feed, grooming supplies, and camping gear. While you need to have everything you need, don’t over-pack as this can increase the weight of the trailer significantly making towing more difficult.First aid kits for humans and horses.
Your own clothing and toiletries.
Extra horse blankets and leg wraps.
Mucking items such as a pitchfork and shovel.
Buckets and sponges.
Saddle and other riding gear.
Hay and other feed.
Water (enough for 24 hours).

, Horses have a strong flight instinct and often resist being loaded into a trailer.Start slowly, introducing your horse to the trailer without forcing him to get in. Walk him around and let him check out the trailer.Reward all positive steps towards the goal of loading including sniffing the trailer, not backing away and exhibiting curiosity. Pat or rub him and give verbal encouragement.
Do not use force or violence as this will create a bad association for your horse and make him even more resistant to the trailer.It may take many tries to get your horse comfortable enough to load.
Let him back out whenever he wants to. The goal is make him comfortable and relaxed so that he will load easily.
When the horse loads for the first time do not shut the doors as this may panic him. Once he is completely comfortable, close the butt bar and doors., You want the horse to walk out of the trailer, not bolt.


Use patience when teaching him to back out of the trailer.
Use verbal cues or a small tug on the tail to signal that it’s time to back out.
If he wants to rush out of the trailer, use the lead rope to slow him down.Do not attempt to pull or push the horse.
Do not stand behind the horse.
Untie the horse from the trailer before releasing the butt bar or opening the back door.When he unloads properly, reward him with praise and patting or rubbing.

, Some horses are very resistant to being in a trailer.


Your horse may be afraid of the trailer because of past bad experiences.Ask a horse professional for assistance if your horse is particularly resistant or reacts with violence (such as bolting or rearing).
Do not lose your patience or react with violence as this will exacerbate the problem.

, If you are using a side by side style trailer load the horse in the left hand stall of the trailer, as it will tow more safely if the heavy side of the trailer is in the center of the road. If you are using a slant load trailer load the horse in the front stall; the trailer will generally balance better.It is safest to teach the horse to load on command. However you may need to lead him into the trailer. Ask a friend to help you guide the horse into the trailer and to observe in case of an accident.
You may want to use shipping boots or leg wraps but these may cause sores or loss of circulation if used over a long period of time. Be sure to wrap properly to avoid injury.Use a leather halter as it will break if there is an emergency. If you use a nylon halter make sure it is a break-away., Your horse should be secured in place in the trailer.Use a trailer tie with a quick release snap. Hook it to the tie ring on the halter and the tie ring on the trailer. Remove his lead rope so he does not become tangled in it.
Keep the rope slack. If you tie the horse too tightly, sudden turns will jerk the horse's head around. A slack rope also makes feeding from the hay bin easier.
You also have the option not to tie the horse in the trailer.

, Whether you do or don’t tie the horse, be sure to secure the butt strap and back doors of the trailer.


Make sure all doors are closed and latched. Make sure nothing will fall on or under the horse during transport.

, Do this as needed to keep plenty of air moving through the trailer.Horses release a lot of heat and moisture as they breathe.
Exhaust fumes and ammonia can build up in a closed trailer, causing respiratory distress for the horse.

, Places to check include doors, wheels, and the hitch. Make sure nothing is amiss and no tools, lead ropes, etc. have been left on the ground or trailer fenders, or are leaning on the trailer.

, Take corners, accelerate, and stop slowly and smoothly. Remember that the horse is standing up, trying to keep its balance.


Practice driving the trailer before you try with a horse loaded.
Get used to taking turns slowly and changing lanes gradually., Your horse needs time to rest and unlock its legs.Stop at least every 3-4 hours.
Do not remove the horse from the trailer.
Park in the shade.
Give the horse some water.
Check for injuries and make sure the trailer is still in good condition.

, Choose a good place, away from highways and traffic and set all brakes.Park on a level surface with good footing (preferably not pavement).
Park in the shade if possible.

, Unloading properly is just as important as loading properly to minimize risk of injury to your horse and yourself.


Attach the lead rope and untie the horse from the trailer.
Lower the ramp doors and release the butt bar.
It is safest to teach your horse to back up on command. If you or an assistant enter the trailer to back him out, make sure to speak to him as you approach so he knows you are there.
Back him slowly out of the trailer, making sure there are no obstructions such as the lead rope tangled around his legs.
It may be possible to turn the horse around in a large trailer so he doesn't have to back out.
Never stand behind the horse as he could injure you (and himself) if he decides to bolt out of the trailer.
Once outside, tie him to the trailer or other safe space.
Check for injuries and offer him some water.

Monitor the horse upon arrival.",How to Take Your Horse on a Long Trailer Ride," Check your trailer carefully before completing a long distance trip. Make sure that your trailer is an appropriate size for the horse being transported. For example, a small trailer will be very uncomfortable for a large horse. Inspect the following parts of the trailer before heading out:Tire pressure. Make sure that the tires are full and do not have any holes or punctures. Ensure that the trailer has a spare tire that is easy to access.
Brakes and brake lights.
Taillights. Make sure they are in working condition.
Floor. Make sure it is stable and sturdy and that there are no sharp edges or signs of rusting/wearing on the inside floor of the trailer.
Loading ramp. Ensure it is stable and can support the horse.
Trailer hitch. It is very important that the connection between the truck and trailer is solid so that the trailer does not come detached mid-trip.
Internal partitions. Make sure they are solidly attached and not likely to come loose and fall on the horse during transit.
Door latches and locks. It is extremely important that your doors remain locked and closed during travel as horses can fall out onto the road or highway causing a major accident.;
, In order to reduce pressure on your horse’s joints and feet during travel, you should place a rubber mat down for traction and comfort. You should also cover the bottom of the trailer with bedding. For example, place a thin layer of straw or shavings on the floor of the trailer. This will provide your horse with some added comfort and will soak up any urine or fecal matter.Metal flooring with straw directly on top can lead to slipping and make the horse unstable if the trailer makes a sudden stop.
If your horse is in an open air trailer the bedding may blow around and get into their respiratory tract. In these cases use a minimal amount of bedding.
In a closed trailer you can add more bedding for comfort.

, When travelling long distances with your horse, you should always pack a first aid kit. In case of an emergency, a first aid kit will help to treat your horse while you wait for help. Things to include in a travel first aid kit for your horse:Stethoscope.
Thermometer.
Scissors.
Headlamp.
Bandage material.
Betadine or chlorohexadine scrub and saline.
Antibiotic ointments for wounds.
Electrolytes and/or probiotics.
Any medications or supplements, such as Banamine (to treat Colic).
Do not give medication to your horse without first consulting a veterinarian. Giving pain medication can mask your horse’s symptoms which may make diagnosing the issue more difficult.

, You may want to install a trailer camera in your trailer so that you can watch the horse during transit. This will allow you to monitor your horse’s behavior and will alert you to any potential problems that your horse experiences while traveling. For example, you can watch your horse and see if they are in discomfort or panicking while the vehicle is moving.If you notice your horse’s behavior change, then you may want to stop for a rest and check to make sure everything is alright.

, When you are traveling long distances with your horse, particularly across state or national borders, you may be required to get your horse vaccinated or provide certain paperwork. For example, the most common paperwork required is a health certificate, brand inspection, and a negative Coggins test.Search online to discover the exact papers and vaccines that are required for your planned destination.
Talk with your vet a few months before your trip in order to ensure that your horse has all of the proper medical paperwork necessary for travel.
Keep in mind most health certificates are only good for 30 days so take this into consideration when planning your trip.

, Shipping boots can provide your horse’s legs with protection during transport. They can support the horse’s legs and prevent swelling. Make sure that you remove the boots during long off-load stops, such as overnight. Shipping boots can cause rubs or irritations when applied improperly.Introduce the shipping boots to your horse prior to transport.
Open the boot and wrap around the bottom of your horse’s leg (just above the foot). Do up the middle clasp first, followed by the bottom clasp, and then the top clasp.Make sure you apply the boots to the proper leg (e.g., the right front boot goes on the right front leg).
There are also shipping head and tail protectors available to further protect your horse during transit.

, If your horse is not used to riding in a trailer, you should allow your horse to become comfortable with the trailer by practicing shorter trips. This will help your horse become accustomed to the space and will get it used to loading and unloading as well as balancing. Some of the major concerns when transporting a horse long distances are anxiety and stress. By introducing your horse to the trailer, you can help alleviate stress.It is very important to train your horse to load and unload on your own trailer as well as other types of trailers, if possible. This will make your trips more enjoyable and less stressful.

, Sometimes horses will not drink water with a different taste or smell from the water they normally drink. If you are travelling a long distance and staying away from home for a long time, you may not be able to pack enough water from your home sources. In order to ensure that your horse stays hydrated while travelling, you can try using flavored water.Begin flavoring their water two to three days prior to travel so that they get used to the new taste.
Try flavoring with Gatorade, applesauce, carrot shreds, molasses, or peppermint.You can also make a tea by stirring a handful of sweet feed into the water and allowing it to soak for a while before straining it out.
Experiment until you find a flavor that is irresistible to your horse.
Do not flavor with juices that are high in sugar, such as apple juice.

, Shipping fever is a term used to describe any bacterial respiratory infection and is characterized by a strong cough. Typically, shipping fever occurs as a result of long distance travel among horses who are stressed. Try these tips to reduce your horse’s chance of developing shipping fever:Travel with multiple horses. Even if you only need to transport one horse, you should always bring along another horse to provide company and reduce stress.
Make sure your horse has enough room to drop its head during travel. This will allow it to clear any particulate matter from the respiratory tract.
Take your horse to the vet prior to travel to make sure that it is healthy. If your horse is sick, long travel will likely worsen the illness.
Take your horse’s temperature before you travel that day. Your horse’s rectal temperature should be between 98-101 degrees Fahrenheit (36-38 degrees Celsius).
Make sure that the trailer is well ventilated and that your horse is well fed and watered during transportation.
Give your horse vitamin C or a commercial immune system booster before travelling to help their immune system and prevent shipping fever. Always consult with your veterinarian prior to administering anything to your horse as they may be able to recommend a more effective vaccine or product.

, Long trailer rides can be stressful on the horse. As a result, it is important that you take frequent breaks, typically every two to three hours. While you are driving, your horse is constantly expending energy in an attempt to balance. A break from driving will allow your horse an opportunity to rest. A few things to consider during each break:Park the trailer in the shade and open up windows to allow them to cool off. The trailer can be quite warm so it is a good idea to cool down your horse during breaks.Offer the horse water and replenish their food supply.
Do not offload the horse during a roadside stop. This can be dangerous if you are not familiar with the area and it may be difficult to re-load the horse.
Recheck your trailer hitch, brake lights, and other safety points on the trailer at each stop.
Rest stops should last 30-60 minutes., Throughout the journey you should monitor the health of your horse for signs of stress, colic, or illness. At least twice a day, during a rest break, check your horse’s temperature (normal is 98-101 degrees Fahrenheit or 36-38 degrees Celsius), pulse (normal is 36-44 beats/min.), and respiratory rate (normal is 8-20 breaths/min.). You should also monitor:Hydration: Look at their gums (they should be pale pink and moist) or complete a tent test (squeeze their skin on their neck or shoulders. It should bounce back to normal. If it stays raised it likely means the horse is dehydrated.)
Signs of Colic: See if the horse is showing signs of abdominal pain by pawing, looking at their sides, trying to lay down in the trailer, or won’t eat. If any of these signs are present, consult a veterinarian.
Respiration: Your horse should be taking even breaths at a normal rate, they should not be fast and shallow or slow, very deep and audible. If any of these signs are present, consult a veterinarian.

, Supply your horse with hay during transportation. You should have a hay bag for each horse that is travelling. If your horse is a fast eater, you can use a slow feeder bag to reduce the risk of choking. Supply the same hay that your horse is used to eating at home.Travelling can be stressful on your horse, so it is important to pack enough hay to last the entire trip as well as one to two weeks once you reach the destination.
Give damp hay to a horse during travel. This will reduce the amount of dust in the air and can help prevent shipping fever.
Pre-load a number of hay bags in order to save time during rest stops. This way you can easily replace the bag.

, It may be difficult to provide your horse with water while the vehicle is moving. As a result, you should always offer your horse water during each rest stop. They may not drink water immediately, or at all rest stops, but you should always offer water. It is extremely important that your horse remains hydrated during transport.


Some horses will refuse to drink water that smells or tastes differently than their home water source. Bring a tank of water from home so that your horse can drink from a familiar water source.
If it is not possible to bring a large supply of water from home, then you can try feeding your horse flavored water. You should start this prior to departure so that your horse is accustomed to drinking water that tastes different.

, When you are driving a horse trailer, you need to be extra cautious. Remember that the horse is standing up the entire time trying to balance. You should gradually increase and decrease your speed, navigate corners slowly and carefully, and be aware that your vehicle is much longer and heavier than normal. Try not to use quick movements that could throw the horse off balance.Practice by driving the trailer around empty so that you can get used to the size of the vehicle.

, Your horse should only be trailered for a maximum of 12 hours in a day. If your trip is going to take longer than 12 hours, then you will need to arrange to stable the horse overnight while on-route. They should be removed from the vehicle for at least 8 hours in order to rest. This time is essential for rehydration and will allow them to clear out their respiratory system, helping to reduce the chances of shipping fever.Plan your route in advance and find a location where you can stable your horse.
Many farms will allow you to rent a stable for the night.

, Do this ahead of time, in case you need emergency care during your travel. It will be a comfort to know approximately where the referral hospitals are located in the area and to have contact information for them. At the very least, if something goes wrong you will be able to consult with a veterinarian 24 hours a day., When you are embarking on a long trailer ride with your horse, it is important that you set aside two to three days for recovery following the trip. Some horses, even healthy ones, may develop shipping fever during, or shortly after, arriving at their destination. Your horse should have have a few days rest before attempting any major physical activity.For example, if you are transporting your horse over a long distance to take part in a trail ride, you will want to arrive a few days ahead of the ride to allow your horse a chance to recover from the travel.
If your horse is expected to engage in a performance-based activity, you should give them more time for recovery. Arrive five to six days ahead of a competition date to allow them enough recovery time.

, Once you have arrived at your destination, you should check your horse’s temperature, make sure that it is drinking water, eating, and passing normal urine and manure. If the horse shows any signs of illness, contact a veterinarian immediately.Walk the horse around a small paddock upon arrival. This is so that the horse can stretch its legs.

Food is important.,
Have fresh hay as a free choice.,
Think about a shelter for cold, winter nights even if it's summer.,
Log on to http://caprinesupply.com and look up basic health care products.,
Make sure to have enough feed, water and space for as many goats as you are keeping.",How to Raise Nigerian Dwarf Goats," A good recommendation is to feed the goats Eastern Grass Hay, or Alfalfa mix. Note: If you have wethers and Bucks, that are older, do NOT feed Alfalfa, as it can cause Urinary Calculi. You can also feed kids (0 days-12 month old goats) COB (Corn Oats and Barley) and some Calf Manna. A good place to start is to feed the babies a mix of 2 cup COB and 2 cup Calf Manna, and give them each get a cup of the mix. These are just example measurements, so do research!;
, You can also have a salt-lick block as free choice. Above all, you need fresh, cold and clean water!

, You must clean or ""Muck"" out where they stay at least every day. Shelters that can be enclosed so that nothing but air and light can get through is ideal. Small babies are easy targets for coyotes. Make sure it's warm, dry and comfy so when the weather gets harsh, you are ready.

, If anything goes wrong, you'll have the supplies.

, Only so many acres can support a goat. You don't need spacious acres with lush green pasture and browse running miles long, you just need a pasture, a shelter, nutritional supplies, health supplies and lots of love and compassion for your little bundle(s) of joy.

Maintain the steel pen.",How to Build a Round Pen," A 50-foot (15.24 m) enclosure works well for lunging a horse, but if you plan to ride and train your horse in the pen, you may want to build a round pen with a 60 foot (18.28 m) to 80 foot (24.38 m) diameter.


The most common round pen size is 60 feet in diameter. But you can create a pen that is anywhere from 40 to 120 feet in diameter, depending on how much room you would like for you and your horse.;
, Look for an area that is not prone to flooding. The footing in the round pen should be firm, with good drainage that does not trap water.


If the ground is not level, you can rent a small bulldozer to remove any rocks and level the ground.
You can also try to remove any rocks or debris by hand. It’s important that the area is level and smooth so your horse does not get injured when he walks around the pen., Start at the center of the pen and use measuring tape to create a perfect circle. Be sure to account for the gate in your measurement.


The walls or rail fences of the pen should be at least 4 feet high and have one relatively small gate. The gate should be designed to allow one horse to enter and exit comfortable.

, You can go for a more affordable option of tilling the dirt, or use other material like sand, wood shavings, or shredded rubber, or a combination of materials.To use dirt: Till the soil with a garden tiller, loosening the soil at least 4 inches deep. You may have to till the footing often, as dirt compacts with use and can create a hard top layer that can injure your horse’s legs. Keep in mind that in rainy climates, the dirt will turn to mud and you won’t be able to use the pen if its muddy.
To use sand: Start by adding a layer of gravel. Use a shovel or rake to distribute the gravel. Then, spread a layer of sand on top of the gravel, using the rake. Sand provides good drainage and soft footing. For wetter climates, it's a good option.
To use wood shavings or mulch: Start by adding a layer of gravel. Then, spread a layer of wood shavings or mulch on the gravel. These materials make good footing because they create a cushion over the ground. But if they go too wet, they can become slick. They also tend to break down easily and turn into dirt over time.
To use shredded rubber: Start by adding a layer of gravel. Then, spread a layer of shredded rubber over the gravel. Shredded rubber helps to drain water and provides good footing. But high winds can blow the rubber pieces away in the pen.
To use a combination of materials: Start with a coarse layer, like gravel, to help with drainage. Then, add a finer layer of wood shavings or shredded rubber to prevent the top layer from washing away. Add a cushioning layer made of sand to the top to create good footing for your horse.

, When constructing a pen, you have two options for the pen material:Wooden posts and rails: This is likely your cheapest option, depending on lumber costs at your local hardware store or lumberyard. Wooden rails are flexible, in the event your horse falls against them. But they will break under extreme pressure and may cause injury to your horse if they break. The wider the wood rails are, the safer the pen will be.
Manufactured steel pipe panels: This option is more costly, but the panels are portable, easy to assemble, and can be adjusted in size as necessary. They are also very durable and can withstand a lot of use. But these panels do not “give” if you or your horse falls into them. Most metal panel manufacturers have changed the corner design of the corral panel from rounded to square to prevent a horse from catching a hoof, neck or halter in the gap., The number of posts you need for a given round pen diameter is pi (3.14) times the diameter divided by the distance you want between the posts. Multiplying by 3, instead of 3.14, will give you a rough amount, unless you are making a very large pen.For example, if your pen is 40 feet by 3 feet or a circumference of 120 feet, and you want 9 feet between each post, divide 120 by 9 to get 13.3. So, you would need 13 posts (with maybe one extra post just in case) for the pen.

, Now that you have an idea of how many posts you will need for your pen, go to your local hardware store and pick up:7” diameter treated wooden posts (you may need to go to a lumberyard)
Pressure treated wooden boards (approximately 150 3/4-inch by 6-inch by 16-foot)
Concrete mix (one bag for each post)
A 660’ spool of electric braid
A gasoline driven post hole digger (you can also rent this or dig the holes manually)
Nails
A hammer

, Use the post hole digger to make holes for the gate, based on how wide you want your gate to be. Starting with the gate posts will allow you then work around them as a marker.The holes should be about 2-3 feet deep.
Place the gate posts in the holes, perpendicular to the ground. Then, fill the holes with cement.

, If you have rocky soil, it may be best to have longer intervals between the posts so you have less holes to dig.Place the posts in the holes and fill the holes with cement.

, Make a solid wall by attaching them to the insides of the posts. Stagger the boards on the posts to distribute the pressure evenly. Cut the remaining boards to the height of your fence and nail them vertically to the inside to cover the joins at the posts.


Alternatively, you can create a more open pen by using electric braid instead of wooden boards. Attach 4-5 strands of electric braid between the posts. Depending on how high the posts are, you may use more or less strands of braid.
Be sure to put enough tension on the braid to prevent sagging between the posts.
You may also want to also add a top railing made of wood to the pen to give it a more sturdy appearance.

, You will want a gate big enough for a horse to in and out of the pen, but not large enough for a tractor or multiple horses to pass through.


Make a gate out of wood or wood and braid.
Using the gate posts you built earlier, hang the gate.
Attach a latch made out of wood or braid to the gate.
You can also purchase ready made metal or wood gates.

, If you used pressurized lumber or treated wood posts, they should hold up pretty well. You can also prime, stain, or paint the wood posts and rails to maintain them., To do this, multiply the diameter of the area by 3.14 to determine the pen’s circumference. Then, divide the circumference by the length of the panels you are going to use.For example: if you plan to use 10 foot panels to construct a 60 foot pen, multiple 60 by 3.14 to get a circumference of 188.4. Then, divide 188.4 by 10 (panel length) to get 18.84. So, you will need 19 panels for a slightly larger than 60 foot pen.
If you are going to be adding a separate gate piece, make sure you factor in its length when calculating the overall diameter of the pen.

, Look for panels made of high quality galvanized steel, with a clear coat finish that protects the steel from rusting., Lay them on their sides so that the inside and outside tabs line up with each other.


Some panels have a quick pin latch system with built-in pins. This prevents the pins from getting lost when you move the panels.

, Make sure the tabs are overlapping.

, Continue with the other panels until they have all been mounted.


Many panels will be built with mud legs to prevent them from sinking into the ground.

, If the panels are made of high quality steel with a good coating, they should not fall apart easily. Be wary of rust. If the panels start to rust, paint them with a rust resistant paint.If the panels get dirty, simply wipe them off with a cloth."

Determine how much shelter you need.,
Consider the size of your herd.,
Create stalls.,
Don't forget a fence.,

Buy at least two goats.,
Allow your goat to graze.,
Try alfalfa hay.,
Supplement their diet with grains.,
Provide a plentiful supply of water.,

Bathe your goats only if they get parasites.,
Provide vitamin A. Pygmy goats need vitamin A in their diets to keep up their health.,
Include vitamin D. Just like in humans, vitamin D helps goats absorb calcium, which maintains bone health.,
Add minerals for pasture-fed goats.,
Inject selenium.,
Give vaccinations yearly.Your goat will need to be vaccinated against enterotoxemia and tetanus, at the very least.,
Schedule a yearly checkup.,
Trim your goats' hooves.",How to Care for Pygmy Goats," To make this determination, consider the weather in your area. If you live in a mostly temperate climate, your goats may not need as substantial a shelter as other places. However, if you're in an area that has severe winters, you'll need a full-on barn to protect your animals, though it can be a small one. You just need to provide protection from the elements., The size of your shelter is determined by the size of your herd. In general, you need to provide 15 to 20 square feet for each goat you have.So if you only have one goat, your shelter should be 15 to 20 square feet. In practice, that's a 3-by-5-foot shelter or a 4-by-5-foot shelter. If you have 5 goats, you'll need 75 square feet to 100 square feet, which translates to approximately an 8-by-9-foot shelter or a 10-by-10-foot shelter.
In fact, you can use a large dog house for a pygmy goat if you are keeping it in your backyard., If you have multiple animals, create multiple stalls so each goat has his or her own space. The ideal floor for goats is gravel with clay on top of it. It's easy to clean out, and you can apply another layer every couple of years.Hay is sufficient for bedding, and goats generally won't eat what's on the floor.Also, you'll need troughs of some sort to feed the goats in., The best fences for pygmy goat is wire fence. To keep your pygmy goats from jumping over, the fence needs to be at least 4 feet (1.2 m) high., Goats love to climb, so you'll need to include some places for them to do so. For instance, any kind of picnic table is ideal for this pastime. You can even just create hills out of dirt, as goats will find that just as enjoyable. They also like to jump on and off these places.Old tires also make good toys for your pets.

, Goats are meant to be in a herd, so you should keep more than one. They prefer to live in a social group., Goats can eat grass, brush, and forbs, though they will eat the last two over grasses. Forbs are weeds such as dandelions and clovers. In the summer, goats may be able to subsist solely on pasture if you have enough land.You will need about 1/4 of an acre of land per goat.If you have a herd of goats, you will need several pastures to keep up with your goats' demand. Also, you want rotate where your goats feed so that plants have time to grow back., If you don't have a sufficient pasture for your goat or goats, you can feed alfalfa hay in place of grazing.Each goat will need about a pound or two of feed per day. However, if they are also getting grains, they will need less., In the winter, goats will need more feed. Also, goats that are providing a substantial amount of milk and young goats will need a supplemental diet of grains even in summer.Appropriate grains include corn, barley, and oats., Like all animals, goats need water to live. However, water is especially important to goats, as they are ruminants, meaning it takes more water for them to process their food than other animals.Always ensure they have access to clean, fresh water on a regular basis.


Make sure to clean out the container you use fairly regularly and to change the water often., Use a a sturdier brush to get rid of the more obvious dirt on your goat. Next, use a soft brush (curry comb) to comb through your goat's hair. Also, feel for bumps on your goat as you brush, as those could indicate infections or a cut or scratch.Your goat will not likely need clipping unless you plan to show her., Most of the time, brushing will be sufficient for your goat. To bathe the goat, slightly warm up the water so it's not cold. Lather the goat up with a shampoo meant for animals or goats. Use a washing mitt to help along the process. Rinse off the soap.It makes it easier if your goat has a collar on because it is easier for you to hold on to her., Mostly, they can get this vitamin from green hay or from grazing. However, if you are not supplying either of these, try adding some corn to their diet., If your goats are outside most of the time, they will absorb vitamin D from the sun. However, if they don't get much sunlight, feed them either sun-cured hay (not heat-cured) or irradiated yeast., If your goats are exclusively pasture-fed (rather than alfalfa- and grain-fed), you should add a mix of iodized salt, limestone (ground), and animal bones (steamed and ground).Essentially, you can put this mixture out in its own bucket and let the goats eat it as needed., Selenium is an essential nutrient, but it is especially important if white muscle disease is prevalent in your area, as selenium protects against this disease. When kids are born, you should provide a supplement of this nutrient by needle.This disease calcifies the muscles, making them whitish, which is where the disease gets its name., You can usually buy these at local feed stores and give them yourself. You may also want to ask your vet about rabies shots.You may also want a clostridium CD vaccination., To keep your goat in good health, it's best to schedule a yearly checkup. That way, you can ensure your goat has the proper vaccinations, and you know your goat is in good health., Your goats hooves will grow over time, and if they aren't trimmed, you could end up with goats who can't walk well.To trim them, use gloves, hoof shears, and a hoof knife.Tie or hold the goat. You will need to have someone hold the goat in place while you trim its hooves.Look for the growth rings. You should be able to see where the hooves have grown. Trim back the hooves until they are even with the last growth ring."

Give the horse a bucket of treats each day.,
Gradually move the bucket into the trailer.,
Lead the horse further back.,
Let the horse leave on its own.,
Practice tying the horse up.,
Use extra special treats before traveling.,
Load the horse to the trailer.",How to Train a Horse to Trailer," Drop a few oats into a bucket and leave it at the horse's bedtime stall each morning. Repeat this for several weeks, to get the horse comfortable and excited when he sees the bucket.;
, After several weeks, place the now familiar treat bucket inside the trailer. Leave it about 2 feet (0.6 meters) from the entrance, on the floor. Let the horse approach the bucket on his own.

, Wait until the horse can walk up to the trailer calmly, and repeats this for several days with no signs of fear. Move the bucket into the trailer feed bin where it can be easily seen. Lead the horse up to the back of the trailer.

, During training each day, let the horse leave the trailer when he wants. Stand nearby and talk in a soothing voice. Some horses may take an hour or longer to leave. This takes patience, but will make the horse much more comfortable and cooperative.

, Practice passing the (shortened) lead rope through the open window at the front of the trailer and tying the horse. The rope should be slack, so the horse can turn its head and eat from the feed bag.

, At this point, the horse should practically load itself. When it comes time to travel in the trailer, add some special treats on top of the hay bag, such as slices of apples and carrots.


You can also try this whenever the horse is reluctant to enter during training.

, When it comes time to travel, you'll want to go through extra preparation to make sure the horse is comfortable. If your horse gets skittish about any of this, let the horse adjust on its own.

Test the goat for parasites.,
Record all relevant information.",How to Drench a Goat," There are three main drench types: white, clear, and third generation ivermectin. Many ivermectin drenches are safe to use, and a handful of white drenches are also approved for goats.Most clear drenches use levamisole as an active ingredient and are not licensed for use with goats since this ingredient is generally ineffective.
Always check the label to verify whether or not a specific drench is approved for use with goats, regardless of the type.
Additionally, drenches can be ""broad spectrum"" or ""narrow spectrum."" Broad spectrum drenches are typically best for goats since they treat a wider range of internal parasites, and goats are highly prone to infestation. Narrow spectrum drenches are best used when you only need to treat one specific type of parasite.
If you are uncertain about which drench the choose, talk to your livestock veterinarian for a recommendation.;
, Goats are susceptible to internal parasites throughout their entire lives, so you will need to drench them at regular intervals every summer and autumn.


White drenches that are approved for goats should be administered every four to five weeks.
Ivermectin drenches should be administered every eight weeks.
Also note that newborn goats should typically be drenched one to two weeks after being weaned from their mothers.

, Check the drench gun to make sure that it is capable of delivering accurate doses.Adjust the gun to deliver 10 ml doses, then squirt ten of these 10 ml doses into a graduated cylinder or other calibrated container. Check the receiving container after you finish to verify that it now contains 100 ml of drench.
It is best to calibrate the drench gun with the actual drench instead of substituting water.
You should also test the gun for leaks. Place your finger over the nozzle of the drench gun and try squeezing the trigger. If you're able to depress the plunger, there is probably a leak. If you are unable to do so, the drench gun should be safe to use.

, Drench dosage is always based on weight. If possible, weigh the goat by leading it to a commercial livestock scale and taking an exact measurement.


If you do not have a commercial livestock scale, you can use a bathroom scale. Weigh yourself on the scale first, then pick up the goat and step on the scale again. The difference between your weight and this second weight is the weight of the goat.
When drenching a large herd of goats, separate the goats into smaller sections based on size and weigh four to six goats in each group. Determine the dosage based on the average weight per section.

, The proper dosage will vary depending on the specific drench you use. Read the label instructions that come with the drench to determine how much to give the goat based on that goat's weight.


You'll need to calculate the dose carefully. Giving too little can make the drench ineffective and may cause internal parasites to grow resistant to it. Giving too much can poison the goat, however.
You must also make sure that you follow the dosage rate for goats and not for sheep since the two rates can differ from one another.

, Draw the correct dosage of drench into the gun. Double-check the dosage before grabbing the goat.


You may need to shake the container of drench before loading it into the drench gun. Check the label to determine if this is the case. If so, shake the bottle as thoroughly as possible to mix its contents.
The drench gun should have a dial on the side that allows you to set the dosage. If administering medication to more than one goat, you should check the dial in between drenches to verify that it remains set to the correct dosage.

, Approach the goat from behind and, if possible, use your legs to straddle the neck and prevent the animal from turning its head. Direct the head of the goat so that you have a clear, unobstructed view of the animal's mouth.Goats can be very temperamental and difficult to restrain, so if you can get someone else to help you, doing so is advisable. One person should restrain the goat while the other delivers the drench.
Ideally, the goat's head should be slightly lifted as you restrain it. Do not lift the head by more than 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm), though, since doing so can make it difficult for the goat to swallow.
Make sure that you do not hold the goat's mouth closed as you retrain it, either. You must also keep your fingers out of and away from the mouth to minimize the risk of getting bitten.

, Insert the nozzle of the drench gun into the left corner of the goat's mouth. Try to position the nozzle so that it rests over the base of the tongue and points toward the back of the throat.Do not insert the nozzle into the mouth through the front teeth. Since drench guns are not designed to fit in that position, you will have difficulty properly delivering the drench if you hold the device there.
Avoid positioning the nozzle directly into the throat. If it extends into the back of the throat, it may prevent the goat from swallowing.

, Slowly squeeze the trigger of the drench gun to deliver the measured dose directly over the goat's tongue. Continue holding the goat until you feel the animal swallow the dose.


You need to be firm but gentle. Delivering the dose aggressively can cause the nozzle of the drench gun to cut into the back of the throat. It may also break teeth or redirect the drench into the goat's lungs.

, Once the goat swallows the entire dose of drench, remove the drench gun and release the goat.


Watch the goat for several minutes after releasing it. If the animal spits, coughs, or vomits any of the drench, it will not have received the full dosage. Check the product label to determine if a second partial dose can be administered.
If you do not wait for the goat to swallow the drench, the animal will probably spit it out or allow the medication to spill out. You must wait until the goat swallows before letting it go.
When drenching more than one goat, make sure that the treated and untreated goats remain separated throughout the procedure to prevent accidental overdoses.

, Depending on the exact drench used, you may need to withhold or reduce food for 12 to 24 hours after administering the medication.


This is especially common with white drenches but may not be necessary for many ivermectin types. Regardless of the type, though, you should check the drench instructions for more specific information.

, If drenching a dairy goat, you should check the label of the drench to determine how long you must wait before milk from that goat is safe for human consumption.


Some white drenches have a fairly brief withholding time, but with many third generation ivermectin types, the wait time can be as long as 28 days.

, If possible, release drenched goats onto clean pastures to avoid the risk of re-contamination.


Consider using a pasture previously grazed by cattle and horses since these animals do not share many of the same parasites goats are prone to catch. Avoid pastures used by other goats or sheep, though.The best pastures will also have plenty of space and grass taller than 1.5 inches (4 cm) high.

, After you finish drenching your goats, you should clean the drench gun and store it in a safe, sanitary place. Store any unused drench, as well.


Clean the drench gun by rinsing the gun and pipe with warm water. Do not use any soap.
Unused drench should be stored in temperatures between 39 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit (4 and 25 degrees Celsius). Keep it away from direct sunlight.

, Seven to ten days after drenching the goat, check for the presence of parasites by delivering a fecal sample to your livestock veterinarian.


Your veterinarian should be able to test the sample for parasite eggs. If the drench was effective, there should be no eggs present in the sample.
If there are eggs, then the drench was ineffective. Talk with your veterinarian to determine what may have gone wrong and how to remedy the problem.

, Each time you drench your goats, you should mark down the date and dosage amount in an official record book.


Also make a note of the specific drench used and any expected withdrawal period. The withdrawal period varies depending on the drench and dosage.

Purchase treated wood.,
Sink two sturdy posts into the ground.,
Build a wooden gate.,
Attach the gate to one gatepost.,
Attach the rope or latch.",How to Build a Horse Fence Gate," Choose a sturdy, weather-resistant wood. You'll need two gateposts, plus enough wood to build your gate.


For a typical horse, each post should be at least 8 feet (2.4 meters) long, so it stands about 5.3 ft (1.6m) above the ground.
For tall draft horses or jumpers, each post should be 12 ft (3.7m) long, and stand about 8 ft (2.4m) above the ground.
See below for more information on gate styles. The length of the beams depends on how wide you want your gate to be.;
, Sink these posts at least a third of the way into the ground, using a post hole digger. Once the posts are sunk, soak surrounding dirt with water to help the dirt settle more firmly around the post.


Shovel extra dirt on the top of the wet hole to put more weight on the sinking dirt.

, A typical wooden gate consists between three and six horizontal bars, plus two vertical beams at either end. You may use more bars for a larger horse, or to prevent the horse from sticking its head through the gaps and tearing its mane. To reduce warping over time, you may nail additional beams in an X shape over the bars if necessary.


The top of the gate should stand about halfway up the horse's neckline. Use a taller gate if the horse is a jumper.
Make sure all screws and nails are tight enough that the horse can't loosen them by scraping. You don't want your horse to get cut when scratching the gate.

, Weigh the gate first, then purchase door hinges rated to support more than that weight. Drill sturdy screws through the hinges and into gatepost, preferably with a nut on the other side.


Now's a good time to check the gate for sagging or skewing. Use stronger hinges or adjust the position of the hinges if you notice any problems.
You may also prop the gate up with steel cable and a turnbuckle. This makes the gate easy to open and close. The gate will also be less likely to sag and easy to adjust if it does.

, The simplest closing mechanism is a sturdy rope or chain, just long enough to loop over the fence and tie the gate closed. Latches are more convenient, but the horse must not be able to nudge it open with its head. Use two latches for more protection, or cover the latch with a horizontal barrier that makes it difficult for the horse to reach.

Choose a breed.,
First look for local goat dairies, or attend a local fair or 4-H show to talk to a knowledgeable goat owner.,
Goats need a shelter as well as some open space outside to roam around in.,
Be sure you have a secure location for them that will protect them from the elements.,
Provide some type of bedding.,
Now on to the breeding.,
Consider renting a buck for your goat.,
Be sure your doe is in standing heat.,
Don't breed them too young.",How to Raise and Breed Milk Goats," Dairy goats come in both full size and mini varieties. Full size breeds include Nubians, Lamanchas, Saanens, Toggenburgs and Alpines, while mini breeds include Nigerian dwarf and Nigerian Dwarf crosses. Each breed has its own characteristic temperament, appearance, and milk production.;
, It is always good to have a local mentor who can help you pick out and prepare for your new goats.

, You will need items such as: wood,tin,nails,lights for safety precautions, gates, doors, T-posts, Corner posts, staples, a very good gutter system. Fencing options such as Hog wire , Electric wire, Stock panel, Chain-link. Goats are extremely good at escaping from enclosures so fences should be at least four feet tall and/or electrified. Goats can be tethered instead of fenced but this is generally not recommended due to safety considerations.

, There are a wide variety of buildings not even for that specific purpose. The most common lean-to shelters might be even and old chicken coop and run,an old horse barn, garages,sheds really goats aren't all that particular in reality. Flooring for the shed could be wood,concrete, dirt, sand, or gravel.

, The bedding can be anything that can soak up urine and feces is acceptable and also easy to clean. such as: peat moss,chopped oat straw,long straw,wheat straw,wood shavings.

, A goat obviously needs to be bred to produce kids--and milk.

, Leasing a buck offers many advantages such as: good breeding lines in some cases,good kids with good potential milk records.

, A doe will usually be in standing heat for about a full 24 hours, but will also come back into heat in about 21 days if the breeding session is missed.

, Doelings are sexually mature at three to four months old but should not be bred then but it should be postponed until she is at least seven months old or weighs about 70-80 pounds. Bucklings are sexually mature at two to three months old. Gestation in goats is five months. If you live in a cold climate, be sure to time the breeding so that kidding occurs during one of the warmer spring months.

Provide a good space for them.,
Provide good shelter from the rain and cold.,
Provide appropriate food.,
Provide clean water every day.,
Spend time around your goats.,
Keep the goats groomed well.,
De-worm regularly.

,
Ensure that the goats are appropriately vaccinated.

",How to Care for Miniature Goats," Although they do not need as much space as their larger relatives, they do need at least 6 metres x 6 metres / 20 x 20 feet and should be fenced off to prevent roaming. In addition, keep the fencing at least 1.5 metres / 5 feet high to prevent predators entering, such as dogs or foxes.;
, Goats do not like being wet or windblown and should be given a good shelter to get out of the elements. Any small type of shelter should be suitable, provided that you allow enough room for the amount of goats you have. Keep the interior clean and use fresh straw as bedding inside.

, Good pasture is a priority and should be supplemented with hay, grain and vegetables.Keep hay feeders above the ground to prevent infection from parasites. You may also want to keep the grain in a large garbage can, preferably metal, as rats or mice may get into the grain.

, As with all animals, fresh water is important part of a daily diet.

, Miniature goats are very affectionate. They enjoy interacting with humans and are commonly found in zoos owing to their love of being around people and getting lots of pats! In particular, miniature goats enjoy being brushed..

, Trim hooves at least every four months.

Prepare some pasture space.,
Build a shelter.,
Put up a strong fence.,
Provide entertaining objects.,
Bring your goats home.,
Keep does and bucks separate.",How to Care for Nubian Goats1," Before you consider the purchase of one or more Nubian goats, it is important to ensure that you have adequate space for them. These animals require about 200 square feet of pasture space per goat.Ideally, this space should contain grass, bushes, and other plants the goats can eat.
Keep in mind that goats are vocal animals. While Nubian goats are not the loudest of all breeds, they can be vocal, especially during certain times of the year.You may want to consider this in deciding how close to your home you will raise your goats.;
, Nubian goats are a hearty breed that is less sensitive to heat and cold than some other goats. Even so, they'll need a warm, dry, and well ventilated area to protect themselves from the elements.Your shelter should provide at least 25 square feet of space per goat. There should be plenty of clean, dry straw for bedding.Dirt floors are preferable to wood. When wood floors get wet, they can be a slipping hazard for goats.

, Like most goats, Nubians are natural escape artists. This means you'll need a strong fence to keep them in.Build your goat paddock with fences at least four feet tall.Woven wire and ""no climb"" horse fencing work well. Fence material with square holes is not ideal, as goats can sometimes get their heads caught in the fence.You'll need to walk the fence line regularly to check for damage and holes the goats might start digging to get under the fence.
Do not tether your goats. This can cause stress and in some cases fatalities as goats can strangle themselves attempting to escape the tether.

, Nubian goats are curious and playful. Make sure their space contains objects that they can entertain themselves with.Good choices include stacks of straw bales they can knock over, old tires, and piles of rocks.

, Once you've prepared an adequate home for your goats, find a breeder or other seller online. Purchase your goat or goats, and bring them home.


Make sure you have a trailer or large truck bed with a covered roof to transport your goat safely and securely.
There are many breeders of these goats all around the country.Shop around for a good deal on a healthy goat.

, If you have both bucks and does, you'll need to house them separately, due to the bucks' aggressive nature. This is doubly true if you don't want lots of baby goats. Your bucks may also require stronger fencing material to keep them in.Keep in mind also that bucks emit a powerful odor during breeding season that is attractive to Nubian does but unpleasant to most people. If you are keeping bucks, consider keeping them further from your home.

"
Have the trailer ready.,
Keep your horse close to you.,
Walk into the trailer or lean on it showing the horse that you are calm, and totally relaxed - there is nothing to be afraid of.

,
Place the horse directly in front of the trailer.,
Keep your horse calm.,
When the horse is in the trailer, calmly speak to it and move towards the back and close the tail bar.,
Watch for problems.,
Double-check for safety.",How to Load a Horse on a Trailer1," Have the trailer set up in a secure location where the horse can feel comfortable to enter. Ideally, use a spot where you have practiced loading and unloading previously, and that is quiet and calm.;
, Use a well-secured lead rope and lead your horse toward the trailer. Present yourself confidently and without fear or anxiety.


If your horse begins to get nervous when you near the trailer, stay calm and walk your horse in loops near or around the trailer to get him used to seeing it.

,, Walk beside the horse and as you walk, you should be in one barrier and the horse in the other.


Use the ‘go forward’ command, if your horse knows it.

, Always watch your horse's behavior when loading. If he appears skittish, try tactics that will calm him down and then re-approach the trailer.


For horses that are difficult you may consider trying restraints on the horse such a rump rope, twitch or war bridle. Some trainers use “butt ropes” at the back of the horse that prevents the horse from backing out of the trailer. Be warned, however, that this might cause panic or distress, and it is better not to use them. Sometimes food may be placed just out of reach to motivate the horse to enter the trailer. Try carrots, apple chunks, etc.

, Once this is secured, raise the tailgate and go to horse and secure inside.

, If your horse is colicky or sick, then normal methods of persuasion may not work when loading your horse. Always look for general signs of good health in your horse and be wary of issues such as illness or injury.

, Before you travel, you should always check to see if everything is secure. Make a checklist and walk through it to make sure you and your horses are ready to travel. Consider checking:


Is the horse secure?
Does the horse seem calm enough to travel?
Is the horse relaxed around and in the trailer?
Is the tack secured and not likely to move during transport?
Is the gate securely locked and closed?
Is the trailer secure to the vehicle?

Prepare to load two horses together.,
Load the other horse into the trailer first, making sure to tie him or her before leaving.,
Come back for your horse next, and be patient.,
If your horse loads, tie him/her up and close the trailer.,
Unload your horse's friend first, and then your horse.,
Work your way towards solo travel.",How to Load a Frightened Horse Into a Horse Trailer1," If your horse is of the trusting nature, having a friend might help him or her load. If you don't have a trailer that accommodates two or more horses, ask around your barn to see if you can borrow someone's for a few hours.;
, It's best to use a horse that loads well into trailers, so your horse will see that his/her friend isn't frightened.

, Even though she/he sees a friend, s/he may not be too trusting. Walk up patiently, and reward every step forward with a praise.

, It's best not to quickly unload your horse, as they will expect that to be normal. Close the trailer and leave your horse and his/her friend in there for a bit before unloading them.

, Make sure to give your horse a treat or praise, so they know that they did the right thing by loading and unloading. If you wish to try again, let him/her have a few minutes to calm down

, If you want to try this exercise again, try it without your horse's friend, with your horse's friend loading second, or with your horse's friend tied to the outside of the trailer. Your horse can't always travel with a buddy, so be sure to wean him/her off loading with one, so they don't freak out when it comes time to inspect it.

Be aware of the gestation period for a doe.,
Look at the doe's size.,
Do a ""pooch test"".,
See the vet or rather, have the livestock vet drop by the farm.,
Check for mood swings.,
Check for stringy mucus.,
Check the udder.,
Take note of bleating and searching.,
Ensure that the pregnant doe is well cared for.,
Feed the goat appropriately.,
Ensure that the doe has adequate access to shelter throughout the pregnancy.,
Rid the doe of any internal parasites.",How to Tell if a Goat Is Pregnant," Generally, five months is the length for a goat pregnancy.Figure around 145 to 155 days as normal for the gestation period., Realize that this eyeballing test doesn't work with all goats and in fact, some does can look wide and therefore pregnant, and not actually be pregnant.However, in some cases, the size of the doe will indicate that pregnancy is well underway and, along with other pregnancy signs, can confirm pregnancy.


Note that the doe's abdomen usually won't look larger until around three months of gestation., This refers to checking the area of the doe's vulva and anus to see a shape change.Lift up the tail to check. It does help if you've checked either pre-pregnancy or in the first month, so that you know what looks ""normal"" and have a comparison image (yes, do take a smartphone picture to help you). About two to three months after conception, check this area again. If the doe is pregnant, the anus will drop away from the tail area and the vulva will appear longer, like a teardrop.However, as with looking at the goat's belly size, this is subjective and based on good observation skills.

, The vet can do a blood test to check. However, goats can show a false positive and this may be accompanied by an increased belly.If you want absolute certainty, ask the vet for an ultrasound. Since this is costly, not many breeders indulge in this unless absolutely necessary.

, The doe may act up and seem grumpy or cranky when closer to the due date for kidding., Some does produce this, some don't. If you see it coming out of the back of the doe, this suggest that labor may occur any time within a few hours to a few days., This tends to increase in size close to kidding time.It may only do this several hours before kidding, depending on the goat as an individual and its breed. The udder may seem very solid and shiny when the kids are close to arrival., This is an innate action of looking for the kid or kids, even though they're yet to be born.If the doe is wandering around bleating either softly or loudly and looks as if she's looking for something, it's time to get her ready for the birthing.


Note that twin kids are normal, as opposed to a single kid., A pregnant doe must not be stressed; if she experiences any stress, she may abort the kids.,


First three months: Maintenance rations are fine.
Near full term: Supply half as much feed again.
Give vet approved concentrates for extra energy, especially if the doe needs to stay warm., This is especially important if it's winter.

, Use an appropriate worming paste or formula your vet has recommended to you.

Provide a constant source of water.,
Feed your goats browse.,
Feed your goats forage.,
Supplement their diet with pellets.,
Provide mineral supplements.,
Avoid poisonous plants.",How to Care for Nubian Goats2," A goat's water needs will vary from one season to the next. Be certain that your goats have a source of water at all times.Use heavy containers for water, as goats have a tendency to knock them over otherwise.
You may wish to consider an automatic watering system to reduce waste.

, The primary component of a Nubian goat's diet is a class of plants called ""browse."" Shrubs and bushes are ""browsing"" plants (as opposed to grazing plants such as grass).If there aren't already browsing plants growing in your goats' area, feed them browse you've gathered from elsewhere. Good choices include:Brambles
Blackberry bush
Ivy leaves and vines (not the flowers or berries)
Nettles
Thistles

, In addition to browsing, goats will also need to eat what is sometimes called ""forage,"" i.e. mixed grasses and clover.You can allow your goats to graze naturally in their paddock for grasses (and should do so for at least eight hours a day), but should also feed them high quality hay such as clover and alfalfa., Especially during the winter months when their pasture area may not grow as much wild food, you may wish to supplement your Nubian goats' diets with commercially available goat feed pellets.This is especially important if you are raising your goats for milking.
It is easy overfeed with pellets, which can cause your goats to become obese. Feed your goats according to package instructions, and do not overfeed.
If you notice your goats gaining weight, consider switching out your pellets for a variety formulated to prevent obesity, such as DuMor.

, To stay healthy, goats require certain minerals in their diets which are not always available in browse and forage they eat. This is especially true in the winter months.You may need to provide supplements.


Goats can develop health problems if they become deficient in selenium or magnesium.
You can provide your goats with commercially available mineral blocks that can help them get the nutrients they need. Note that mineral blocks formulated for sheep do not contain copper, which goats do need., Goats will eat a wide variety of wild plants, but some of these can be poisonous to them. Make sure your goats' pasture areas do not contain any plants that can poison them, such as:Azalea
Daisy
Rhubarb
Daffodil
Lilac
Laurel
Pine
Tomato
If you believe your goat has eaten something poisonous, call a vet immediately.

Keep their area clean.,
Trim their hoofs.,
Vaccinate your goats.,
Handle your goats with care.,
Watch out for common health problems.",How to Care for Nubian Goats3," Like any animal, Nubian goats require some cleaning up after. There are two common approaches to this:Daily cleaning. Clean the manure out of your goat enclosure every day.
A deep-litter system. Cover the manure with fresh straw on a regular basis, and do one deep-cleaning every summer. This approach is smellier but provides additional heat in the winter as the manure decays and can also reduce flooding inside your barn.

, Nubian goats need their hoofs trimmed about four times a year. Don't attempt this yourself until someone has shown you how to do it, or you may injured your goats.A veterinarian can show you how to carry out this relatively simple procedure using a hoof trimmer, commercially available from most farm stores., Nubian goats should be vaccinated against several different common diseases. Among these are rabies, tetanus, and clostridium (CTD).Talk to your vet about the correct schedule for these vaccinations.
The rabies vaccine is particularly hard on goats. Give this vaccine at least a month apart from the others.

, When you have to handle your goats (e.g. for vaccination or inspection), do so calmly and gently so as not to spook them.If need be, you can restrain your goat with a rope harness during handling. Bucks can also be restrained by holding their horns, though this requires a second person.

, Although Nubian goats are a hearty breed, any goat is susceptible to a variety of illnesses including upper respiratory problems, parasitic infections, bloat, sore mouth, and hoof rot. Keep an eye out for any of the following symptoms:Loss of appetite and/or sudden weight loss
Limping
Listlessness
Labored breathing
Diarrhea
Discharge from the eyes or nose
Abnormal body temperature
Visible abscesses
Contact your vet immediately if you note any of these symptoms.

Avoid certain foods.,
Introduce bucks in the fall.,
""Dry off"" pregnant females.,
Create a birthing stall.,
Separate babies.,
Milk the goats.",How to Care for Nubian Goats4," If you are planning to milk your goats, you should avoid feeding them certain foods that can ruin the taste of their milk. Among these are:Alfalfa
Turnips
Mustards
Cabbage
Marigolds
Kale
Ragweed
Wild garlic, onions, carrots, and lettuce

, Goats only produce milk after giving birth. The female Nubian goat comes into her mating season in late summer and fall. During this period, introduce bucks to the females.A female will be receptive to male goats when in heat. You will be able to tell a female is in heat because her vulva area will swell slightly, and may leak fluids. She may also become extra affectionate.A female will need to be ""freshened"" annually by becoming pregnant to continue producing milk.
A female Nubian goat may go into heat more than once year, depending on the climate in your area.
Bucks can be a real handful to transport and care for. If you don't want to keep any yourself, you can often pay to have your female bred to studs owned by someone else.

, If your female goat is already lactating, you will need to stop her milk production after she becomes pregnant so she can dedicate her nutritional resources to the pregnancy. This process is called ""drying off.""Drying off is achieved by gradually extending the time between milkings. Start this process about 60 days into the pregnancy. If you are milking every 12 hours, which is typical, extend the time to 13. The next day, extend to 14, then 15 and so on until the female stops lactating., When the female is very close to birthing, typically in January, put her in a birthing stall. This is a comfortable, private stall she can give birth in without being bothered.Fill the stall with fresh straw and provide a heat lamp so the goat can be warm and comfortable.

, The female goat will typically give birth to two to five babies. They should be separated from the mother and fed a diet of pasteurized goat milk to prevent a disease called caprine arthritis encephalitis, or CAE.When the babies are able to fend for themselves, you can introduce them to your herd, or sell them to someone wanting to start their own goat herd.

, Milking goats is a simple process of rhythmically squeezing the teats from top to bottom to force out the milk.This should be done about every 12 hours.


Most goats should be milked for about a minute and a half each time. It may take up to five minutes if you are having trouble getting the milk out.
Make sure to milk your goats in a clean, dust-free environment, such a special milking room.
You can also milk your goats using a vacuum milking pump.

Gain your horse’s trust.,
Get your horse used to the trailer.,
Adapt your body language.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Teach the ""go forward"" command.,
Be patient.",How to Load a Horse on a Trailer2," To make loading as not stressful as possible, build trust with your horse. You want to make loading something that is a safe experience that can be done with ease. Practice these steps to gain trust in your horse.Be responsible for your horse's actions. Often, your horse's actions (or reactions) can be attributed to your leadership. For example, if your horse is spooked easily, you may be giving off body language that triggers the horse to get scared. If your horse is lazy, you may not be giving confident instructions to your horse.
Establish a healthy relationship with rules. You should be kind to your horse, but still have established boundaries.You do not want your horse to develop bad habits because of ill-established rules. For example, practice grooming or touching your horse. If you notice your horse is uncomfortable with you touching or grooming a particular spot (for example, his hoof), then proceed at the horse's pace until a routine and boundary is set. This helps to establish trust and a routine.
Be consistent. You do not want to send mixed signals to your horse. Always be consistent in behavior and rules. This will help establish continuity and patterns. The more you practice anything, the easier it gets!
Redirect, do not punish. You want to use positive reinforcement when working with your horse. If your horse does something you do not like, do not hit or punish it. This will establish mistrust, fear, or anger. Instead, redirect the horse into a behavior that you want to see. For example, if your horse is hesitant to do something, do not hit it. Instead, work with the horse to assuage its fears or discomfort.

, Trailers are not something that are natural for horses; they are closed off spaces where a horse cannot easily escape.Therefore, do not expect your horse to naturally love the trailer. Instead, let him get used to it on his own time. Consider:


Putting the trailer somewhere your horse can interact with it on his own time. If you leave the trailer in a grazing pasture, for example, he can encounter it when he wants and become used to it.
After the first few days, when the horse no longer seems to care about it being there, start feeding it in the trailer. Start by putting the feed in a bucket inside the door with the ramp down and the doors open. Secure the trailer if you can so that the horse doesn't just dump it. Place the food further and further in each day. Just let the horse go in on its own and exit on its own when the horse has done eating. When the horse is comfortable with this, start closing the ramp while it eats. Have a hay bag available in there, too.
Practice walking near the trailer, touching it, interacting with it while your horse is near. Instead of loading your horse as soon as you get a trailer, practice interacting with the trailer around your horse without actually loading him in. Get your horse used to seeing you act naturally and comfortably with this piece of equipment.

, If your horse trusts you, then how you interact with the trailer will signal to the horse how he should interact with it. Do not get frustrated or angry at features of the trailer. Do not be intimidated by using it.


Practice using the trailer on your own before even bringing the horse into the picture. Get used to its features so that you can confidently use it and focus on loading your horse.

, Apply positive reinforcement when working with your horse.In each step of the loading process, let the horse know what he is doing right and well. You can do this in a number of ways:


Presenting small treats when he does something right.
Always verbally giving good cues: “Good work!” “Good boy.”
Giving comforting touch/pets.

, When approaching the back of the trailer and getting the horse in position to load, tap the horse on the rump/upper hip to give it the “go forward” command. You will want to give clear direction to your horse that you want him to move and load himself.


When tapping the horse to move forward, you can use a positive sound to let your horse know that you want him to move forward. For example, you can use a “kiss” sound or a click to indicate you want your horse to move forward.As soon as your horse begins to move, stop the tapping to signal you want him to continue to move forward.
You can repeat the load and unloading process with the ‘go forward’ cue until your horse becomes comfortable with this procedure.
Remember to reward your horse every time he makes a positive effort to load or unload. This will establish a good rapport and making loading a habit.

, All of this will take time. It will take work. There will be some hardships and mistakes. The important thing to remember is to be patient and to keep working toward your goals. Practice makes perfect!

Use a close lead rope.,
Avoid using whips or stud chain.,
Pick the right trailer.,
Consider size.,
Learn to secure the trailer properly.",How to Load a Horse on a Trailer3," Your goal should be to lead the horse calmly, not to drag the horse to the trailer. Use a short rope and a firm hand and walk your horse.Do not drag or pull the horse; instead, be relaxed and calmly walk toward or around the trailer.


Your horse can read your body language and your frustration. If you are frustrated or angry at the horse, he will pick it up and be more likely to panic or disobey.

, You do not want to associate pain or fear with loading. For that reason, avoid using equipment that your horse may fear or distrust. This may include:


stud chains
new people
ear pulls
force
multiple ropes
fly masks

, You want a trailer that is secure and safe, but also will not scare your horse. Pick a trailer that is large and has open windows. Your horse will be less likely to load if the inside of the trailer is closed off and dark. Consider these trailer features when loading:Step up -- These are the most traditional trailers and may work well with loading because they are so straightforward to use. This requires the horse to simply step up and into the trailer. However, this may present challenges when unloading as it may cause the horse’s hind legs to slip when backing out.
Loading ramps -- Using a ramp on a step up trailer may solve some of the problems of an uneasy unload. However, they can be slick and steep. When looking to purchase or use a loading ramp, consider one that is a low and gradual slope. Pick one with a non-slick surface and easy to lift and use.
At a slant -- Slant-load trailers allow the horse to turn around inside to be led out. This may make it an easier and calmer experience when unloading the horse head first. These trailers are often designed to load multiple horses. This may be problematic if the first horse to be loaded has a problem, as all the horses must be unloaded in order to get to the first horse.
Straight shot -- This type of trailer is generally used for two horses and a single horse can be unloaded without removing or bothering the other. These trailers usually include longer stalls to give horses more room. Some believe this type of trailer is the most comfortable for horses, especially for larger breeds.

, When choosing a trailer, it is important to consider not only the type but also the size. Modern trailers are generally larger than more classic trailers. The interiors are usually 6 ft wide and more than 7ft tall, compared to the older 5ft wide by 6ft tall.Depending on how many horses you intend to board or what comforts you are looking for, there are number of different designs out there. For example, you can buy trailers that have small apartments attached.

, You must learn to use the trailer properly for the safety of you, your horse, and your tack.Look for safety features in a trailer when purchasing or borrowing. Consider:


The suspension
Load balance
General condition of the trailer (cracks, rust, damage, etc)
Indicator and hazard lights
Closing and securing mechanisms
Structural integrity of the flooring

Find a treat your horse loves.,
Let your horse get a good whiff of your treat of choice, then place said treat into the trailer.,
If you choose to put the treat into the trailer, make sure to keep a handful or pocketful of it to feed to your horse as s/he loads, as praise for doing the right thing.

,
If your horse properly loads, let him/her have the rest of the treat as a reward, then leave him/her in there after closing the trailer for a few minutes.,
Unload your horse and give him/her a good pat on the neck.,
If you want to try this exercise again, try only having treats when they properly load or only after they have successfully loaded and unloaded.",How to Load a Frightened Horse Into a Horse Trailer2," Horses are very motivated by food, so try that to get him/her loaded. This method works best with sweet feed or grain, but hay will work too.

, You can also hold the treat in your hand as you enter the trailer, to keep your horse motivated.

,, It's best not to quickly unload your horse, as they will expect that to be normal.

, If you wish to try again, wait a few minutes to let them calm down.

, Giving your horse treats every time you load is fine, but you also want to encourage them to do it one their own.

"
"
Know that you can't just expect your horse to do what you tell them when you tell them if the result is often negative.,
Walk into the trailer and ask your horse to follow.,
Praise each step forward.,
If your horse successfully loads, make sure to tie him/her up and close the trailer, so that they do not automatically equate loading with getting out.

,
If you wish to try this exercise again, give your horse a few minutes before reloading.",How to Load a Frightened Horse Into a Horse Trailer3," Trailers are an unfamiliar place where your horse experiences rocking, odd movements, and general insecurity.

, Avoid entering the trailer before your horse does, if possible. It may sometimes be necessary. Horses are herd animals and, by instinct, will follow someone or something that they trust.


Your horse may balk at loading, but hold firm and do not let your horse back up.
Eventually, your horse will get tired of you putting pressure on his/her halter that s/he will move forward a few steps. Horses don't like pressure and, while you should never be trying to pull your horse's head off, gently pulling on the halter is enough of a nuisance that they will try to relieve the pressure.

, Your horse should know that by moving into the trailer, they are doing what you want and should be rewarded.

,, Practicing will make perfection, and your horse should be a pro by the time you're finished

Consider your budget.,
Consider the size of trailer.,
Consider how much you'll use the trailer.,
Consider your towing vehicle.,
Consider the condition of the trailer.,
Consider the needs of the horse.,
Consider how safe the trailer is.",How to Buy a Used Horse Trailer,"


Budget is probably going to be the most limiting factor in buying a used horse trailer. How much you have to spend is going to narrow your choices. If budget is not a concern, then you can buy a horse trailer with all sorts of modern features such as dressing rooms, interior lighting, padded dividers and more. A lower budget might limit your choice to a horse trailer that is structurally sound, but not very attractive. Less money can also get you a stock trailer; they're not designed specifically for horses (lower height) but they are less expensive, and do the job.;
,


Horse trailers come in a variety of sizes to accommodate shipping a number of horses. The smallest trailers will ship 2 horses, while the largest can ship 6 horses. Professional horse movers can accommodate many more horses, but they are pulled by a tractor trailer designed for hauling very heavy loads.

,


If you're going to be trailering every weekend, then it might be worth spending a bit more on a used or even a new trailer, if your budget allows. If you are going to be showing, then having a trailer with a built in dressing room can be very convenient. At the very least, you will want a trailer with some front storage to carry your tack (saddles and other equipment.) If you will only be using the trailer periodically, then a structurally sound but no-frills trailer may be more practical.

,


Trailers have different hitching mechanisms. Three common types are goose neck, 5th wheel and bumper pull. Both a gooseneck hitch and 5th wheel hitch mount in the bed of a truck but the difference here is the fifth wheel hitch mounts above the bed whereas the gooseneck hitch mounts level with the truck's bed and utilizes a mounted ball for towing. Make sure that your hitch is equipped to tow the horse trailer you choose, along with the weight of the animals. A 2-horse trailer (3400 lbs) and 2 large horses (1300 lbs each) can reach 6000 lbs. Experts recommend only towing up to 2/3 of your vehicle's rated towing capacity, so a vehicle rated to tow 9000 lbs would be appropriate to haul a 6000 lb load.

,


Once you've determined your budget and your trailer needs, you can begin to look at the overall condition of the trailer. A used trailer must be structurally sound. There should be no damage or wear to the floor of the trailer, and the electronics (brake lights and so on) should be in good condition and working properly. The trailer should have a functioning breakaway system which will apply the trailer's brakes in an emergency if it becomes disconnected from the tow vehicle. The suspension and tires should also be in good condition. Always check to make sure you have a full sized correctly inflated spare. If you don't know what to look for, consider asking your car or trailer mechanic to take a look at the trailer.

,


Horses do not like to be trailered. Some horses will tolerate it, while others strenuously object. The larger the interior and the better lit and ventilated it is, the more at ease your horse will be. In addition, there are step up and ramp access trailers. Most horses load more easily onto ramp mount trailers. The walls, back door and dividing bars should be adequately padded to protect the horse. The halter mount should be long enough to allow the horse some head movement to expel dust and other contaminates but not too long to be caught up in a leg or hay net. The larger the horse, the more interior room they'll need. Interior latches, breast bars, dividers and latches should all be in good condition with no sharp edges or protruding parts.

,


Besides being safe for the horse and structurally sound, the safest horse trailers are those with a rubber torsion suspension. With these trailers, neoprene cords absorb about 97 percent of the road shock, meaning less stress on the horse's legs. It has the added benefit of being able to carry the trailer on 3 wheels safely until you can pull over, if a wheel should happen to go flat.

"
"
Start practicing weeks before you must transport your horse.,
Associate the trailer with good things and keep it as un-scary as possible.,
Get the trailer rolling.,
Practice long drives.,
Don't act any different on days you are going somewhere.",How to Get a Spooked Horse in a Trailer," Lead your horse over to the trailer and let him sniff around it. When he's comfortable sniffing the outside, put him back in his paddock. The next day, open the ramp and let him sniff the trailer again. Allow him to sniff the inside. The next day, show the horse some grain inside the trailer. If the horse steps inside, give him the grain, pat him, and lead him back out. If he doesn't, keep showing him the grain until he steps even just a little bit onto the ramp. Keep working over the next week(s) with grain or hay or a carrot as a reward until your horse is comfortable just standing inside the trailer.


Remember that although treats can be a motivator for horses, horses are prey animals and won't care about food while extremely nervous. It may take you relaxing in the trailer and being a confident leader while asking the horse to load for the horse to do it.






Make sure that you practice with loading on a sunny, cool day with no distractions. Make sure there are no dogs barking, or other horses neighing.






If you can, roll the trailer out into an empty field and practice there.





;
, Open all the windows and vents, perhaps relax in it yourself for a while (in clear view of your horse), then ask your horse to load.

, Once your horse is comfortable standing in the trailer with the ramp open and closed, hitch up the trailer and take it for a short drive around the field. Just drive around the perimeter once or twice-depending on the size of the field- to get the horse used to the movement of the trailer. Once he's comfortable with the movement, take him out on the road for a couple of minutes.

, Every once and a while-maybe once a week-take your horse for a longish drive in the trailer. Maybe you can go grab some lunch at that place that's hard to get to. (Make sure you let the horse out to stretch his legs a couple of times.) Then take him straight home. That way, he won't always associate the trailer with work.

, Have things loaded beforehand and don't get stressed or rushed. If you do, your horse will know something is going on and will get jittery. If you're ready ahead of time, he'll probably think this is just one of your joyrides and that he doesn't have to work much.

Get him ready for tölt.,
Try a tölt.,
Move to flying pace.",How to Ride an Icelandic Horse1," The tölt is one of the two gaits that is uniquely natural for Icelandic horses. It is a four-beat gait where there is always a part of the foot on the ground. It is an incredibly smooth gait that can still carry you along at up to 20mph. Because of this, it’s great for trail-riding and trekking. It’s a natural gait that you often see foals performing. As such, it doesn’t take much to bring an Icelandic into tölt, but you can start by getting in a good position.Sit slightly further back in the saddle than you would normally. A couple of inches should be enough.
Don’t tilt backwards. Keep the same upright position you would have for a normal walk.
You can shorten the reins a little as you prepare to transition to tölt.;
, The footfall for tölt is generally similar to that for walk, so you can move from walk to tölt relatively easily and smoothly. In tölt, the horse will carry its neck a little higher so shorten the reins, sit back a couple of inches and give him a cue to speed up. You can give him a gentle squeeze with your legs, or an audio cue. An Icelandic horse should move into tölt naturally. After a few steps loosen the reins a little more, and keep your wrists flexible and loose.


Pay attention to the neck and the head. You want the horse’s neck to lift, not the nose.
Be sure to keep the bit soft in the horse’s mouth. Aim to be as soft as possible to promote a nice smooth and soft tölt., The second special gait for Icelandics is known as flying pace. This is a two-beat lateral gait, in which the legs on each side of the horse move together and there is a clear moment of suspension when all of his feet are off the ground. It is a gait generally only used over short distances, such as races over a few hundred meters. At flying pace, an Icelandic might travel at 30mph (equivalent to a full gallop), so this is a gait only for an experienced rider.You must be riding at race speed to move into a flying pace.
Not all Icelandics are capable of achieving flying pace.An Icelandic that can pace is highly valued and can make an excellent race horse.

"
"
Get in a good position.,
Try a trot.,
Move into canter.",How to Ride an Icelandic Horse2," When riding an Icelandic you should follow the basics of English style riding.Sit up straight and hold the reins in both hands. You should be able to draw a straight line down your side from your ear, to your shoulder, to you hip and then down to your heel. On each side, the stirrup should be at the ball of your foot. Your heels should be pointing down, and your toes pointing up.


Hold your hands around six inches above and in front of the saddle’s pommel.
Hold the reins with your thumbs up, and try to keep your hands steady.You can apply a little pressure with your legs to get the horse moving forward.

, Once you have him walking nicely, you can apply a little extra pressure with your legs and heels to bring him into a trot. You can either go for a sitting trot or a rising (or posting) trot. Try to relax your elbows and keep your hands steady. If you’re trying a rising trot, move in and out of saddle in rhythm with your horse’s trot. Don’t try to move too far out of the saddle, or make an exaggerated movement, instead try to make a slight forward thrusting movement with your hips.


For a sitting trot, the key is to relax and stay relaxed.
Don’t allow your legs or back to tense up. This can be difficult if your horse has a bouncy trot, but comes with practice and experience.
Tensing up will make your horse think you want to go faster, and will also make the ride more uncomfortable for both of you., To bring him into canter from trot, move your leg on the side you want him to lead the canter from backwards slightly. Keep your other leg in the normal position. Sit up straight and give him a gentle squeeze or small kick to move into canter.


Don’t hold the reins too tightly, and try not to tip forward in the saddle.
If you do, you may bring him back into trot.
Keep your elbows relaxed, and allow your hands to move forward and back in rhythm with his bobbing head.
Keep your back relaxed and supple, and let your hips rock with the horse’s movement.In Iceland, canter and gallop are consider one gait."
"
Note the slightly smaller size.,
Enjoy his spirited personality.,
Look out for the mane and coat.",How to Ride an Icelandic Horse3," To really appreciate how special Icelandic horses are, it’s a good idea to think about all their unique characteristics. The first one you will notice is their relatively small stature. They are generally smaller than other breeds, weighing between 330 and 380 kilos, or 703 and 840 pounds.


The average height for an Icelandic horse is between 132 and 142cm, or 52-56 inches., Icelandics are great companions, not least because of their tendency for spirited temperaments and big bold personalities.Although Icelandics can be very spirited and even stubborn, they generally combine this with real friendliness and an affinity for people. They are typically bred as riding and working horses for farmers in Iceland, and as such, they make great family horses.


They have no natural predators in Iceland, so they have become quite laid back characters.
You can of course still get lots of variety across individual horses, who each have their own personalities.The disposition and strength of Icelandics make them great horses for long treks and trails.

, Icelandic horses can be recognised quite easily by their long flowing manes. The manes and tales of Icelandics are thick all year round, and are never cut or plaited.Their coats come in almost every colour, and in winter they develop fluffier double coats to protect them from the cold.They shed their winter coats in the Spring and become sleek like other breeds."

Wear beekeeping apparel to protect yourself from stings.,
Choose a sunny day around mid-day to work the bees.,
Obtain a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket to place your bee working tools in.,
Fill your smoker with your chosen burning material.,
Light the smoker just before you reach the hive.








,
Approach the hive from the back, out of the landing path of the heavily laden bees.,
Open the top of the hive, and blow smoke into the inner cover.,
Pull out the frame closest to the side of the bee box, and lay it on the ground.,
Move downward into the brood box.,
Remove honey-loaded supers, and replace with a fresh super and frames.,
If you choose to do so, feed and/or medicate the bees as needed.








,
Replace all hive components, and quietly leave the area.








,
Clean all hive tools with disinfectant.

",How to Work With Bees," This could include a commercial bee suit, but at the very least it should include a hat with a veil and bee gloves. Wear thick, long clothes, tuck your pants into thick socks, and wear sturdy shoes. You may want to put rubber bands around your ankles to prevent bees from crawling up your pants.









Bees are more aggressive to dark colors. Wear light-colored clothing when working with bees.;
, More bees will be away from the hive working during this time. Cloudy, rainy days should be avoided. Many bees will be at the hive, and they seem to be more apt to sting on these days.








, This will allow you to keep everything together and transport them easily when going out to work bees. Place in the bucket a smoker, a hive tool, burning material, matches or a lighter, and any feed or medication needed for the bees at the time you work them.

, Common choices are burlap, pine needles, corncobs, wood pellets, dried grass, or mulch. Smoking bees calms them by causing them to gorge on honey. The smoke masks the alarm signal from the guard bees.








,, Come around to the front, and blow a few puffs of smoke into the entrance of the hive. Move away, and wait 3 minutes.








, Use the hive tool, if needed, to remove the inner cover and blow smoke between the frames as you remove and inspect them. The hive tool is useful for breaking the propolis, which is the resin-like material bees use to glue areas of their hive. Give the bees plenty of time to eat.








, Move the other frames into that place after you have inspected them. Gently lift the frames up, and allow the bees to let go and move out of the way.








, Look for the queen and sealed brood, and make sure that you have ample frames for the colony to work with. Check on any abnormalities and pests, such as mites or moths.








, If you're preparing the bees for winter, reduce the entrance to the hive and remove any extra supers. This will force the bees down into the brood boxes to store honey for the winter.

Before you go out into the ring you need to do last minute touch ups.,
When you go out you will walk around the ring one way with your mini horse until the judge tells you to go the other way.",How to Show a Miniature Horse," Some shows have height, weight, breed, and gender requirements. You can usually find these on the web page for the show or your registration forms. In most mini horse shows there are divisions for different heights, colors, and genders.;
, Make sure you are giving it the right amount of feed and hay but be sure not to overfeed it. You can look online, in books, or talk to a vet to find out how much you need to feed it.

, Practice turning and stopping. Make sure that when you stop the mini horse stops with you and doesn’t pull on the lead rope.

, Getting the right equipment for your mini horse is very important also. You can find brushes, mane combs, horse shampoo/conditioner, hoof polish, hoof picks, lead ropes, and halters at farm supply stores such as; Tractor Supply and Family Center, but you may want to look elsewhere for a more decorative halter and rope. The scissors, towels, baby oil, and baby powder can be found at any store.

, It is good to make sure that they are not too long or overgrown.

, Trim it so that it looks nice and neat but also flows normally, don’t worry if you don’t get it right the first time it takes practice. Practice at home a few months before the show; eventually you will learn how to cut it to make it look right.

, Some horses do not like to be bathed so you need to tie them to a post and slowly introduce them to the water by just turning it on a little until they get used to it. After you have wet them down you need to put shampoo on them and lather it all over their coat, mane, and tail, you can use your hands or a soap brush. Then rinse them and do the same with the conditioner and then rinse again. After you are done you will want to use the towels to dry your mini horse, so they don’t get muddy or sick.

, The next step is brushing; you need to brush your mini horse to remove any dust, dirt, or hair still on the horse. Use soft, slow strokes so that you do not spook or aggravate it. After you’ve brushed you should comb out the mane and tail so that there are no tangles, you can use hair de-tangler if needed.

, You use the baby powder for the white legs and faces of your mini horse to make it look cleaner and flawless. You use the baby oil on the dark parts of the horse to make it look darker and smoother. Finally you put the hoof oil on black hooves to make them look shiny and for white hooves you make sure that they are clean and have no mud.

, The judge may give you instructions such as trot or turn in a circle. Then the judge will have all of you come to the middle to announce the winners.

Look for mottled skin.,
Look for vertical-striped hooves.,
Look for white sclera (eyeballs).",How to Identify an Appaloosa Horse1," Mottled skin is skin that has ""splotchy"" light and dark patches. No other horses have mottled skin, so this the sure way to tell if a horse is an Appaloosa.In fact, this is one of the ways that official horse registries prove that a horse is an Appaloosa.Look where the hair is thinnest and lightest to see whether a horse has mottled skin. These spots include the nose, mouth, and face (especially around the eyes) as well as the genitals and anus.You can also sometimes see mottled skin patterns beneath white patches in the coat.;
, Many (though not all) Appaloosas will have well-defined light and dark lines on their hooves. Unfortunately, other horses can sometimes also have these markings if they also have white leg markings.This means that this body feature doesn't prove that a horse is an Appaloosa unless you see it on a horse without white leg markings.

, Most horses have completely dark eyes — in other words, there are no ""whites"" of their eyes. Appaloosas, on the other hand, have eyes like a human's with a white area (called the sclera) around the iris and pupil. Seeing this is a good sign that a horse is an Appaloosa.


Note that, in rare cases, horses with bald faces can also have white sclera even if they're not an Appaloosa. If you see a horse with a bald face and white sclera, this is not enough evidence to identify it as an Appaloosa."

Let the cat go free.,

Continue to make sure your cat’s basic needs are taken care of.,

Have your cat seen by a vet.",How to Train a Cat to Be Outdoor Safe and a Good Rodent Catcher," Outdoor cats are different than cats who go outside.Most cats will practice hunting behavior when let outside. However, outside cats will be used to spending all or nearly all of their time outdoors, and better able to take care of themselves than indoor cats that spend some time outdoors. If you want a dedicated mouser, an outdoor cat is the best choice.


Short-haired cats make the best choice for mousers, because you will not have to worry about their fur becoming tangled, matted, or trapped in something.
Female cats tend to be more consistent hunters than males.;
, You can get a potential mouser from any source with cats available. However, many animal shelters have formerly stray cats available, which make great outdoor cats. These felines are used to spending time outdoors, and are even happy to be there. They are also not dependent on constant human companionship.Consider getting more than one outdoor cat at a time. They can enjoy having another cat to snuggle with, groom, and hunt with.Kittens will not be prepared on their own to begin hunting right away. They are also more vulnerable to predators like owls and wolves.For this reason, it is best to get a cat that is already about the size of a rabbit if you want it to be a mouser.

, Once you have chosen your mouser-to-be, take it to your veterinarian for a checkup. The vet will ensure that the cat is in good health, and provide it with any vaccinations and other care it may need.Spaying or neutering your outdoor cats will not stop them from being effective hunters. However, it will reduce the tendency to roam, helping to keep them on your property.Your vet can also insert a tiny microchip in your cat for identification purposes.

, Even if they spend all of their time outdoors, mousers will need you to provide them with shelter and a regular supply of food and water. When you first bring them home, they will also need to have a litter box available.You can use automatic feeders and water dishes (available at pet supply stores), or make sure to replenish your cat’s food and water yourself everyday.
Your cat’s shelter should be easily accessible, covered, dry, and protected from wind, cold, and heat. Good choices include a barn, shed, or dedicated cathouse.
Make sure your cat has a place to bed that is safe from disturbances like dogs, cars, and children.

, When you first bring your cat home, it will be somewhat stressed as it gets to know its surroundings. Keeping it in a large cage or enclosed area at first will protect it and prevent it from running away.Set the cage up near the shelter that your cat will use once it is accustomed to its new surroundings, so that it will associate that area with home.


Make sure that the enclosed area is large enough that the cat is free to roam around, stretch out, and get some exercise. It should also be protected from heat, cold, rain, etc.
Your local animal shelter may be able to lend you a cage or crate to use.
Check on your cat regularly. Refill its water and food dishes, and empty its litter box whenever necessary.
Give your cat some toys to play with to keep itself occupied, and treats to make it associate its new home with good feelings.
Putting towels or blankets in the enclosed area can also make your cat feel more comfortable. A towel, blanket, or t-shirt that you have used will help your cat get used to your scent.
Spend some time with the cat, so that it gets used to your presence and the sound of your voice. However, don’t attempt to pet it or pick it up if it seems fearful or aggressive. Eventually, the cat will begin to trust you.

, After a week or so, your cat should be ready to roam around on its own.Open the area it has been enclosed in, and let the cat come out on its own. It may disappear for a day or two in order to explore. Leave the cage or enclosed area where it is, and keep food and water supplied. The mouser will come back to feed.


Once the cat seems to be comfortable with its new surroundings, you can remove the cage and just let it use the permanent shelter you have set up for it.

, Cats will hunt, even if they are fed regularly, because of hunting instincts.You will not have to train your cat to do the actual hunting.


Cats are opportunistic. Rodents are easier to catch than other animals, like birds, and cats will sit and wait for mice and rats to emerge from burrows and other hiding places.Some cats will bring their humans rodents they have killed as a “present.” Others will eat the rodents, or leave them elsewhere.

, Even if your cat is a professional mouser, it will need you to provide it with a steady supply of food and water. It is a myth that cats will not hunt if you feed them.Your cat’s shelter should be kept dry and comfortable; if it is cold, put some blankets or straw inside.


Give your cat a constant supply of dry food. If you also offer it wet food at night, it will be drawn to its shelter and away from predators such as wolves, coyotes, and owls.

, Barn cats or mousers might be more solitary than indoor cats. However, they will still appreciate some attention, so make sure to pet and play with them often.


Sometimes, outdoor hunting cats will go away for a day or two, roaming and exploring. Usually they will come back.If you have not seen yours for an unusually long time, you may want to search for it to make sure it is ok.

, Mousers will need regular health check-ups, vaccinations, and other preventative care.Because they spend most or all of their time outdoors, mousers may also be more susceptible to injuries, risks, and illnesses, so make sure to keep an eye on yours.Your vet may suggest that your outdoor cat take special treatments to prevent problems from fleas, ticks, worms, and other pests.

Look for the stereotypical ""brown-on-white"" spotted pattern.,
Look for the ""blanket"" pattern.,
Look for the aptly-named ""leopard"" pattern.,
Look for an inverted ""snowflake"" pattern.,
Look for Appaloosa roan patterns.,
Be aware of less-common coat patterns.",How to Identify an Appaloosa Horse2," Appaloosas can have a wide variety of coats, but this is the type that many people are familiar with from TV and movies. The stereotypical Appaloosa horse has a white or light-colored coat covered with thick, reddish-brown spots. Often, these spots appear clustered around the front quarters of the horse and are less present on the rump, though more even spot patterns are also possible.


On an Appaloosa, the skin underneath dark spots is usually dark as well. This dark skin usually extends a little outside of the spot and under the white hair, which can give the spots a subtle ""halo"" effect when viewed up close.
While the reddish-brown shade for the spots is most famous, their color can range from chestnut to black., This pattern can be seen when the top of the rump (and sometimes the whole hindquarters) of the horse is completely or partially free of spots and the rest of the horse's coat has dark spots or solid patches. The visual effect of this coat can look a little like a white blanket is laid across the horse's rump, hence the name.


The ""classic"" blanket pattern (also known as a ""snowcap"") has a completely bare rump — no spots. A rump that's mostly white with some spots is technically known as a ""spotted blanket"" pattern.

, A leopard-coated Appaloosa horse will have spots that are generally smaller and wider-spaced than on the typical spotted Appaloosa. The horse should appear mostly white or light-colored with noticeable — but not visually overpowering — dark spots. The visual effect is similar to a Dalmatian's coat. As with the coat patterns above, spots on a leopard coat can range from chestnut to black.


Note that, even on leopard coats, front quarters and legs of the horse may sometimes have thicker spotting or solid patches like on blanket patterns.

, While most Appaloosa coats have dark spots on a light background, this coat pattern is the opposite: it has light spots on a dark background. The horse's ""base"" coat will usually range, once again, from chestnut to black. The spots will generally be small, white, and well-spaced apart, like individual snowflakes fallen on a dark surface.

, A ""roan"" coat is one that has a roughly even mixture of white and colored hairs. The colored hairs can be any shade — this allows for many different roan coats. An Appaloosa roan pattern usually has a lighter colored area around the forehead and jowls as well as over the back, loins, and face. Darker patches usually appear around the leg, behind the front leg joints, above the point of the hip, and above the eye. The frontal bones of the face can have both lighter and darker patches.The contrast between these light and dark patterns can be a little subtle. Roan coats don't have the distinct borders between light and dark hair that spotted patterns do, so you may need to take a close look to identify these patterns.

, The patterns above aren't the only kinds of coats that Appaloosa horse can have. In rarer cases, Appaloosas can have unusual coats that may even make them look like other breeds of horse. See below for more information on some of these unusual coats:Mottled: The horse's coat is completely white. Because Appaloosas have mottled skin (skin with light and dark patches), these shades will be subtly under the light coat.
Solid: The horse's coat is completely dark-colored. There are no spots.
Roan blanket (or ""frost""): The horse has a roan pattern over its rump, back and hind quarters. In other words, there will be whitish patches in these areas that blend smoothly into the darker parts of the horse (no clear-cut spots).
Roan blanket with spots: Same as above, but with spots in the light roan areas.

"
"
Don't look only for the classic ""brown on white"" coat pattern.,
Don't look only for spots.,
Be aware that Appaloosa coats change as the horse matures.",How to Identify an Appaloosa Horse3," As noted above, the most famous Appaloosa pattern is reddish brown on a white background. However, as also noted above, this is just one of many coats that an Appaloosa can have. Don't put too much stock in whether or not a horse exhibits this ""classic"" coat, as it isn't very useful as the sole identifier of a horse's Appaloosa status.

, Appaloosas are famous for their spots, but a spotted coat isn't a prerequisite for being an Appaloosa. The horses may in some cases have coats that are entirely spot-free (such as if they have a solid or roan coat). In other cases, they may have coats with sparse, small, or hard-to-see spots, making identification difficult.


It's also worth noting that many, many breeds of horses can have spotted coats that resemble an Appaloosa's., Making a guess about the identity of a young horse you think is an Appaloosa is not always a wise move. Appaloosa coats can change greatly with age. Spots can move, form, and disappear over the years. Even blanket patterns can develop over time. In fact, a small percentage of Appaloosa will be born completely solid-colored and form spots as they mature.The coat patterns of an Appaloosa's parents don't always predict how it will look when it is grown. For instance, two leopard Appaloosas can produce a solid-colored offspring."

Buy a home for your bees.,
Find a place for the hive.,
Make or purchase a hive stand.,
Purchase protective gear.,
Get a smoker.",How to Keep Bees1," While honey bees can create hives in all sorts of spaces, most naturally occurring hives don’t respond well to having honey harvested from them. Store bought hives are designed to allow you to collect the honey with minimal effect on the honey bees.Langstroth Hives are the most commonly used in the beekeeping industry because they provide movable frames that won’t interfere with the bees inside when removed.
Langstroth Hives will not stick together because they were designed to provide passage for the bees in the gaps between the movable pieces.
Top Bar Hives are designed to be more shallow and sit higher for people who have trouble bending over and may be a good choice for people with back issues.
Ware Hives are shaped a bit like a house and can be difficult to manage large colonies in, but are great for small hives.;
, You can keep one colony in most typical sized housing lots. While many people think that means their backyard may be big enough to house a hive of honey bees, there are some other things you will need to consider before placing your hive.Find out if there are any zoning requirements for keeping a bee colony in your local area.
Make sure no one in your family has a bee allergy.
Let your neighbors know about your hive to see what concerns they may have about their families or health.

, You will want to keep your honey bee hive off of the ground to make it easier to access and prevent the wood from rotting. A good hive stand will stand about eighteen inches off the ground to protect the hives from wild animals as well.A typical hive stand is made of treated 2x4 pieces of lumbar laid across stacked cement or concrete blocks.
Consider putting down mulch, gravel or stones under your hive stands to limit the mud you will have to deal with.

, Honey bees are not the most aggressive species of bee, but their sting can still be quite painful. You will need to purchase honey bee keeping protective equipment to prevent them from stinging you as you check on them and harvest the honey.A simple hat and veil is often enough protection for most beekeeping activities.
A light jacket offers additional protection and is often enough for regular beekeeping needs.
A full suit with gloves is advised for times when the weather is rather windy or the bees seem aggressive.

, A smoker is a cylinder with bellows attached that houses a slow burning fire. As the fire burns, you squeeze the bellows so smoke comes out the nozzle. This smoke is an excellent way to calm bees down as you work around their hive.








Burning pine needles, old burlap, wood or purchased smoker fuel are all effective methods of calming bees down.
Smoke tricks bees into thinking they need to escape a fire and interferes with the pheromones they use to communicate within the hive.

Invest in ""environmental punishers."",
Purchase a compressed-air cat repellent system.,
Place plastic sheeting at the base of your curtains.,
Trim your curtains with double-sided sticky tape.,
Booby-trap any surfaces your cat might be climbing toward.,
Replace your curtain hooks with lightweight thread.,
Use direct punishments as a last resort.,
Provide scratching posts.,
Clip your cat's nails regularly.,
Contemplate whether your cat needs something to do.,
Ensure your cat feels safe in its environment.,
Remove nearby houseplants or food sources.",How to Train Your Cat Not to Climb on the Curtains," Environmental punishers are effective tools that aren't dependent upon your physical presence. These tools will enable you to safely send your cat a consistent message that the curtains are not a climbing toy.;
, These systems are equipped with a motion sensor. When your cat wanders too close to the curtains it will be met with a blast of compressed air.

, Pet retailers sell a type of plastic sheeting that delivers a mild static charge when the cat steps upon the surface. In dry indoor environments any plastic may be sufficient to cause a minor static shock.

, Cats are likely to find the texture unappealing. They may also find it difficult to penetrate with their claws. Test the tape in an unobtrusive location to ensure it will not mar your curtain fabric.

, If your cat appears to be climbing the curtains in order to reach a table top, counter, or shelf, place a stack of lightweight, easily toppled items such as plastic storage containers on the surface. Your cat will be startled when it knocks over a clattering pile of plastic, and may think twice about returning to its favorite haunt., When your cat tries to climb, it will break the thread and pull down the curtains. Once the cat has experienced this consequence a few times it is unlikely to persist, and the curtains can be re-hung properly.


You may also try replacing existing window hardware with a tension rod if your curtains are hanging where use of one is feasible. Many adult cats are heavy enough to pull down the rod if they attempt to climb the attached curtains. Exercise care in using this solution, however, as you don't want the rod to break decorative items (or harm your cat) on the way down. , Your cat may respond to clapping, spraying water, or rattling newspaper or a plastic grocery bag. Try other methods first, however, as direct punishment runs the risk of scaring your cat. These methods should not be employed if the cat is already skittish. If you choose to use water, test to make sure errant spray won't damage your curtains.

, These will meet your cat's instinctual need to sharpen its claws. If your curtains are made of heavy or highly textured cloth, what you see as decor might look like a delightful claw-sharpening surface to your cat.


Different cats prefer different textures and styles; consider cardboard, carpeting, wood, sisal, or upholstery, and horizontal, vertical, or diagonal posts.
Lure your cat toward the post with treats or catnip. You might even try ""modelling"" scratching behavior to illustrate the possibilities of this new contraption. Don't, however, force your cat's paws against the post. You might frighten your cat, leading it to avoid the scratching post altogether.
Make sure posts are sturdy and of sufficient height, and don't toss them when they start to fray -- from a cat's perspective, a worn post offers perfect traction!, Consider applying plastic caps to the cat's claws. These attach with adhesive and typically last 4-6 weeks., Behavior you find infuriating may be your cat's solution to boredom. Cats left alone for long stretches of time may be especially prone to finding ""creative"" (and destructive) ways to occupy their time. Provide enrichment activities to keep your cat's mind and body sharp.


Hide cat treats around the house. Something as simple as an empty box perforated with small holes and containing kibble or cat treats can provide useful stimulation.
Invest in cat toys. Toys that hang or swing are a particularly useful alternative to feline destruction of your curtain ties or tassels.
Consider hanging bird feeders in a (curtain-free!) location where your cat can watch the activity outdoors.
Provide a human-approved location such as a cat perch, accessible shelf, or other elevated surface where your cat can fulfill its natural climbing instincts and enjoy the view. , Again, cats are natural climbers. If your cat feels threatened by other pets or small children, it may seek safety by escaping upward.


Cat perches offer a human-approved escape route for anxious felines.
Pet or child gates can ensure that your cat has access to safe zones in your home. Cats will simply jump over gates placed to stymie small dogs or toddlers. Stairways may be especially useful locations for such barriers -- cats enjoy watching the action below from the safety of a sheltered stair.
Most home improvement retailers sell small cat doors designed for either exterior or interior use. Even indoor cats can benefit from a strategically placed door allowing access to a basement or storage room where they can escape when they feel threatened.

, These items may act as cat-magnets in ways that jeopardize both your cat's welfare and the well-being of your curtains.


Check to make sure your houseplants are not poisonous to cats, and remove tempting hanging baskets or trailing flora from locations adjacent to drapes and curtains.
Cover candy dishes, snacks, or other culinary temptations. Learn what your cat finds appealing -- each animal responds differently to ""human"" food.

Catch a wild spring swarm.,
Purchase an established hive locally.,
Order bees by mail.,
Place the bees in their new home.",How to Keep Bees2," A wild spring swarm is a cluster of bees that have left their hive. You can usually find them temporarily hanging from a tree or bush during the springtime. During that time of year, the swarms will be relatively docile while they prepare to establish a new hive. This is the least expensive, but most dangerous method. With beekeeping gear on, you can gather the bees and their queen into an empty hive.
Place a box below the branch of a tree or bush the bees are currently swarming on. You may be able to shake the branch, causing the majority of the bees to fall in the box but this could anger the bees. Instead, simply cut the branch they are swarming on off the tree and place it in the box for transport.This method is not recommended without support from an experienced beekeeper.

, You may be able to purchase an established hive from a local beekeeper. This can be the easiest way to get started as well as a great way to provide you with a contact that has beekeeping experience.These hives usually only cost between $50 and $100.
Make sure the hive you purchase has been formally inspected by an apiarist or the state department of agriculture. Either test is free to have conducted and can prevent you from having to destroy colonies with communicable diseases.

, The easiest and most common way to make sure you can establish a hive of healthy honey bees is to order your bees through the mail. The U.S. Postal Service will actually deliver your bees right to your door. A beginner order would usually cost about $30 and entail the following:A 3-pound box with 10,000 worker honey bees
One mated queen that is ready to start laying eggs
Sugar water to feed the colony during shipment

, It’s surprisingly easy and safe to transfer your bees from the package they came in to their new hive that you purchased for them. This process is detailed in instructions that often come with the bees as well.Simply place the separately caged queen into the empty hive
Pour the bees out of the box onto the queen
The bees do not currently have a hive to defend and will be disoriented so there is very little risk of being stung during this process.
These colonies will take the first year to build up the number of bees inside and will not yield honey until the second year you have the hive.

"
"
Start with a friend that has experience.,
Check on your bees.,
Inspect their honey making progress.,
Harvest your honey.,
Treat bee stings.",How to Keep Bees3," It’s important that you learn the proper way to behave around a bee hive from someone with experience. An experienced beekeeper can provide you with wisdom and guidance that may be difficult to find online.


A seasoned beekeeper’s poise will show you how to remain calm if you get nervous around the hive.
Having support can make the situation less frightening until you are accustomed to working with bees.

, You will need to check on the status of your hives more often than you will be harvesting honey. When checking on your hive, simply wearing a hat with a veil is often considered enough protection, but you may also choose to wear a jacket.








Visit the bees on a sunny day when flowers are in bloom so the majority of the bees will be out and working.
Wash any clothing bees may have stung previously when visiting, the residual pheromones could incite another attack.
Use a smoker to fill the hive with smoke and keep the bees docile when opening it to inspect.

, Once you have approached the hive, you’ll need to open it and remove some of the interior framing to check on your bees progress in developing the hive and making honey. Remember to liberally use your smoker throughout this process to pacify the remaining bees.








Use your hive tool (a small crowbar) to pry up the corner of one of the interior frame walls, then slide it up slowly.
In different frames you slide out you will find honey or even frames filled with the queen’s larvae.
Frames that are capped in beeswax are full of honey and ready to be harvested.

, It’s finally time to reap the reward of beekeeping, a harvest of fresh honey! You may choose to wear your full beekeeping suit to protect yourself during this process, though if you’re careful, it may not be necessary.








You can purchase a “bee escape” which is a bee trap that allows the bees to enter a container but not leave. As you smoke the hive, most bees will enter the bee escape, allowing you to harvest the honey safely with most bees temporarily displaced.
Use a pocket knife or small blade to cut the honey combs out of the frames. The beeswax honey making up the hexagons is also edible.
A centrifuge specially designed to separate the honey from the honey combs can also be purchased at specialty stores if you would prefer only the pure honey.

, It’s inevitable that you will get stung at some point while working with bees. Most experienced beekeepers have been stung many times, but eventually learn to avoid most situations that may result in getting stung. If you are stung, treating a bee sting is fairly easy:


Remove the stinger as quickly as you can and wash the area with soap and water.
Apply a cold compress and keep an eye out for signs of an allergic reaction.
If signs of a moderate allergic reaction arise, take an antihistamine and apply a cortisone cream to the site of the sting.
If a more severe reaction seems evident, use an epinephrine pen if available and seek medical treatment immediately."
"
Make assessments and preparations on a warmer fall day.,
Ensure the hive has enough food for winter.,
Feed the colony if necessary.,
Look for healthy brood patterns.,
Merge a failing colony with another hive.",How to Winterize Bee Hives1," You should assess your colony’s health and start preparing it for winter during the fall. Choose a sunny day with temperatures in the 50 degree range Fahrenheit (10 to 15 degrees Celsius).Avoid opening your hive box during the winter. If you need to provide food or make any other adjustments, choose the warmest and sunniest day possible.
Bees need to cluster around the queen in order to survive colder temperatures. Every time you open the hive during the winter, bees will break away from their wintering cluster to seal up cracks using a resin called propolis. Breaking the cluster increases the risk of colony death.;
, When harvesting your hive’s honey, make sure the colony has enough food to sustain it through the winter. Generally, a colony will need 80 to 90 pounds (36 to 40 kilograms) of honey for the winter.Harvest surplus honey only from the hive’s topmost supers (boxes). Leave the lower honey supers for the hive’s winter consumption.
You can gently lift or tilt the hive box to estimate its weight when the weather starts to get cooler and periodically throughout the winter.

, If the hive box lifts easily and you believe its honey stores are low, feed the colony using sugar syrup or fondant. Place a honey frame or specially designed feeding panel saturated with the sugar or fondant at the top food super.You can make a sugar syrup by boiling two parts sugar with one part water and letting it cool. Fondant, which is a layered cake frosting available at your local bakery, is a costlier option, but its lower moisture content will help prevent condensation over the winter.

, When temperatures drop below about 64 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius), bees will begin to form their wintering cluster around the queen and her brood. Before it gets too cold, check the brood box to make sure the clustering pattern is healthy. Brood frames should contain a neat pattern of capped brood cells in the centers surrounded by cells with pollen and honey.The brood box should be the deepest super (the lowest box of the hive). It, and the other supers, should contain several removable frames so you can monitor brooding and honey production.
Spotty brood frame patterns, where brood cells and food cells are mixed up, indicate a failing or missing queen and other colony health problems.

, You can winterize a failing or queenless colony and hope for the best, but it’ll have a lower chance of surviving the winter. If you have another box or a beekeeper friend, merge the weaker colony with a stronger hive before winter arrives.First, consolidate the weaker hive into one super, or box, that contains the hive’s 10 strongest frames. The strongest frames will have the most brood and honey cells.
Remove the inner and outer covers of the stronger hive box and place a newspaper with several slits or small holes across its top bars.
Place the super or box with the weaker colony on top of the newspaper-covered hive box that contains the stronger colony. Give the colonies a week to chew through the newspaper so they merge gradually into one colony.
Consolidate the three-tiered hive box back into two by selecting the 20 strongest frames. Place the frames that contain mostly brood cells in the lower super and the ones that contain mostly honey in the top super. That way, you end up with one colony with a conventional bottom brooding tier and top food tier.

"
Remove the hive’s queen excluders.,
Use a vented inner cover.,
Use a polystyrene telescoping top cover.,
Use carpet lining in the coldest climates.,
Wrap the hive with insulated tarp.",How to Winterize Bee Hives2," Queen excluders keep the queen in the lower brood super of a hive box during swarming season. However, you should remove any queen excluders during colder temperatures. Clusters tend to move upwards through the hive box as they consume their food stores during winter, a queen excluder could leave the queen trapped in the lower super. Without the cluster’s warmth, she’ll die., Your hive’s inner cover should have a hole in the center for bees to exit. It should also have other vents or small holes for moist air to escape. Without a vented inner cover, too much condensation will build up, leading to colony death.On warmer winter days, some bees will fly out to investigate conditions, cleanse themselves, remove dead bees, and perform other tasks. For these reasons, exit holes in your inner cover, in addition to those at the hive box’s base, are desirable.

, A telescoping top cover is a standard part of a hive box that fits over the inner cover. Many beekeepers choose a reflective metal cover for the summer to prevent the hive from overheating. You should replace your metal cover with a polystyrene cover in the winter, since it will provide better ventilation and prevent condensation from forming., In the coldest climates, like Northern Canada, some beekeepers use a carpet-lined inner cover and baseboard, with the shag facing into the hive. This provides extra insulation, but the carpet fibers still let excess moisture out. Make sure the carpet lining has cut outs for the hive’s entrances and exits., If you live in a colder climate, like the northern United States or Canada, you should wrap your hive using an insulated barrier, like black tarp paper. Use a staple gun to attach it to the hive’s exterior. Wrap the hive box from about a half inch (or a centimeter or two) below the top covers to the same distance above the base.Purchase your tarp barrier online or at your local home improvement store.

Make grease patties and place them between the food and brood supers.,
Use screening for the bottom board.,
Attach sticky cardboard to the mesh base to test for varroa mites.,
Treat your colony for varroa mites.,
Install entrance reducers and mouse guards.,
Install a bear-proof electric fence.",How to Winterize Bee Hives3," Mix one part vegetable oil with three parts confectioners sugar by hand or using a kitchen mixer. Form a handful-sized amount into a patty. Remove the food super, place two to four patties on top of the brood super’s frames, then put the food super back into place above the brood super.Grease patties will help prevent tracheal mites.

, The bottom board is the hive box’s base and sits above the hive stand. It’s become common for beekeepers to use a meshed bottom board instead of solid wood. In addition to providing ventilation, a screened base lets varroa mites fall through and exit the hive. This reduces the risk of colony-wide infection., A screened bottom board can also help you assess your colony for varroa mites. Attach cardboard coated with any sticky substance, like a sugar syrup, to the underside of the mesh. Check it regularly during warmer temperatures for any varroa mites, which are tiny eight-legged mites visible to the naked eye, that have gotten stuck on the cardboard., If you’ve used sticky cardboard and have detected only a few varroa mites, your bees’ standard hygiene routine will likely keep them from infesting. If you’ve found hundreds or thousands of mites stuck on your cardboard, consider using a chemical insecticide marked for varroa mite eradication.You can find pesticide online or a nearby bee farm. Be sure to use any chemicals you purchase as directed. See a list of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved products here: https://www.epa.gov/pollinator-protection/epa-registered-pesticide-products-approved-use-against-varroa-mites-bee-hives.
If you want to avoid using chemicals, you can simply sprinkle powdered sugar over your bees and hive’s frames to encourage their own self-cleaning.

, Entrance reducers and mouse guards can be made of either notched wood blocks or mesh. Install them in the fall when there’s less traffic coming in and out of the hive. They should fit into the hive box at the base’s exits and entrances just above the bottom board.As swarming season ends and fall sets in, bees will guard their hive’s entrances against honey robbers from rival bee colonies. In addition to helping them do this, entrance reducers also will help keep mice out during winter.

, Use an electric fence with two hot wires to keep out bears and any other predators that might come for your bee hive. Place the first wire about 6 inches (15 centimeters) above the ground to deter smaller predators. Post another wire about 3 feet (1 meter) above the ground to deter bears."

Drape a wet towel over the hive, ensuring that the entrance stays clear.,
Move the hive into an air-conditioned room.",How to Look After an Australian Native Beehive," The social bees endemic to the coast of NSW cannot fly below 18 degrees (Celsius), and will die if left for over 10 minutes above 40 degrees. They should have morning sun, until about 10 o'clock in summer to encourage activity. Some more sun in winter is preferable.;
, Unlike European Honey bees, Stingless bees do not need water (they get all they need from nectar), and so it is not important to position the hive near a water source. In fact, if you position the hive directly above a pool/pond, the bees may think it is the sky, and fly right into it!, You can place your hive directly on the ground, but putting it up on a stool, table or other elevated position will help the bees to take flight, especially in winter., Remember that you will enjoy observing the bees coming and going, so position the entrance so that you can see it easily.

, Be aware that in winter when it is too cold to travel too far outside, the worker bees may dispose of the 'garbage pellets', a by-product of rearing brood, directly outside of the entrance. This may not be particularly pleasant when the hive is located on a veranda.

, If something happens meaning that you need to move your hive, you should know how to do it. A general rule of thumb is that you should only move your hive either less than 1 meter, or more than 1 kilometer. This is because the forager bees may start returning to the old location of the hive., You can easily move a hive a short distance of no more than 1 meter. Do this day or night, it does not matter. Some bees may initially return to the old position but, they will soon figure out where the entrance is, and go to it. Just move the hive - it's that simple., It is also relatively simple to move a hive long distances of 1 kilometer or more. Pack the hive at night (this is important) when the bees are all inside. Close all entrances, ventilation holes and drainage hole to stop the bees from leaving the hive. After moving a hive to a new position, remove the plugs. Bees should immediately start emerging, if it is above 18 degrees Celsius., You will need:

A hive that is full (usually 12-18 months since last split)
A hive splitting tool/heavy duty paint scraper
A new hive, of the same dimensions as the one you are splitting
Plastic strapping or duct tape to hold the recently split hive sections together.
A veil to protect your face from the bites (optional)

, Some effort may be required, as the bees stick the 2 halves together with propolis. Be careful not to cut into the brood (mass of eggs in the center), to avoid damaging the young., Use a rag to clean any spilled 'sugar bag' honey from the joining edges of the hive, to reduce the entry of natural enemies., Then couple the full bottom with the empty top. Press both halves of one hive together, then do the same for the other., Tape is readily available and works well but can leave unsightly glue marks.

The new hive that has the top-half of the original hive should stay in the original position. You can move the other hive to another position.

, In emergency situations, when extreme heat is predicted (over 40 degrees), take action quickly., Immerse both or one ends of the towel into a bucket filled with water. The evaporative effect of the water may help to cool the hive., You could do this the night before, if extreme heat is predicted."

Don't assume that the cat will simply stop jumping or will grow bored with it. Instead, show your displeasure and let your cat know that she's not allowed to jump on the furniture.


Avoid punishing your cat since she will not understand why you're yelling, hitting, or spraying with water.;
, When you see your cat jump on the furniture, look at her and say ""no"" in a firm voice. Do not yell at her, but let her know you're unhappy. Pick her up and remove her from the furniture while saying ""no."" Set her down in a spot she's allowed to be (like her cat bed, a cat tower, or some other comfy place that she enjoys).


Don't punish your cat once you've removed her from the furniture. Let her go find somewhere else to explore.

, If your cat returns to the furniture and jumps on it, say ""no"" again and remove her. You need to do this every time you see your cat jump up on the furniture. Over time, she'll associate jumping on the furniture with being removed from it.


Your cat will be confused if you only remove her some of the times she jumps on the furniture. Send a consistent message that jumping on the furniture is not allowed.

, Startle your cat by placing something like aluminum foil on the furniture. Your cat will be surprised by the noise when she jumps up on the furniture. You can also fill a can with rocks and shake it when you notice her jumping, although she shouldn't see you shaking it. Instead, she should associate jumping on the furniture with a surprising noise.


Consider using something that will make noise when you're not home (like the aluminum foil).

, Cats don't like the feeling of being stuck, so place double-sided tape along all parts of the furniture. Your cat will probably jump up, feel uncomfortable, and then jump off. You may want to leave the adhesive on for a day or two, so that she understands not to jump on the furniture.


Some pet stores carry a double-sided adhesive that doesn't leave a residue when it's removed., Surprise your cat by spraying her with water or an unpleasant-tasting spray. You can buy bitter apple spray from pet stores. When you see your cat jump on the furniture, immediately spray her. This will startle her and she should begin to associate the furniture with an unpleasant surprise.


Spraying your cat with water might prevent her from jumping on the furniture, but some argue that it destroys your bond with your cat and can increase her stress level., This may be a hassle for you, but you may want to fill the furniture so that you cat can no longer jump on the furniture and rest comfortably. You might place books, large boxes, or just make it difficult for the cat to even get close to the furniture.


It may take a few days for your cat to move on. Be aware that very determined cats might keep trying to jump on the furniture, regardless of the obstacles you throw in her way.

, Know that your cat wants on the furniture for a reason. There may be a good view from the couch. Or, she may like cuddling on a big armchair. Your cat may be determined to keep jumping on the furniture and she might be doing it out of boredom.Remember that your cat isn't jumping on the furniture to bother you. Don't take the behavior personally, just work to prevent it.

, Your cat might be jumping on the furniture to get a good view. Help her look outside by hanging a cat shelf. This shelf can be hung low enough for your cat to jump up on and get to a window. Or, place several cat shelves so she can jump around.You can also place a cat tower near a window. This way, she can climb up and still get a good view.

, Teach your cat to respond to commands by using a clicking device. Make your cat associate the clicking sound of the device with reward. For example, click the device and give your cat a cuddle or treat. Do this a few times until she understands that she gets a reward after the click.Once your cat understands the clicker, use it to encourage her when she jumps onto places she's allowed, like her bed, cat tower, or designated space., Your cat may be jumping up on the furniture because she's bored. Offer her new toys to help her use up energy. Get several toys that you can scatter along the floor. This might also redirect her interest back to the floor and away from the furniture. Some good toys might be:Corks
Ping-pong balls
Plastic balls with bells inside
Sisal-wrapped tubes

Put the litter box in a quiet location.,
Place your cat in his litter box shortly after meals.,
Keep a clean litter box.,
Use a litter your cat will enjoy.,
Reward your cat for using the litter box.,
Do not punish your cat for accidents outside the litter box.,
Try confinement training as a last resort.",How to Train a Cat1," Cats prefer to relieve themselves in a peaceful location without a lot of action or loud noises in the background. However, cats also do not like having a litter box that is too far out of the way.


Make sure your cat can physically access his litter box. Do not put the box on a high shelf or an otherwise difficult to reach area if your cat is old and has trouble jumping or climbing.
Avoid noisy or high-traffic areas. Do not place a litter box next to a washing machine, for example, or in a crowded hallway that gets a lot of foot traffic. Cats want peace and privacy, but they also want convenience.Do not put your cat's litter box in close proximity to its food and water dishes. This may discourage your cat from using the litter box.;
, You may also want to place your cat in his box shortly after he wakes up and after playing, as all of these are times most cats will want to excrete wastes. Putting your cat into the litter box during times he will likely need to relieve himself, such as after eating a meal or when he's just woken up, may help remind him to use the litter box every time he needs to go., Cats will not want to use a litter box if it is dirty, and may resort to urinating or defecating around the house.Wear rubber gloves while handling cat feces to reduce the risk of contracting toxoplasmosis.Scoop out solid waste and clumps of urine-soaked litter everyday. Wash your hands thoroughly after handling soiled cat litter, even if you wore gloves.Do a thorough cleaning once a week. This entails dumping out old litter, washing the litter box with a mild detergent, thoroughly rinsing the soap away, drying the box completely, and pouring in a fresh layer of litter. You should only add about two to three inches (five to seven centimeters) of litter when refilling the box., There are many different types of cat litter, made from a variety of different materials. The most important factor is finding a litter that your cat will want to use. Most cats prefer clumping, unscented litter.However, your cat may prefer something different, especially if he was adopted and grew accustomed to something in his former home. See what your cat responds to and adjust accordingly.


The most common types of cat litter are clay litter, clumping litter, crystal/silica gel litter, and bio-degradable litter.Switch litters gradually, rather than abruptly, to minimize the shock and confusion to your cat. Mix a small amount of the new litter in with your cat's existing litter every day over the course of three to five days. If you change litters gradually, your cat shouldn't notice a difference.If your cat continuously relieves himself in a potted plant, he may prefer using soil instead of litter. This can be especially problematic in cats that used to live outdoors. Try lining your cat's litter box with potting soil, and see if he uses it., Give him praise immediately after he has finished using the litter box. This will build positive habits and teach him that that is where he should be relieving himself., Negative reinforcement will not work, and may actually create a litter box avoidance problem in your cat.If your cat eliminates his waste outside the litter box, it's important to immediately wash that surface with an odor-neutralizing enzymatic cleaner.If your cat can smell his urine on the carpet, he might begin to associate that spot or that texture with going to the bathroom.
If your cat passes solid waste outside the litter box, pick it up (with a paper towel or gloves) and place it in the litter box. This will give your cat scent-based cues to use the litter box next time.Try making unwanted elimination areas less desirable to your cat. If he has a part of the house that he tends to relieve himself in instead of using his litter box, leave tin foil or double-sided tape on the floor in that spot to discourage him from going there., If your cat has a strong aversion to using his litter box and nothing else has worked, temporarily confining him in a single room with the litter box could instill an understanding in him to use the litter box.This should only be used as a last resort, when nothing else has worked.
Do not confine your cat to a small room for extended periods of time. It is cruel to lock your cat up over long periods of time.
Make sure your cat has food, water, and his bed in the room with the litter box. Keep the litter box on the opposite side of the room as the food, water, and bed.
f he poops on the floor, scoop it up and put it in the tray to give him a scent mark to return to. If you cat is absolutely sold on a substrate, such as soil or carpet, and refuses to use the tray, then put that substrate in the tray. If necessary, purchase multiple pieces of carpet off cut and put it in the tray. Once the cat uses the tray with carpet in it, start to sprinkle cat litter over the carpet in the tray, to give the cat the idea. Replace sodden carpet with fresh in the tray.

Decide on a target.,
Choose some hides.,
Set up a camera to record your cat`s performance, if desired.,
Get the cat's cooperation.,
Go from easiest to hardest.,
Hold the target in the air.,
Take one of the hides and set it on the floor.,
Make sure your cat is looking at the target.,
Set out both hides.,
Hide the target in your hand.",How to Test Object Permanence in Your Cat," This is an object your cat will be trying to find. Use an object your cat likes to play with as a target. (Make sure the target doesn't make any noise, move, or have a scent your cat can detect, however, or else the test won't be valid!) The target can be anything small and hideable, but make sure you can fit it in your closed hand without any of it being visible.


Do NOT use a treat as the target, because cats can often sniff out treats instead of having to reason about where it would be.;
, They must be big enough to cover the target, and easy to use so you can quickly hide the target while the cat is watching. Make sure the cat is able to retrieve the target - for example, don't use an upside-down cup because your cat is likely to end up pushing the cup around instead of knocking it over.

, It`s best to use a tripod, or else get someone to help you, because hiding the target is easier with two hands. If you use a tripod, make sure you check the view your camera can see, so you know it`s getting a good picture. If your cat wants to play with the tripod, wait until they`re bored of it before starting testing.

, Pick a time when your cat is in a playful mood, and start playing with the target, getting them to bat at it. (This is easier to do with a kitten.) Testing should be fun for your cat as well as you. If the cat isn't interested in finding the target, the results won't be valid.

, Stop when your cat fails the test - the tests build on each other, so they can't pass a harder test if they fail an easier one. But be sure to do several tries, to make sure the result reflects their real ability. Make sure to give them lots of encouragement, and to use a consistent phrase, such as 'find it', to let them know it's time to look for the target.

, Wave it a little to get the cat's interest, and then move it slowly around, so the cat has to turn to follow it. After your cat turns a full circle, set the target down and let them paw at it. Following the object as it moves out of their visual field is stage 2 object permanence. (Your cat should pass this one.)

, If your cat wants to play with the hide, let them do it, and wait for them to lose interest. Then, get their attention focused on the target, and move the target half-under the hide, so they can only see part of it.


If they can find the target when it's partially hidden, that's stage 3 object permanence. This means that the cat can see part of an object and know that the rest of the object must be there somewhere, out of sight. Repeat this a few times, to make sure your cat didn't pass by accident or get distracted or something.

, Then put it completely out of sight under the hide. It's very important that your cat sees the target going under the hide - otherwise, the test is invalid.


If your cat gets the target out from under the hide, that's stage 4 object permanence. This means they know that objects that are out of sight still exist, and can be found again.

, If your cat wants to play with the hides, wait until they lose interest, and then get them focused back on the target. Hide the target under one hide, over and over, letting your cat get it every time. Then, hide it under the other hide.


If they go for the first hide, this is called the A-not-B error, and it means they failed. If they go for the hide it's actually under, they're at stage 5 object permanence. This means they know that the object must be where they saw it disappear, instead of where they usually find it.

, Then, while your cat is watching, move your hand under one of the hides, set the target down (careful not to make a sound or cause visible movement), and pull your closed hand out again. Hold your hand out to the cat, so they can see the target isn't in your hand.


If they to check your hand, and then go to the hide and uncover the target, they're at stage 6, the highest level of object permanence. This means they can infer movements that must have occurred, even though they didn't see or hear the movement occurring.

Play dead.,
Respect your cat's boundaries.,
Give your cat a hunting outlet.",How to Train a Cat2," If your cat gets too aggressive while playing and uses his teeth or nails, respond by immediately disengaging from the play activity, standing or sitting still, and ignoring him. Your cat will want to play, and when you deprive him of movement and interaction, he will quickly learn that he does not want that outcome.Never hit your cat. Likewise, do not yell at him or squirt him with water if he has bitten you. Over time, these negative responses can cause your cat to become fearful of you.Try changing the nature of your play if your cat becomes too aggressive. It's possible that he has slipped into hunting mode. Use a toy with a long string or handle to allow your cat to exercise his need to hunt without causing you injury or creating poor behavior., It's possible he bit or scratched you because you handled him roughly or chased him into a defensive position. If your cat needs room, give him room. If he does not want to be handled, do not try to handle him., Your cat may not be getting enough exercise or enough outlets for his predatory instincts. Try giving him toys that he can flick, like a ball or a stuffed mouse. This will make him feel like he is hunting and catching.Better yet, use a toy with a string or pole, like a ""fishing"" toy, so that you and your cat can play together.Try using catnip. Many stuffed cat toys come with a velcro pouch to insert catnip, or you can simply sprinkle some catnip on the floor and let your cat roll around in it. About half of all cats won't find catnip desirable, but those that do will enjoy a short, safe burst of play time, followed by a period of ecstatic inactivity."
"
Give your cat a scratching post.,
Use citrus or menthol.,
Use the squirt method.,
Do not get your cat declawed.",How to Train a Cat3," If your cat is constantly scratching you or pieces of furniture, there's a chance that he's doing it because he needs to scratch. A cat scratches household items to mark his scent on that item (using glands in his paws), and to remove the sheath that naturally grows over his claws. Giving him an outlet, like a scratching post, to satisfy his scratching needs should alleviate some of this problem behavior.If you catch your cat scratching furniture, a carpet, or any other place he's not supposed to scratch, interrupt him with a sharp noise. Try clapping your hands or shaking a jar full of coins to startle your cat out of his scratching.Immediately direct your cat to his scratching post. By interrupting his scratching of furniture and moving him to an acceptable object like a scratching post, you are reinforcing for your cat the notion that some objects are okay to scratch, but not others., Cats tend to dislike the smells of citrus and menthol. Rubbing a little bit of oil on the furniture your cat scratches the most could help prevent him from scratching there in the future.Soak several cotton balls in either citrus oil or a menthol-based muscle rub.Try dabbing the cotton ball on the legs and armrests of furniture your cat tends to target. Note that this will leave your furniture with a slight odor and may cause staining. Citrus oil may be less likely to stain. If you're concerned about the oils soaking through to your furniture, you may want to try simply taping the cotton balls onto the legs of couches and tables your cat tends to scratch., If your cat continues to pounce on your hands or feet, or destroy furniture around the house, it might be time to employ the water squirt method. Fill a spray bottle with clean, cold water. When the cat pounces, give him or her a quick squirt. Cats don't appreciate being sprayed with water, and they'll soon learn to associate this uncomfortable sensation with biting or scratching you.


Be advised, however, that your cat will come to associate you with the unpleasant sensation of being sprayed with water. He may even come to fear you., No matter how bad of a scratching problem he has, getting your cat declawed will only cause worse problems. The process is incredibly painful for cats and can cause lasting problems like tissue necrosis, permanent pain, aversion to using the litter box, and increased aggression towards humans.Consult your vet on other ways to curb your cat's scratching if this behavior becomes problematic.

Remove food.,
Make the counters unpleasant.,
Give him other climbing options.,
Keep the cat out.",How to Train a Cat4," If you keep food stored on the counter, including your cat's food bowl, he may have come to think of the counter as a place to find food. Remove any food products from the counter, and keep the cat's food bowl on the floor (while he's using it) or in the sink to deter him from climbing up on the counter., One of the best ways to keep your cat from climbing on the counter is to make the counter an unpleasant place for him.Apply double-sided tape to one side of a plastic laminated placemat.Lay the placemats across the counter.Over time, your cat will come to associate the counter with the unpleasant experience of walking on tape.

, Cats love to climb, mostly because they enjoy being elevated off the ground. It's possible that the kitchen counters are the highest ""perch"" your cat can reach. Give him other climbing options, like a cat ""condo,"" which you can set up anywhere in the house and offer your cat a satisfying climbing and perching experience., If your cat insists on climbing up on the counters whenever you are preparing food in the kitchen, keep your cat confined in a bedroom or bathroom, if at all possible. This will keep him from climbing and interfering with your kitchen plans. Let your cat out of confinement once you're finished cooking/preparing food."
"
Use delicious treats.,
Make sure your cat is engaged.,
Try using a clicker.,
Keep training and play sessions short.,
Respect your cat.",How to Train a Cat5," Training a cat is slightly different from training a dog. A dog will learn tricks because he wants to please you; to train a cat, you need to respect his or her independence and provide enticing reasons for the cat to obey you. Pellets of dry cat food aren't going to work, and neither is excessive praise, which cats are less interested in than dogs. The trick is to use high-quality treats that your cat will desire, like catnip, pieces of fresh chicken, or tuna., Before you begin trying to teach your cat a new trick, make sure he is aware that you're trying to teach him something.


Hold the treat in front of your cat's nose so he understands that there is a potential reward waiting for him.
Slowly move the treat in your hand over and behind his head. Continue to do this until your cat tips his head up and sits down on his bottom.
Praise your cat and give him the treat as soon as he completes the ""trick"" of sitting down.

, If you don't have a clicker, you can use a retractable pen to make a similar noise.Give your cat a treat each time you use the clicker, so that he will come to associate the sound with getting a treat. Then use the clicker and a reward every time your cat accomplishes a new trick, like chasing a stick when you throw it. Eventually your cat will respond every time you throw the stick and click the clicker., Remember that your cat will get tired out. Aim for training and play sessions that run about 15 minutes, once or twice every day., As a cat owner, you are probably aware of your cat's unique personality traits and independent nature. Never try to force a cat to do a trick he or she doesn't want to do. Some cats will happily learn to use the toilet and flush it afterward, or perch on your shoulder while you walk around the house, while others prefer not to be bothered or touched. Learn to coexist with your cat so that you're both getting something out of the relationship.

Be patient.",How to Traffic Train Your Cat," If they don’t already know you have a cat, let them know that you do, that you are training him to go outside, and to stay within the boundaries of your yard.Explain that he is not supposed to leave the yard, and that if he comes into their yard, they can either shoo him back to your yard, or they can call you.Ask them to shoo your cat firmly, but without trying to frighten the cat. If they frighten him too much, he may run into the road, or somewhere other than your yard.;
, If you have a fence already, you can skip this step. If you do not, you should use something, such as small flags or large stones, to mark the boundaries of your yard., It is best if you get a children’s squirt gun that can shoot very far. This way, you can hide if you need to spray your cat. It is important that your cat does not see that the water is coming from you. If the does, he will wait until you are not around to do whatever they want to do.An exception to this is if you see that your cat needs to immediately be redirected because of danger (e.g. if you see he is headed towards the road, and there is an oncoming car). In dangerous situations, it is more important that you redirect him quickly, regardless of whether he knows you are doing it.You should also try to avoid spraying him in the face, unless it is to protect him from an immediate threat..

, In his first days outside, you will want to choose a quiet time of the day, right before your cat usually takes a nap., Call your cat by saying “Here!” (with his name) loud enough so that he can hear you. When he comes to you, praise him while you put on his harness and leash.In the beginning, you will carry your cat outdoors to demonstrate that you are in charge of the situation, but this will change later.You should set him down just a few feet outside the door so that he is facing the house.Pet him immediately, so that he gets used to being touched while outdoors., While holding on to his leash, allow him to sniff around the yard freely. Make sure that you have a firm grasp on the leash in case anything frightens him. You don’t want the leash to slip out of your hand if this happens.


Every few minutes, you need to pick him up and pet him while also saying his name. Once you have done this, set him down again facing the direction of your home.It is important that you do this several times before taking him back inside. If he learns that it means he has to go back inside when you pick him up, he will try to run and hide., Not only will this be unpleasant for your cat, it also increases the chance that he will escape from his harness. Cats are masters of escaping. If you pull his harness tight using the leash, it will be much easier for him to wriggle out of it, and once he figures this out, he will do it every time.If your cat jerks away from you because he is frightened, pick him up as soon as possible (step on the leash if necessary). If you don’t grab him, there is a good chance that he will get out of his harness.
If something does frighten him, pick him up and take him indoors immediately. Especially if he doesn’t calm down quickly. Give him a treat, and try again the next day.While it is generally not a good idea to take him inside as soon as you pick him up, a situation where he wants to run away warrants this. You want to discourage him from bolting out of the yard.

, Any time your cat walks towards you or the house, you should praise him. Keep a toy, such as a stick with a string and toy mouse attached to it, on the porch. Try to engage him in playing with the mouse close to the house., During the first three days, the goal is to keep him near the house, and to avoid situations where you have to tell your cat “no.” If he is on a leash, you will have more opportunity to guide him towards the home (without dragging him!).Start with session of 5-10 minutes.
You can use positive things such as toys and treats to keep him interested in staying near the house.
As soon as you need to bring him inside, pick him up, pet and praise him for a minute or two, then take him inside. Once you are inside, reward him with cuddling (if he enjoys it) and a treat. Tell him he did good.

, After three successful days, you can take him outside, and let his leash drag on the ground. Continue to reward him for staying close to the house, but also allow him to explore a bit.


The point here is to teach your cat that as long as he stays inside the boundaries, he gets to roam around, but once he crosses those boundaries, play time will be over.Just as in the first three days, you should continue to pick him up every few minutes, pet him, and praise him. The point here is to remind him that you aren’t necessarily a signal that he has to go back inside., Whenever your cat approaches the boundary of the yard, stay close to him. As soon as he steps on or over the boundary, say “no.” You should avoid using his name, and you should not yell it so loudly that it will frighten him.


Instead, say “No,” and get between him and the outside boundary. Gently shoo him back in the boundary by using hand motions, or by gently pushing him back into the yard.Never hit your cat. Hitting an animal only damages their trust in you.
Any time you see him approaching the boundary, you should do this. You can say “No” or “Uh-uh.” If he crosses the boundary anyway, go and put him back inside the boundary. If he crosses the boundary a third time, then you should take him inside.Remember though, that you should still reward him when he comes indoors. He needs to learn that going inside is a good thing.

, A good strategy is to plan his outdoor time right before his normal meal time so that he has something to look forward to. Otherwise, you can try luring him in with toys and/or treats.If he ignores you, and stays outside, then go over to him and pick him up. Walk around with him for a few seconds while petting him. Apologize, and say that you have to go inside now. Once inside, praise him, and give him a reward., Once he goes outside without his leash and harness, remain cautious. You should still keep a constant eye on him. If he steps on or over the boundary, give him a verbal warning immediately. If he violates that warning even once, take him back inside.At this point, you should also try to hide for a few seconds at a time, or at least stay out of his line of sight. The cat needs to understand that the rules apply whether you are there or not.
You can also hide with your water gun. If he steps on or over the boundary, spray him with the water. Again, do your best to avoid being seen.
Over the span of a few months, your cat should come to understand that the yard is where he is allowed to be, and that going out of the yard is unacceptable. Once you feel comfortable that he will not leave the yard, you can leave him alone, but do not forget to check on him—frequently at first, and then occasionally. You may also need to have reminder training sessions where you stay out with him the whole time, picking him up occasionally to keep him comfortable with being touched while outside.

, By now, your cat should understand that he is supposed the stay in the yard. Hopefully, this will be training enough; however, it is also important that your cat understand what he should be afraid of.

, This will depend on where you live, but you need to figure out when the traffic is lightest on your street, perhaps mid-day (while most people are at work) or late at night after most people have come home.Try to keep the times consistent so that your cat learns what time of day he can expect to go outside. It will help establish patterns that your cat can understand.

, Once your cat is used to going outside at a certain time each day, you should follow him. Be sure to leave the door open so he can easily get back inside., Since your cat knows that he should stay in the yard regardless of whether you are there, you should find a way to hide with a water gun. You will need to wait until a car comes along, preferably a bigger car so that your cat will be sure to notice it., Understand that spraying your cat with water can be very traumatic, so it should not be done often, and if at all possible, your cat should not see that you are the one spraying them.You should only spray that cat if he is near the boundary of the yard, and only if he doesn’t seem frightened of the car already.
The idea here is that you want your cat to associate the car with the something he dislikes.
Alternatively, you can also sit by the road. When you see a car coming, you should pretend that you are frightened, and gently shoo your cat towards the house. Try not to frighten him too much, as he may bolt if he is very frightened.

, If, after spraying or shooing him, he runs toward the house, praise him. Pet him gently, give him a treat, and tell him that he did a good job., Cats are very aware of the behavior of others around them, so it’s important that they sense that you are frightened of the oncoming car, and they will begin to understand that is something they should fear as well., You should go through this training each day for a few days. It is important to be consistent in your training. If you only do this one or two times, your cat may not learn the association between the startling noise and the car.Although your cat will learn to fear the cars using this method, it is likely that, over time, he will become more comfortable with the noise of the car. Thus, it might be a good idea to repeat this exercise every few months to remind him that cars are dangerous.Do not let your cat see you looking calm and relaxed while standing in the road. Your cat needs to see that for you, the road is also a scary place., While it may be true that many cats enjoy time outside, it may not always be possible to train them how to stay safe while outside. If you have a cat that is very skittish, and doesn’t enjoy being touched, you may not be able to train him outside safely.If you really wish to train a cat such as this to be outdoors, you will first need to spend significant time indoors with him in order to gain his trust. In the event that something goes awry outside, you will need your cat to trust completely that you will keep him safe. Otherwise, he will most likely run in whatever direction gets him away from whatever is frightening.

, If you live in an areas where wild animals also roam around, your cat will be in great danger. If this is the case where you live, it is probably best to keep your cat indoors, unless you are able to take him out for walks on a leash.Several wild animals can pose a big threat for cats that are outdoors. For example, coyotes, foxes, hawks, and snakes can easily kill your cat if they catch him. Other animals, such as raccoons and skunks pose a threat, particularly if they have been infected with rabies.

, You should not take your cat out at certain times of the day, for example, when wild animals are likely to be most active, when there are likely to be many cars on the street, or when you have recently applied pesticides or chemicals to the area outside your house.You should also not let your cat outdoors when he has been misbehaving. The outdoors should be seen as a reward for good behavior. If your cat has not been so good, then don’t reward him by taking him outside.
You should not take your cat out at twilight, or after dark, especially if you live in an area where there are wild animals. This time of the evening is when these animals tend to be most active, not to mention that it will be difficult for you to see your cat.
You should also avoid letting your cat out on holidays where fireworks are used to celebrate. For example, the Fourth of July, New Year’s Eve, and Cinco de Mayo. The fireworks may frighten, or even injure your cat., It is important that, before taking your cat outdoors, you give him adequate time to trust you. Cats are not particularly trusting animals, particularly if they have been abused by humans in the past. If you have recently adopted your cat from a shelter, he may be very timid.


Remember though, that having a cat who trusts you can be very rewarding. It may not be as easy to gain his trust as you hoped, but if you treat him with kindness and patience, he will come to trust you, little by little.
If your cat is very shy, you should keep him indoors for at least a few months, even up to a year. This will give him time to learn that this is his home, and that you are the one who keeps him safe.
Never, ever strike your cat. Hitting your cat will teach him that you won’t necessarily always be a safe place to go. It is very stressful for your cat to be physically punished, and can damage your relationship permanently.

Recognize the meow.,
Understand what the meow is about.,
Pay attention to nonverbal cues.",How to Teach Your Cat to Talk1," Cats can make as many as 16 different meows. Paying attention to the different sounds can help you better communicate with your cat.


A short meow is typically a greeting.
Multiple meows signal excitement
A mid-pitch meow is a request, likely for food.
A deep “Mrow” is usually a complaint.
A high pitch “Rroww!” is an indication of anger or pain.
A long drawn out “mrrroww” is usually a demand.;
, In nature, cats only meow as kittens to get attention for their mothers. When they realize you do not respond to their other signals, they learn to meow. Often the meow is a way to communicate something the cat wants, but it can have other meanings as well.


Most frequently your cat’s meow is trying to articulate a request. A meow often means that it wants food, attention, or to be allowed into a room.
A meow can also signal distress. Cats vocalize when they are in heat, lonely, stressed, angry, or in pain. They also become more vocal when they get older.
Other times a meow is a simple greeting similar to a “hello.”, Some of the most important ways that cats communicate are through body language. Cats, for example, have a complex language of signals that they make with their tails.


When a cat looks you in the eyes and makes a long, slow blink, they are showing affection. This is sometimes compared to a kiss.
A cat approaching you with its tail in the air is a greeting that suggests your cat is happy to see you. This has been compared to a handshake.If the fur on your cats hair is standing up, this is a sign that it is angry or afraid.
When your cat's tail is low, or between its legs, it is insecure or anxious.
A tail thrashing back and forth is a sign that your cat is angry. The faster it moves it back and forth, the angrier it is."

Keep in mind that positive reinforcement is the most powerful tool you have when training animals.,
Gather up your cat, the bin you want her to put her toys in (this can be an old shoebox, plastic container, etc), and several of her favorite toys in a room.,
Teach your cat to hold a toy in her mouth and carry it.,
After your cat can take a few steps while carrying the toy, have her take three or more steps carrying the toy before praising her.,
Once your cat will carry the toy around on her own, encourage her to take it towards the toy bin.,
When your cat is good at doing this, encourage her to carry the toy up to the toy box using the same method as described above.

,
When your cat is to the point that she will hold the toy over the toy basket, encourage her to drop the toy by gently removing it from her mouth while saying ""Drop"" or ""Release"", or by giving her a treat, which will cause her to drop the toy in the toy bin so she can eat the treat.

,
Gradually work towards getting your cat to drop the toy in the toy bin by praising her when she does well, ignoring her mistakes when she makes them, and helping her understand that the command ""Clean Up"" means take the toy to the toy bin, and ""Drop"" means put it in the toy bin.

,
Eventually, your cat will begin doing this behavior without prompting, and you will be able to get your cat to put a toy away by saying your chosen command for this action.

",How to Teach Your Cat to Put Its Toys Away," If you lavishly reward your cat while training her, she will learn what you teach much faster than if you punish her or yell at her when she does something wrong.;
,


Try to bring your cat into the room where you want to keep the toy box permanently, so your cat learns where this box is located. You may also want to bring some cat treats with you to praise your cat when she behaves well.

, Encourage your cat to play with one of her favorite toys.


Once the toy is in her mouth, prompt her to walk forwards, either by sitting in front of her and calling her name or tempting her with a treat. As she does this, give her the command, ""Clean up!"", or something else short that you would like to use as the command for this behavior. When your cat takes a step or two forwards while holding the toy, praise her.

,


Be sure that each time you want her to carry her toy, you give the command for this action so she learns the meaning of your chosen phrase. Gradually work up in your training until your cat will carry the toy around the room.

,


Put your cat on one side of the room holding her toy and go sit on the other side.
Call your cat over to you or prompt her with a treat.
Be sure that you tell her your chosen command so she associates walking towards her toy box with this command. When your cat reaches you, praise her.

Get a clicker.,
Use vocal cues.,
Give your cat a bell to ring.",How to Teach Your Cat to Sit1," Using a clicker involves reinforcing positive behavior with a sound. When the cat does something you approve of, like squatting towards a sitting position, reward the cat and hit the clicker. Try to avoid rewarding the cat without the clicker noise so there is no confusion about why a reward is happening.Initially you may have to use the clicker with a treat without any action by the cat, just to get the ball rolling.As a substitute for a clicker you can use a ball point pen. ;
, Begin the process by making a specific, repeatable sound before feeding the cat. Preferably, this sound can be before opening a can of cat food. Once the cat associates that sound with food, the sound can be used for specific training without food. When you see your cat start to move towards a sit, make the vocal cue. If the cat sits, make the same sound.


A great way to use this vocal training is to simply get your cat to come to you. After the cat has made a solid association, initiate the training in small steps.Don’t allow your cat to jump for the treat. The same vocal cue strategies used to reinforce positive actions can be used to tell your cat that the treat isn’t permitted without sitting down.

, Try putting a bell at your cat’s eye level and showing it a treat. When the cat wants something and starts to meow, ignore it. When the bell is rung, however, look for the cat to sit and reward it immediately. Ignore destructive behavior. Wait for the desired reaction (e.g. squatting towards a sit or actually sitting).

Discover your cat's favorite treat.,
Keep the treats nearby.,
Realize that teaching is a multi-step process.,
Clicker train your cat.,
Teach your cat to sit.,
Teach your cat to stay.,
Challenge your cat.,
Distract and test your cat.,
Be patient.",How to Teach a Cat to Stay," While your cat may like a variety of treats, you should find the one that motivates her the most. The best way to do this is to wait until your cat is hungry and place small amounts (about a teaspoon) of different treats into separate bowls. Place the bowls side by side and watch carefully to see which she pays the most attention to and eats the fastest. You might even notice her paying more attention to you when you prepare her favorite treat.Try lots of different foods, including ham, steak, tuna, freeze dried prawns, cubes of cheese, and commercial cat treats.;
, Since you'll be training several times a day (at least twice daily) over the weeks to come, have a ready supply of the treats. You may want to keep them in a treat pouch or small plastic container. This way, you can keep the treats on you so you'll be ready for any impromptu training opportunities that come up.


If your cat has a medical condition, especially anything gastro-intestinal or allergy related, check with your veterinarian to make sure the chosen treat is suitable for your pet., Once you've found what motivates your cat, you may think you're ready to train your cat to stay. However, you'll actually need to get your cat used to a clicker. This training device will help her associate the click-clack sound of the clicker with a treat or reward.By preparing your cat to associate training with rewards, you're actively teaching her to stay rather than simply rewarding her with treats for doing something she intended to do anyway.

, Buy a clicker, a small plastic device that makes a click-clack sound when pressed. Teach your cat to associate the clicker with rewards by pressing the clicker and giving the cat a treat. Repeating this creates the basis of your early training sessions. This way, your cat actively looks for a treat when you press the clicker. Once this happens you are ready to move on with teaching.Once your cat is clicker trained, you can use the clicker to reinforce other positive behaviors.

, Wait until the cat is walking around, rather than just sitting anyway. Get her attention by showing her a treat and when she approaches hold the treat just in front of her nose. Sweep it backwards in an arc over her head and as she follows the treat her bottom will drop to the ground. The instant her bottom touches the ground, mark the action with a click-clack. At the same time, firmly say ""sit"" and then give her a reward.Spend several 5 minutes session teaching her this, until she is sitting on command.
Don't forget you can train whenever you are in the same room as your cat. You don't need to wait for a formal training session.

, Get your cat to sit, then take one step away from her. If she doesn't move, click-clack (to mark the stay behavior) and say ""stay."" If she follows the command, immediately give her a treat. Repeat this several times and then end the session by giving her lots of praise.If your cat loses concentration and wanders off, end the session. Don't force her to train.

, Once your cat has shown she can follow the command to stay, work on gradually extending the physical distance between you. Start by taking two steps away, and once she is staying regularly, you can increase it to three, four, or more.Take it slowly, and if the cat loses focus and gets up, then retrace your steps on the next session.

, Ask your cat to stay while you throw a toy as a distraction. If she has learned to stay, she won't chase after the toy. However, if she goes after the toy, return to practicing the command. Seeing you throw the toy and command her to stay will help your cat better understand what you're asking her do to by staying.You may want to leave the toy in sight during following training sessions. This way, your cat will get used to its presence and will be more likely to stay when you throw the toy again.

, Some cats will learn this command in a few days, while others could take weeks or months. If you find that your cat loses interest quickly or doesn't respond to the commands, change when you train. Train just before she normally eats, so she's more motivated by the treats.Or, reduce the length of your training sessions until she starts to respond. Just be prepared to give training as long as your cat needs. Above all else, make sure your cat is enjoying the sessions, so she's more interested in training.Do fun active things with your cat after training sessions. For example, you might play a game with a wing-on-a string. This will also help use up any energy she saved up by sitting and staying during the training session.

Get help with a cat that won’t respond to its name.",How to Teach a Cat to Recognize Its Name," Cat’s generally respond better to shorter, pleasant-sounding names. While you might have your heart set on “Princess FluffyBottom McPhee,” you should probably shorten it to “Fluffy” for training purposes.If you are adamant that your cat’s moniker “Sir William the Vicious of Belvedere” cannot be shortened, you could just train him to come to “kitty.”


Don’t change your cat’s name once it has become used to it. This will just confuse the cat.
The introduction of new nicknames can also confuse your cat. Consistency is key.;
, You can start training your cat when it is still a kitten, and the younger the cat is, the more receptive it will be to learning its name. An older cat can still learn new tricks, of course, but perhaps not as quickly.

, Remember that verbal praise is not going to impress or motivate your cat. Instead, you need to provide immediate, tangible rewards that your cat enjoys. A cat will always appreciate a tasty food treat like a bit of tuna or cheese, a spoonful of wet food, or a commercial cat treat. Cats will also respond to nonfood rewards if it’s something they really enjoy, like a bout of laser pointer tag, or a hearty scratch behind the ears.The kind of reward that works best will depend on the cat, so prepare to do some experimentation.
Make sure you have enough kitty treats on hand to get through the training process.

, Dogs are easy to train because they are social creatures that want to please humans, and feel rewarded by a simple “Good dog!” or other verbal praise. Most cats, on the other hand, are less concerned about what you think of them, and more interested in what you are going to do for them.Cats respond well to rewards and can readily learn new tricks if you are patient with them and offer them something they really want when they do well.

, Only use your cat’s name when you are calling or speaking pleasantly to it. You should never use a cat’s name to scold or reprimand it; for that a simple but firm “No” will suffice., The best way to get your cat interested in training is to feed the cat a bit less than usual so it is slightly hungry and more eager to earn food treats. Then simply approach the cat and say its name, and then present it with a small food treat. Repeat this two or three times. Then walk a few feet away from the cat, and repeat the process but add the word “come” or “here” to the cat’s name. (For example “Charlie, come” or “Here, Sneakers.” Either works, just be consistent.) When the cat approaches you, pet her and offer her a treat. Then move a bit further away and repeat.Make sure the cat links her name to the pleasant reward. This means saying her name, then immediately giving the reward.
Repeat this activity, calling the cat 10 to 20 times per session, once or twice a day until the cat reliably responds to its name.

, After about a week, you can begin calling your cat from longer distances. Start by calling your cat from another room. Eventually try calling her from every room in your house. Once she is reliable about coming when called inside the house, you can also try calling her outside (assuming she is an outside cat). , If there are other members of your household, get them involved with teaching your cat its name. Make sure everyone uses the same phrase to call the cat. Eventually, you can teach the cat to run back and forth between two people, alternately calling her and offering a treat.

, If your cat refuses to respond to her name, she may have a hearing problem. White cats, in particular, are far more likely to be deaf.Your vet can screen your cat’s hearing so you will know for sure.


Some cats are simply more difficult to train than others. If the cat’s lack of response or general behavior is troubling, consult with an animal behaviorist to get help identifying and rectifying the problem. Ask your vet or look online for a recommendation."

, After your cat no longer seems to respond, take a break. Try again the following day. Repeat every day until your cat regularly responds when you meow.

Try to remove sounds, toys, food, and anything else your cat may be tempted by.Be sure to choose a room in which your cat is comfortable and used to.
Close blinds and/or curtains to keep exterior distractions to a minimum.

, Cats won’t necessarily react to normal treats. They want treats that are soft food, like fish, chicken, or turkey. Use something they love and rarely get.You may be able to successfully train your cat without treats. Sometimes a favorite toy works just as well.

, Begin by rewarding your cat when it starts to sit. Reward each movement. Every time the cat hints at sitting down, or better, actually sits down, give it a reward.Begin simply and grow off of each movement., The angle of the treat will be such that the cat has to look upward, and the cat's anatomy is beneficially angled. This should cause the cat to sit down.

, The ASPCA recommends repeating training about 40 times per day within two five minute training sessions.The training could be just the squatting motion, or the raising of the cat's head, as long as the movement is a precursor to sitting.


Practicing too much could be counter-productive.Be sure to reinforce the training on subsequent days until the cat gets it.

Motivate with treats over praise.,
Be positive.,
Sit on the ground.",How to Teach Your Cat to Sit3," Motivating a cat isn’t likely with praise. They don’t work in a partnership, so there is no reason to really do what you command. When the cat sits, you can praise it, but be sure to do so with a treat as well.

, Cats do not respond well to dominance or stress. When stressed, they are likely act out, and they certainly won’t be responsive to training. To avoid negative reactions from your cat, be sure not to react negatively to failure or setbacks.When your cat doesn't sit immediately, and it won't, remember the following:


Do not punish. There is a good chance that no matter the punishment, your cat won't make an association between it and the action. If it doesn't sit and you punish it, there may be an association with any number of other things instead of your actual command.Do not get physical with the cat. Hitting, shaking, or slapping could make it fearful. If that happens, the cat may avoid you, which will make training nearly impossible.
Do not force the issue. The more you force it, the more likely the cat will stress out. Cats learn on their own terms, and at different speeds. You may just frighten the cat if you push too hard.
Use the treats solely for training. If you use the treats too often, your cat will start to beg. It will pester you for a treat when it does anything whatsoever.

, You will want to be on the ground with your cat to show you want its attention. It may also help because being higher than your cat could appear like you’re about to pounce and show dominance. The extra focus should help when trying to persuade your cat to start the sitting movements."

Remove resources.,
Use a motion-operated compressed air canister.,
Encourage your neighbors to neuter their cats.,
Contact an organization to have stray cats neutered.",How to Stop Cats from Peeing on the Front Porch1," Remove food, water and other things that could be highly prized by visiting cats. This reduces the ""value"" of the porch and makes it less worth it to stake a territorial claim.;
, An ideal deterrent is a canister of compressed air that is activated by a motion sensor. These canisters sense motion on the ground. Once triggered, they deliver a squirt of compressed air, which cats hate. If the visiting cat perceives your porch as risky or hostile, the cat will not want to visit anymore.


This tactic is one that the cat won’t associate with you. If the cat thinks you're causing the hostility, this might not solve the problem. For example, if you shout at the cat each time he is around, he will learn to wait until you are not around, and then he will come to pee on your porch. He associates the punishment with you instead of the porch. Therefore, the cat will avoid you but will visit when you're not around.

, No amount of deterrents is going to bring the problem under control until the neighborhood cats are neutered.Both male and female cats often urinate on your porch to advertise that they are sexually available to other cats. Talk with your neighbors to see if they will agree to neutering their cats.


You should positively identify your neighbor's cat before talking to your neighbor. Watch for the offending cat by either watching through the window or setting up a security camera.
Rule out your cat by trying fluorescein dye. Fluorescein is a harmless orange dye that, when ingested, turns urine bright green, and it fluoresces when illuminated with an ultraviolet light. Get fluorescein dye from your vet and add some of the dye to your cat’s food. After a day or two, inspect the areas on your porch where there is urine. Try this at night and shine a black light on the porch. If you see something fluorescent, your cat is the likely culprit, instead of your neighbor's cat., If you have a population of strays in the neighborhood, chances are they won't be neutered. There are numerous charitable organizations which are geared towards trapping and neutering stray cat populations. Search the internet for an organization near you.


You can also contact your local veterinarian. Chances are the clinic undertakes neutering at a discounted rate for any nearby charities. The vet can usually give you contact details for a local charity coordinator.

Don’t bother covering surfaces with tin foil or plastic.",How to Stop Cats from Peeing on the Front Porch2," Neighborhood cats be attracted to your porch by food left out for wildlife or your own pet. Other cats will grow accustomed to finding food here, and they may mark the area with urine. Remove the food so there is no longer a benefit to claiming your porch., Some cats are attracted to certain substrates, such as soil. These can be tempting to use as a toilet. Remove any plant pots from the porch so that cats don’t have this option for where they urinate.

, Eliminate spaces that are cozy and inviting for cats to visit. These might include a chair with a cushion on it, or a objects such as boxes and crates that a cat could shelter in., Some advice urges homeowners to put tin foil or plastic over areas they want to protect. Cats will likely continue spraying regardless, so these methods are generally unproductive.

This happens when the cat feels challenged or insecure for some reason. Most commonly, he feels a threat to his territory. The key to stopping this behavior is to help him to feel more secure.If you have a cat flap or another means of another cat entering the house, it is crucial to make sure no strays can get inside your house.


Lock the cat flap and let your cat in and out on demand.
Use a microchip activated cat flap that is programmed to respond only to your cat's microchip.

, A diffuser gives off a synthetic version of the hormones released by a nursing mother cat that make the kittens feel safe and content. These are a handy way of reducing an individual's stress levels.Ask your vet for a feline pheromone diffuser such as Feliway to help decrease your cat's anxiety levels.

, Make sure you play with it regularly. Try for 5-10 minute sessions, 3 times a day. A tired and content cat is less likely to be stressed about what's happening outside., If neighborhood cats are making your cat act territorial, keep your cat indoors.


Seeing neighborhood cats outside may cause stress. Consider blocking the view through the lower half of windows looking over the front yard, so your cat cannot sit and look at other cats.Keeping your cat indoors can also help you identify if your cat is the one urinating on the porch. If the smell fades when you keep your cat inside, your cat might be the culprit."

By cleaning away cat urine with a household cleaner, you are merely replacing that cat's scent with another urine-based smell. This actually increases the culprit's instinct to spray, because he feels his scent has been overwritten by another., To thoroughly deodorize urine smells without leaving a smell behind, create a deodorizing solution. Use enzymatic or biological laundry detergent (such as Seventh Generation or Biokleen) mixed with water.


Mix 9 parts water with 1 part laundry detergent. Spray on the surface that you want to clean. Scrub with a brush or rag to wash the contaminated area. Choose a nontoxic detergent.
Some surfaces such as carpet, soft furnishings, and painted walls may not be color fast. Test an inconspicuous spot before embarking on a major clean.
If carpet or fabric has been sodden with urine over a period of time, it is impossible to get the smell out. In this case, throw the item away., Using clean water, thoroughly rinse the area where you’ve applied the deodorizing solution. Dry thoroughly with a clean towel.

, Use a spray bottle to cover the most frequently used areas where the cat urinates. Work the rubbing alcohol into any cracks or crevices with a nail brush. Allow the area to air dry., Avoid the temptation to put a strong smelling substance on the porch to deter the cats. The cat will merely feel the need to refresh his scent marker and hence will return to the spot to urinate.


Refrain from using essential oils such as eucalyptus or rosemary. Although it is popularly believed that cats don't like the smell of these oils, this approach can actually be counterproductive."

Purchase a harness and leash.,
After getting a harness you can put it on your cat.,
Be patient.,
Practise inside the house, then in your back garden/yard.,
When you're both ready to go for your walk, attach the harness and leash to the cat and let your cat get used to being outside.,
Pace around with your cat for a while, until he or she is ready to walk.

,
Be careful that your cat doesn't come to harm from dangers such as traffic or dogs.,
Have fun taking your new walking buddy around!

",How to Take a Cat for a Walk," Do not use a collar because cats will probably manage to escape. Furthermore if a cat tugs on her collar it can damage her windpipe, whereas a harness will distribute the pressure more evenly, causing less damage.;
, If she doesn't want to, just play, do not force her to wear it. It may take days, weeks or months before your cat will let you put his harness on and guide her with the leash.

, Most cats probably won't like being restrained or lead around by a mere human. Some cats will never let you put the harness on them without freaking out, and you should respect this. Never force the harness on a cat if it is having a fit.

, Let your cat get used to it!

, If your cat is an indoor cat, it will be very different for her outside. Let her adjust to the new noises/smells/etc. Be prepared to sit with her and wait for her to be ready to walk.

,, Be ready to pick your kitty up and take her home if she is in danger or scared. Be sensible and take precautions such as carrying your cat across roads.

Determine your ability to tame a feral cat.",How to Tame a Feral Cat," The feral cat should remain in an enclosed area until she becomes more comfortable with you and her new environment. Prepare a small and quiet room, such as a bathroom, that is away from people and other pets.Place a litterbox, a food bowl, a water bowl, and some toys in the room.Make sure the room’s windows and doors are closed to prevent her from escaping. Also, check the room for any holes or cracks where she could manage to get through.If there are shelves in the room, remove anything that she could knock over.Create hiding places in the room (e.g., upside-down cardboard boxes with holes cut out).For at least the first few days, use organic potting soil as litter—the feral cat will be much familiar with this than regular kitty litter.Light the room with a nightlight, rather than turning on the overhead light. The darkness will help the feral cat feel more secure in her new environment.To get her accustomed to human scents, place some old pieces of clothing (e.g., socks, sweatshirts) in the room.The feral cat will need at least a few hours to allow her to settle in.;
, You will need to take the feral cat to the veterinarian to receive some much-needed veterinary care (e.g., vaccinations, dewormings, FeLV and FIV testing).It will probably be easier to transport the feral cat in the carrier, rather than the trap.Leave the carrier door open and place some blankets and treats in the carrier to make it more comfortable for her.
Place a towel over the trap and carrier to create another safe hiding place., Don’t be surprised if the feral cat bolts if you try to get near her.Setting a humane live animal trap will be the only safe way for you to catch her and bring her into your home. A live animal humane trap is designed such that the door will close behind the feral cat when she steps on a panel at the bottom of the trap.To entice her into the trap, place some tasty morsels of the food at the back of the trap.
She may be frightened at the sound of the door closing when she steps on the panel. However, she will not be injured.Live human traps are available online. Consider contacting your local animal shelter or animal control to inquire about borrowing a trap.Place some comfortable bedding (towels or blankets) in the trap.

, Taming a feral cat should be done inside your home. However, the feral cat’s fear of human interaction presents a problem with bringing her into your home.Feeding the feral cat outdoors can help her at least begin to trust you,or at least trust that you will feed her.


Feed her at the same time each day.

, After the feral cat has had some time to settle in, begin to interact with her to start getting her accustomed to human interaction. To prevent scratches and bites, wear long sleeves, pants, gloves, and shoes when you enter the room.You may also want to have a piece of cardboard that you can hold up in case she lunges at you.Plan to spend time with her at about the same time every day—having a routine will help her settle into your home.Knock before you open the door, and enter slowly.Talk to her quietly as you tend to her needs (e.g., cleaning her litter box, replacing her food and water.Do not stare or make eye contact with the feral cat—she could perceive this as aggression. Instead, avert your eyes and lower your head.As she becomes more comfortable with you, sit with her for about an hour each in the mornings and evenings. Other than talking to her, you can read a book or work quietly on your laptop.Do not try to handle her at the beginning.Attempts at handling her would likely result in you getting bitten, scratched, and hissed at.

, Playing with the feral cat will help her continue to get more comfortable with you before you handle her. Purchase some lightweight cat toys from your local pet store and let her play with those while you are in the room with her.You can also make a homemade ‘kitty tease toy’: attach a small piece of cloth to a string, and attach the string to a small stick.Do not let her play with the tease toy alone. She could swallow the string, which could lead to intestinal obstruction that would require extensive veterinary care., Handling a feral cat can be fraught with danger—she may quickly put up her defenses and attack you out of fear. Observing her body language will let you know if she is comfortable with moving to the next level of human interaction. Body language that indicates she is not ready include lunging at you and growling at you with her ears laid flat against her head.She may also hiss at you if she does not want you to handle her.
If she seems relatively calm when you around her, that is a good clue that she may be ready to be handled.

, Still wary of more human interaction, the feral cat will need time to adjust to your hand. To begin, place your hand flat on the floor, palm side down.Let her come to you, and allow her to bump into your leg, arm, or hand.Resist the temptation to pet her. Her explorations of you are her way of testing you to see if you are a threat.Keep your hand a small distance away from her at first. As she becomes more comfortable with your hand, move it and your body closer to her.You must allow her to initiate the contact. She may attack if you make the first move.

, Petting the feral cat may feel like a moment of truth—will she welcome you or attack you? Set a toy near your hand and place your hand flat on the floor. When she approaches, sniffs, and nudges your hand, take this as your cue to slowly lift your hand and hold it at her eye level.Briefly leave your hand at her eye level, then start petting her.Pay attention to her body language—tensed muscles, a swishing tail, dilated pupils, and flattened ears are all signals that you should stop petting her and give her some space.Keep the first petting session brief.It is best to stop petting her before she lets you know she’s had enough., If you have a feral kitten, you can try picking her up and setting her in your lap when she becomes more comfortable with you petting her. Keeping in mind that she is still a wild animal, slowly and gently wrap her up with a towel (leaving room to scruff her) to prevent you from getting scratched or bitten.Turn her body such that her head is facing away from you. Scruff her by firmly gripping the skin at the base of her neck.Grasp the skin as close to her ears as possible, making sure not to grasp too tightly.Gently lift the her up in the air and set her gently in your lap. If she will let you, pet her and talk to her in a soothing voice.Although kittens are scruffed by their mothers, do not be surprised if the feral kitten does not like being scruffed by you. Read her body signals to determine if she likes or dislikes being scruffed.

Never reach for a feral cat or kitten from its front., Grooming the feral cat not only gets her more comfortable with human interaction and handling, but also helps you keep her skin and coat healthy. Brush her with a soft-bristled pet brush.You can also comb her with a flea comb to remove fleas.Combs and brushes are available at your local pet store.
Flea infestations in feral kittens can be very dangerous, leading to potentially fatal anemia.In addition to combing her with a flea comb, she will need to take a flea preventative (available through your veterinarian).

, Feral cats are either totally feral (no human contact or only negative human contact), semi-feral (some positive human contact), or converted feral (abandoned house cat that becomes semi-feral).Totally feral cats will be the most difficult to tame and socialize, and converted feral cats will be the easiest.Semi-feral cats look to humans to feed them, but do not seek further human interaction. This minimal level of human interaction teaches them important social cues of the human world.Semi-feral cats are sometimes referred to as ‘community cats.’, Having a rough estimate of the feral cat’s age can let you know how easy or difficult it may be to tame her. Feral kittens, particularly those younger than 10 to 12 weeks old, are usually easily tamable.Older feral cats who have been feral for a long time will be most difficult to tame, if you can tame them at all.Feral kittens should not be removed from their mothers until they are weaned, at approximately 13 weeks of age. This is very important. Puppies are okay to be separated from their mother at 8 weeks, kittens are not! To separate them to early can lead to life long behavioral and developmental issues. Experts widely agree that for kittens, 13 weeks is the appropriate time for separation.).If you see a feral kitten with his mother, trap the mother and kitten at the same time. Keep them together inside your home until the kitten is fully weaned. Contact the local animal rescue to have the mother spayed and returned to her colony., Taming a feral cat is difficult and comes with no guarantee that the taming will be successful. In addition to being a challenge, taming a feral cat can take a lot of time: feral kittens could be tamed in as little as two to six weeks,but it could be a year or more before an adult feral cat is tamed.Acclimating a feral cat to your home and socializing her could require several hours of your time per day, potentially for months on end.Be honest with yourself if you can handle this level of daily commitment.
Paying for the feral cat’s veterinary care will likely be expensive. Determine if you are in a financial position to pay for the feral cat’s care.

Set up the ladder.,
Cover the ladder in carpet.,
Leave the ladder out.,
Climb up the ladder yourself.,
Coax the cat up.,
Help the cat.",How to Teach a Cat to Climb a Ladder1," Presumably, you are not trying to get your cat to climb a ladder so it can help you patch the roof or clean the gutters. Since this exercise is purely theoretical anyways, set the ladder up in a safe place and make sure it is does not reach too high in the air. This will prevent you and the cat from hurting yourselves when trying this out., A cat will be far more likely to climb up a ladder if it can comfortably grip the steps. Since cats use their claws to dig in and gain traction, cover the ladder steps in carpeting or some other soft cloth to help the kitty get its footing., Once you have covered the ladder in cloth, just leave it out. Cats love to investigate objects they are not used to. Ladders only work for one thing, climbing up and down. Just leaving this interesting new thing out for the cat may be enough to get the cat to climb it.A cat that is not forced, watched, or feeling that it is obliged to perform is more likely to discover the ladder and make an ascent for the fun of it, without your interference or coaxing.

, Cats are curious creatures. Use this curiosity to your benefit. Climb the ladder yourself and see if your cat is interested enough in what you are doing to simply follow you up.

, If your cat doesn’t immediately follow you up the ladder, trying calling the cat’s name and encourage it to climb to the top. This may be enough to get your cat scurrying right up to the top next to you.

, If the steps above don’t work, then manually help your cat climb the ladder. Take its legs (not tightly) and move its legs up the ladder gently, one rung at a time. If your cat struggles at all, stop. This is a really unnatural exercise and no cat should be forced to attempt it.

Put the ladder in place.,
Put treats at the top of the ladder.,
Use a toy.,
Tap the top of the ladder.,
Try clicker training.,
Wait and see.",How to Teach a Cat to Climb a Ladder2," Place the ladder in a safe place in your house, preferably above a soft surface. Make sure the ladder doesn’t lead to anything too high to avoid feline and human injuries.It is probably wise to make sure this ladder doesn’t lead to any surfaces you’d prefer to keep the cat off, like counters, shelves, or the kitchen table.
Again, make sure the ladder is covered in a soft cloth or carpeting so the cat can get adequate traction.

, You can climb the ladder yourself. Or, if you're afraid of heights, just put the treats as high as you can reach and tap on the step with the treats on it to encourage the cat to climb up.

, If your cat likes to play with a particular toy, use that toy to motivate your cat up the ladder. A string will work best for this, as your cat can follow the string up rung by rung. Keep the cat moving after the toy until it has navigated all the rungs and reached the top of the ladder.

, After trying the treats and toys out, try to encourage your cat by tapping the top of the ladder and calling its name. This final nudge of encouragement may be enough to get your cat up the ladder.

, Teach your cat to associate a click-clack noise with a tasty treat. Then lure your cat to the first rung on the ladder. Click and reward your when he looks at the rung or puts a paw on it. Gradually, your cat will learn he gets a reward for stepping on the ladder and you can start to progress him upwards.

, After trying all of these techniques, your cat may come to associate the ladder with a toy or obstacle to be played with. If this is the case, the cat may ascend the ladder on its own without any treats, toys or encouragement from you.


Cats are secretive animals. You may want to try setting a camera up around the ladder to see if the cat may be using it when you aren’t around.

Recognize play aggression.,
Relax your extremities when bitten.,
Say “ouch” and gently pull away.,
Remove yourself from the play session.",How to Stop a Cat from Biting or Scratching During Play1," If your cat’s ears flatten, its tail flickers and it stares at you, it may be exhibiting play aggression.However, it shouldn’t look like your cat is in pain. There shouldn’t be any growling or hissing sounds, which could indicate more serious forms of aggression due to physical pain or injury.If your cat is exhibiting aggression and you don’t know if it is play aggression or aggression due to a serious illness, you should get it checked out by a veterinarian.;
, If your cat bites an extremity and you become tense or pull away quickly, they will instinctively double down on the bite. To avoid this scenario, you should simply relax your extremity, which should induce your cat to let go of you. , If your cat scratches you, you can firmly say “ouch” to indicate that they have hurt you. Then, gently pull your body away from their grasp.Avoid yelling, which could make matters worse.
You could also gently tap their nose to indicate bad behavior.

, If your cat is biting or scratching and will not stop the aggressive behavior, simply walk away from the situation. Go to a different room and avoid contact with your cat to indicate the end of the session. Your cat should eventually learn that the bad behavior leads to the ending of a play session.Avoid picking up or moving your cat after they exhibit bad behavior, since your touch could indicate a reward for the bad behavior.
If your cat acts out very briefly and you don’t want to end the play session, you can use a short, five second time out. Your cat will realize that the biting or scratching results in the loss of their playmate. After five seconds, you can resume the play session. If the aggressive behavior continues, you should end the play session."

Choose an appropriate target.,
Have treats ready.,
Get a clicker.,
Set aside time for training.,
Find a quiet area.",How to Target Train a Cat1," In order to begin target training your cat, you need to select a target. You can use anything from the eraser end of a pencil, a chop stick, a sticky note, or even your hand., Treats are an important aspect of target training. For example, when you first begin training, each time your cat touches the target they should be rewarded with a treat. This is the primary form of reinforcement. Choose a treat that your cat really enjoys and break it into small pieces.If your cat does not get motivated by food, you could use a nice rub as a reward., You can also use a clicker while target training. The clicker acts as a secondary form of reinforcement. Eventually your cat will begin to associate the sound of the clicker with the treat. This can help to speed up the training process.

Clickers are optional for target training.
If you are training a cat that is deaf, you can replace the clicker with a flashlight. This will act as a visible indicator or cue., Training sessions with your cat should be fairly brief. Do not try and train your cat for longer than three to five minutes at a time. When your cat begins to lose interest and no longer attempts to touch the target, you should stop the training session., It is always best to train your cat in a quiet area with few distractions. Choose a location, such as the living room, where your cat spends a lot of time and is completely comfortable. This will help you to gain your cat’s attention."

Give your kitten time to socialize and learn how to play.,
Don’t use your fingers during playtime.,
Use toys during playtime.,
Schedule a regular playtime.,
Avoid punishing tactics.",How to Stop a Cat from Biting or Scratching During Play2," You should give them at least the first two weeks of their life to socialize with their mother and littermates, since separation during this stage often results in aggressive behavior.Kittens learn how to play by interacting with their littermates and mother. For instance, if they bite one of their littermates too strongly, the reaction of the littermate will stop them from biting inappropriately.If kittens are not given sufficient time to socialize with littermates and their mother, they may never learn how to play nicely.A lot of social development happens between the second and seventh week of a cat’s life, but it isn’t until the six month mark that cats start to really understand the social hierarchy in a household.If you get two kittens of about the same age, they will learn how to play nicely with each other. They will understand the pain inflicted by a bite or a scratch, as well as how to reduce such pain by playing nicely., If you start playing with your kitten by wagging your fingers or getting them to latch onto your hands, they will assume this is appropriate behavior. Although it might feel fine when they are small kittens, it will be pretty painful by the time they grow up. So, you should never use your fingers during playtime., By using toys during playtime, you will teach your kitten to direct their attention away from your body and towards an appropriate object, such as a mouse toy. You can use a fishing rod or wand toy, which allows you to keep an appropriate distance between you and your cat while keeping their attention on the toy.

You could also use wrestling type toys, such as furry animals that your cat can pretend to hunt and tackle.

, Every day, you should have an interactive play session scheduled with your cat. Preferably, schedule a fifteen-minute session in the morning and another fifteen-minute session in the evening. The predictability of the play sessions will give your cat a crucial outlet, and help stop any acting out or poor behavior.Regular playtime can help strengthen the bond between you and your cat.

, If your kitten bites or scratches you during playtime, you should avoid hitting them or yelling at them. These tactics will make them want to avoid you altogether and will do nothing to stop the biting and scratching."
"
Cut your cat’s claws.,
Curb hand biting with bad smells.,
Keep some extra toys in your pocket.",How to Stop a Cat from Biting or Scratching During Play3," By trimming your cat’s claws, you will reduce the pain inflicted by their scratching. Although it won’t stop the poor behavior, it can make things more manageable while your cat is learning new habits., Apply Tabasco sauce, another hot sauce or a bitter apple sauce to your fingers prior to playtime. If your cat starts biting your hands during playtime, they will start associating the biting behavior with the bad smell and hopefully stop the behavior., If your cat starts attacking you during playtime, pull out a little toy and throw it for them."

Present the target close to your cat’s nose.,
Click and treat your cat when they look at the target.,
Present the target again.,
Click and treat your cat when it touches the target.,
Move the target slightly.",How to Target Train a Cat2," Begin target training by placing the target in front of your cat’s nose. It should be about 2 inches (5 cm) away from the cat. Your cat should automatically look at the target. It may even move towards the target.You can put a bit of wet cat food on the end of the target to help coax your cat to touch the target., When you cat looks at the target, press the clicker and give the cat a small treat. Your cat will begin to associate the target with the treat. While your cat is eating the treat remove the target from view., Once your cat has finished its treat, present the target again. Place the target directly in front of the cat and close to its face. If the cat does not notice the target after a few seconds, remove it from view and then present it again., This time, wait until your cat touches the target with its nose and then give it a treat. Continue to practice target training by placing the target close to your cat and then giving a treat once they touch it., Once they have gotten the hang of this skill, you can place the target slightly to the left or right of your cat’s face. Similarly, you could position the target slightly above or below your cat’s eyesight. Your cat should move and follow the target.Continue to keep the target close to your cat, but position it so that it is not directly in front of your cat’s face.

"
"
Move the target away from your cat.,
Click and treat once they touch it.,
Continue to move the target further away.",How to Target Train a Cat3," Once your cat has perfected target training at a close range, you can begin moving the target further away. For example, place the target close the cat and then once the cat moves towards the target, pull it further away. The cat should continue to follow the target., Once your cat follows and then touches the target, press the clicker and give your cat a treat., Try placing the target behind the cat, or move it further away from the cat. Continue to train this activity until your cat has mastered the skill of following the target.After a few training sessions, your cat should be able to happily follow the target.

"
Target train your cat to move off surfaces.,
Lure your cat into a crate with a target.,
Use target training to get your cat comfortable with touch.,
Teach your cat to sit.",How to Target Train a Cat4," Target training is an excellent tool for stopping unwanted behaviours. For example, your cat may enjoy sitting on the kitchen counters while you are cooking. In order to stop this behaviour, place the target on the ground. Your cat will jump off the counter in order to touch the target.

You can use this to coax your cat off of any type of furniture.
Alternatively, you could use a target to get your cat to go to a certain space. For example, you may want them to sleep in their own bed or sit on their cat perch.

, Some cats will hide or try to avoid being placed in their carrier. Once your cat is target trained, you can simply place the target near the door of the carrier and your cat will voluntarily enter. This can make trips to the vet much easier and less stressful for both you and your cat.Give your cat a treat once it enters the carrier and touches the target.
You can also coax your cat out of its carrier using a target.

, You may find that your cat is afraid of human touch. This is particularly common among rescue cats. One way to help overcome this is through target training. Once your cat has become comfortable touching a target, replace the target with your hands. Alternatively, you could use your hands as the target right from the beginning.Eventually your cat will associate your touch with a positive reward in the form of a treat.
When using your hand as a target, always keep your hand in a predictable position, such as an open palm, closed fist, or extended fingers.

, Tricks are not only for dogs. Once your cat has mastered target training, you can begin to teach it tricks. For example, you can teach your cat to sit by holding the target in front of the cat’s face and then moving it upwards. Then say “sit.” Your cat should naturally sit as they look upwards at the target. Once sitting, reward the cat with a treat."

, The British shorthair cat has a stocky and broad-shouldered build and a full chest.t has a thick tail that tapers to a round tip., To identify a British shorthair cat, look for short, strong legs.They have rounded paws at the end of each of their four legs., The British shorthair cat, as its name implies, has a short coat. The coat is quite dense, however, and its short length does not prevent it from shedding heavily.It has a crisp or plush feel to it.

The cat’s coat is often a grayish blue, but it could be spotted, white, black, calico, cream, or amber, too.

, The eyes of the British shorthair cat are large and round.They tend to be copper or deep gold in color. Occasionally, British shorthair cats will have blue or deep green eyes., Male British shorthair cats weigh about nine to seventeen pounds (4.1 to 7.7 kg) when full-grown. Females weigh between seven and twelve pounds (3.2 to 5.4 kg). Weigh your cat when it is fully grown to determine whether it could be a British shorthair cat., British shorthair cats tend to be quite healthy. There is, however, a small chance of the cat developing polycystic kidney disease, which can cause cysts in the kidney. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy might also be inherited in British shorthairs.If you’re worried about your cat’s health, talk to your vet about getting a genetic test to check for the likelihood of inherited health problems. DNA testing can also help determine the breed."

If the cats are isolated in cramped cages or pens, or if their living conditions are unsanitary and dirty, you should not buy a British shorthair from that breeder. Cats raised in such conditions are harder to socialize later, and could suggest health problems., Sometimes you will have to wait many months before you can get the cat you want from a breeder. Reputable breeders will not sell kittens until they’ve been weaned from their mothers after they’re 12 to 16 weeks old.

Pay attention to a noisy cat.,
Be on the lookout for smarts.,

Check for an easy-going and sociable cat.",How to Identify a Bombay Cat," One of the main characteristics of a Bombay cat is its black fur, which should be glossy and short. The goal of the original breeder was to create a cat that looked like a miniature panther, hence the fur color., Another defining characteristic of the breed is its eyes. It was specifically bred to have gold or copper eyes, so if the cat you're looking at doesn't have that characteristic, it's not a purebred Bombay., Bombays tend to have rounded edges. That is, they have a rounded head with a short nose. This trend continues throughout the cat's body, with rounded eyes, ears, and feet, as well as a rounded tail., Bombay cats tend to be medium to large cats. They range in weight from six to over twelve pounds, and the males are larger than the females. While they aren't as stocky as the Burmese, they are still very muscular, strongly built cats.Bombays tend to feel heavier than they appear., Bombays generally walk in a certain way. It's a kind of swishing, swaying walk. Interestingly, it mimics the walk of a panther, the large cat the Bombay was bred to look like., Bombay cats are fairly talkative, and they will hold conversations with you. They aren't loud, per se, they just like to talk often. They have a distinctive meow, so you will know when your cat wants your attention.However, not every Bombay cat will show this characteristic., Bombays are pretty smart cats, so watch to see if the cat is able to figure things out. For instance, this might be the cat that will figure out how to open your bedroom door or get the treats that you've hidden on a high shelf. These cats love to be engaged in games of fetch, puzzle games, and other types of fun cat toys., Of course, all cats are naturally curious and inquisitive. However, Bombays are even more so. They will always want to be in the middle of the action, so they can see what's going on., These cats are fairly laid back when it comes to social situations. They do well around families and pets, though they may want to be the dominant pet in the household, particularly if there are other cats.They also enjoy curling up on your lap for some snuggle time."

The coat will feel thick and dense. Semi-long haired Burmillas tend to have a medium-length coat with tufts at their ears and a fringe of fur on the chest, belly, and legs.Burmilla cats will have one of two distinct coat lengths. Some Burmillas are shorthaired, while others have semi-long hair. These are not two different breeds, however. Shorthaired cats can give birth to semi-long haired kittens, and vice versa.;
, The heads of Burmilla cats are gently rounded at the top and have a medium width between their ears. The general shape of the face should resemble a sort of wedge, tapering in from wide cheekbones toward the muzzle. The chin will appear firm with good depth, and should be in line with the tip of the nose when viewed in profile., Burmilla cats have ears that are medium or large with a broad base. The tips will be somewhat rounded. They should tilt forward slightly, something you can see when viewing the cat from the side. When viewed head-on, the outer line of the ear should appear to lead smoothly into the cat’s cheek.Older males might not have ears that lead directly into their cheeks.

, Burmilla cats have a distinctive “M” shape on their foreheads. When examining the cat, look at their forehead for the “M” shape. If present, you might have a Burmilla cat., Burmilla cats have stunning, luminous eyes. The eyes are green and have a range of different hues. Their eyelids are so dark that some breeders suggest that the cats appear to be wearing eyeliner.Younger cats (less than two years old) might have a yellow tinge to their eyes., Burmilla cats have proportional bodies. The back should be straight from the shoulder to the rump. The chest should be rounded and medium in width. Overall the body is medium in length and size.Burmillas are compact but stocky, with heavy bones and substantial musculature.

, Burmilla cats have slender legs, with rear legs slightly longer than front limbs. Their paws should be ovular. The contours of the paws should be discernible and not covered in tufts of wispy fur., Burmilla cats weigh an average of seven kilograms (15 pounds).However, they might weigh up to 12 pounds and still be healthy. If your cat weighs more than seven kilograms, it might simply be obese. Check your cat’s overall dimensions and proportionality against a known Burmilla to determine if it could simply be an obese Burmilla."

Look at the shape of the cat.",How to Identify a Balinese1," Balinese cats are known for their long haired coats. Their coats have a silky texture and lie close to their bodies. They are also known for having minimal shedding of their coats, which is rare among long haired cats.Touch the cat’s coat to confirm the texture. You should also note if there is only minimal shedding on your hand after you touch the cat’s coat.;
, Most Balinese cats have coats that are blue, lilac, chocolate or a dark gray in color. In this sense, Balinese cats can have the same body coloring as Siamese cats.

They can also be affectionate in the same way their Persian ancestors were.Some breeders describe the cat as adventurous but clumsy.Burmillas might enjoy sitting on your lap.
Burmillas might be playful even into adulthood.

, Burmillas are generally healthy. However, they are predisposed to two conditions: polycystic kidney disease and allergies. If your cat has either of these conditions, you might have a Burmilla on your hands.Alternately, if you know you have a Burmilla based on other criteria, have your cat screened for these conditions to prevent or attenuate health problems that might arrive later.

, If you’re still unable to determine whether you have a Burmilla cat based on its behavior and appearance, you could get its genome partially sequenced. The vet will check your cat’s DNA by taking a sample from the inside of its mouth, then checking it against that of a known Burmilla specimen. To have DNA testing performed on your cat, contact your vet."

Research Burmilla cats.,
Decide what kind of cat experience you want.,
Buy from a reputable breeder.,
Adopt from a rescue shelter.,
Check the conditions in which the cat is kept.,
Be patient.",How to Identify a Burmilla Cat3," Before obtaining a Burmilla cat, you should find out all you can about them. You should be able to recognize Burmilla cats immediately upon seeing one, and should also know what sort of care the cat needs. Consult veterinary literature, encyclopedia entries, and other trustworthy sources to learn more about Burmilla cats., Obtaining a cat of any sort is a serious investment of both time and money. Once you’ve researched Burmilla cats thoroughly, evaluate your situation to determine if it is the right cat for you based on its temperament and attention requirements. If you conclude that it is right for you, decide if you’d like to raise a kitten or if you’d prefer the company of a full-grown cat.While it might be more difficult to obtain a full-grown cat, it is not impossible.

, You can locate a reputable breeder by soliciting recommendations from vets, family members, or other trusted members of your community. You can identify a reputable breeder by certain practices they engage in. For instance, a reputable breeder will not sell to wholesalers or pet stores. If the breeder sells cats online, you should also steer clear.Breeders of repute should provide all shots and vaccines necessary during the cat’s first weeks of life, and have the cat screened for illnesses before selling it. If your breeder doesn’t provide medical documentation that demonstrates the cat is free of illness and has receive its requisite vaccinations, look elsewhere for a Burmilla cat.
Ask your breeder questions. A reputable breeder should be able to answer any questions you might have. You might want to ask, for instance, “Is this cat energetic?” or “How old is this cat?” Questions regarding whether or not the cat is litterbox trained and whether it is friendly are also appropriate.

, Because Burmilla cats are a relatively uncommon breed, it is unlikely you’ll obtain one from a pet shelter or a private seller. But if you do, hold them to the same standards you would a breeder. Contact your local animal shelter or animal rescue organization for information regarding whether they have Burmillas available for adoption., When you meet the breeder you’re working with, check the premises. Is the cat kept outside where it could contract fleas or interact with sick cats? Is it kept crammed in a tiny pen with a bunch of other cats (or even alone)? Does it have bald spots on its fur, wounds, or other signs of ill health? These are all red flags that you should look elsewhere for a Burmilla cat.Good breeders will raise their cats indoors and allow them plenty of opportunities for socialization and play.
If the breeder you’re working with refuses to allow you to see where the cat is being raised, you should be suspicious. This is usually a sign that the breeder is trying to hide something.

, When working with a reputable breeder, you will likely not be able to get a Burmilla immediately. Even if one was born recently, they need to stay with their mother to nurse for about 12 to 16 weeks. Plus, as reputable breeders are much in demand, you may get your name on a wait list, which could further delay your Burmilla experience.If the breeder you’re working with offers you a Burmilla and any other sort of cat you request right away, you should be suspicious about their business practices.

Check for a spotted coat.,
Look for the right color pattern.,
Notice the large, athletic build.,
Watch for active behavior.,
Notice if the cat is affectionate.,
Listen for their distinctive meow.,
Consult a reputable breeder.,
Check with Bengal breed organizations.,
Ask your veterinarian.",How to Identify a Bengal Cat," The Bengal breed’s most distinctive physical feature is their beautiful spotted coat. These cats have inherited these spots from their leopard ancestors. All Bengals will, without exception, have a spotted coat.Bengal cats usually have a shine or shimmer to their coat that is most visible in direct sunlight. Breeders often call this the “glitter” effect.;
, All Bengals have spotted coats, but they can come in a variety of colors. The most common color pattern is a brown or golden background color. But these cats can also come in cinnamon-sorrel colors, gray-beige, charcoal, silver, or blue color patterns.Sometimes the spots link together to resemble more of a striped patterns, but these are still considered Bengal cats. This is often called a marbled pattern variation.

, Bengal cats are usually quite large and lean. They have an athletic build and very rarely develop the saggy belly that many other cat breeds get when they gain a little extra weight.Bengal cats typically weigh between 8 lb (3.6 kg) and 15 lb (6.8 kg) once they reach their adult weight.

, Bengal cats are descendants of wild Asian leopards, so it is in their nature to be active and energetic. They have a penchant for playing and exerting large amounts of energy. Bengals spend more time playing and less time napping than many other breeds of domestic cats.If your cat seems quite docile or lethargic, it is unlikely that the cat is a Bengal.

, Despite their wild ancestry and feral appearance, Bengal cats are very affectionate towards humans – especially their owners. They love to cuddle and play with their family members and spend much of their time engaging with humans.A Bengal cat will not be reclusive or aloof. It will spend most of its time around the humans and other animals of the household.

, Bengal cats are quite vocal and loud, more than many other breeds of cats. They regularly communicate with their owners about what they want and how they feel. They will not hesitate to let their owner know if their litterbox needs cleaning or if they want more food.Even though Bengals express themselves often, their meow is actually more of a gruff little bark sound than an actual loud meow.

, Well-respected Bengal breeders will be able to provide you with a guaranteed Bengal kitten with documented Bengal ancestry. They may even be able to advise you about a cat you already have to determine whether or not it is a true Bengal cat.To find a reputable breeder, you should consider looking for recommendations from Bengal breed organizations.
The International Cat Association has a list of approved Bengal breeders., For almost every breed of cat, there are breed-specific organizations that regulate the standards of the breed and provide information about the breed to interested parties. Find a Bengal organization near you and ask them for more information about the breed.

Try the International Bengal Cat Societyor the Bengal Cat Association., When all else fails, take your cat to your vet’s office and ask for their advice. Your vet will be able to help you analyze the cat’s physical features and personality traits in order to arrive at a conclusion about the cat’s breed.Bengal cats are immune to feline leukemia, so your veterinarian will be able to help you determine if this is the case for your cat.

Apply a conditioner to the coat for gorgeous presentation.",How to Groom a Siamese Cat," With their short hair, Siamese do not shed much and generally don't require a lot of work to keep their coats looking good. However, a quick weekly brushing can help remove loose hair that does accumulate in the coat. Use the tips below to have a successful brushing session:


Use a gentle brush or comb. A Siamese's coat is quite short, so you don't need much to get it brushed. Many breed aficionados recommend smaller rubber brushes.Use any hard-bristled brushes gently.
Brush in the direction of hair growth. Going against the grain can be uncomfortable for the cat.Go slowly, working through one section of the cat's body at a time. Wipe dead hair from the brush between sections.Finish by wiping the cat's coat with a soft towel.;
, This can be intimidating for someone who hasn't done it before, so see WikiHow's guide to trimming a cat's nails if this is your first time. You can find a few basic tips below:


Use a sharp set of human nail clippers or guillotine-style veterinary clippers.Dull blades can make the process uncomfortable.
Hold the cat in your lap and gently squeeze its toe to get it to extend its claw.
Cut the sharp tip off of the nail. Stay away from the quick — the pink park at the base of the nail. Cutting through the quick or near to it is very painful and can result in bleeding.Note that many owners clip the rear claws much less frequently than the front ones since cats don't use them for scratching.

, It's easy to forget that a cat's teeth need taking care of just like a human's most vets recommend brushing about once a day.However, if you can't keep this schedule, brushing weekly or even monthly is better than nothing at all. A few tips for brushing your cat's teeth include:


Use specially-formulated toothpaste from the pet store for cats. Don't use human toothpaste. The fluoride in it can make your cat very sick.Get your cat used to the experience of having its teeth cleaned by wiping a little of the toothpaste on your finger and gently rubbing its teeth and gums. Do this for a few days before your first brushing.Use a soft-bristled cat toothbrush to gently apply the paste to the cat's teeth. Be sure to get the teeth at the back of the mouth and along the sides. Give the cat chances to take short breaks if brushing gets uncomfortable.

, Visits to the vet aren't exactly grooming tasks themselves, but they can affect the way you groom your cat. Regular checkups give the vet a chance to catch health problems early, including those that can change your cat's grooming needs (like skin diseases, etc.). In addition, vets can recommend grooming techniques and resources to help keep your Siamese healthy and happy.The exact schedule you should use for taking your cat to the vet depends on its current health situation. If your cat is healthy, its age is the main factor that affects its vet schedule. See below:0-4 months old: Monthly visits

4 months-7 years old: Visits once or twice per year

7-10 years old: Visits twice per year

Past 10 years old: Visits every 3 months; more often as age-related health problems develop

, Just like people, cats occasionally need to visit the dentist to keep their teeth clean and healthy. Veterinary dentists have access to techniques and tools that allow them to give your Siamese's mouth a ""deep"" cleaning — much more thoroughly than you'll be able to do with a toothbrush and paste.Again, the exact schedule for dental cleanings depends on the health of your cat's teeth. Cats generally begin to need cleanings at around one year of age. After this, most vets will recommend cleanings every few years if the cat's teeth are kept healthy. However, if dental problems develop, cleanings can be needed as often as two or three times per year., There's no way around it — most grooming tasks are at least a little unpleasant for the cat. This can lead the cat to struggle, squirm, and even lash out. Giving the cat a treat after you're done grooming it can help it associate the grooming process with positive feelings. Be consistent with your treat-giving and your cat may even begin to look forward to being groomed.


Siamese cats generally like the same treats as other cats. Try offering small bits of cheese, cooked tuna, chicken or catnip as rewards.Give treats sparingly — they shouldn't make up more than 10% of a cat's calories.

, If your cat can't seem to relax as it's being groomed, you may want to reconsider how and when you are grooming it. See below for suggestions:Groom your cat when it usually has low energy (like before bed or when it's tired out).
Talk to your cat in a calm, soothing voice as you groom it.
If your cat is affectionate, offer it lots of petting and give it breaks. If it isn't, work quickly but gently.
Watch your cat's body language. If you notice your cat pinning its ears back (flattening them against its head), the area you're grooming may be sensitive.

, Because trimming a cat's nails can be tricky and the consequences for screwing up can be very painful for your cat, many owners opt to have an expert do it instead. Most pet groomers that accept cats will be willing to offer this service. Veterinarians will also sometimes do this for free at checkups.

, Some cats never get over having a hard plastic toothbrush thrust into their mouths. As an alternative, you can put a bit of gauze or a rag over your finger and apply a dab of toothpaste to the end. Carefully scrub around the cat's teeth, paying special attention to the teeth at the back and sides of the mouth. Work your finger gradually and gently into the cat's mouth, then go as quickly as possible for your cat's comfort.

, Another tool to help keep your cat's mouth clean when it hates using a toothbrush is to use special foods designed to clean its teeth. You may be able to find these foods and additives at pet stores, but talk to your veterinarian before using them to ensure they are safe for your pet's diet. As a good rule of thumb, products that have the Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC) seal of approval on the packaging should be suitable for most cats, including Siamese.

, Most Siamese cats do a good job of cleaning themselves when they're a little dirty. However, when they're extra dirty or they've gotten into something sticky, they may need a little help. Use these steps to make the bathing process as easy as possible:Use the calming techniques in the section above to get your cat into a mellow mood.
Put down a rubber mat in the sink or tub so your cat doesn't slip.
Use a spray hose to gently wet your cat's fur. Don't spray into the eyes, ears, or face.
Use a solution of one part pet shampoo to five parts water to work up a lather in your pet's fur. Don't use human shampoo, which can be hard on a cat's skin.
Rinse well to remove the shampoo. Dry gently with a clean rag or towel.

, Siamese cats are unlikely to get matted hair because their fur is so short. However, if they do get matted hair in one of the few spots where their fur grows thicker (like around the jowls of male cats), it's nice to know how to get rid of the matting without hurting the cat. See below:


Use the tips of a Greyhound comb — a thin-toothed metal comb — to gently tug at the mat.
Gradually work from the edge of the matted section to the center, loosening the hair if you go.
Resist the urge to thrust the comb into the mat and yank it out. This can be very painful for your cat.
If your pat becomes antsy or uncomfortable, give it a short break and plenty of affection before starting again.

, As noted above, Siamese cats don't need a lot of work to keep their coats looking good. However, if you want your cat to look especially presentable (like if you're entering it in a show), specially conditioners can leave the coat with a warm, shiny finish. Follow the directions on the packaging for proper use — often, all you'll need to do is rub it in with your hands or a towel.


Note that cat conditioners can be somewhat expensive. A small bottle can cost more than $20."

If you've just brought a cat home, give it a room where it can hang out and calm down. Leave it alone (with everything it needs) for about a day before you try interacting with it.Even if your cat isn't new and tends to hide, this method can be a good way for you to reintroduce yourself to the cat.;
, A radio or playlist with gentle music (such as classical) may help the cat relax. It helps them feel not quite as alone. Play it softly so you don't annoy the cat, as cats' ears are more sensitive than ours., To start getting the cat used to you, try just hanging out in the room with it. Don't try to interact with it yet. Just be in the room. Try reading a book, for instance, or just play on your phone. Sitting on the floor can make you seem approachable.Don't force them out of hiding. Give them a chance to come out.
Also, stay relatively quiet, and don't make sudden movements that may startle the cat.

, Once the cat is slowly getting used to you, try encouraging interaction with treats. You could place your hand on the ground and place treats around it. The cat will be encouraged to come up and take treats.You could also try putting chicken (just chicken or another meat) baby food on your fingers or spoon and let the cat lick it.
If they're not quite ready to come out, try dropping a treat near where they are so they associate the treat with you., Even if your cat is still being skittish, playtime may bring them out of their shells a bit. Try using a toy that has a stick with a fleece tail or mouse hanging off of it. Gently brush it back and forth near where the cat is hiding to see if you can encourage it to come play.You could also try wiggling your fingers under a blanket or using a piece of yarn to entice the cat to play.

, Once your cat starts coming out regularly to see you when you're in the room, you can start moving towards petting. Start by letting the cat smell you. Reach out a flat palm for the cat to sniff. If the cat rubs its head on it or seems interested, you can try petting it on the back. If it runs away, you may need to try again another day., Sometimes, a skittish cat will show aggression because that is how it's dealing with being afraid. The important thing is to not yell or lash back at the cat. Just use a soothing voice and back up a little to give the cat space. Continue to talk to it for a few minutes. Don't just rush out of the room. If you just leave, that tells the cat that this behavior gets rid of the thing it's scared of--you!Set out a treat for it before you leave, so it still thinks of you in a positive light.

, If your cat hasn't been around other people much, you'll need to start slowly. The first step is just having your cat be in the same room with someone new. Close off exits, though leave a hiding place in the room, and have your friend just sit and talk with you. That way, the cat can get used to the idea of someone new being around.Hiding spots can include places like underneath a chair or behind a piece of furniture.

, One way to encourage positive interaction is to have playtime while your friend is over. Start with you playing with the cat (using a toy), and then get your friend to take over. Playtime will help your cat associate strangers with something they like., Just like you got your cat to interact with you with treats, you can also encourage interaction with others with treats. Have the person sit on floor. They can place their hand down with treats nearby, which may encourage the cat to approach.However, remember that feeding your cat too many treats can lead to obesity. Cats should only have 20 calories per pound of weight each day to maintain their size, so a 10 pound cat only needs 200 calories a day. When you're feeding treats, make sure you're taking those into account for your cat's caloric needs.Try to pick treats with healthier ingredients. A shorter list of ingredients is better than a longer list. Also, skip treats that have preservatives and dyes., The first part of interaction will likely be smelling. Your friend can even hold out a pointer finger for the cat to smell. Often, just offering it will get a cat to come over and take a good sniff.Keep in mind that some cats may need this introduction each time the person is over.
If the cat seems interested, the person can try to pet it.

, Your cat should take the lead when it comes to interactions. If you try to force a timid cat to interact, it's only going to make the situation worse. However, if your cat can decide to come out on its own, that may make future interactions easier., If you're trying to get a cat more accustomed to being petted, begin with areas the cat likes. For instance, if the cat likes its neck rubbed, start there. Move on to stroking parts it isn't quite as used to, such as the top of its head. Start with short sessions, and give your cat a treat as soon as you're done., Once you've worked on just getting the cat used to petting, start working on areas like its paws. Your cat will need its paws handled from time to time, such as when its claws are trimmed or when it visits the vet. However, most cats don't like their paws handled. Start by just touching the paws when the cat is near you or sitting on you (after some petting the cat likes), then work up to holding the paw in your hand. Keep the sessions short at first. Reward your cat with a treat afterwards.Try doing this step when the cat is sleepy.

, Most cats aren't huge fans of being picked up, but it does need to happen sometimes. To help it learn not to struggle, pick it up. When it struggles, talk to it soothingly. When it stops struggling, you can put it down. If you put it down before it stops struggling, it learns that's what results from that behavior., When you're first introducing pets, let them be in separate spaces. However, it can help to have a door between them, so they can sniff each other through the doors and start getting to know one another., A good next step is feeding them together, but one on each side of the door. They'll be able to smell and hear each other, but they'll also be doing something enjoyable, eating., The cat will start to want to explore the rest of the house after a few days. The first couple of times it goes into the larger house, try locking up your other pets. That way, the cat can get the lay of the land without having to worry., After a few days or a week, try introducing the animals. Some unhappiness is to be expected. However, if they continue to be aggressive, you may need to separate them again by guiding the cat back into is separate space.If one of the animals is a dog, keep it leashed for the first couple of introductions.
If they get in a serious fight, toss a towel over them, and then try to encourage the cat back into its room.
Only let them out together when you're at home for the first couple of times., Before you let them out unsupervised together, all animals should be relatively calm. They should be able to eat and go to the bathroom without looking worried. If they continually fight, you may need to slow down the introductions and keep them separated for a while longer."

Siamese cats are known to be very affectionate cats. They love to sit on your lap and will even climb into bed with you at night.Siamese cats are very beautiful. They come in many different color variations and they have beautiful blue eyes. The most common colors are seal, chocolate, blue, and lilac point.They don't require much grooming. Their hair is very short, and while they do shed it's not as noticeable as with some breeds.
They are energetic and love to play.
They are often good with children. They may even be more tolerant of young people than they are of adults. Of course, you should always supervise young children with pets to ensure the safety of both the child and the pet.;
, If you would like to own a dog but cannot walk one or you are not allowed to have one where you live, then you may want to consider a Siamese. They share many of the same attributes of a dog and some Siamese cats can even be taught how to play fetch.Make sure that you are allowed to have a cat where you live. If you rent, check with your landlord to be certain.

, Most purebred animals come with an increased risk of certain health problems because of the selective breeding necessary to create the breed. The Siamese cat is no different. Some of the conditions that Siamese cats are susceptible to include:


Early onset kidney disease. A variety of problems affect the kidney leading the cat to age prematurely. This condition may cause increased thirst, poor appetite, weight loss, vomiting, bad breath, poor coat, and early death. In some cases the deterioration can be slowed with prescription diets and medications but regular visits to the vet will be necessary.Weakness in the immune system. This condition makes the cat vulnerable to acquiring the feline leukemia infection. If you have a cat that is leukaemia positive, then getting a Siamese is not a good idea.
Megaesophagus. The esophagus is the muscular tube connecting the mouth to the stomach. If the cat develops megaesophagus, the tube will become big and saggy, which delays food on its journey down into the stomach. This condition leads to regurgitation of food, inadequate calorie intake, and malnourishment.
Eye twitching. Siamese cats may also have a quirk in the nerve supply to the eyes, which means their eyes track constantly from side to side as if watching a never ending train passing by., While many cats are placid, easygoing, and like to sleep a lot, a Siamese is not this type of cat. In certain ways, having a Siamese is much more like owning a dog. Siamese cats are strong-willed and intelligent. If the Siamese sets its sights on doing something then they will do it regardless of the obstacles or consequences., Because of their intelligence and stubbornness, Siamese cats are very difficult to train. For example, a Siamese may ignore unpleasant experiences such as being squirted with water, which makes it difficult to deter them from bad behavior.

, A regular cat may chirp and purr sometimes, but the Siamese yowls and howls. A Siamese may keep howling and yowling for hours if it wants something. The Siamese cat’s howl is loud and quite annoying, which is what makes it so difficult to ignoreThink about whether a noisy cat would annoy you or comfort you.

, If you want a cat because you are out a lot, then getting a Siamese cat may not be your best option. Siamese cats need attention and they will howl or destroy the place if they don't get it. These cats are needy and they demand your attention. If they don't get enough attention, they often resort to destructive behavior to take their minds off being alone.You will need to board your Siamese cat or hire a live-in pet sitter when you'll be away for more than one day, as your Siamese won't be able to tolerate human absence for any lengthy period.

, If you plan to get a Siamese kitten, then you will need to kitten proof your home. But even if you plan to get an adult Siamese, you will need to make sure that your home is safe for the cat. Siamese cats are very intelligent and curious. They may end up tangled in your electrical wires or climbing up into your shelves.


Secure loose wires, put a screen on the fireplace, put child safety locks on all of your shelves, and keep fire out of reach.

, Keep in mind that Siamese from shelters may not be pedigreed, even if they look like Siamese cats. The only way to know for sure if a cat is Siamese is to read the cat's registration papers, which most shelter cats don't have. However, a cat from a shelter can make a wonderful companion.Rescue groups may have papers for their Siamese cats, depending on how the cats were obtained.

, If you want to be sure that you are getting a Siamese cat, do not get a Siamese cat from a backyard breeder or a pet store. Do your research first. Responsible breeders will be glad to give you references and tell you which cat associations they belong to. They will also provide registration papers and a health guarantee.Cat shows are excellent places to meet responsible breeders.

, If you do not know any breeders in your area and you cannot find a Siamese in a shelter, consider asking your local veterinarian for recommendations on how to find a Siamese cat. Your veterinarian may be able to refer you to a reputable breeder or Siamese rescue group in your area.

Look at the color of the cat’s fur.,
Look for a short, silky coat.",How to Identify a Burmese Cat1," Burmese cats have golden eyes. They are set far apart and should be in line with the base of the cat’s ears. Their rounded shape gives them a large appearance. The brow above the eyes is also rounded, tapering back toward the ears., Burmese cats vary in the type of legs they have. Some have four short legs that are proportional to the rest of the body.Other Burmese cats have long legs, with their two front legs slightly longer than the two rear legs. Burmese paws are ovular in shape., Despite their trim build, Burmese are quite muscular, and can therefore weigh a good deal.Males usually weigh about eight to 12 pounds (3.6 to 5.4 kg). Females usually weigh six to 10 pounds (2.7 to 4.5 kg)., Burmese cats have a wedge-shaped head, with a wide skull tapering toward a narrower snout.Seen from the side, you’ll notice the end stopping at a blunt point, rather than tapering down in a rounded way. The end of the nose will be parallel with the chin. Their heads are proportional to the size of their bodies and sit atop a well-developed medium neck., Burmese cats have two medium-sized ears. They are set apart but not flaring out. Viewed from the side, you should be able to identify a slight forward tilt to the ears., Burmese cats are muscular and solidly built. They are a medium-sized cat, larger than their Siamese ancestors but smaller than the British Shorthair.They have rounded chests, and their backs should be level and end in a medium-length tail with a rounded tip., Burmese cats typically have dark brown sepia (sable) fur. But you might also find a Burmese with champagne, beige, light brown or tan, medium-blue, gray, silver, lilac, tabby (multicolored), tangerine, or light golden fur.Burmese cats’ coats will darken as they mature. If your cat’s coat is getting darker as it ages, it might be a Burmese.

, Burmese cats have short coats. The short length means they are easy to groom and do not shed much.The coats feel silky or satin-like to the touch, and you might find it pleasurable to pet the cat."

Do you like to spend time lounging around the house or are you always involved in a project or task. These are questions you should ask yourself before deciding what type of cat you want to get.Gauge your family's requirements. Do you have children? There are breeds, such as the Birman and the Ragdoll, that tend to be very good with children.Knowing your family and what they want and need from a cat can help you narrow down your requirements.;
, Each person may have different preferences for what type of cat is most attractive to them. Perhaps you like the flat face of a Persian or the fluffiness of a Maine Coon.Make a list of the attributes in a cat you find the cutest, including the color, size, length of coat, and other distinctive attributes. With a list in hand you can prioritize your choices and keep all your preferences in mind.For example, do you want a short-haired cat or a long-haired cat? This is an aesthetic decision but it can also impact the amount of cleaning you have to do to keep hair to a minimum.
Many breeds come in a variety of colors and fur lengths, for example the American bobtail, so in many cases these preferences will not eliminate all cats in a given breed., This will have an impact on the amount of work you have to do to raise the cat. Raising a kitten requires a lot of attention and care, as well as supervision so they don't get into trouble. However, raising a kitten well can also positively impact how well the cat it trained and how well it behaves. With an older cat you won't have to do the work to raise it but its personality and behaviors will already be formed.


If you are having a hard time deciding between a kitten and an older cat, pick an older cat. Older cats have a harder time getting adopted, so by getting one you are saving a life in addition to getting a great pet.

, This is largely a matter of preference. However, male cats are known to be more dominant than females, especially male cats that have not been fixed.Whether you want a male or female cat may depend on pets you already have in the home. If you already have a female cat, for instance, it may get into fights with another female that it is not related to.

, With all the information you now have about your family and its needs, you can now decide what type of cat you are looking for. Make a list of all the attributes you are looking for in a cat. This will help you keep a clear focus while researching a wide variety of cute and cuddly felines.


For example, this could be an active cat that likes to play, such as a Siamese or American curl; a cuddly cat that lounges most of the day, such as a Manx or Exotic; or an inquisitive cat that might get into trouble but is excessively smart, such as a European Burmese or Japanese bobtail., Begin with a general web search for common cat breeds and their appearance. This will help you narrow your search down by finding cats that look good to you. Begin my searching for cat breeds with the characteristics that you absolutely need. For instance, if you want a short-haired cat that is active, search for that. It is of no use to you to look over long-haired breeds if you absolutely don't want one.


Go to the websites of national cat organizations. These organizations tend to have good general information about a wide variety of breeds.The most common cats are domestic shorthair and longhair varieties. These are cats that are not considered purebred and do not have a specific breed. These come in all colors and sizes and their personalities come in a wide variety as well.You will not find information about them on websites devoted to purebred breeds.

, It's relatively easy to find a cat that is appealing to look at but you also need to know how they will act in life. In order to sort through all the information out there, make a list of all the cat breeds that might suit you based on aesthetics. Then research each one to find one that suits you.


For example, if you want a medium sized, long-haired cat that is friendly and playful, look into the Ragdoll breed or Birman breed.These are popular breeds that generally have a great disposition.
Some cat organizations have comparative charts that can help you sort through the many different types of cats.This phase of research should also let you know if getting a certain breed will be difficult or easy. Some specialty breeds are very rare and would require an immense amount of work to find. You may be able to find a similar breed that is much easier to get and will be just as great in your family.

, Once you decide on a few breeds that might suit you, you should spend some time learning more about them. Knowing a little bit about the history and health problems of the different cat breeds can help determine what breed suits you. A cat breed that has a lot of health problems may not be right for your family.


Even if you decide to adopt a cat that is a breed that has some health problems, it's important to know the risks to your cat's health. Having all the information will help you to keep an eye out for signs of a problem developing.

, Find a breeder that breeds you breed of cat or will source your specific breed of cat for you. Make sure that that they do not have a bad reputation by asking for references and calling them. Also talk to the breeder about their breeding practices and why they do what they do. This will give you an idea whether the breeder is breeding ethically.


Checking out a breeder is important so you can avoid bad breeding situations. At the least, good breeding practices include focusing on one or a select few breeds, knowing the genetic and breeding histories of the animals you breed, and thorough screening and vetting of potential adopters., If there is a selection of cats to choose from, then look at all of them. You may get a gut instinct when you meet them in person which cat is right for you.


When viewing the cats, also take a look at the breeding conditions the cats are being raised in.

, Make sure your chosen cat does not have any defects or issue's that would make it ill. This could be physical signs of illness, such as a cough or seeping eyes, or a family history of inheritable diseases.


Ask the cat breeder about the cat's parents. They should know who they are and about their health. Otherwise, you should be suspicious of the breeding operation.

, If the breeder and the specific cat check out, then you just need to decide whether or not to adopt it. Be aware that breeders will charge you a fee, which pays for their breeding operation. This cost will vary depending on the breeder and the rarity of the breed.


If you cannot find your chosen breed, try looking for a different one. There is bound to be another breed that also meets most of your requirements.

Monitor the cat’s health.,
Observe the cat’s behavior.,
Listen to the cat.,
Get a genetic test.",How to Identify a Burmese Cat2," Burmese cats are generally healthy, though they might be prone to gingivitis. They might also be predisposed to an inheritable condition known as hypokalemia, or low potassium. This condition causes weakness in the skeleton. It could cause localized weakness or fragility (for instance, weakness in the cat’s back or limbs), or it might be throughout the whole skeleton.Cats with hypokalaemia will require potassium supplements.
Your breeder should screen for this test before you obtain the cat from them.

, Burmese cats are energetic, playful, and friendly. They tend to seek out attention and affection, and readily make friends with both people and other pets. If your cat enjoys being stroked and held, it might be a Burmese cat., Burmese cats tend to vocalize somewhat more than most other cats.Their meows are soft and sweet., If you still cannot identify your cat as a Burmese after careful observation of its appearance and behavior, you could get a DNA test to discover it is, in fact, a Burmese. To perform a genetic test, a vet will have to swab the inside of your cat’s cheek to get some cells. The genes in the cells will then be compare against a known Burmese genome for similarities. If you’re interested in getting a DNA test, contact your vet.Genetic tests are not 100% accurate."

Try a Devon Rex.,
Think about a Sphynx cat.,
Look at a Balinese.,
Consider an Oriental Shorthair.,
Check out a Siberian cat.,
Spend time with the cat you want to adopt.",How to Choose a Hypoallergenic Cat Breed1," This cat, which has a curly coat, tends to shed less than other cats. While it's not the hair that causes allergies, the dander and saliva can be carried by the hair. Therefore, a cat that sheds less may cause fewer allergies.This cat is a very social cat and enjoys spending time with its family.The Cornish Rex, a similar breed, may also be a good choice, but you'll need to bathe it more often because of the oil that builds up on the coat.;
, This cat is a hairless variety, though some do have a small amount of hair. Some people with allergies are able to live with this cat because it doesn't send hair into the air like other cats (for the most part), limiting your contact to dander. Also, they don't have as much of the typical allergen in their saliva, which also helps those with allergies.Sphynx are energetic, and you'll find they may get into some goofy situations. They can be a bit clumsy in their enthusiasm. They enjoy getting attention from their humans.

, Even though Balinese are longhaired, these cats are low-shedding. In addition, they only have a single, silky coat of fur, so they have less fur overall. Therefore, they will likely spread less dander around your home, reducing allergens.These cats also produce less of the enzyme in their saliva that causes allergies, so they are a good choice for those with allergies., These cats look a bit like Siamese in their shape, and they also like to talk like Siamese, too.These cats also tend to put off less dander than other cats, so they make a good choice for those with allergies.Oriental Shorthairs like to be in the thick of things, and they love attention.

, These cats are longhaired cats, but they produce less of the enzyme in their saliva that causes allergies.They are smart cats and get along well with families., Not every cat will affect your allergies the same way, even within the same breed. Therefore, it's important to spend time with the cat before adopting it to see how much of a reaction you have.Often, one visit will be enough to tell you how bad your allergies are with that particular cat. However, you can try several visits if you're unsure. Many breeders and shelters will let you take an animal on a trial basis, if you need to do so.

Vaccinate your cat.,
Deworm your cat.,
Spay or neuter your cat.,
Take her for regular checkups.",How to Care for Toygers1," When you first get your Toyger kitten, you need to make sure she is up to date on her vaccinations. Ask her previous owner or breeder for her records so you know what care she has already received. At six weeks, she should have had her core vaccinations, including those for distemper, feline rhinotracheitis, and feline calici virus.


At nine to 10 weeks, she should have a booster for these vaccinations and her last boosters for these at 14 to 16 weeks. She may also need these repeated at one year old.
At 12 to 16 weeks, she should have her rabies vaccination. This will need to be repeated every year.
She may have also gotten a feline leukemia test at the same time as her first distemper vaccine.;
, When you take your kitten for her first check up around eight to nine weeks, your vet should start the deworming process on her. This should be redone every three to four weeks and at least two additional times after the first., Before your Toyger reaches six months old, you need to decide if you want to breed her. If you don’t, have her spayed (or neutered if male). This will help prevent unwanted kittens as well as cut down on undesirable behavior such as heat behaviors and urine spraying.


You can have her fixed as early as eight weeks., After your Toyger reaches one year old, you need to take her back to the vet at least once a year for a health checkup. She should be given her rabies vaccination and be checked for any issues. Once she reaches 10 years old, take her twice a year to avoid any specific diseases more common in senior cats.


Although your Toyger should generally be healthy, there is one breed specific problem to be aware of. During these regular checkups, make sure your vet looks for heart murmurs, which have been noted as common in this breed."

Brush your cat often.,
Try bathing or wiping your cat down.,
Wash your hands after touching the cat.,
Have yourself tested for allergies.",How to Choose a Hypoallergenic Cat Breed2," Brushing your cat reduces the amount of hair and dander they leave around your home. Try brushing your cat daily if possible. You can do it less if you'd like, but make sure to do it frequently for it to be effective.For shorthaired cats, try using a metal comb or rubber brush. The rubber brush will especially help remove dead hair. Work in the direction the fur goes, brushing from the top of the cat's head to the tip of the tail, taking it section by section.It can help to start with a metal comb or bristle brush and follow up with a rubber brush to help remove the dead hair.For longhaired cats, look for a wider spaced bristle brush, and try following up with a rubber brush.
If you have a cat that's wired-hair or curly, wire-pin brushes work well. They also work on medium- and longhaired cats.For both shorthaired and longhaired cats with thick coats, start by brushing against the grain of the fur, then going back over it moving in the direction of the fur., Bathing your cat can reduce allergens like dander and saliva. However, you'd have to do it fairly often (once a day). Bathing your cat this often will not be a pleasant experience for your cat, and it will likely dry out their skin. Instead, you can try quick-cleaning wipes to rub down your cat each day. You can find specially formulated wipes at the pet store or online., When you come in contact with the cat, it's important to wash your hands afterwards. That way, you won't spread the allergens to your face, including your nose, mouth, and eyes, which is where the allergens will cause the most damage., While it may be cats that you're allergic to, you could also be allergic to what a cat brings in from the outside if it's an outdoor cat. Having yourself tested for allergies will help you determine just what allergies you have, so you can make adjustments. For instance, maybe you'll just want to keep your cat indoors (which is healthier for the cat anyway)."

Vacuum and dust regularly.,
Add a HEPA air purifier to your house.,
Keep the cat out of your bedroom.,
Wash clothing, pillows, and bedding often.,
Choose hard surfaces.",How to Choose a Hypoallergenic Cat Breed3," Your cat produces allergens all the time, so one way you can help your allergies is to reduce the number allergens in your home. Try vacuuming at least once a week to reduce dander, which is what gives you allergies.Also, be sure to dust regularly, so you're picking up any allergens that are around your home.Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to make sure you capture allergens instead of spreading them around the room., An air purifier can trap allergens so they don't bother you. If you can only afford one, put it in your bedroom. That way, you'll have an area that gives you a break from allergies.You can also get a HEPA air filter for your air conditioner.

, Creating an area that is cat-free can help you take a break from allergens. The best place to choose is your bedroom, so that you can sleep better without allergies bothering you., Even if you ban your cat from your bedroom, dander and pet hair will build up on the soft surfaces in your home. Wash these items frequently to help prevent the buildup of dander and fur. This will help control the level of allergens in your home.

Use a vacuum cleaner and lint roller to clean soft surfaces that you cannot wash, such as your sofa.

, Hard surfaces, such as hardwood or tile floors and blinds, are less likely to harbor allergens than soft surfaces. It's best to skip thick carpets, for instance, as well as cloth curtains, as they can both trap allergens.For cloth that you need to have around, such as towels and sheets, be sure to wash them in hot water to help reduce allergens."
"
Brush your Toyger’s fur.,
Trim her nails.,
Clean her ears.,
Brush her teeth.",How to Care for Toygers2," Your Toyger’s fur should be relatively short. To keep her looking her best, you should brush her once a week. This will keep her fur shiny and help cut down on shedding.This is also a good time to look for any abnormalities, such as lumps, scrapes, bruises, bumps, or other injuries. Take her to the vet immediately if you notice any.

, During your brushing sessions, you can also trim her nails. Your Toyger may not like having her nails cut, but it will make her life easier. To trim them, get her in the right position on your lap and use cat claw clippers to trim the ends. Make sure to avoid the pink area of the nails because they hold the quick, which is where her blood and nerves are.


This can be quite an undertaking, so you may want to let your vet trim her nails every month or so., During your weekly grooming sessions, you should check your Toyger’s ears. You don’t have to clean her ears weekly, only when they are dirty. Check her ears for discoloration, residue, or odors. If you notice any of these, you should clean them. To do this, wet a cotton ball with a cat ear cleanser and gently wipe them out.


You can get an ear cleanser at a pet store or ask your vet for recommendations., Once every week, you need to brush your cat’s teeth. It takes a little patience at first, but it is easy once your Toyger gets used to it. Start by buying a cat toothbrush and toothpaste. Put some of the toothpaste on your finger and let her get used to the flavor.


Next, rub it against her teeth yourself. Then graduate to the brush the next day.
Never use human toothpaste on a cat."
"
Feed her the right foods.,
Avoid overfeeding her.,
Buy her a scratching post.,
Get her the right toys.,
Bond with her.,
Teach her tricks.",How to Care for Toygers3," To keep your Toyger healthy, you need to feed her the right kinds of foods. Since your cat is a carnivore, or meat eater, her body requires amino acid proteins found in meat to be healthy. She could develop eye problems or develop serious diseases if she isn't fed enough healthy, good quality food with meat in it.To make sure she gets enough of these proteins, she should have cat food that has real meat in it. It can be hard to know what food is good quality, but look for cat food with meat, not meat byproduct, listed as the first or second ingredient.

, Another way to keep your Toyger healthy is to keep her at a healthy weight. Your cat food will have suggested food amounts based on her size. Since your Toyger is a medium sized cat, look in that range for her specific weight to know how much to feed her.


Avoid feeding her this amount all at once. Your Toyger will get hungry throughout the day, so break it up into two to three small meals so she doesn't get hungry.Spreading out the food during the day will keep your Toyger feeling full and satisfied.

, Your Toyger's predatory nature and instincts will lead her to want to scratch things in your house. To avoid her scratching things you don't want damaged, buy her a scratching post. You can also buy her a cat tower or something similar that will give her a place to scratch as well as explore.


Scratching will also help remove dead areas of her claws to help them grow healthily and give her quality exercise.If your Toyger scratches things she isn't supposed to, do not yell at her or punish her. Try a different kind of scratching post that may be more suited to her needs.
Pick her up and move her to where her scratching post is when you see her scratching the wrong thing. This will show her where to scratch without messing anything up.

, Your Toyger is very intelligent and energetic, so she needs toys that engage her curiosity. These don't have to be expensive or elaborate, they just have to keep her attention. Cheap, homemade toys include a wadded up piece of paper or a cardboard paper towel roll. You can also buy her toy mice, toys with dangly feathers, or a laser pointer.


Set aside time each day to play with your Toyger. The more energy you help burn off, the happier your Toyger will be., During the first weeks you have your cat, you should bond with her. Pick her up, pet her, and love on her. Encourage lap time, which can help you bond with her and aid in getting her used to human contact. She may have a temperament that is more solitary and will cause her to avoid lap time.


If this is the case, talk to her when you play with her and when you feed her. Encourage her to approach you and give her the kind of attention she seeks.
This may take some time to figure out. It may also be difficult because cat's do not like change. As you are learning your Toyger's likes and dislikes, keep talking to her and bonding with her in whatever way she will let you., Since your Toyger is intelligent and energetic, she is the perfect candidate to teach tricks to.Start with getting her attention with treats, then try to get to her to do a certain trick, such as sit or roll over. Keep using treats to reward her as you teach her tricks.


With some patience, you can teach your Toyger to do many different tricks, which will help keep her healthy and give her exercise everyday."

Feed your Sphynx cat often.,
Set up a litter box.,
Provide scratch posts.,
Keep your Sphynx cat warm.,
Protect your cat from sun exposure.",How to Care for Sphynx Cats1," The Sphynx cat lacks the insulating fur of other cat breeds, and therefore loses body heat more easily. The breed has a very high metabolism, which means your Sphynx cat needs to eat more than another cat might. You should always have dry food down for your cat to eat if you feed your cat dry food. If you feed your cat canned food, feed him three times a day or as needed to keep him satisfied.If feeding your cat wet, canned food, try for an average of eight to 12 ounces of food per day.You do not want your cat to be overweight, but your Sphynx cat should never be bony. If his weight decreases, or his ribs become more obvious, then increase the ration by five to 10%. Reweigh him again a week later to check the weight loss has been arrested.
Alternatively, look for a food that is marketed for active cats, or look for a breed-specific food made for Sphynx cats. These tend to be higher calorie than the equivalent amount of regular food.
Feed your Sphynx cat a good quality, protein rich food. Meat should be listed first and second on the pet food label. Avoid foods where a large percentage is cereal based.;
, You should provide your cat with a large litter box. It should be placed in a quiet, out of the way spot. Check with the breeder to see which cat litter he used to provide consistency for your cat., These provide an outlet for the cat's natural desire to scratch. Place several posts in your home, near entrance and exits, and next to the cat's bed., Because of the small amount of hair, the Sphynx cat needs to be kept warm. Usually, keeping the cat in your home at room temperature is enough. Sphynx cats also often lie in sunlight shining through windows or sit near objects that give off heat. Your Sphynx may want to cuddle with you often to be near your body heat. He may also want to sleep beneath your comforter at night.Provide access to blankets that your cat can lay on or under.
During the winter you may need to place your Sphynx cat in sweaters., Because the Sphynx cat’s skin is exposed, you need to protect it from the sun. A limited amount of sun is fine, but too much can give your cat sunburn.Use UV blocking shirts or hats on your cat.You may want to install sun-blocking screens on your windows to make sure your cat doesn’t lie in a sunny spot and get sunburnt."

Spend a lot of time with your kittens.",How to Care for Siamese Kittens," If you got kittens from a breeder, the best course of action is to provide your kittens with the same food the breeder was using. Switching foods, especially quickly, can shock your kittens' systems and cause vomiting or diarrhea. If the breeder's food is within your price range, stick to feeding your kittens that.If you do not want to use the breeder's food for any reason, start off feeding your kittens that food and gradually mix in the food you want. You should not abruptly switch your kittens to a new food.;
, If you don't know what food your breeder was using, or if it's unavailable to you, make sure to opt for the highest quality kitten food possible. Look for a recognizable name brand kitten chow. Check the label for a stamp from the Association for Animal Feed Control, which should indicate the food is safe for your kittens' stages of life.Read reviews of various kitten chow brands online before making a purchase at a pet store or grocery store.
Ask your vet for recommendations if you are unsure.

, Your kittens' total food for the day should be split into four to five small meals a day until kittens are six months old. After six months, your kittens' should eat two larger meals a day. Feed your kittens by spacing out meals at roughly even intervals, starting first thing in the morning.The precise amount of food per day depends on your kittens' ages, as well as the type of food you are using. Most foods have guidelines on the label somewhere advising you how much food to you use.
If you're unsure about portions after reading your food's label, talk to your vet.

, Keep clean, fresh water out at all times. Refill the water as necessary. If the water becomes dirty with food or dust, replace it with clean water.Make sure the water bowl is low enough to the ground so your kittens can easily reach it.

, Taurine is a mineral that helps with heart and eye health. As a breed, siamese are prone to eye problems. A taurine supplement, or a food higher in taurine, may help prevent these problems from developing. Talk to your vet about whether your siamese kittens would benefit to extra taurine in their diet., If you do not already have a vet, find one as soon as you adopt kittens. Kittens need extra vet visits during their first year. An internet search for vets in your area should help you find a quality vet for your kittens.If you purchased your kittens through a breeder, ask them for a recommendation.
Read reviews of vets online before settling on a vet. Make sure the vet you choose has a good reputation.

, Kittens need a number of vaccinations to prevent common diseases like feline distemper, calicivirus and rhinotracheitis. Your kittens will also need rabies shots. Vaccinations start at around 8 weeks. Your vet will be able to put your kittens on a schedule to get them all their necessary shots.Make sure you obtain medical records from your breeder or shelter. These records will tell you which vaccinations your kittens have already received.

, Worms and parasites may be a problem for kittens adopted from the shelter. Many shelters test for worms and give cats dewormers prior to adoption, but your vet may recommend testing anyway. If your kittens have worms or parasites, these are easy to treat via a round of deworming medications., Siamese cats are generally fairly healthy. However, all breeds are prone to certain genetic problems. Talk over breed-specific issues with your vet to determine whether your kittens may be at risk.The shape of your kittens' heads may lead to respiratory or dental problems. Your vet may be able to determine which kittens are at risk by examining their heads. If any of your kittens are at risk, talk to your vet about how to manage potential dental or respiratory issues.

Start brushing your cat’s fur at an young age.,
Get a great comb that works well on Persian fur.,
Learn the proper way to brush your Persian’s fur.,
Brush your cat’s fur every day so that she stays healthy.,
See a professional groomer.",How to Care for Persian Cats1," To make sure that your Persian accepts being brushed a lot, you will have to start brushing her at an early age. From day one, make a point of brushing your kitten so that she gets used to this experience. If you don't start brushing her at an early age, she may develop a dislike for being brushed that can ultimately make it much harder to maintain her coat.


One way to help your cat accept being brushed is to brush her right before a mealtime. That way, your cat will associate getting brushed with getting food (which is something that she enjoys).;
, You will need a metal comb that has narrow teeth on one end and wide-spaced teeth on the other end to properly detangle your cat’s long fur. A metal slicker-type brush can also be good for removing excess fur that has a tendency to become tangled.

, One common mistake owners is brushing over the outer surface of the coat without getting down to the hair roots. Think of brushing your cat in terms of combing your own hair: you need to part the fur and comb knots out from the roots, working tangles free on your way to the hair tip. This mentality can also be applied to your cat. As with your own hair, it is most effective (and comfortable for the cat!) if you brush in the direction that the fur grows. The proper combing process involves:


Parting your hair and using the wide-spaced teeth on the comb to brush out any loose knots. This step also helps to get the fur lying in one direction, making it easier to detangle.
Using the slicker brush, work in sections and progress from head to tail. This will help to brush out loose hairs.
Once you have cleared the coat of shed fur, go over it again with the wide-toothed comb, working from the root to the tip of the hair, and then finish by combing your cat’s whole body with the narrow-toothed part of the comb.

, While it might not seem like brushing fur is that big of a deal, a Persian’s luxuriously long fur can become a problem really quickly. When your cat’s fur gets tangled, it becomes matted.


These tangled up clumps of fur can tug at your cat’s skin—which can feel very unpleasant—and may tangle to such an extent that it creates a hard shell of fur on certain areas of her body.
Having tangled fur can also increase your cat's chances of developing skin infections. When the fur is matted, it is much harder for your cat to clean the skin under the fur. When cat's skin goes uncleaned, they often develop infections.

, You cat’s fur might become matted for a variety of reasons. It might be from a lack of brushing. If cats get overweight or older and less healthy, they can also become less efficient in self-grooming and less able to take care of themselves. This can lead to tangled and matted fur.Consider seeking out a professional groomer if you aren’t able to deal with your cat’s matted fur. A groomer can try to remove the matted areas; in a worst case, he or she may have to shave down the cat’s coat to avoid possible skin problems.

Monitor young children's interaction with a ragdoll.,
Keep your ragdoll indoors.,
Have blood work done after your cat is a year old.,
Get your ragdoll screened for heart conditions.",How to Care for Ragdoll Cats," Unlike most cats, ragdolls keep growing until they're four years-old. During its first four years, you need to have food present for your cat at all times. Leave out dry or canned food and, once your ragdoll has finished its food, give it a bit more. As ragdolls grow, food needs to be restricted to prevent obesity. However, during the early years, extra feeding is important.Discuss the precise amounts of food with your vet. Exact amounts depend on how fast your ragdoll is growing as well as its current health.;
, Ragdolls need a high amount of protein to thrive, and it's generally easier to get protein via canned food. Dry food tends to have higher amounts of grain and other fillers. It's best to feed your ragdoll a diet of primarily canned food.Look at the label on your canned food to figure out feeding amounts. Usually, the label will indicate how much food you cat needs a day depending on its weight and age.
Talk to your vet for recommendations for canned food.

, Vitamin and mineral supplements are not necessary for every ragdoll. However, if your cat has any underlying health problems, your vet may suggest using dietary supplements. If your vet suggests supplements, make sure you talk about how much your cat needs and how to feed your cat the supplements., Go for grain-free varieties of popular cat food brands whenever possible. A ragdoll needs a lot of protein in its diet, and too much grain can affect its overall health.If food is grain free, it should say this somewhere on the label.

, Ragdolls need a litter box to eliminate in. Make sure your ragdoll knows where to find its litter box. Keep it in a somewhat open space, like a closet that's always cracked open, so your ragdoll can use the litter box if necessary.Ragdolls are a bigger breed, so opt for a larger, deeper litter box. A covered litter box may not work for such a large breed.
If you get a ragdoll kitten from a breeder, ask the breeder what type of litter they use. Use this same type of litter so your ragdoll does not get confused about a new litter box.

, Strive to play with your ragdoll for 20 minutes a day. Ragdolls enjoy balls especially, and may play fetch if you toss a ball for them. Stop by your local pet store or drug store and stock up on some cat toys for your pet., Due to their long coat, ragdolls should be groomed regularly. Use a soft bristle brush and brush the fur gently at the roots. If brushed regularly, a ragdoll's coat should brush out smoothly without a lot of mats or tangles.When your ragdoll is a kitten, brush it each day to get it used to the practice. As ragdolls are friendly and do not mind handling, it should be fairly easy to get your ragdoll to hold still during grooming. If your ragdoll appears nervous, talk to it and coax it to help it stay calm. Use treats or talk to it in a soft voice.
Once a ragdoll is used to being brushed, brush their coat once or twice a week., If you got a ragdoll from a breeder or shelter, obtain a copy of its vaccination records to make sure you stay up-to-date with vaccines. Make sure to get your ragdoll vaccinated completely for diseases such as rabies., Ragdolls need clean water to be out at all times. Keep a bowl of water where your ragdoll can reach it. Check the water each day and refill and replace as necessary.

, Most cats have a natural inclination to scratch. Get your ragdoll scratching posts and leave them around the house. This will deter your cat from scratching furniture.

, Dental care is important for any cat. Talk to your vet about how often you should brush your cat's teeth. Then, invest in cat toothpaste and a toothbrush. Most ragdolls are easy to handle, but spend a few days using your finger or a cotton swab to gently massage their mouth and gums. Once they're comfortable with having their mouths touched, you can use a toothbrush to brush a small amount of toothpaste on your ragdoll's teeth.If you notice anything unusual when brushing your cat's teeth, like discolored teeth or bleeding gums, see a veterinarian.

, Ragdolls are very friendly cats that enjoy being handled. This makes them safe to have around young children. However, due to their docile nature, ragdolls may not protest when handled roughly Monitor young children closely and make sure they're handling the cat correctly. You do not want a young child to accidentally injure your ragdoll., Ragdolls do not do well as outdoor cats. They do not have a good sense of danger and tend to be trusting in nature, which can easily lead to accidents or injuries outdoors. For your ragdoll's safety, keep it as an indoor cat., Ragdolls are prone to breed-specific health conditions. Early detection is key to treating these conditions effectively. Once your cat is a year old, have your vet run blood work to rule out breed-specific health issues.Ragdolls are prone to bladder and kidney problems. Your vet can test for these with blood work.
If your ragdoll is diagnosed with a breed-specific issue, talk over treatment with your vet.

, Due to their size, ragdolls are more prone to heart conditions than other breeds. Vets can perform tests on your ragdoll as they grow to rule out heart disease. If your vet notices signs of heart disease, they can then talk to you about how to slow the progression of the disease.In ragdolls, heart disease is usually the thickening of the arteries around the heart.

Bathe your cat regularly.,
Wash your cat’s ears.,
Clean your cat’s eyes.",How to Care for Sphynx Cats2," Sphynx cats need regular bathing to keep their skin in good condition. Because of the lack of hair, the Sphynx’s body secretes oil. This causes the breed to need frequent bathing.You should bathe your cat once a week.


Sphynx cats are a great breed for people who are allergic to cats and cat hair. By bathing, your cat often, it also washes away dander and helps to keep the allergic component down.Sphynx cats have different degrees of hairlessness. Some Sphynx cats are completely hairless with skin that feels like a warm chamois leather. Some Sphynx cats have downy hair over their body, which feels like warm peach fuzz.
The skin itself is often ""oversized"" for the body and sits in wrinkles. These wrinkles can be pronounced over the forehead and give the cat a quizzical or worried expression., Because of the large size of the Sphynx’s ears, they need to be cleaned regularly. Gently clean the ears with cleaning solution on a cotton ball or cotton swab once a week. If you neglect your Sphynx’s ears, he can get a build up of ear wax, oil, and dirt., Sphynx cats don’t have eyelashes.

Give your Sphynx a lot of attention.,
Satisfy the Sphynx’s natural curiosity.,
House your Sphynx cat inside.,
Consider companions for your Sphynx cat.,
Provide places for the cat to climb.",How to Care for Sphynx Cats3," Sphynx cats love people and being around people. If you want a cat to bond with who wants to take part in what you're doing, then a Sphynx is a good choice. Sphynx cats are known to follow their owners around the house with wagging tails.Play with your Sphynx cat twice a day.

, The Sphynx is renowned for his inquisitive nature. He puts a lot of enthusiasm into whatever he does, which along with his natural curiosity means the Sphynx can get up to mischief if he’s not provided with an outlet for his normal behavior. Because of this energy and curiosity, the breed has a lot of character and can be seen as quite mischievous.

, Because of your Sphynx cat’s lack of hair, you need to keep her inside. If she is left outside, she can get sunburned or too cold. If you let your Sphynx cat outside, make sure to watch her closely to make sure the elements don’t make her sick.

, The Sphynx cat is a social cat who doesn’t like being alone. If you are gone from home often, consider having another Sphynx cat or other pets. Sphynx cats do very well with other pets, including dogs and other cats., Sphynx cats have a lot of energy. They like to climb on furniture and doors, and even climb on people’s shoulders. They also are good at balancing and can be acrobatic tricks.Make your home a fun place for your Sphynx cat to explore by giving him plenty of places to climb.


Consider attaching shelving to the wall in such a way that the cat has an aerial walkway around a room. Providing a high perch beside a door will give the Sphynx a great spot from which to watch people come and go, which could prevent your Sphynx trying to dash out the door each time.

Vaccinate your cat.,
Desex your cat.,
Control parasites and worms.",How to Care for Sphynx Cats4," You should vaccinate your Sphynx cat against common infectious diseases, such as cat flu, feline infectious enteritis, feline leukemia, and rabies.

Understand the term brachycephalic.,
Keep your cat’s nose clean.,
Get your cat vaccinated regularly.",How to Care for Persian Cats2," Persians are brachycephalic, which is a term that means their nose and nasal chambers are fore-shortened when compared to normal cats. It is part of the breed description of pedigree Persians that in profile the nose ‘button’ does not protrude past the level of the eyes.Sadly, this means the cat has sacrificed a system of mucous membrane lined scrolls within the nasal chamber that filter and warm air. This predisposes Persians to sneezes and sniffles, because they lack the normal filter that is the first line of defense against infection.

, The best way to help your cat fight off respiratory infections is by keeping her nose clean. Making sure your cat's nose is clean is very important because your Persian’s shortened nose can become blocked easily, making it difficult for your cat to breathe. You can use a warm, wet cloth to wipe your cat’s nose and make sure that it is cleaned out.


Wipe your cat’s nose at least once a day, and always wipe it if it looks slightly blocked.

, Persians are prone to respiratory infections because they do not have as much protection against pathogens due to their stubby noses. Cat's normally have an extra defensive layer in their noses that help keep bacteria and other pathogens out, but Persians lack this extra defense. Because of this, it is important to take your cat to the vet to get regular booster vaccinations against cat flu.


If you notice your cat having a hard time breathing or sneezing uncontrollably, you should take her to the vet.
Persians can have a lot of potential health issues. For this reason, you should think very carefully before breeding a cat with respiratory or other issues that could be passed on.

Be aware that Persian’s can have eye problems because of how their faces are structured.,
Wipe away your cat’s excess tears.,
Understand why Persian cat eye fluid turns brown.",How to Care for Persian Cats3," Part of the appeal of Persians is their round, flat faces and large eyes. Sadly, the features that make them so attractive can also cause problems. All cats produce tear fluid that serves to keep the surface of the eye moist and their corneas healthy. This fluid should drain away via paired tear ducts in each eye. Sadly, your Persian’s truncated nose means these ducts are kinked and can no longer drain effectively.Think of it like a hosepipe that you bend or step on to stop the water from flowing. This is what happens because of your cat’s shortened nose.

, The best way to help you cat is to simply wipe away the excess tears that have a tendency to stain Persian fur and irritate their faces. If you notice that your cat has excess eye fluid on her face, use a cloth or paper towel to wipe up the excess fluid.


Wipe around your cat’s eyes at least once a day. You should really try to wipe it anytime you notice that it looks wet under her eyes. Do not wipe the eye itself, however, as this could lead to corneal scratches or ulcers.

, You may be wondering why the fluid that leaks out of your cat's eyes turn brown. The reason is that chemicals called porphyrins are found in the tear fluid and when the chemicals are exposed to the air, these porphyrins oxidize and turn a brown-rust color.


This is the same process that causes a cut apple to turn brown.
You should be able to keep these tears from creating stains on the cat’s fur. Basic eye care, mentioned above, is one way. You can also wipe around the eye with a small amount of liquid boric acid, which is safe as an eye wash, on a cotton square. Wipe the area below and around the eye with cotton balls soaked in water warm twice a day after removing the staining."

Be alert for any signs of illness.,
Watch out for polycystic kidney disease (PKD).,
Look for symptoms of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (heart disease).,
Pay attention to signs of Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA).",How to Care for Persian Cats4," While Persians have been bred for their unique looks, this same breeding has also led them to become predisposed to certain diseases. While there is nothing you can do to prevent your cat from getting the disease is she is genetically prone, you can watch for signs of these diseases and have your cat treated as soon as she develops the condition.

, This genetic fault affects one in three Persian cats and results in the formation of multiple fluid-filled cysts within the kidney that can lead to renal disease. Once the problem i identified your pet’s lifespan can be extended by prescription renal diets and medications such as ACE inhibitors which can aid the filtering capacity of the kidneys.Symptoms include:


Drinking more than normal.
Reduced appetite.
Lethargy.
Weight loss.
Vomiting.
If you recognize these signs in your pet then take her to a veterinarian.

, This disease causes the heart wall to become thickened which then impairs the heart’s ability to pump blood around the body. Luckily, there are drugs such as diuretics and ACE inhibitors that can decrease the workload on the heart and increase longevity.Signs that your pet has heart disease are vague and non-specific. However, you can look out for things like:


Exercise intolerance.
Sleeping more than normal.
Lack of interest in food or grooming herself.
Shallow breathing and breathing through an open mouth.

, PRA is a genetically programmed thinning of the retina that eventually leads to blindness. Whilst it sounds distressing, cats are actually very good at compensating for blindness. They are adept at using their whiskers, sense of smell, and hearing to move around. If your cat does go blind, it is generally best to keep her indoors and avoid rearranging the furniture, as she could become disoriented.Signs of blindness include:


Bumping into objects left in her path that are not normally there.
Pupils that cease forming slits in bright light, and will remain large and black.

Select a high-quality cat food.,
Feed your Norwegian forest cat two measured meals per day.,
Provide lots of fresh, clean water for your Norwegian forest cat.,
Give your Norwegian forest cat treats.",How to Care for Norwegian Forest Cats1," Keeping Norwegian forest cat in peak physical condition requires some high-quality cat food. Take care to choose a high-quality cat foot that will meet all of your Norwegian forest cat’s nutritional needs.


One good way to select a food for your cat is to read the ingredients. The first two ingredients listed on the package should be meat (not meat by-products). If they are not, then keep looking.
Choose a food that contains taurine. Taurine is an essential amino acid that your cat needs for good vision and heart health. All high-quality cat foods should include this ingredient, so avoid any cat foods that do not contain taurine.;
, Free-feeding is when you allow your cat to have access to unlimited food. This way of feeding causes some cats to become overweight, so it is not the best method. Instead, feed your Norwegian forest cat a measured amount on a regular schedule.To determine how much to feed your Norwegian forest cat, take the daily recommended feeding amount on your cat’s food package and then divide this amount in half. For a cat that weighs between five and nine pounds, you may need to provide a daily amount of 2/3 of a cup. To divide this amount into two meals, give your Norwegian forest cat 1/3 of a cup in the morning and 1/3 of a cup at night.
Providing small portions will make it more likely that your cat will eat her food.Check with your Norwegian forest cat’s veterinarian for a specific recommendation on how much to feed your cat.

, Your Norwegian forest cat will need to have a bowl of fresh, clean water available at all times. Wash your cat’s water bowl daily and change the water once per day or as needed.Your cat’s food and water bowls should be placed somewhere that is easy for your cat to access. Never place food and water bowls near your cat’s litter box. Cats do not like to eat and drink near their litter boxes.

, Norwegian forest cats like treats like all cats do, so try to give your Norwegian forest cat a special treat once per day. You can buy special kitty treats in the grocery store or pet store. You might also try giving your cat some acceptable human foods as a treat. Remember that treats should not exceed 5% of your Norwegian forest cat’s total daily calories.

If you start brushing your Norwegian Forest cat when she is a kitten, then this process will be much easier for both of you.

, Your Norwegian forest cat needs his claws, but sometimes your cat’s claws may become too sharp and you may have to give him a trim. If your cat uses his scratchers often, then you may not need to trim his claws at all. If your cat does not use his scratchers too often, then it is a good idea to trim your Norwegian forest cat’s claws once every three weeks.Trim the white tips of your cat’s claws only. Avoid the pink area of your Norwegian forest cat’s claws. Cutting this part of the claw can hurt your cat. You should be able to see the pink area of your cat’s claws when you look at them in the light.
Use a special guillotine style nail trimmer and only trim a little bit of your cat’s claws at a time. The goal of a trim is to cut off the sharp tips, not remove your cat’s entire claw., Regular dental care is a good way to keep your Norwegian forest cat’s teeth healthy, which is important for his overall health. Regular brushing will also help to keep your cat’s breath fresh. To brush your Norwegian forest cat’s teeth, use a toothbrush and toothpaste that is meant for cats. Human toothpaste can make your cat sick.Introduce your Norwegian forest cat to the toothbrush gradually. For example, you may begin by letting him to lick wet cat food off of the toothbrush for the first few days and then try to put the toothbrush into his mouth after he seems comfortable with it.
When you brush your Norwegian forest cat’s teeth, use gentle strokes along the surface of his teeth and gums. Do not apply too much pressure or you may injure him.

, Norwegian forest cats have thick, double coats that are waterproof, so giving him a bath might be a challenge and you may want to consult a professional groomer if you think a bath is necessary.Keep in mind that you should not need to bathe your Norwegian forest cat unless he gets dirty or sticky.If you notice that your Norwegian forest cat suddenly stops grooming himself, then take him to see the veterinarian before you do anything.

Take your Norwegian forest cat to visit a veterinarian.,
Spay or neuter your Norwegian forest cat.",How to Care for Norwegian Forest Cats3," Your Norwegian forest cat will sleep about as much as the average cat, so he will need a comfortable bed. Find a comfortable bed for your Norwegian forest cat and place it somewhere that he likes to nap.


For example, if you have noticed that your cat takes a lot of naps near a specific window, then try placing his bed near that window.

, Norwegian forest cats need to scratch, so it is important to provide your cat with an appropriate outlet for scratching. Corrugated cardboard scratching boards and rope wrapped boards work well. Try placing a few of these scratching posts throughout your home.If you notice your Norwegian forest cat scratching something that is off limits (couch, carpet, etc.), do not yell, hit him, or throw something at him. Just pick up your cat gently and place him right next to one of his scratching posts. You might even try placing his paw on the board to show him that he can scratch it. With time, he will understand that these are for scratching and other things are not for scratching.
To make scratching posts even more attractive, sprinkle a bit of catnip on and around them.

, Your Norwegian forest cats will use litter boxes if they are clean and available. Scoop litter boxes daily and change the litter once per week. Some other good ways to encourage good litter box habits include:Ensuring there are enough litter boxes. You need at least one more litter box than your total number of cats. For example, if you have two cats, then you need to have a minimum of three litter boxes.
Using fine-grained litter. Cats seem to prefer fine-grained litter in their boxes. Choose a clumping litter variety to make it easier for you to clean the box.
Filling the box to the right level. Cats do not like litter that is too deep, so try to fill the box so that there is only about two inches of litter.

, Norwegian forest cats need regular veterinary exams just like all other cats do. Take your Norwegian forest cat to see a veterinarian as soon as possible after you get him and then take him for regular veterinary visits once every year. During your cat’s veterinary visits, your cat will get a physical exam, get tested for diseases (such as feline leukemia), and receive vaccinations (like a rabies vaccination).


Maintain annual visits and take your Norwegian forest cat to see a veterinarian you ever suspect that he is sick., If you do not plan to breed your Norwegian forest cat, then you should have your cat spayed or neutered. Spaying and neutering helps to control the pet population and protects your pet from some health conditions and behavioral problems. Talk to your Norwegian forest cat’s veterinarian about spaying or neutering as soon as possible to prevent bad behavior from setting in.


Cats that are not spayed or neutered are more prone to behaviors such as spraying, aggression, and roaming. If you wait too long to spay or neuter your cat, then these habits may cause long-term behavioral issues.Spaying and neutering can also protect your Norwegian forest cat from certain health issues, such as enlarged prostate, uterine infections, and certain forms of cancer."

Let your cat adjust to wearing the harness.You want your cat to get so used to the harness that it forgets it's wearing it.",How to Put on a Cat Harness," There are two types of cat harness: the Figure Eight and the H-harness. The main difference between the two is that the Figure Eight features just two loops that meet on top of the cat's shoulders, while the H-harness has a short strap that lies between the shoulder blades with the loops sewn onto either end.


There is no right answer to which type of harness is best. Some owners report the Figure Eight harness is harder to wriggle out of. Indeed, the fit of the Figure Eight harness is much more snug, which could account for why it seems more secure on some cats.;
, Harnesses usually come in different sizes, such as small, medium, or large. These sizes are typically based on the measurement around the chest, usually 12, 14, 16, or 18 inches.Most harnesses have adjustable loops but they are not designed so that a small harness can fit a big cat. Rather, these are designed for ease of comfort and to get the harness to fit snugly.
To find your cat's chest size use a tape measure and place it immediately behind the cat's front legs. Measure around their chest in a full circle, taking care that the tape is not twisted. Apply gentle pressure so the tape fits snugly but is not digging into the cat. Take this measurement and add 2 or 3 inches - this figure now gives you the size of harness you should buy.

, Cat harnesses are available at most pet stores and they come in a variety of colors and materials. If you have a specific model in mind, however, it may be easiest to buy the harness online.


Remember that sizes may vary between brands, so a Large in one brand of harness may not fit the same as a Large in another brand.

, Hold the harness by the straight piece of strapping between the two loops. Look at the two loops hanging down from the waist and identify which is the smaller. This smaller loop will slip over the cat's head and does not need to be unbuckled. The larger loop will go around the cat's chest, and needs to be unbuckled., The spot where the loop connects to the connecting strap should rest just above of the cat's shoulders. With the small loop over the cat's head, slide the harness so the ""waist"" of the figure eight lies on its back between the shoulder blades.

, Take the ends of the bigger loop and feed them under the cat's chest. Check for twists and straighten them out so there is nothing to dig into the cat. Then fasten the buckle.


If the loop is too small to fit around the cat's chest you will need to ease out some extra length by using the sliding adjustment on the harness.

, A comfortable fit of this harness should be snug but allow you to insert two to three fingers between the harness and the cat. Use the sliding adjusters to lengthen or shorten the loops individually until you are satisfied the cat is both comfortable and secure.

, This may be possible for some cats, but not necessarily all cats.


It may help your cat to accept a new harness if you leave it beside the cat's food bowl before you try putting it on. That way it will come to associate it with good things.

, H-harnesses have a strap that runs along the underside of the cat's chest between the front legs, in addition to the loops and the straight piece that a figure-eight harness has.


If the loops of your H-harness are attached by two straight pieces on opposite sides of the loop, then you have a harness with a back strap and a chest strap. It is easy to identify the back strap because it is always shorter than the chest strap., Find the short strap (back strap) and hold this. Now slip the cat's head through the smaller loop. Unbuckle the large loop and you'll find one half of the loop forms a large D shape with the chest strap. Simply feed the front leg on the same side as the D, through the space within so that leg is enclosed. Feed the remaining long length of strap under the cat's chest and up the other side, and fasten the buckle.

, A good fit on a H-harness means that the harness is snug but loose enough to allow you to insert two to three fingers between the harness and the cat. It is typical, and important, that you spend some time adjusting the fit of a harness the first time you put it on.


Use the sliding adjusters to change the size of the loops until you are satisfied the harness is fitting correctly.

, Remember that not all cats will adjust to wearing a harness, so if your cat really puts up a struggle decide whether you have the time and patience for this kind of training.


To aid your cat's comfort, also let your cat sniff the harness and be around it for awhile before trying it on. This will make the cat more comfortable.
Now you are ready to attach the lead to the harness and off you go!

Set up high places.",How to Care for Tonkinese," Check with the breeder to see if your Tonkinese has gotten her first distemper vaccine at six weeks of age. Ask for proof that she's gotten this important vaccine, along with a dewormer at her first veterinarian examination. Don't bring your cat home until she's gotten them. Make sure to schedule the following tests and vaccines for your cat:Feline leukemia test: Talk with your vet to determine if you should vaccinate your Tonkinese against feline leukemia. Your cat should be tested for the disease before exposing her to other cats in your home. You can also have her tested when she gets her first distemper booster.
Distemper boosters: Your cat needs these at 9 weeks and 12 weeks of age. She'll need them annually after these early boosters.
Rabies vaccination: Your Tonkinese should get this at 12 weeks of age and then you'll need to follow your city or county requirements and vaccine manufacturer's recommendation. Usually, an every other year vaccination is advised.
Dewormer: Give a dewormer every 3 to 4 weeks, starting when your Tonkinese is 8 or 9 weeks old. Do this a minimum of two times.;
, Decide if you'd like to breed your cat. If not, get your Tonkinese spayed (if she's female) or neutered (if he's male) to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Make sure to have the surgery done before your Tonkinese is six months old. This will reduce the likelihood that your Tonkinese will breed before having the surgery.


Spaying or neutering your cat can also cut down on undesirable behaviors such as spraying urine or annoying heat induced behaviors, can reduce her cancer risk, and can reduce the likelihood that she'll roam., While it may seem like your Tonkinese is constantly at the vet's if she's a kitten, you need to continue providing regular veterinary care as she grows. Your cat should see the vet once a year for an exam and vaccination boosters. Do this until she becomes a senior cat around 10 years of age.


Once your Tonkinese is around 10 years old she should see the veterinarian twice a year. This will help catch any age-related diseases., Use a cat toothbrush and toothpaste to brush your cat's teeth every day. Get your cat used to teeth brushing by initially placing a small amount of toothpaste on your fingertip to let your cat taste it. Do this again the next day, but also rub your finger along her gums. The following day, put toothpaste on the brush and gently rub it along his gums. Over the next few days, slowly work the bristles along her teeth in small circles, working up to the entire mouth.Avoid using human toothpaste because the fluoride it contains is toxic to cats.
Brushing your cat's teeth daily will reduce plaque and bacteria buildup.Once your cat is comfortable with the process, it should only take a minute.

, While your veterinarian check your cat's teeth at her annual exam, you should also take her if you notice any loose or missing teeth; if she has growths or sores in her mouth; or if her gums are red or inflamed.Daily brushing is important, but it won't remove the deeper buildup of plaque and bacterial buildup under the gums. Take your Tonkinese to the veterinarian once a year for a professional teeth cleaning.

, If your cat is acting ill, contact your veterinarian for advice. Cats are good at hiding illnesses, so if you see her acting ill, she may have been sick for a while. Symptoms of illness include:Change in diet (not eating or drinking)
Vomiting excessively
Diarrhea
Problems urinating (either excessive or unable)
Weakness or lethargy

, Read the labels on cat foods and look for one that lists meat as one of the top two ingredients. Tonkinese cats need meat to get certain amino acids found only in meat protein. If they do not get these essential amino acids, they can become ill. They can suffer from serious eye and heart problems if these amino acids are lacking in the diet.


Manufactured cat food contains the essential nutrients your cat needs, but you still need to look for a quality product that doesn't contain more fillers than meat.

, Proper feeding is an important way to keep your Tonkinese healthy. Talk with your veterinarian or look on the food package to determine how much food to give according to your cat's age, weight, and activity level. Split this amount into two or three servings a day. Cats prefer to eat frequent, small meals throughout the day.Spreading out the food during the day will keep your Tonkinese feeling full and satisfied.
You may want to purchase a timed feeder that dispenses food throughout the day.

, Use a rubber brush or regular soft bristled cat brush to briskly brush over your Tonkinese. Since Tonkinese have a shorter coat, they don't need much grooming. Take grooming as a chance to check your cat for fleas, cysts, lumps or bumps on the skin.If fleas you find fleas, treat your cat immediately to control the problems.


Pay attention to any lumps or bumps, especially their size, shape and color. If they doesn’t resolve or grow within a week, contact your veterinarian.

, Trim your Tonkinese's claws when they get long and sharp. Place your cat on your lap and use the forearm on your dominant arm to gently restrain her upper body. Once she's restrained, use your other hand to pick up a paw and gently press on it. This will expose her claws and you can use your dominant hand to trim the the white tips off. Just be sure to avoid trimming the pink part of the nail. This area contains the blood and nerve supply. Cutting this part would cause your Tonkinese pain.


You can use scissor-type clippers, a guillotine-type of clipper, or human nail clippers., Place your cat's litter box in quiet part of the house that is out of the way. Tonkinese cats are generally easy to litter box train, as long as they have a clean litter box with fresh litter. Choose clay, clumping, silica-based, or plant based litter (like pine or wheat).Once you find a litter that your cat likes, keep using that kind or your cat may decide to relieve herself somewhere else.


Studies show that cats prefer fine-grained, unscented litter.Clean your cat's litter box daily by scooping out the soiled litter and replacing it with fresh litter.

, A scratching post gives your playful cat a chance to scratch, climb, and explore. Teach your cat to use the scratching post instead of scratching other things. When you notice your Tonkinese scratching something like the furniture, pick her up and place her near the scratching post. She'll soon associate scratching with the post. You can also spray cat deterrent spray on items you don’t want damaged by his scratching.


Scratching is a normal, healthy activity for cats to help them remove the dead outer part of the claws. It also lets your cat mark her territory., Since Tonkinese cats are active, you'll need to offer plenty of toys to keep her stimulated. Be sure to include interactive toys so that you can play with her. Consider using laser pointers and feather wand toys in your play sessions. Tonkinese love to play fetch. Toss her wadded up pieces of paper or small soft balls.


Don't forget that your Tonkinese cat also enjoys cuddling you. Let her spend time sitting in your lap or just relaxing with you., Tonkinese cats love to explore and climb. Give your cat the opportunity to climb and scramble. You may purchase a cat tower or set up a ramp so she can climb up and look out windows.


Your Tonkinese may become troublesome if she gets bored. Prevent this by creating an interesting environment for her to discover."

Give your Ocicat treats.",How to Care for Ocicats1," To keep your Ocicat in excellent physical condition, you will need to feed her a diet of high-quality cat food. One good way to choose a cat food is to read the ingredients. If the first two ingredients listed are meat (not meat by-products), then the food is probably high-quality. If not, then keep looking.


Make sure that the food contains taurine. Taurine is an essential amino acid that all cats need for good vision and heart health. Most cat foods will contain this ingredient, but if you find one that does not, then do not buy that food.;
, Some people free feed their cats, which is when the cat has access to unlimited dry food all of the time. This method of feeding can cause some cats to become overweight or even obese, so it is not ideal. Instead, maintain a regular feeding schedule for your cat and follow the guidelines on your cat’s food package to determine how much food to give your cat.Take the recommended daily feeding amount listed on your cat’s food package and divide it in half. For example, if your cat weighs between five and nine pounds, then the cat food package may suggest a maximum daily amount of 2/3 of a cup of food per day. To divide this into two portions, give your cat 1/3 of a cup in the morning and 1/3 of a cup in the evening.
Cats prefer small meals, so your Ocicat is more likely to finish her food if you give it to her in two portions.Ask your Ocicat’s veterinarian if you are unsure about how much to feed your cat.

, Your Ocicat will need to have access to a bowl of fresh, clean water at all times. Make sure that you have a special stainless steel or ceramic bowl for your Ocicat’s water.

Refill the feeder regularly.,
Show the birds to your cats.,
Position a piece of furniture near the window overlooking the bird feeder.,
Make sure your cats stay indoors.",How to Set Up an Outdoor Bird Feeder for Indoor Cats," The type of bird feeder you choose will depend on the location you plan to hang the feeder. There are three basic types of birdfeeders: ground, hanging, and window. To look at each type and make an informed decision, visit a local pet-supply store or birdwatching store, and speak with the sales staff.Ground feeders are planted in the ground and allow squirrels and chipmunks to access the food, in addition to birds.
Hanging feeders can be suspended from overhanging tree branches.
Window feeders attach to the wall of your house, outside of a window. This is probably the most practical type of feeder to use when hanging a feeder for your cats to watch.;
, When deciding where to hang the feeder, choose a location near a window that birds can access easily. Find a window that’s at least 10 feet (3 meters) off of the ground on the outside of the house, as this height will keep the feeder safe from squirrels, foxes, or outdoor cats.To make sure that your cats will be able to see and observe the bird feeder, it’s important that, inside the house, the window is accessible to your cats.
You should also make sure that this area is easy for you to access, because you will need to tend to the feeder regularly in order to refill and clean it.

, Once you’ve decided on a window to hang the birdfeeder in front of, make sure that the external window screen is secure and that the window itself closes tightly. By doing this, you’ll ensure that your cats won’t be able to press on the window and open it. Securing the screen will also ensure that birds won’t scratch or peck at it.Additionally, if you have children in the house, it would be wise to ask them not to open the window near the feeder. This will prevent birds from flying from the feeder directly into your house.

, When hanging an outdoor feeder, it’s a common problem for birds to fly into the window, mistaking the clear glass for open sky. To avoid this problem and spare birds’ lives, tape a bird-shaped silhouette on the window. This will deter birds from flying into the glass. Alternatively, you can hang a reflector to the outside surface of the glass; birds will see this and avoid flying into the window.Visit your local pet-supply shop, or a store dedicated to selling birdwatching products. Ask the sales staff what they recommend you put in your windows to prevent birds from flying into them.

, Although ground feeders come in a variety of models, most of them are attached to the top of a sturdy metal pole, which simply needs to be stabbed into the soil. Other models are made of wood or plastic and have a flat base or four legs, and can be placed on the ground. Set up your ground feeder on a flat patch of land near a window from which your cats can look out.

Be aware that, when feeding birds with a ground feeder, you’ll also attract a number of chipmunks, squirrels, and other small rodents.
If you don’t want to attract these types of animals, ask a sales person at your local pet supply store to recommend a type of feeder that deters rodents.

, This variety of feeder is composed of the hanging feeder and a rope attached to the top. You need to find a large overhanging branch that’s near enough to your house that your cats can see it from a window. Then, using a ladder, climb up to the branch and tie the rope securely around the branch. Make sure that your hanging feeder is suspended at least 5 feet (1.5 meters) off the ground, so squirrels cannot jump up to it.Use safety precautions when climbing a ladder to attach the tie-rope. Never lean a ladder against a weak or dead branch. Have a friend or family member hold the base of the ladder for stability.

, These feeders typically have 2 or 3 large suction cups attached to the back, which you can stick to your window. Attach the feeder by dampening the suction cups (this will make them more adhesive) and sticking them firmly to the glass of a window. Hang the feeder low on the window so cats can easily see it, but so that it won’t obstruct your own view.

If you need to use a ladder to access a second- or third-floor window, have someone stand below you and stabilize the legs of the ladder.

, Of course, to attract birds, you’ll need to fill the feeder with seeds. Most types of bird seed are blends of grains: they commonly include sunflower seeds and millet, which appeal to a variety of bird species. Once you’ve filled the feeder, birds may be slow to start coming at first. However, as more and more birds discover your feeder, it may become quite crowded.Speak with the sales staff at a birdwatching store, and ask which types of seed they recommend to attract various types of birds in your area.

, The frequency with which you refill the bird feeder depends on how quickly the birds empty it, and how often you’re willing to pay for seed. If you refill the seeder as soon as the birds finish the seed, you may find yourself replenishing the seed a couple of times each week.However, if you let the feeder stay empty for too long or refill it infrequently, fewer and fewer birds will come back to the feeder.

, Once birds start to come to your outdoor feeder, you’ll need to show your cats the feeder and the birds. The outdoor bird feeder won’t do your cats any good if the pets don’t know of the feeder’s existence or location. Pick up your cats and bring them to the window overlooking the bird feeder. If there are birds at the feeder, this should arouse your cats’ curiosity.

If your cats have already discovered the bird feeder and are curious about the birds, you may not need to show your cats the feeder.

, This will give your cats an easy access point from which they can observe the birds.Depending on the height of the windowsill, a relatively low piece of furniture should do, such as a chest-high bookshelf or a low dresser. If the cats are unable to leap up to the window, they won’t be able to observe the birds at the feeder.

Alternately, if the window which overlooks the bird feeder has a sill large enough for the cats to comfortably rest on, you may only need to position furniture so that the cats have easy access to the windowsill.
Move a chair or low table, so your cats can leap from that to the windowsill.

, Once your cats have found out about the bird feeder, they should enjoy regularly overlooking the birds and watching them fly and eat. However, your cats may also try to escape and run out to the feeder, where they will likely try to catch the birds. To prevent this, make sure that your cats don’t run outside.

Be careful when opening doors that lead outside, especially with your cats nearby.
You can use your feet or body to block the door when you’re walking outside, or set up a gate across the opening of the door when you exit.

When you believe you have a correctly sized collar, try it on the cat to see if it fits.You can quickly take a measuring tape and wrap it around the neck of your cat to get an estimate of how large the e-collar should be. However, experimenting with different settings on the e-collar is the only way to verify what setting makes for the best fit.
Ideally, your first fitting should be done by a veterinarian. If you feel the need to remove and replace the collar, use the same settings that your veterinarian used when first applying the e-collar.
The Elizabethan collar should fit snugly, so that the cat cannot move its head much.;
, The collar should be flat when you get it. Wrap it around to form the cone shape the Elizabethan collar is known for. Be sure that the side labeled ""bottom"" is wrapped underneath the one that reads top.How far these two sides overlap will depend upon how tight the collar will be. Most collars are adjustable. Experiment to see what size fits your cat.
If the sides are not labeled “top” or “bottom,” put the side with the long plastic tab hanging from it on top.

, The top fold should have a long piece of plastic hanging off the inside of the fold that is aligned with two large holes. The bottom fold should have four small slits, that might be labeled ""in"" and ""out"". Align the folds so that you can thread the plastic all the way through the first slit, out the second, in the third, and out the fourth.


By the time you complete this process the collar should be securely shaped like a cone.
This is a good time to slide the cone on to your cat’s head to determine if it fits appropriately. Remember, you will use an additional collar to secure the e-collar in place when you are done.

, There should be three smaller pieces of plastic, circling the inside of the collar. These should be aligned with their own slits. Thread these in and out of the slits, so that by the end you have four loops around the inside of the collar.Check to verify that the loops are secure and cannot easily be pulled out. You might want to bend the end of the plastic a little bit and pull on the loop to keep the plastic firmly in place.These loops will be used so that you can wrap your cat's normal collar around the inside of the e-collar to help secure it in place.

, Now that you have four loops around the inside of the Elizabethan collar, run your cat’s normal collar through these loops. That way, once the Elizabethan collar is on your cat, you can use the other collar to help secure it in place., How you pick up your cat will vary depending upon how cooperative it is. If it is content being handled, grab your cat underneath the abdomen with one hand. Hold it close to your body. Use your other hand to hold its chin in place. Carry it to a flat surface like a table.If your cat is frightened, place a towel over it. Let it sit for a couple of minutes until it calms down. Then wrap the towel around the bottom of your cat and pick up it up, so that it is bundled up in the towel.
If a cat is aggressive, grab it and pick it up by the skin on the back of its neck. Use your other hand to hold your cat's back feet and support it from behind.

, If you have someone to assist you, have him use both hands to either hold the cat's neck or front legs. At the same time, he should lean over on the table and press his arms against the side of the cat. That way, the cat will be secured by pressure on both sides.


Talk to your cat in a calming voice to reassure it and make it more comfortable.
If you are trying to secure the cat yourself and having some difficulty, grab it by the skin on the back of its neck and lift its front legs off the table. This will leave one hand free. This position also makes it impossible for the cat to scratch you. Because cats are carried like this by their mother, they also tend to calm down in this position., Consider asking a second person to hold your cat in place; it will probably not want to cooperate. Standing behind your cat, slide the smaller opening of the e-collar over the cat's face and onto the neck. Gently pull the cat's ears forward., Close the collar that you looped through the inside of the Elizabethan collar. This should secure the Elizabethan collar in place. Be sure that it fits snugly, without impeding your cats’ breathing.Alternatively, something like a ribbon can be passed through the loops and then tied around your cats neck to secure the e-collar in place.

, While you should be able to install and remove the Elizabethan collar yourself, a veterinarian will be able to make sure that you have the best fit. Try to have a professional take on and pull off the collar whenever possible. Do not stop use of the collar until you have been told to do so by a veterinarian., While the Elizabethan collar might look uncomfortable, you cat should be able to eat, sleep, and get around with it on. There is no good reason to take it off, and if you do, your cat might ruin the stitching on its wounds, requiring serious surgical intervention.If you do feel the need to remove the collar, the process should not be too difficult. Simply undo the secondary collar that is wrapped through the loops of the Elizabethan collar. Then pull the Elizabethan collar directly off your cats’ head. Leave the remainder of the collar constructed so that it can easily be slid back on your cat when the time comes.

, There are now some alternatives to the Elizabethan collar on the market that purport to be more comfortable, or even safer in that they don’t block peripheral vision and thus are less likely to lead to another accident. Before trying these though, consult with your veterinarian about how effective these alternatives are."

Remember, the shelves are places where your cat will not only sleep, but also run across and jump onto. This means you want to place them away from areas where they can hit something and break it.Keep the shelves away from televisions, cabinets full of expensive items, couches, and beds. You don’t want the cat jumping down from the shelf onto you in the middle of a movie or while you sleep.;
, Make sure to choose a spot in your home where your cat hangs out. Don't place shelves in an area or room where your cat never goes. You want to give your cat access to shelves in their normal areas in your home.


For example, if your cat spends most of their time in the living room, find a place in your living room to mount them. If they like to sleep in the spare bedroom, consider placing the shelves there.

, Choose the height of the shelves based on your cats. Most cats can climb and jump high. However, if you have an overweight cat, a senior cat, or a cat with mobility issues, you should place your shelves lower on the wall.


Instead of having them climb vertically, you may want to spread out different horizontal shelves your cat can easily get to so they have multiple shelves to play on.
You may also consider placing some shelves closer together. Instead of a large vertical space for them to jump, place them with a shorter, easier vertical space they can step up on.

, Before you put up the shelves, take a pencil and draw lines on the wall where you want to put the shelves. If you want to put them in a particular design, figure out where each one will go and how far apart you want them.Make sure you do this ahead of time. You do not want to put up shelves and not like where they are and have to take them down again.

, To provide some variety for your cat, choose shelves of different sizes. Choose some that are long and others that are wider. If you are buying cat shelves, you can find shelves that are rounded or in odd shapes.Try long shelves over doors, short shelves as steps up towards wide shelves that multiple cats can lay on., You can set your cat shelves up in a variety of different ways. You set them up on a diagonal, like a staircase going up. Each shelf will be to the side and slightly higher than the previous.


You can do a zigzag pattern, where you put two to three shelves going upwards in a diagonal, and then switch directions the other way as the shelves continue going up.

, When building your own cat shelves, you may choose to cover the shelves in carpet or paint the shelves. Painting the shelves makes the shelves match the decor. Covering them in carpet gives the cat a surface for traction, and it also gives them something to scratch.Choosing carpet squares can give you a way to add color or individuality to your cat furniture.

, You can buy cat shelves to place in your home. Premade cat shelves can be purchased from a pet store or online retailer.Buying cat shelves may be more convenient because they come with mounting hardware.


Cat shelves may be very expensive. Some can be over one hundred dollars. Doing it yourself may be much cheaper.

, If you want to make your own shelves, try different sizes, like an 18 inch and a 24 inch. You can also start with a piece of 2x6 wood, and get a few pieces of wood slightly larger than that.You can buy shelves intended for knickknacks or books, or pieces of board to make into shelves at a home improvement store.

, Take the carpet pieces and cut them to fit your shelf. Then, you need to attach it to the wood or shelf. You can do this by nailing the carpet to the wood. Alternately, you can use a staple gun and staple the carpet to the wood.Try buying carpet squares instead of rolls of carpet. You may also ask at a home improvement store for any carpet scraps.

, To keep the shelves against the wall, you need some kind of bracket. Metal L brackets are great for attaching cat shelves onto the wall. Attach one side of the bracket onto the bottom of the board with screws. Just make sure the screw isn’t so long that it’s going to come through the wood on the other side.The side that goes on the wall should be the longer side. Make sure the side you attach to the board is the short side.

, If you are buying normal shelves, the weight limitation on the wall anchor may be too small to hold your cat. Most traditional shelving only holds around 10 pounds. Instead, buy wall anchors that will hold up to 50 pounds.If you buy cat shelves, check the weight limits. Make sure your cat doesn’t weight more than the shelf will hold.

, Before you mount the shelf, make sure to align the brackets and shelves where you want them. Use the level to make sure the shelf will be straight. Then mark where the screws should be drilled into the wall.If you have someone helping you, you can go directly from holding the level to attaching the brackets to the wall.

, Once you decide where the shelf is going to go on the wall, attach the other side of the bracket to the wall. Use a drill to attach the bracket on the wall with anchors and screws.Make sure you are using longer screws to mount the shelves on the wall.

Try it on for safety.",How to Measure Clothing for Your Cat," Catch your cat in a good mood, or a sleepy mood. Wait until your cat is holding still, and take his or her measurements. If your cat is hyper, play with him for a while and gradually calm him down. For example, let your cat chase a toy for a while, then let him catch the toy.


Feeding your cat might calm him down.
If your cat will not hold still, try pinching the scruff of his neck with a binder clip.This will not hurt your cat, and it is likely to calm him.
Different strategies work for different cats. Do whatever your cat needs to calm down.;
, Take a measuring tape. Measure from the base of your cat's neck to the base of your cat's tail. Record the number. If you have no measuring tape, procure a string and a ruler. Measure with the string, then lie the string along the ruler and record its measure.

, Do this while your cat is lying quietly at full length. Start the measuring tape in the middle of your cat's back. Slide it under your cat, then wrap it around the largest part of the cat's belly. If you are making an outfit with a harness, wrap the tape measure firmly, but without squeezing. If you are making clothes that cover the belly, leave a little room so your cat doesn't feel squished.

, Depending on the design of the outfit, you might want to measure the length of the legs or the circumference of the head. Measure your cat's legs while he stands. Try to avoid dressing your cat in anything that will squeeze his neck or obstruct his hearing or vision. Turtlenecks are not recommended.


If your cat wears a collar, measure the collar instead of your cat's neck.
Cats generally are distressed when their ears are covered, so reconsider the hat., Buy pet clothing from an independent designer or a trustworthy pet accessory retailer. Opt for outfits that have been cat-tested and cat-approved. Avoid outfits with small or dangling pieces. The outfit's description should include measurements: make sure they match the measurements you took, and opt for a looser fit over a snugger one.Buy an outfit made for a large doll only if it will accommodate your cat's neck and limbs without squeezing.

, Cut out your cat's outfit from a pattern designed specifically for cats. Check the pattern against your measurements. If it is too small, discard it. Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to every measurement to avoid creating a snug outfit that will rub your cat's hair uncomfortably.Pick a soft cloth that does not smell strongly. If you can, let your cat play with it before you sew it. If the cloth smells familiar, your cat will be less disturbed by it.
If you cannot find a good pet costume, you can try adapting an outfit designed for a large doll.

, Try the outfit on your cat to see if your cat will tolerate it. Make sure the costume does not obstruct your cat's vision, hearing, or movement. Clothing that covers the ears, falls in the eyes, or blocks the legs will cause your cat a lot of stress. Do not tie anything around your cat's neck, as this can choke it.


Remove any small or dangling parts of the outfit, as your cat may chew and swallow them."

Put the nail caps on.",How to Put Nail Caps on Your Cat," There are several acceptable implements you could use to trim your cat’s nails. You might want to use regular nail clippers of the same variety people use. You might use guillotine-style clippers. Or you might use clippers that more closely resemble pliers.Whatever you choose to use, ensure the blades of the tool remain sharp.;
, Since all cats are different, there is no universally best way to situate your cat in advance of trimming its nails. Get to know what sort of position your cat is most at ease in, and help it adopt this position before you begin trimming its nails.For instance, some cats are most relaxed when sitting on their human’s lap.
Other cats are most at ease when propped on a particular piece of furniture, or in a particular room.

, Take the paw whose nails you wish to clip in your hand. Using your thumb and index finger, squeeze the top and bottom of the paw at a point just behind the point from which the claw extends. This will cause the claw to extend. Clip the end of the claw carefully.Don’t try to cut all the cat’s nails in one sitting. Do one or two paws per session.
Don’t clip the quick. The quick is an interconnected network of blood vessels in the part of the nail closest to the cat’s paw. You can identify the quick by looking for a pinkish or reddish mass within the nail.
If you don’t feel comfortable clipping your cat’s nails, go to a veterinarian or professional groomer to have your cat’s nails clipped., Generally, nail caps come in three sizes: small, medium, and large. These sizes depend on your cat’s weight. Each manufacturer will define what sort of cat their product is designed for. Check the packaging carefully when shopping for nail caps to ensure you buy some that fit your cat’s nails.Additionally, nail caps come in different sizes. Choose the size that fits your cat’s nails. To select the size that will fit your cat’s nails, check the nail cap package for information regarding which nail caps are best for a cat of a particular size.
Choose a color that you like.

, Inside the nail cap package, you’ll find a variety of materials. Every nail cap package is different, but each will probably include nail caps, adhesive, and applicator tips in varying quantities. Each of these objects will probably be packaged separately. Open each package in turn so that all necessary materials are ready for use.You’ll only need one applicator tip and one container of adhesive.
You might need to cut the adhesive container’s top off. In other cases, the adhesive’s lid will simply twist off.
Additionally, your nail cap package should include an instruction manual. Read the instruction manual before applying the nail caps so that you’re aware of the specific directions for use.

, While it is possible to put nail caps on your cat by yourself, the whole process proceeds much more smoothly if you hold and reassure your cat while a friend or family member applies the glue to the nail cap. Once the nail caps are ready, you can just slide them on your kitty’s claws., If you project stress and frustration while applying nail caps to your cat, your cat will sense your mood and feel similarly anxious and frustrated. To keep your cat happy and relaxed throughout the process, talk to it kindly from time to time, and rub its belly and neck between each nail cap application., Place your cat’s rump on your lap. Tuck its head into the crook of an elbow. Rub your cat’s belly and neck gently to reassure it.The best place to cradle the cat is in a sofa or chair with large, soft arms. This will enable you to lean the arm supporting your cat’s head against the armrest.

, Using your thumb and index finger, gently squeeze the top and bottom of the paw. Place your index finger on the paw pad of the nail you’d like to cap. Above the nail you’d like to cap, push down and out (away from the cat’s body) with your thumb. The claw you’d like to cap should then pop out., Fill the applicator tip with adhesive. Squeeze one or two drops of adhesive into a nail cap using the applicator tip. This will fill the nail cap with adhesive. Squeeze the sides of the nail cap gently to evenly distribute the adhesive within. Slide the nail cap on your cat’s extended nail until it stops.Continue to extend your cat’s claws and apply nail caps to the other nails on each paw.
If you’re trying to prevent your furniture from being scratched and torn, you probably only need to apply nail caps to the cat’s front paws. Understand that it may take your cat some time to adjust to wearing the nail caps."

Know which usages to avoid.",How to Make Catnip Spray," The easiest way to do this is simply to buy it. Catnip will be available at most pet stores. You may be able to find catnip at hardware and grocery stores with a ""Pets"" section. Catnip is also available for order online. Wherever you buy from, it's fairly cheap — a small container will rarely cost you more than $10.If you're a gardener, you can also get catnip seeds from many garden supply stores for much cheaper.Plant the catnip plants in the early spring and harvest the leaves at any point during the growing season.;
, The spray you'll make for your cat in this section is actually a sort of ""tea"" that's been allowed to cool. Like any tea, your first step should be to boil some water. The exact amount of water you use doesn't matter that much — the more you use, the more dilute the spray will be. If this is your first time, you may want to try boiling about four to five cups to start and adjust the recipe as you wish in the future.


If you have an actual teapot, you may want to use it for convenience here. If you don't, no need to worry. A small saucepan also works well.

, When the water reaches a steady boil, remove it from the heat. Let it cool for a minute or two to about 80 degrees C (176 F). Next, add your catnip: about one teaspoon of dried leaves or one tablespoon of fresh catnip.There are a few ways you can do this:


If you have a metal tea ball or infuser, put the catnip inside it, then lower it into the water.
If you don't have these sort of tea accessories, you can just dump the catnip in and strain it out later.

, Now, all you need to do is wait. Over the next few minutes, the catnip leaves will release their inner chemicals into the water, including the active ingredient nepetalactone.You should notice a slight change in the color and smell of the water.


If you wish, you can also stir the water every few minutes to distribute the catnip throughout.

, The tea should be ready after about five to seven minutes.The longer you let the catnip sit in the tea, the stronger it will get, so don't forget to remove it! After, let the tea cool to room temperature.


If you used a tea ball or infuser, you can just pull it out of the water. If the leaves are floating directly in the water, pour the tea through a strainer into another container to remove them. If you don't have a strainer, you can use cheesecloth or a coffee filter.

, Now, just pour the tea into a clean plastic spray bottle and it's ready to use! You can use one that you already have or buy one from most department stores for extremely cheap.


If you're reusing a spray bottle, be sure to thoroughly wash it and allow it to dry before using it for catnip purposes. Don't reuse containers that originally contained caustic cleaners like bleach or ammonia.
Store leftover tea in an airtight container in the fridge.

, Your new catnip spray can be used in a wide variety of ways. In general, anything you spray it on will make the cat ""go nuts"" when the cat goes near it, touches, or smells it. This can make it fun for your cat (and you) if you use the spray on your cat's favorite objects. A few suggestions are below!


Play it safe with your spray at first. Start off with just one or two sprays, then judge your cat's reaction and give more sprays as needed.

, One great idea is to give a few sprays in the place where your cat usually sleeps. When the cat eventually comes here, it will have a comfortable spot to jump, roll around, and otherwise wig out. The soft bedding will feel especially good as the cat rubs itself against the sprayed surfaces.

, Another good idea is to spray things like chew toys, rag dolls, scratching posts, and so on. The toys may become irresistible to the cat, leading to intense, frantic playing followed by periods of ""spacing out"".

, This can mealtime a delightful surprise! It's completely safe for your cat to eat food that has been sprayed with catnip. However, be aware that your cat may be tempted to make a mess when it starts to feel the effects.

, If you've never seen a cat play with catnip before, you may be shocked to see how your cat reacts to your spray. To put it bluntly, catnip makes cats act like they're drunk or ""high"". The substance is somewhat unpredictable and different cats may react differently to it. However, certain reactions are common. If you see these, don't worry — your cat will be much calmer in a few minutes and should be back to normal in an hour or two:


Loud meowing
Rolling and writhing against the catnip
Hyperactive running and playing
Weird movements and gestures
""Spacing out"" — standing still and staring at nothing

, Catnip is usually good, safe fun for your cat — unlike alcohol and other human drugs, it's completely non-toxic to cats.However, this doesn't mean that any use of catnip is a smart idea. See below:


Don't spray catnip directly onto a cat (especially into its face). This can be too intense and may irritate the cat's eyes.
Don't play with catnip in dangerous areas (like near dropoffs, fragile objects, fires, and so on). Remember that it's common for catnip to make cats act wild and foolish.
Don't play with catnip more than about once per week. Using it more often isn't dangerous, but it can make it less effective over time."

Contact the nearest zoning board, building inspector, or other regional government office to see whether it limits farmers to certain breeds, ban only uncastrated male goats (bucks), or imposes some other limitation. Check with your landlord or homeowner association as well.


Make it clear whether you are raising goats for commercial or personal use, as different regulations may apply.;
, Goats are social animals, and are more likely to be uncooperative or try to escape if kept alone. Always keep at least two goats in each enclosure.Because uncastrated males (bucks) cannot be kept with females (does), this may require purchasing more than two goats. Keep reading for tips on deciding which sex of goats to purchase.

, There are three main types of goats divided by sex: females, called does; uncastrated males, called bucks; and castrated males, called wethers. Does need to be impregnated by a buck before they produce milk, but raising a buck can require a lot of extra work. Bucks require a separate enclosure, may develop a strong odor, and are often aggressive.For the easiest start to your goat farm, buy two does, and pay another goat farm for the opportunity to breed your does with its buck.


Neutered males, or wethers, are not able to breed or produce milk. They are usually purchased as barnyard pets. Many goat farms end up with wethers when their goats give birth to extra males.
If you do purchase a buck, consider spending extra for one with breeding papers. You'll have a better idea of its traits and are less likely to breed defects into your herd.

, Young goats are called kids, or bucklings or doelings depending on sex. When around 8 weeks old, they are typically cheaper than older goats, and may be friendlier if raised around humans, but they require one to two years of care before they can be bred, produce milk, or be sold as meat. A junior kid between 6 months and 1 year old will take less time to mature, and may even come with the option to have it bred before purchase (so it produces milk sooner). Finally, an adult or senior goat may be the cheapest option of all, but be wary of goat farmers selling useful milk producers. They may be trying to sell the lowest-quality goats in their herd., Some breeds are suited for milk production, such as Nigerian Dwarf, La Mancha, and Alpine goats. Others are usually raised for meat, such as the Spanish or Tennessee breeds. Finally, some farms raise Angora or Cashmere goats to sell their hair for fabric.Find out which breeds are raised in your area, how large each breed grows to, and the physical and personality traits of each breed. Some breeds tend to be more docile, produce bucks with a stronger smell, or be prone to certain health problems.


Before deciding, you may want to read up on how to milk goats, slaughter goats, or shear goats. If you are not up to slaughtering a goat yourself, find commercial slaughtering operations nearby that will purchase your goats before raising goats for meat.

, The costs of raising a goat varies over time and from region to region, as does the profit you can earn from selling goat products. If you are planning to raise goats for commercial purposes, it pays to get a good idea of costs and expected profit. Try to talk to several goat farmers or read recently published goat farming guides in your area to get a good estimate of the following costs. If the resulting estimate is above your budget, you might decide to purchase fewer goats, or a different breed.Keep in mind that a goat farm may not be profitable for two years or more, especially if you are raising young goats or need to pay for initial setup such as fencing.


How much does it cost to raise a doe, a buck, or a kid for one year? Try to find numbers for your specific goat breed if possible.
If you are raising goats for milk, how much milk does one doe produce? How much can you sell this milk for?
If you are raising goats for meat, how much does a slaughtered goat sell for? Do they sell for more during a specific time of year, such as Muslim holidays, Christmas, or Easter?
How much on-hand money do you have available for unexpected costs, such as fencing repair or veterinary procedures? If one of your goats dies, will that cause you financial hardship?

, Goats are excellent at crawling through small gaps or climbing over fencing. Five feet fences or higher of sturdy, ""no climb"" wire fencing strung between posts is harder to climb or slip through than fences constructed with horizontal beams.If you have both bucks and does, make sure to build a separate, strong buck pen with especially sturdy and tall fencing. This fence will keep your bucks in rut from accessing your does in estrus (heat); in other words, this will prevent your goats from unplanned breeding.


Goats of significantly different sizes should not be kept with each other, unless they are kids kept with their mother.
Bucks can become aggressive when in rut and near females, so the separate enclosure is highly recommended even if you don't care about unplanned breeding.

, Your goats will need a place to go in the winter and when it's raining. A small pole barn will work just fine. Goat breeds with thick coats may be able to withstand colder temperatures, but check with an experienced goat farmer first. If you live in a mild climate a three-sided enclosure will provide fresh air; if your area experienced cold winters, create a fully enclosed, draft-free environment, but let the goats out during the day.


Goats hate puddles and wet weather. If you live in a rainy area, you may wish to provide a larger indoor enclosure.

, Goats will graze or chew on almost anything, although stories of them eating cars and tin cans tend to be exaggerated. Milkweed, bracken fern, or wild cherry leaves are examples of plants that can be poisonous to goats, although some goats may not eat these if provided with a sufficient variety and quantity of other foods. Strong-smelling plants may add an unpleasant taste to the goat's milk, including onion, cabbage, buttercup, and parsley.

, Shop around for food and water buckets. Compare various grains to determine which will be nutritious and cost-effective for feeding your goats. The feed should provide significant amounts of calcium and phosphorus in a 1.2:1 ratio to prevent health problems, and certain feeds may require additional mineral supplements.An experienced goat farmer or a veterinarian may be able to advise you on locally available options.

, Most goat species grow horns, and if allowed to grow, these horns have the potential to seriously injure other animals or humans. Anytime after the young goat is two weeks old, have the horn stubs removed, or ""disbudded."" This can be painful for the goat, and difficult without proper assistance. The assistance of an experienced goat farmer or veterinarian is recommended, especially one who knows how to administer anesthetization before starting the procedure.If the skin on their forehead is easily moved around by rubbing, the goats are probably naturally hornless and do not require disbudding.

, Even if you are breeding goats, you typically only need one buck per 25–50 does. Young, male goats that you do not intend to breed should be castrated at two weeks old or later, but only if they are healthy. Have a veterinarian administer a preventative tetanus shot before you perform the castration.Male goats grow large testicles, so even a castrated goat (wether) may not look as though it has been castrated.

, If you wish your does to produce milk or kids, you will need to breed them with a buck once the doe has reached breeding age. When a doe goes into estrus (heat), remove it from the herd and introduce it to a buck, rather than the other way around. Two to four breedings is usually enough to ensure pregnancy. A normal gestation period is around 150 days, but this can vary by species.

, Does can be milked while they are pregnant, once the udder is enlarged. Milk one or two times a day until roughly two months before the due date for the birth. This pause ensures the mother has enough nutrients to feed the newborn goat. Resume milking again once the newborn kid is six weeks old.You do not need to breed the doe again until its milk production drops significantly.

, Know who you can consult if one of your goats develops a health problem or escapes its enclosure. If no goat farmers or livestock veterinarians live nearby, try to find a book on goat farming that covers topics such as performing a health check and identifying signs of disease., Whether you are selling meat, fiber, dairy products, or goat kids, you'll need to find a market to purchase them. For a small operation, it may be easiest to sell to individuals in your community or become a vendor at a farmer's market. If you have more products than you can sell this way, you can ship products through online orders or sell them to a commercial vendor who takes care of delivery for you.


Consider opening up your farm to visitors, and charging people to visit and pet friendly goats.

Get goat specific shampoo.,
Tie up the goat in an open area with a drain.,
Ask someone to help you wash the goat.,
Mix the shampoo and water together in a bucket.,
Pour the soapy mixture over the goat.,
Rinse off the goat with clean water.,
Let the goat air dry if it’s hot out.,
Blow dry the goat.,
Use a clean towel to dry the goat.",How to Wash a Goat," Look for shampoo made for goat hair at your local pet store or online. Goat specific shampoo will be gentle on the goat’s coat and ensure it retains its natural oils.In a pinch, you can use mild soap like Dawn dishwashing detergent. Make sure the soap is gentle and does not contain any harsh chemicals like bleach or ammonia.;
, Make sure the goat doesn’t slip away during washing by tying it up to a secure spot, such as a post next to a drain. Put a collar on the goat and tie it up so it is secure.Tying the goat up in an open area with a drain will ensure the water can drain properly off the goat when you wash it.

, It can be tricky to wash the goat on your own, especially if the goat is large or skittish. Ask a friend or partner to help you hold the goat and soothe it while you wash it.


If you are practiced at washing the goat and have secured it by tying it up, you may not need a second pair of hands.

, Place the bucket of water close to the goat and within your reach. Pour a few drops of the shampoo into the water and mix it together., Carefully lift the bucket of water and pour the soapy mixture over the goat. Avoid getting any of the mixture in the goat’s face or eyes. Let the soapy mixture fall over the goat’s coat. Make sure you get the goat’s hind legs as well.You can also use a sponge dipped in the soapy mixture to drip the mixture over the goat. Do this until the entire goat is covered with the mixture.
Let the water run down the goat's coat to clean it. Do not scrub or rub the goat's hair as this can strip it up of its natural oils.

, Use a bucket of clean water to wash off the soapy mixture on the goat. Lift the bucket and pour the mixture over the goat to rinse it off. Make sure all the soapy mixture is removed from the goat’s coat.You can gently run your hand through the goat’s coat to help distribute the clean water in the goat’s coat and remove the soap.

, If you are washing the goat on a warm day, let the goat air dry in direct sunlight. Make sure the goat is tied up and under constant supervision so it does not wander off and get dirty before it dries.It may take some time for the goat to dry in the sun, but this method will result in a beautiful, clean, fluffy coat.

, Another option is to use a blow dryer to dry the goat quickly and efficiently. Use a blow dryer on the gentle heat setting. Tie up the goat when you blow dry it to make the job easier.Move the blow dryer all over the goat in a side to side motion to dry their coat. Use the low heat setting so their hair is not damaged by the heat.

, Gently wipe the water off the goat’s coat. Try not to rub the goat’s hair, as this can damage it and remove the natural oils. You may need to wipe the goat down several times with the towel to get it dry."

Consider the character of the doe.,
Check her udder.,
Look at the teats.,
Feel and look at her rib cage.,
Look at her legs and gait.,
Check the condition of her coat.,
Look at her eyes.,
Look at the condition of the whole herd when purchasing does.",How to Spot a Good Milker (Goats)," Is she well behaved and docile? This will make for a better milker than an agitated and nervous doe.


Look for an alert attitude. Check her tail – if it's droopy, it can mean that something is wrong.;
, It should be soft, wide, and round.

, Symmetry is an important signal; are her teats all the same size?


Teats should not be so long that they drag on the ground. Check that they are sitting high enough and unlikely to get caught up in her legs when she walks.

, It should be well-rounded. This indicates that she is able to accommodate a lot of feed that is then turned into milk. She should also have a good appetite (the only time this diminishes in a healthy doe is during labor).


In conjunction with this, she should have no problems chewing, eating, and swallowing.

, She should have strong legs and not have difficulties walking. If she has a hunched back, this can indicate that she is unwell or that something is wrong.


Check her hoofs. Hoof rot can manifest itself in lameness, a stench, and black deterioration of the inner hoof., A good sign is a smooth coat with soft skin, with no bare patches in the coat.


If her coat is dull, she probably has parasites. Lice may be a problem if there is listlessness, weakness, and anemia.If her coat is fluffed up, this can mean that the doe is unwell., They should be clear and bright, indicating that she is not suffering from an illness.

, This should help give you an indication of the care that has been given to the goats.


Taste the milk from the herd and preferably from the doe you'd like to purchase."

Clip the goats between the end of June (mid-winter southern hemisphere) and before September.,
Measure the down.,
Try to avoid the worst of the winter weather.,
Shear the goats in different colour lots to avoid cross-contamination of the fleeces.,
Place the goat in a shearing restraint for shearing.,
Feed and shelter well.,
Sort the fleeces.",How to Harvest Cashmere," (In the northern hemisphere, this probably equates to the end of December to before March but check with local conditions and ask breeders or goat associations for confirmation.) The downy hair will moult as winter comes to an end, leaving only the coarse fibres.;
, It must be at least 30mm in length to make it worthwhile.


Do not shear parts of the goat that are shorter than this, and do not shear at all if the goat's downy hair is not at least this long anywhere.

, If you cannot avoid it, do not shear pregnant does, as the stress may cause them to abort. Whatever you do, you must be assured of having adequate shelter for the goats after shearing because goats do not have a layer of fat to keep them warm (unlike sheep).

, Shear white goats first, then grey, then brown.

, Usually this will mean only its head is restrained.


Shear tail to shoulder length first, each side.
Shear down the shoulders.
Finish by shearing shoulder to tail.

, After harvesting the cashmere, keep the food highly nutritious and regular. Regardless of your shearing, cashmere goats will continue to moult, losing even the stubble that remains after shearing.

, Remove any contaminants such as vegetable matter and stains.

Find a sturdy stick or dowel.,
Cut a length of string or fishing line.,
Attach the string to the dowel.,
Tie the feathers onto the length of string.",How to Make Kitten Toys1," Usually your feather toy won’t require a stick longer than two feet, but depending on your height you may want to select a stick that’s a bit longer. As for thickness, you should try to find a stick that’s around a half inch in diameter—any slimmer and it might snap while your kitten is playing with it.;
, Fishing line is usually the best choice for making feather toys because it’s easy to work with and very strong. Fishing line has the added benefit of being hard to see, causing your kitten to focus more on the feathered end of the toy and avoid getting tangled up in the line. If you don’t have fishing line, any thin, sturdy string will do.

, Use some strong tape to affix your string to the dowel, making sure to wrap the tape tightly. While masking tape is an acceptable choice, electrical tape is even better. Electrical tape will wrap tighter and last longer than masking or scotch tape.


While tape usually gets the job done, you may also want to consider drilling a small hole in the dowel and threading the string through the hole. Be sure to tie a knot at one end of the string to prevent it from slipping through.

, There are a few methods you could use to attach the feathers, but the most secure way is to pierce a small hole in through the hollow, quill end of the feather and thread your string through. Be sure to thread all your feathers onto the string before tying off the end with a knot.Feathers can usually be found a craft store and are typically inexpensive. Resist the temptation to use wild bird feathers that may be laying around your yard or neighborhood, as they haven’t been sterilized and may make your kitten sick.
When making your holes, a needle or awl will usually be sufficient to pierce the quill.
You may also want to attach a few small bells or rattles to your feather toy by threading them onto the string the same way you attached the feathers. Your kitten may respond better to the toy if there’s sound involved.

Pick out a cardboard storage box the right shape and size for your cat.,
Cut a square or circular door-hole in the front of the box.,
Customise the bed specifically to your cat’s needs, likes and dislikes.,
Add a soft, comfortable base to the bed.",How to Make a Simple Cat's Bed1," Cats feel the cold more than humans so it will help your cat stay warm by providing great insulation from the cold, as well as a safe space to retreat and relax in. You can buy cardboard boxes in a variety of colours, floral, vintage or modern designs. This lets you choose one to suit your personal choice for your home décor. Alternatively you can simply use a cardboard box from the supermarket or local store.


This can be a fun project for a rainy day with your kids when your cat looks like they are in need of a nap.
Before you begin take a minute to learn how to keep your cat safe as well as cosy by making their bed a cat-friendly zone.;
, Cut the hole using scissors or with a craft knife. For an older, slower cat it makes sense to start the door-hole at ground level, but a younger cat or kitten who loves to jump will love a circular door-hole hole halfway up the front of the box.


Make sure the door-hole is large enough for your cat to climb in and out in comfort.
If your cat loves to squeeze into things keep the hole relatively small.
If your cat is sensitive to tight spaces then supersize the door!

, Does your cat like a quiet dark place? Do they like to look around and watch all the household bustle around them? Would they prefer the inside of the box to feel snug and dark, or sunny and light? Asking these questions will help to you design a bed perfect for your cat.


If your cat likes to look around them, think about cutting the top off the box as well as a door-hole – this will make sure that they don’t feel isolated.
If your cat likes privacy then a good idea is to tape a soft piece of fabric over the door-hole as a curtain. To make a chic bed you could use the same fabric to line the box.
Add a snack tube. Cut a hole in the top of box with scissors or a craft knife. Fit a paper toilet roll tube in it as a handy snack drop to ensure you don’t disturb their privacy.

, This can make a real difference in how quickly and happily your cat adapts. Their sensitive whiskers and paw pads mean that they love snuggling into soft textures. Think about your cat’s favourite textures - a pillow, a cushion a furry rug, some fur fabric or even vintage curtains may all suit them.


Add something that smells of you such as an old t-shirt or sweater.
Add a favourite toy, or appeal to their sense of smell with a little bit of cat nip.

Select a quality goat.,
Provide a safe environment.,
Feed your goat high quality food.,
Give your goat plenty of water.,
Provide proper vitamins and minerals.,
Adjust your goat's food as necessary.,
Cut your goat's hair.,
Trim your goat's hooves.,
De-horn your goat, if necessary, should be done when kids are 4 to 10 days old.,
Review the rules of your specific show.,
Practice in a barn.,
Get scrapie tag and official ID with the Board of Animal Health.,
Present your goat.,
Move your goat when asked.,
Shift your goat's position when asked.",How to Show a Goat in 4H," There are certain things you should look for when selecting a goat. You want a goat that lives up to show standards, as this can increase your chance of taking home a prize at the fair.Look for a goat with rounded shoulders and thick forelegs. The ribs should have deep twists as well as a soft feel. The goat's back should be strong. You should be able to see muscles throughout the back.
Pay attention to the goat's head. A goat should have a straight jaw. A jaw that is overshot is known as a ""parrot mouth"" as it creates a beak-like appearance. An undershot jaw is known as a ""monkey mouth."";
, Once you select a goat, you need to maintain the proper environment. This will allow your goat to grow and thrive.Your goat should have a barn or shed to sleep in. Make sure it is at least 15 square feet. You should also have a fenced in area outdoors where your goat can roam and get exercise.
Have the outdoor area as big as possible, as this will allow your goat to roam and play. Make sure your fence is at least 42 feet tall, as this will prevent your goat from escaping.

, You want a goat pellet that will make your goat grow big in preparation for the competition. You should go for a goat pellet comprised of 16% to 18% protein. This will help a young goat grow and build muscle.Feed your goat around 2 pounds of goat food a day. You will have to have some kind of trough or feeder in its barn.
You should make sure the feed you choose contains ammonium chloride. This helps prevent issues with a goat's urinary tract.

, This is essential to your goat's wellbeing. Water helps regulate the amount a goat eats. Goats that are dehydrated my overeat to compensate, resulting in obesity.Provide clean and fresh water on a daily basis.
Always check the goat's water trough when checking in on your goat. If the water trough is dirty or empty, clean it out and add more water.

, If you're feeding your goat a balanced diet, it should get most of the vitamins and minerals it needs. In addition to high quality pellets, give your goat fresh vegetables and grains to assure it is getting the right vitamins and minerals.Calcium, phosphorous, and salt are important to a goat's diet. Provide a salt lick for your goat, and feed your goat vegetables and grains. Vegetables have a lot of phosphorous, while grains are high in calcium.
Vitamin A is the only vitamin your goat will not get naturally in its diet. Talk to a vet about adding vitamin A supplements to your goat's diet.

, You want your goat to go into the show at a good weight. It may be necessary to feed your goat more or less in the weeks leading up to the show.Your goat should have some muscle definition in its back, legs, and flanks. You should also be able to feel your goat's ribs. Your goat should not have a visible belly.
If your goat appears puffy and lacks muscle definition, cut back on feeding slightly. You can also remove some hay from your goat's barn and pen to prevent snacking.

, A goat's hair should be neat and trimmed prior to a show. In the days leading up to the show, make sure to give your goat a good trim.Use a pair of shears to trim uneven hair on your goat. Target hair around the hooves, on the belly, in the ears, and at the bottom of the tail. You should also trim any uneven hairs on the goat's chin.
Check the expectations of the show you're attending. It may be preferable to shave your goat. If you choose to shave your goat, do it at least two weeks before the show. Use a blade that trims hair between 1/2 and 1/4 inch long. The hair on the hocks and knees should not be shaved.
Your goat may be nervous for the clipping or shaving process. It's a good idea to have a friend or family member hold the goat still while you work.

, Your goat will look more presentable at the show with neatly trimmed hooves. Use a good pair of hoof shears to trim your goat's hooves. Prior to cleaning, you should also use a hoof pick to clean manure and dirt out of your goat's hooves. You should also scrub the sides of the hooves with a toothbrush to get them clean.A goat's hoof has a hard outer shell protecting the soft white portion inside. Start by trimming around the outer portion. Then, move on to the white portion. The goal is to trim down your goat's hooves until they're level on the ground.
Keep trimming until the white portion turns to pink. Make sure the goat's heel and toe are on the same level.

, De-horning is required in some competitions. Check regulations at your show. If you need to de-horn your goat, do so prior to the show.You will need a de-horning iron, which you can get at a livestock store. It will need to be plugged in to warm up for about 10 minutes.
Trim the area around the goat's horns with a pair of shears. Then, put your goat in a holding box. This is a box that restricts a goat's movements, allowing you to de-horn safely. You should also have a helper hold the goat still while you work.
Place the de-horner around the budding horn. Rotate the de-horner counter clockwise for 3 to 4 seconds. A copper ring should form at the base of the bud.
Use a sharp knife to cut off the bud at the copper ring. It should come off fairly easily. Repeat with the other horn.

, Different shows have different rules. You want to see what is required in your show. You may have to walk the goat and show the goat in a specific manner. Ask your 4-H leader to provide you with guidelines and read them closely before the show.There will also probably be guidelines in terms of what kind of paperwork you need for the show. You want to make sure you have all your materials assembled before it's time to show your goat.

, Once you know what to expect, practice. Nothing will prepare your goat better than regular practice prior to the show.Practice leading your goat around using a harness and lead rope. If you need to move your goat for the judge in any specific way, such as making the goat walk backwards, practice prior to the show.
Practice every night leading up to the show. You and your goat should have the expected routine down before the show begins.

, These are required for 4-H shows. The scrapie is a tag that goes on your goat's ear, verifying your ownership. An ID from your state's Board of Animal Health assures that your goat is healthy.Regulations vary in terms of how to get the scrapie tag. Ask your 4-H leader about regulations in your state. You should also be able to find this information somewhere on your state government's website.
Usually, the ID from the Board of Animal Health is some kind of certificate. Your goat may also be given some kind of animal identification number. As with the scrapie tag, how to get this paperwork varies by state. Check with your 4-H leader or check your government's website.

, At the show you will be asked to present your goat to judges. Keep calm and follow your judge's instructions. How exactly you present your goat varies state by state.Make sure you give equal attention to the goat and the judge. Shift your gaze from your goat to the judge throughout the presentation.
Make sure not to do anything to draw attention away from the goat. Avoid fidgeting or talking too much. You should only talk when the judge asks you a question.

, The judge will ask you at some point to walk with your goat. Lead your goat around the arena with the lead rope as the judge watches.Walk slowly. The proper speed for your goat is one step at a time.
If you walk with other goats, leave an adequate amount of space. There should be enough space that one goat could fit between your goat and the goat ahead of you.

, The judge may request that you move to the right or backwards slightly. This is to help the judge get a good view of the goat. Follow the judge's instructions carefully to assure you get a high score.If you need to switch sides, always walk in front of the goat rather than behind the goat.

Stand a toilet paper tube upright.,
Draw a circle around the tubes on a piece of cardboard.,
Cut the circles out.,
Tape one circle to the end of the tube.,
Put some cat food or treats in the tube.,
Close the roll with the other circle.,
Punch small holes in the top and bottom of the tube.,
Decorate the toy.",How to Make Kitten Toys2," Observe the tube to make sure it is free from any traces of toilet paper and isn’t bent or damaged.

, The circles will need to be a little larger in diameter than the tubes themselves. Place your pen or marker about half an inch out from the edge of the tube and draw a consistent circle all the way around it. Making the circle larger will make it easier to attach to the end of the tube.


If you prefer, you can use your first circle as a template for making your second. Simply cut the first circle out and use it as a stencil to draw another.

, Using a pair of scissors or an X-acto knife, cut out the circles you drew and set them aside. It’s okay if your circles aren’t perfect, as your kitten will probably make quick work of biting and clawing the cardboard anyway.

, Using a sturdy masking tape, attach the cardboard circle to one end of the tube as shown. You’ll need to leave the other end open to add treats. Apply the tape liberally to make sure it doesn’t come off right away—your cat will enjoy the toy more if they are able to play with it longer before getting the treats inside.

, Pour some dry cat food into the roll for your cat to enjoy once it has successfully opened the toy. In addition to making a rattling sound while your kitten is playing with it, the scent from the food will also encourage your cat to play with the toy until it has discovered the treat.


This kind of toy is often referred to as a puzzle feeder, and is designed to develop your kitten’s instinctive hunting and problem-solving skills. The toilet paper roll is an example of a basic puzzle feeder, but there are many different varieties to choose from as your cat gets older and more capable., Tape the tube shut the same way you did with the first circle, making sure to achieve a good seal.

, Using a pair of scissors, and awl, or even a sharp pencil, make small holes in the cardboard circles you taped onto the tube. It’s important not to make the holes too big as your kitten will make the holes bigger with its teeth. These holes are also important because they allow your kitten to smell the contents of the toy.

, If you’re so inclined, you can decorate your toy by using brightly colored paper or drawing designs on it with markers. Be sure to use pet safe materials and to supervise your kitten at all times when it’s playing with the toy.


Most paper is pet safe, but make sure your kitten doesn't swallow small pieces of it or it might become a choking hazard.
If you use markers to decorate your toy, make sure they're non-toxic.

Find an empty medicine bottle.,
Add some noisemakers to the bottle.,
Put the top back on.,
Supervise your cat while it plays.",How to Make Kitten Toys3," Remove any labels from the bottle by soaking them in hot water and then scrubbing or using products like Goo Gone. Once the labels are removed, clean the inside of the bottle with soap and water to remove any powdery residue that may have accumulated.

, Use anything from beans to corn kernels to create rattling sound as your kitten bats the bottle across the room. While most pill bottles will have childproof (and kitten proof) lids, it’s always a good idea to fill the bottle with edible items just in case your kitten manages to open it., Secure the top tightly before letting your kitten play with the bottle. If your bottle doesn’t have a locking lid, you may consider gluing or taping the bottle shut to prevent the contents from spilling out.

, It’s always important to keep a close eye on your pet when it plays with toys—especially homemade ones. You may also need to retrieve the bottle toy if your cat happens to bat it under a sofa or somewhere it can’t reach.

Create the perfect “hideout” for the more intrepid cat.,
Make the frame.,
Pull the t-shirt over the frame.,
Place the tent over a comfortable base.",How to Make a Simple Cat's Bed2," This method is a super-quick route to a colourful hideaway that your cat will love and that also works with your home decor! Using items from around the house you can whip this stylish divan up with just a t-shirt, wire hangers, old fabric scraps and a safety pin.


You could use one of your old t-shirts that your cat already loves the feel of.
You could pick one to match your home décor, bright or black, patterned or plain - the choice is yours. Better still you can change it up as often as you like!

, This is how you will make the tent shape which will sit over your cat by shaping the hangers into an arch.Think about the height of your cat and make sure that the arch you make is high enough to make them comfortable inside. If your cat is small and likes a cosy den then you can cut the ends off the hangers before you start to make a smaller arch.


Shape the hangers into two arcs and cross them into an X shape. This is your tent frame. Check the frame is solid. Wind tape through the “X” to secure it tightly.
Create small “feet” at the bottom of each arc by bending the ends of the hangers. This will make it sturdy. Wrap tape around the each “foot” to protect your cat's paws from any sharp ends.

, This will make the tent cover. The t-shirt needs to be large enough so that it will cover the frame with some fabric to spare. This means you will be able to pull the t-shirt tightly over the frame to make a snug home.


Slide the t-shirt over the tent frame, keeping the t-shirt neck at the front and center. This is your door.
Pull the t-shirt tightly over the frame at the back and fasten it with a safety pin to make it easy to remove for washing.

, You can choose to sit the tent over a ready-made cushion or any other soft base. The point is to make sure your cat feels comfortable and safe so whatever fits that criteria – go for it! You can use your cat’s favourite textures – a pillow, cushion, towel, some felt or even vintage curtains or a throw.


Add something that smells of you such as an old t-shirt or sweater.
Add a favourite toy, or a little bit of cat nip to make it even more desirable.

Choose an old sweater.,
Stitch the seamed edge of the sleeve to the side of the sweater.,
Fold the bottom edge of the sweater.,
Make a running stitch from one “armpit” to the other.,
Stuff the edge of the sweater until you have a sausage-like ring.",How to Make a Simple Cat's Bed3," In less than 30 minutes you can create the perfect bed with just a needle and thread! If your cat loves to bask in the sun and watch life go on around them, then this is the perfect bed for them - safe, snuggly and simple.


Choose an old sweater or fleece jumper that will appeal to your cat.
Make sure it has long sleeves as this is what will make the cosy basket shape.

, You just need yarn and a tapestry needle.You can choose to use contrasting yarn (such as red yarn on a black jumper) or use the same color so it is invisible.


Stop when you have sewed approximately halfway down the sleeve from where the armpit meets the side seam.
Repeat this step for the other arm.

, Place the sleeves in front of it and roll the bottom of the sweater up. Make sure that the sleeve cuffs slightly overlap. This is how you will make an outer ring to your bed to stuff later.


Sew each sleeve to the top of the rolled up sweater edge.
Where the cuffs overlap in front, put one cuff inside the other and stitch down the outside cuff edge along the top layer.
You have now created a tube which you will later stuff.

, The stitching can be invisible or contrasting in keeping with how you chose to style your bed. When you make this running stitch make it arch a little as you sew across to make a half moon shape.


Make sure you sew through both layers of sweater fabric.
The more arched your shape, the rounder the bed will be.

, This is how you will make a solid yet squishy border to your bed so keep your cat safe and snug inside and keep their shape if it jumps in and out a lot.


Use old rags, stuffing or strips of old clothes to make it nice and full.
Pad the bottom of the bed a little and stitch the neck opening closed.

Take the following into consideration:


Materials/Fabric.,
Avoid choosing a cat bed that has hanging fabric or strings because your cat could easily try to eat these materials.

,
Consider where your cat prefers to sleep.",How to Find the Best Bed for Your Cat," Natural fabrics (wool, cotton, feathers, etc) for lining and stuffing is ideal. Not only will these fabrics provide maximum comfort, but they will help with certain allergies. If you'd prefer to use synthetic fabrics, find one that is hypoallergenic. Faux Fur and minky fabric also seem to be favorites.
Comfort. Consider your pet's sleeping style. You'll want a bed that is big enough for your cat to stretch out, but keep in mind that cats like to curl up in cozy places, so don't get it too big either.
Placement. Find out where your cat likes to sleep. Get the right kind of bed in size and shape for that space.
Style/Design. If you have an older cat, you'll want to make sure that it is easy for your cat to get in and out of the bed. Look for accessibility, amount of space it takes up, etc.
How easy it is to wash, dry, and if you can take off the cover. Should your cat get fleas, you'll want a bed that you can easily clean or you risk continued re-infestation.
Durability. A 5$ bed from Walmart with a thin fabric is probably not the best choice. Look for one with a sturdy fabric and high-quality materials. Make sure check the stitching on the sides. Cat beds that are double stitched tend to last longer.;
,, You may want to choose a bed that can be easily placed in different locations throughout the house if this varies.

Gather your fleece.,
Cut two pieces of fleece into a rectangle shape.,
Cut out strips.,
Create corners.,
Tie all the strips together, except for one side of the covering.",How to Make a No Sew Pet Bed1," The first thing you'll want to do when making a no-sew pet bed is create your covering. To start, you'll need at least two pieces of fleece. You can repurpose an old fleece blanket or purchase fleece at a local craft store.


The amount of fleece depends on the size of the bed you're creating. You want to make sure the fleece is big enough for your dog or cat to sleep on comfortably. You have the option of stuffing your bed with an old pillow or using old clothing or scraps of fabric as stuffing. If you're using a pillow, make sure the fleece is big enough to cover the pillow.
You should also take into the account the size of your pet. A comfortable pet bed should be big enough for your pet to lie down and stretch out in the bed. It may be a good idea to measure your pet when she's stretched out somewhere. Measure the length and height of your pet when she's stretched out, and aim to have your bed a little bigger than that. For example, if your cat is about a foot long and six inches high when stretched out, you could make a bed that's 15 by 10 inches.
You will be slicing the sides of the fleece into strips and tying them together instead of sewing. Therefore, consider the dimensions you want for your finished bed. Get 4 to 6 more inches of fleece than these dimensions. For example, if you want a bed that's 3 feet by 2 feet, get a block of fleece that measures 3'4"" by 2'4"".;
, Once you've selected your fleece, you can begin to assemble your bed. To start, lay once piece of fleece out on the floor. Cut it into a rectangular shape, 4 to 6 inches bigger than you want the actual bed. Remember, add 4 to 6 inches to both the height and width of the bed. Place this piece of fleece on top of your other fleece. Cut the other piece of fleece into roughly the same size and shape., Once you have your fleece cut into rectangles, you can begin trimming the sides of the fleece into strips. Remember, you'll be tying the strips together instead of sewing in order to assemble the blanket.


Move around the sides of the fleece, cutting out strips of fabric 4 inches long and about 1.5 inches apart from one another.Depending on the thickness of your fabric, you may need sewing scissors. Regular craft scissors may not work to cut through fleece fabric.

, You will need to create four corners for your bed. To do so, cut out 4 by 4 inch squares on each corner of your rectangle.To close the corners, take both the bottom on top fringe on one side of the corner. Then, take the bottom and top fringe on the other side. Tie these four fringes together in a single knot. This will close off the corners, preventing stuffing from leaking out later on., Once you have the strips cut out and the corners assembled, begin tying the strips together. This creates the covering of your bed. Double-knot the bottom and top strips together one-by-one. Leave one side of the bed untied. You'll need to keep this side opened to stuff your bed or slip a pillow inside."
"
Consider using a pillow.,
Try stuffing your bed.,
Tie the remaining strips together.",How to Make a No Sew Pet Bed2," Once your cover is created, you'll have to decide on how to stuff the bed. If you have an old pillow, consider using this to stuff the cover. The main advantage of a using a pillow is that it's already uniform and soft. It requires little extra effort on your part in regards to assembly. If you have a spare pillow, this may be your best option., If you do not have a spare pillow, you can stuff your bed yourself. You can buy cheap stuffing at a local craft store. You can also use old blankets, clothing, or other fabric items from your home. If you're using repurposed items, you may have to fluff and pat down the pillow to get out any unwanted lumps or bumps. These can cause discomfort for your pet.You can squeeze the bed lightly to fluff it. You can also run your hand over lumpy portions, smoothing them out.

, Once you've inserted the pillow or stuffing, tie together the remaining strips. Remember to double-knot the top and bottom strip on each side. Once you've finished knotting the strips, your no-sew pet bed is complete."

Watch out for harmful household cleaners.,
Avoid products containing formaldehyde.,
Look into pet-proof fabrics.",How to Make a No Sew Pet Bed3," You may want to clean your fabrics before using them in a pet bed. If you choose to do so, be careful of what cleaners you're using. Certain products may contain ingredients that are harmful to pets.


Watch out for cleaners that contain ammonia or chlorine. These products can irritate a pet's skin, eyes, and nose.Be careful when using laundry detergent of any kind. If residue is left on bedding, it can potentially be an irritant for your pet. If you use detergent, choose a mild, natural brand. Make sure you examine bedding thoroughly to make sure no residue is left behind., Formaldehyde is a common ingredient in many fabrics and household items. Some studies indicate formaldehyde may contribute to the development of cancer in animals. Read the labels of any products you purchase or are repurposing for a pet bed. If you see formaldehyde listed as an ingredient, you may want to go with another product., You want to make sure the fabric you choose can withstand a lot of wear and tear. Your pets may scratch or chew on a new bed. Synthetic fabrics may be more resistant to pet damage. Consider investing in a synthetic brand of fleece, as this may make your no-sew pet bed last longer.

Cut a piece of cardboard into a rectangular shape.,
Fold the cardboard over and poke the end of the string through it.,
Draw the cardboard up the string a bit and fold over the bottom.,
Hold the end of the string and wave the cardboard near your cat.",How to Make Cat Toys out of Common Household Items1," As an alternative, you can simply use an empty cardboard tube from a roll of toilet paper.;
, Thread the string so that you will be able to dangle the cardboard securely from the end. The toy should begin to look like a pendulum that you will swing in front of your cat.

, This will keep the cardboard sitting on the string and hold the toy together while you move it around.

, The goal is to make the toy agile and maneuverable so that when you move it, it will look as much as possible like a living thing. This allows your pet to feel like it is catching prey."
"
Find an empty pill bottle.,
Open the pill bottle and place one or two small jingle bells inside.,
Make sure the toy is sealed shut.",How to Make Cat Toys out of Common Household Items2," If there is still a label on the medicine container, wash/peel it off.

, Alternatively, you can use beads, dehydrated beans, or uncooked popping corn, which will rattle instead of jingle. This type of toy is designed to replicate the scampering movement of small prey. The rattling or jingling contents will draw your cat's attention to the toy whenever you throw it, and your cat's predator instincts should make it want to chase the toy., If you think the cat may be able to open the bottle, despite the safety cap, tape it shut with duct tape.

"
"
Find a small stuffed animal.,
Cut a small hole in the bottom of the stuffed animal.,
If stuffing is leaking out, remove enough of it so that your cat will not try to pull out or eat the stuffing.,
Squirt a small dab of glue onto one end of the straw.,
Hold the end of the straw and wave it around in front of your cat.",How to Make Cat Toys out of Common Household Items3," It's best if the stuffed animal looks like something your cat would want to chase, like a mouse. Stuffed toys made with materials that feel similar to wool, fur, or fleece will be most attractive to your cat. You will also need glue and a straw.

, Make the hole just big enough for the end of the straw to fit through.

, You want to make the toy as safe as possible for your cat to play with and reduce the risk of choking.

, Stick the straw inside the stuffed animal and secure it in place.


It is recommended that you not use tape for this step, as it is less secure and the tape or stuffing inside could become a choking hazard for your cat. For this reason it is also recommended that you remove the eyes, if they are plastic pieces fixed to the cloth. Your cat won't think it looks any less like a mouse without the beady eyes, and it won't try to chew or swallow them if they're removed from the beginning., Allow your cat to pounce on it, or nibble on it. However, do not leave your cat unattended with this toy, as your cat could hurt itself.

Wear an old sock for a few hours.,
Take a large pinch of catnip in your hand.,
Drop the catnip in the toe.,
Grip the toe of the sock with the catnip inside and pull the sock off.,
Repeat this, adding a bit more catnip for every layer.,
Tie a knot in the end of the sock.,
Give the toy to your cat.",How to Make Cat Toys out of Common Household Items4," Wear it just long enough for your odor to rub off.

, Put the sock over your hand, with your fingers holding the catnip dangling down inside the bottom of the sock.

, Then twist the end of the sock. It doesn't have to be perfectly secure, just enough to allow you to re-wrap the sock with multiple layers.

, You should now have a new ""layer"" to add to the toy.

, You won't need too much. Not all cats like catnip, but cats that do like catnip tend to be quite sensitive to it.


One theory on why catnip excites cats is that it acts on the hypothalamus, triggering a predatory reaction. Some research suggests certain molecules in catnip act as an opioid on cats, triggering the pleasure center in cats' brains. Not all cats are affected by catnip. Only about 30-70% of all cats will react to catnip., You may want to make this knot somewhat loose, so that your cat will be able to access the catnip. ""Working"" for food allows cats to indulge in the natural predatory instincts that all cats are born with., Some cats are immune to catnip, but those that aren't immune will find the toy irresistible.Even if your cat does not like catnip, it will certainly enjoy playing with the toy.


Your cat will be able to smell you on the sock, and it may come to associate your smell with the excitement and joy of playing with catnip, making this a great toy for newly adopted cats."

Poke a hole through a ball and feed a string through.,
Attach the end of the string to a stick.,
Wiggle the end of the string around the room.,
Fix the pole to a board for solo-play.",How to Make Cat Toys out of Common Household Items5," Make sure the string is tight.

, Make sure you give yourself enough string length to fully utilize this toy.

, Like the jingle ball toy, this toy is designed to allow your cat to feel like a hunter. The string allows you to move the toy more fluidly, in order to reproduce the shaky, rapid movement of a mouse., This will allow your cat to play with the fishing toy even when you're not around.

"
"
Find a long stick.,
Attach a small cluster of feathers to the stick.,
Wiggle the toy around.",How to Make Cat Toys out of Common Household Items6," The longer the stick is, the better: you want to allow your cat to scratch and lunge at the toy without scratching your hand or arm.



Do not poke your cat with the stick. This could cause serious injury to your pet. For this reason, you may want to attach something soft and blunt to the end of the stick, like cotton balls or a cut-open ping pong ball.

, These can either be attached directly to the end of the stick, or to the soft cotton or ping pong ball cap affixed to the stick. Cats tend to like feathered toys because they resemble birds, a natural prey animal for cats.Glue is the strongest adhesive, but if your cat chews off any excess glue it could cause serious illness. For this reason, you may want to tape the feather to the stick.

, You can pull the feather stick across the floor, dangle it in the air, or see what your cat will come up with on its own.

"
"
Darken the room.,
Grab a flashlight or laser pointer.,
Turn on the flashlight and move it around the room.",How to Make Cat Toys out of Common Household Items7," Turn off the lights and close the windows if it is light outside. Don't worry; cats have excellent night vision!

, It doesn't have to be anything fancy; any light source in a dark room should engage your cat.

, Cats have excellent night vision, and seeing a point of light in the dark will trigger your cat's predatory instincts.Be careful with where you point the light. Your cat may only be paying attention to the light, and not the environmental surroundings around the room.

Tie the stuffed animal to the string or flexible belt.,
Play with the toy.",How to Make Cat Toys out of Common Household Items8," Also find an old stuffed animal. It is best to use a toy that you do not have any emotional attachment to, as your cat may shred and tear the toy apart.

, Thread through a hole or simply tie around the toy.


Ribbon can also be used.

, This toy is similar to the puppet and fishing toys in terms of design, and you can use the string or ribbon to manipulate the toy in a way that mimics real-life animal movements. This kind of play is exciting and enriching for cats. There are a few options here:

Drag or wave in front of your cat (this works best with kittens). Let her figure out what it is, then play away.
You can use this toy to teach a kitten how to get up a ladder, which leads to a bed, shelf, or designated cat space. Having a space designated just for your cat to ""escape"" from the rest of the house can be just as beneficial as play.Walk around the house dragging the toy. This is useful if your cat wants to go outside but you want to keep her in. It's also good for making her tired.
Tie this toy to door handles for when you're away from home.

Get a sock, some yarn, catnip, scissors, and a sewing needle and thread.,
Cut the heel off the sock.,
Fill the sock piece with catnip.,
Insert one end of the yarn or thread into the sock's hole.,
Make the ears.,
Sew the ears on near the front of the toy.,
Twist the leg part of the sock to form a tail.,
Give the toy to your cat.",How to Make Cat Toys out of Common Household Items9," If you do not have yarn, you may use thread in its place.

, Now the base of the sock should resemble a bag. This will be the rat's body.

, This step is optional, as your cat will probably want to chase a rodent-shaped toy with or without the incentive of catnip., Sew it closed. You can decide how tightly you want to sew the body shut. Some cats may want to open the toy up to access the catnip more directly; other cats may be content playing with the toy as it is.

, Do this by cutting two circles out of the scraps from the heel of the sock.

, The toy should begin to take shape at this point.

, You can sew the ""tail"" in place, but if you're using catnip you'll want to refresh the filling from time to time. It may be easier to bind the tail shut with a stretchy fabric length or ribbon.

, As with other predator/prey cat toys, this should spark your cat's natural instinct to hunt.

Gather materials.,
Cut off the toe from the sock.,
Fill the sock with catnip and sew it shut.,
Wrap the sock with yarn.,
Sew on some feathers.,
Wave it in front of your cat.",How to Make Cat Toys out of Common Household Items10," You'll need fluffy yarn, a sock, scissors, catnip, a needle and thread, and some feathers.

, You can discard the toe, as it will not be needed in constructing this toy.

, Again, this step is optional, as your cat will want to play with anything that resembles its natural prey., Tie the yarn to one end of the sock and wrap it completely, so you no longer see the sock. Tie down the other end of the yarn.

, Choose a few places to add feathers. Slip them under a loop of yarn and use the needle and thread to sew them in place. This will also keep the yarn from unraveling.

, Your cat will love this toy, as it combines feathers with a stuffed animal."
"
Find an old unwanted sock.,
Slide a toilet roll inside the sock.,
Stuff some dried catnip into the sock.

,
Tie the loose end of the sock in knot.,
Cut out two eye shapes from felt.,
Done.",How to Make Catnip Filled Sock Toys1," Check that it is free of holes, or the catnip will fall out.;
, Push it down to the toe section; it should reach back to around the heel area.

,, This forms the tail, while the toilet roll end forms the body of the catnip sock.

, Glue to the front of the fish for its eyes. Be sure to use non-toxic glue.


If wished, you can also add a felt smile.

, Toss it kitty and see if the fish is attacked. If your cat likes this, it will bring hours of play.


The catnip fish sock can also be attached to a string and dangled over the cat, for some ""fishing"" fun.

Find an old, unwanted stuffed animal.,
Cut a little hole.,
Tie a string or ribbon around the toy if you want to drag it around for your cat.,
Give your cat the new toy.",How to Make Cat Toys out of Common Household Items11," Again, it's always best to use stuffed animals that you do not have any sentimental attachment to, as your cat will want to tear and shred the toy.

, If you know your cat likes catnip, insert a small amount into the stuffed animal. Sew the hole up neatly.

, This step is optional. Your cat may prefer playing with the toy alone, or it may enjoy engaging with you while you maneuver the toy around the room. Again, it will take time and patience to learn what your cat likes best.

, If you added a string, swing it back and forth in front of the cat, as this will make it clear that it is supposed to ""hunt"" the toy."
"
Find a suitable sock.,
Push a handful of dried catnip into the toe zone of the sock.,
Tie the end of the sock together.,
Add a face to the catnip mouse sock.,
See if your cat likes this new mouse in the house.

",How to Make Catnip Filled Sock Toys2," The ideal sock is either a child's sock or a small adult's ankle sock.

, When you're satisfied that there is enough in there, also stuff in a filling, such as scrap fabric, toy stuffing, etc. Be sure to choose infill that is safe for the cat.

, Use yarn and tie with a strong knot. There should be a little tuft of sock left hanging out for the mouse's ""tail"".


If you wish, make the yarn long enough so that this can be a dangling toy. If you leave the toy lying around, keep the yarn short and clipped close to the mouse.

, Use a fabric pen to draw a face on the toe end of the sock. Draw on whiskers and ears as well. Alternatively, glue on felt pieces, using non-toxic glue.

,
Add stuffing to the sock.,
Add some more catnip as you stuff.,
Continue alternating between stuffing and sprinkling.,
Place on the floor.",How to Make Catnip Filled Sock Toys4," If it's a boring sock, or slight worse for wear, consider tie-dyeing it for a bit of added fun. At the very least, ensure it's washed and clean.

,, Since this sock is so long, you could even stuff it with all those other mate-less socks that have been amassing in the laundry basket. Or, use standard toy stuffing, scrap fabric or felt offcuts, etc.

, Every few inches or centimeters, sprinkle in some additional dried catnip. This sock is long, so it is a good idea to encourage your cat to find several spots of catnip scent throughout the sock.

, Then tie the end of the sock off with yarn. Make sure to use a tight knot. Cut off any long loose ends of the yarn; this one isn't so ideal for ""dangling"", as it's big.

, Encourage kitty to sniff it. Enjoy the pouncing, the hugging, the back leg raking and the general enjoyment the cat will now produce.

, For a nicer finish, turn the sweater inside-out first, then sew straight across the top of the sweater, just below the neckline. Turn the sweater right-side-out when you are done., Use a ruler and a tailor's chalk to draw a horizontal line across the front of your sweater. Make sure that the line is level with the bottom of each armhole., Make sure that the stuffing meets the body of the sweater, where the neckline used to be. Use enough stuffing to fill the arms, but not so much that they stretch out and become bulky.Fill one arm all the way to the cuff, and the other just below.
You can also roll up a baby blanket or quilt batting, and use that instead., Take the arm that you filled all the way to the edge, and tuck it inside the other arm. You want the cuffs to overlap each other., Thread a yarn needle with a piece of yarn. Sew the arms together along the edge of the visible cuff. You can use a matching yarn color for this, or a contrasting one., Spread the sweater onto a flat surface. Set the looped arms on top, so that the cuff is facing the bottom. Trace around the outer edge of the looped arms with tailor's chalk. Cut along the line that you drew.Make sure that you cut through both layers.

, You don't have to do this, but it will make the bed more comfortable for your cat. You can use more polyester stuffing/fiberfill, or you can use a pillow. If you are using a pillow, make sure that it is the same dimensions as the sweater's body., Flip the sweater over. Sew the body of the sweater to the looped arms using a yarn needle, yarn, and a whipstitch. Start at one armpit and end at the other.You can use a matching yarn color for this, or a contrasting one.

Look for old luggage in your basement or attic.,
Plan how you'll use the suitcase for your pet.,
Test the suitcase to see if your pet will sit in it.",How to Make a Pet Bed from an Old Suitcase1," If you don't have any, try the local thrift store. When choosing the suitcase, consider the following:


Is it big enough for my pet?
Is it best left intact or should it be cut in half to accommodate the pet? Does the design permit this?
Is the suitcase safe, as in no dangling bits or pieces your pet might get caught up in. (Cut off or remove anything you're concerned about.)
If the suitcase is moldy, falling apart, filled with bugs, etc., discard it and look for a better one. Your pet deserves a healthy bed!;
, Will it be a handy portable bed for when you travel? If so, you probably will want to your pet's items in one side and the bedding in the other. Or, perhaps are you're just looking for a cute bed to keep at home, in which case, storage of items won't be required.

, If your pet is leery of suitcase (some pets have an aversion to even seeing suitcases in the home if they associate them with you leaving), he may not want to even go near the suitcase. Before you go through the effort of creating bedding from the suitcase make sure Fido or Felix has no problem plopping down and making himself at home.


Be aware that your dog or cat may be more enticed once soft bedding is in the suitcase. Provided you're game, going ahead and making up the bedding portion may be enough to convince your pooch or kitty to give it another go.

Find a box.,
Remove the flaps from the box.,
Cut an opening in the front.,
Decorate the outside of the box.,
Line the inside of the box.",How to Make a Bed for Your Cat1," Get a nice big cardboard box. You may be able to ask for one at your local supermarket. It must be in good condition, and must be big enough to hold your cat., Using a pair of scissors or a box-cutter, carefully remove the top “flaps” from the box. You may want to save these for future art projects. Leave the bottom “flaps” intact., You are going to create a U-shaped opening in the front of your box to act as a doorway for your cat. First, take a pencil and mark the location you plan to cut. Then, using your scissors or box-cutter, carefully cut this opening in your box., Using construction paper or fabric, and some craft glue, decorate the outside of your box. This will transform your cardboard box into an attractive cat bed., The final step is to create a soft area inside the box for your cat to rest upon. This may be a folded up towel, some quilt backing, stuffing, or a pillow the right size. Place your soft materials in the bottom of your box, and your cat bed is ready for use!"

Measure and weigh your cat.,
Consider whether it will be an indoor or outdoor bed.,
Measure the surface area of the location where you will place the bed.,
Determine whether your cat’s favorite sleeping spot is close to an outlet.,
Find a washable bed.",How to Choose a Heated Cat Bed or Pad1," Using a tape measure, measure the length of your cat from the base of their neck to the base of their tail. You may find it easier to do the measurements with a partner, so they can keep your cat calm while you get the measurement. Then, place your cat on a home scale to obtain their weight. When you go shopping, see if the heated cat beds will comfortably fit your cat’s size and weight.If you have a kitten, you can look up the approximations for the full grown size and weight of your cat’s breed.
If you have two cats who like to sleep together, you should account for their size together and look for a larger bed.;
, If you have an indoor cat, you will have lots of options to choose from for heated cat beds and pads. For outdoor cats, there are also a variety of options for heated cat beds that could be placed in garages, barns or porches. Outdoor cat beds typically have a roof, whereas most indoor cat beds are not enclosed., You should consider the location of the cat bed, such as whether it needs to fit on a small table beside a window. If there are space limitations, such as a small area in your apartment where the bed needs to fit, you should write down the dimensions of the surface area where you want to place the bed., If your cat likes to sleep in a spot that is not anywhere close to an electrical outlet or if the bed is for a cabin without electricity, it is best to choose a self-heated bed or microwavable style pad. However, if there is an outlet close to your cat’s favorite spot, there are many styles to choose from., You can find machine washable heated cat beds and pads. Typically, you will just have to unzip the cover and throw it in the washing machine. With some models, you remove the heating element and then wash the bed. However, not all brands have this option, so keep an eye out for the machine washable versions.

Find some sweaters that are at least 50% animal fiber.,
Cut the sweaters apart into flat sheets.,
Felt the sweaters using a hot cycle on your washing machine.,
Dry the sweaters in the dryer.,
Cut your sweaters into squares and rectangles.,
Pin the pieces together using ½-inch (1.27 -centimeter) seam allowances.,
Sew the pieces together to make your front and back panels.,
Sew the panels together.,
Turn the pillowcase right-side-out.,
Insert the stuffing, then close the pillow.",How to Make a Cat Bed from an Old Sweater2," This is very important, otherwise the sweaters will not felt. Animal fiber includes alpaca, cashmere, and wool.Choose colors and patterns that go well together.

, Begin by cutting the arms off of each sweater. Next, cut along the side seams on the sweater bodies. Finally, cut along the arm seams as well. You should get four, flat pieces from each sweater., Wash the sweaters in a washing machine using hot water and a little bit of detergent. The combination of heat, agitation, and detergent will cause the fibers to felt together.Try to wash like colors with like colors to prevent bleeding and staining.

, Use a hot temperature for this as well. This will help further felt and shrink the fibers. If the sweaters did not felt at all, they likely did not contain enough animal fiber; check the label again., Cut them in different sizes, about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) larger than you want them to be; this will allow for seam allowances. You need to cut enough squares and rectangles to cover the front and back of your pillow.

If you want just the front of your pillow to be patchwork, then cut a larger, solid square for the back.
If you don't have a pillow to use as a base, then make a template that's about 25½ inches (65 centimeters) and 33½ (85 centimeters) square.

, Test your design against your pillow to make sure that you get the shape and dimensions correct; it needs to be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) bigger on all sides. If anything sticks out, trim it off., Make sure that you are sewing them right-sides together, and that you are using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowances. Work one section at a time, removing the pins as you sew. Do not sew the front and back panels together just yet, however.Iron the panels, if needed using the wool setting on your iron.

, Pin the panels together with the right sides facing in. Sew around them using a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) seam allowance. Back stitch at the start and end of your sewing.If you want to stuff the pillow with fiberfill, leave a small gap in one of the sides.
If you want to use a pillow, do not sew one side. Instead, sew a zipper to that side.

, Reach through the gap you left in the side of the pillow and grab one of the corners. Pull the pillowcase out through the gap. If you need to, use a pen, pencil, or knitting needle to push out the corners., If you used polyester fiberfill, sew the gap shut using a yarn needle and a piece of yarn. If you used a pillow, then zip the pillow shut."
"
Clean out the suitcase.,
Remove the hinges from the suitcase if you plan to only use one side.",How to Make a Pet Bed from an Old Suitcase2," While cleaning it, remove any straps or other items that may either be harmful to your pet, provide a chewing temptation or will potentially compromise the design.


Consider using a vacuum cleaner to remove any dust and/or debris. A handheld vacuum cleaner can be helpful.
Use a clean cloth to polish and clean both the inside and outside of the suitcase, depending on what it's made from.

, However, if you are creating a travel case where you will store some of your pet’s items on one side, leave this part intact.


Depending upon how they are secured, use a screwdriver to easily (and safely) unscrew each hinge and separate the luggage.
If leaving the lid in place, ensure that there is a special hinge that prevents the lid from slamming shut on your pet's head should he accidentally bump the lid down. You may need to add such a hinge.

Try simply transferring the pet’s current bed to the suitcase.",How to Make a Pet Bed from an Old Suitcase3," If there is any way possible to make this work, turn to the pet’s current bedding first. The pet’s scent will create a more inviting, comfortable environment for your pet and increase the likelihood he will want to sleep in his new bed.


Shop for new bedding if the pet’s current bed doesn’t work with the suitcase design. Take measurements of the luggage’s inside before you shop. Hit the pet store first to find bedding that is comfortable but also designed to be laundered.
Another approach is to use an older pillow that you no longer sleep on, cover it with one of your old warm and cozy sweaters (wool or cashmere will be much appreciated) and then stuffed into the suitcase. Your pet will smell your odor and will appreciate the comfy pillow fill and the delicious texture of natural animal fibers. You could also try blankets that have your scent on them. That works as well.

Gather materials.,
Attach the legs.,
Place the pillow inside.,
Make decorations.,
Decorate the inside of the lid.",How to Make a Bed for Your Cat2," You are going to need an old suitcase with hard sides (look at a thrift store), four wooden legs (which can be found at a hardware store), strong glue, some art supplies, and a small pillow (that can fit inside the suitcase)., Turn your suitcase over so that the bottom is facing up. Then, apply some glue to bottom of each wooden leg, and affix each of them to the bottom of the suitcase (one near each corner.) Place some books or other heavy items on top of the legs, and allow the glue to dry (usually this takes about an hour).Another option is to drill through the bottom of your suitcase and into the wooden legs.
This is a good choice if your wooden legs came with screw holes, and if you are proficient with power tools.

, Hopefully you have located a pillow that is roughly the same size as the inside of your suitcase. (You can look at thrift stores, home goods stores, or if you are feeling very adventurous, you can make your own.) Then simply place your pillow inside the suitcase.Avoid pillows with tassels, sequins, or long strings that your cat may choke on.

, The inside lid of your suitcase-turned-cat-bed is a wonderful place for some cute decorations. You may want to cut pictures out of a magazine, or draw some images (e.g., little fish) on construction paper and cut them out., Take the decorations you have created and arrange them on the inside of your lid. When you’ve figured out the best configuration, use some craft glue to stick your decorations down. Your cat bed is now ready to use!"

Gather materials.,
Sew up the neckline of your sweater.,
Sew a line from armpit to armpit.,
Fill your ""tube"" with stuffing.,
Sew the sleeves together.,
Attach the bottom.",How to Make a Bed for Your Cat3," You are going to need a heavy-duty needle, yarn, stuffing, and an old sweater. Except for the sweater (which you can find at a thrift store), you can find all of these materials at a craft store. A good choice of material for the sweater is 100% wool, for warmth and comfort, but any material will do. If you have a sewing machine, you may want to use it, but it is not required., Begin by flipping your sweater inside out. Then, sew along the neckline. (This closes the top of the sweater off so that you can stuff it later.) Finally, turn your sweater out the right way., Visualize a line that moves from one armpit of your sweater to the other. You are going to sew both sides of your sweater together, across this line, using either your heavy-duty needle and yarn (or a sewing machine). Ultimately, you are creating a “tube” that runs all the way from one wrist-opening to the other. , After you have sewn the line from armpit to armpit, take your stuffing and insert it into one wrist of the sweater. Keep adding stuffing through the wrist-opening until you have a soft tube, that runs all the way from wrist to wrist. Now touch the wrists together to form a soft circle. This will form the ""edge"" of your cat bed.

, Once again, the “tube” of stuffing you have created is going to form the soft, plush edge of your cat bed. In order for this work, you need to sew the sleeves together, forming a loop. First, tuck one sleeve inside the other. Then, using your heavy-duty needle and yarn, sew around in a circle., The “body” of your sweater will now form the bottom of your cat bed (where your cat will lay). Line up the “body” with the plush loop you have created, with the body fabric on the bottom. Any fabric that extends out farther than your plush loop is excess. Remove this excess fabric with scissors. Then, using your heavy-duty needle and yarn, attach the bottom to the loop."

Choose memory foam for heavier and arthritic cats.,
Look for color-fast fabrics.,
Choose quick-drying fabrics.,
Evaluate the quality of the materials.,
Check if the bed has removable covers.",How to Choose a Heated Cat Bed or Pad2," If your cat has arthritis, joint issues or is overweight, you may want to get a heated bed that has thick foam or memory foam. This type of foam is more supportive and can improve the comfort level for your cat., Since you will need to wash the bed, you should double check to make sure the fabric is color-fast. If the design fades or bleeds when it gets wet, it could loose its attractiveness., Beds made of fabrics that are quick-drying will help prevent mold growth, which could be damaging to your cat’s health.For instance, you may want to avoid cotton, which takes a long time to dry, and find something with nylon, polyester or other quick-drying fabrics.

, Look for quality materials that will both hold up to your cat’s claws and help regulate heat. For instance, a good quality wool bed can help your cat stay warm., Removable, machine washable covers will allow you to keep your cat’s bed clean. You want to avoid the scenario of having to clean your cat’s bed without a removable cover.If the retailer sells extra covers for your cat bed, you might want to purchase one, since it will be handy to own on laundry day.

Look for chew-proof designs.,
Pick a heating pad.,
Choose a smaller, circular bed for cats that like to snuggle.,
Consider a fully enclosed bed.,
Find a bed with a hood.,
Avoid beds with a lot of loose fabric and strings.",How to Choose a Heated Cat Bed or Pad3," For both heating pads and beds, you want to make sure the bed is designed to be chew-safe. For instance, electrical cords should be thick and chew-safe to prevent your cat from electrocuting itself. Heating pads should be resistant to gnawing., Heating pads are more portable than beds, so they are a great choice if you move around a lot or like to take your cat to the cottage or cabin. You can get plug-in electrical heating pads, which are similar to heating pads for human beds but run on a lower wattage. You can leave them plugged in for a reliable heat source for your cat. Alternately, you could get a microwavable heating pad, which typically retains heat for approximately twelve-hours.A heating pad will cost you in the neighborhood of $30.
You can find a heating pad online or at your local pet store.

, If your cat loves to sleep in small places or curl up into a tiny ball, look for small, circular designs. You can find small heated cat beds with a circular shape, short walls and an open top. Your cat may enjoy this type of bed if they love to snuggle., For outdoor locations and for cats who like the feeling of complete enclosure, you should consider heated cat beds with a roof. Some of these beds are conical shaped like a mini apartment building, whereas others look like small houses or barns.Check to see if you can remove the heating element in order to clean these types of beds.
A fully enclosed bed will cost in the range of $35 to $60 dollars.
You can find fully enclosed beds online or at your local pet store.

, If you are looking for flexibility, some cat beds have a hood that can be opened or closed. Like a convertible, these cat beds are ideal for cats that sometimes prefer enclosure and sometimes want a more open feel.Heated cat beds with hoods cost in the range of $30 to $40.

, If the design of the cat bed includes frills or hanging elements, your cat could gnaw at these loose parts and ingest them. So, you should find a bed without excessive use of strings or loose materials."

Finish sewing the mouse closed.",How to Make a Furry Mouse Toy for Cats," In order to make a furry mouse toy, you will need to use good quality wool felt. This will give the mouse a nice furry feel. You'll also need a handful of other items. These items can be purchased at most craft stores.You'll need:

Wool felt fabric
Fabric scraps (optional)
Fabric chalk
Fabric scissors
A large needle and embroidery thread
Hot glue gun and glue (or super glue)
Stuffing
Twine (optional)
Catnip (optional);
, Begin by cutting your felt fabric in the shape of a square. Your mouse can be any size you want, but a good average is for the fabric to be 2"" X 2"" (5.08 cm X 5.08 cm). Now fold your square in half.
Set a book (or another heavy object) on your folded square to help it keep its shape.

, Starting at the fold, carefully draw a semi-circle that comes to a point at one end. This should look similar to a letter ""D,"" if the bottom of the letter were stretched to a point., Using a pair of sharp fabric scissors, carefully cut along the curved line. Do not cut at the fold! If you open your fabric square, you should have a sort of lopsided heart., Using either a different color of wool felt, or any kind of scrap fabric you have lying around, cut out two tiny circles (to be used as eyes) and two medium-sized circles (to be used as ears)., Of course, your mouse will also need a tail. You have two options for this: (a) you can braid a piece of twine or (b) you can cut out a slender piece of scrap fabric. Select which type of tail you want, and create it., Plug in your hot glue gun and allow it to heat up. Meanwhile, unfold your mouse and line up the locations for your ears and eyes. Place a tiny dab of glue where you want each of your eyes, and press the fabric down onto the glue. Then place a medium-sized dab of glue where you would like each of the ears. When you affix the ear fabric to the glue, pinch it a little at one end (the end closer to the head of the mouse). This will help give them the impression of mouse ears.If you do not have access to a hot glue gun, regular super glue can work.

, Now flip the body of your mouse over. You are going to glue the tail to the seam of your fold. Place a line a hot glue about 1/4"" (0.63 cm) long right along the fold in your mouse body, and press your tail into the glue.Once again, you can use super glue if you do not have a hot glue gun.

, Using your needle and embroidery thread, start at the tail and begin to sew the back of the mouse closed. Stop when you are about 3/4 of the way along the semi-circle., Break off small pieces of stuffing (about the size of a silver dollar) and carefully press them down (one by one) into the mouse using your fingers. Continue this until the mouse is full., If your cat enjoys catnip, you may want to add some to this toy. Sprinkle 1-3 teaspoons (5-15 ml) of catnip into the stuffing. You can purchase catnip at any pet store., Take your needle and embroidery thread and continue sewing the mouse the rest of the way closed. Make sure that all glue is completely dry, and give your handmade gift to your feline friend."

Design your cat tree.,
Buy your materials.,
Cut all materials to size.,
Build the base of your cat tree.,
Cover the base in carpet.,
Attach the vertical supports to the base.,
Attach the horizontal perches to the supports.,
Continue building according to your design.",How to Make a Cat Tree1," Before purchasing materials or starting to build, you need a design plan, which you can sketch out on a piece of paper to determine your materials shopping list.There are several things to consider when designing your cat tree.


First, consider your space limitations. Determine where your cat tree will be placed, and what size will fit well into that space. It's a good idea to take measurements to ensure your finished product will fit the space.
You should also consider your cat's personality. If your cat likes to climb, consider building a tall cat tree with several perches. If your cat would like a private place to hide or sleep, consider building in a covered sleeping nook.
Finally, you should keep your carpentry skills in mind. If you are relatively inexperienced with building things and using tools, keep your design simple so that you aren't overwhelmed.
If you're at a loss for where to begin, there are several websites that have pictures of do-it-yourself cat trees you can use for inspiration, or even patterns for cat trees other people have made.;
, Use your design plan to determine which materials you will need. Plywood works well for horizontal platforms; dimensional lumber and cardboard or PVC pipe work well for vertical supports, and carpet is ideal for covering the wood.You may also need the following tools to assemble your tree:


A drill and some wood screws
An electric stapler
A table saw and a handsaw
A Hammer and nails
A carpet or utility knife
Wood glue or another powerful adhesive
If you want to create covered areas for your cat to perch, you may also want to pick up a concrete form tube. These heavy-duty cardboard tubes make great perches and tunnels for cats.These can also be cut lengthwise using a utility knife to create concave platforms or open-topped beds for your cat., Using your plan as a guide, cut all the plywood and lumber sections to size.


A simple hand saw works well for cutting dimensional lumber, while a handheld circular saw or table saw is better for cutting sheets of plywood.
Sand rough edges if desired.

, The tree needs a sturdy base, which should extend farther out from the center than any other platform or component of the tree in order to prevent tipping. To make the base, a good option is to cut 2 squares of plywood to size and glue them together for extra thickness.A 24"" (60 cm) square works well for a basic cat tree,but the taller your tree, the larger you'll want to make the base, to ensure it is sturdy.

, Before attaching any vertical supports, it's best to cover the base with carpet or a thick upholstery fabric.


Cut the carpet to size, making it a few inches larger than the base on all sides. Then, wrap its edges over the edges of the plywood base, and staple it in place on the underside of the base with a staple gun.You may need to cut small notches in the carpet at the corners to make it fold neatly beneath the base., The vertical supports that will hold up your platforms can be attached to the base with screws, nails, bolts or wood glue.


Flip the base over so the carpeted side is face down. Then, drill holes through the underside of the base in the spots where you want the supports to be. Attach the supports by inserting screws or nails through the holes and driving them into the supports.You may want to cover the supports with carpet before attaching them, as this will be easier than doing it after they are already secured in place.
To make your cat tree double as a scratching post, wrap one or more of the supports in sisal rope, securing each end with wire brads or staples, placed where they will be out view and won't be scratched by the cat.If you use staples, you may need to tap them down with a hammer to make sure they don't stick out too much., The plywood perches can be attached using wood screws and/or gluing them to the tops of the vertical members.Wrap them in carpet or fabric after affixing them, so that the screws aren't visible through the carpet, and staple the carpet in place on the underside as you did with the base., Continue to affix each component, referring back to your plan for measurements and placement.


Adjustments to your design can be made as you go to account for stability issues, new ideas, or incorrect measurements.

Turn the bag right side out.",How to Make a Crinkle Play Bag for Your Cat," In order to create your own crinkly play sack for your cat, you'll need to gather some fabric and other craft materials. The fabric sizes listed here are just a guideline. If your cat is very large (or very small) you may want to modify these measurements.2-16 x 36"" (40.6 x 91.4 cm) pieces of fabric (can be different colors/patterns)
36 x 5"" (91.4 x 12.7 cm) piece of fabric (or 36""/91.4 cm feather boa) for trim
16 x 36"" (40.6 x 91.4 cm) piece of newspaper or cellophane
A needle and a strong thread (such as embroidery thread)
Scissors;
, Lay out one of your 16 x 36"" (40.6 x 91.4 cm) pieces of fabric of fabric. Layer it with your ""crinkle"" material (your newspaper or cellophane). Top it with your second 16 x 36"" (40.6 x 91.4 cm) piece of fabric. The crinkle layer should be in the middle, with the regular fabric under it and on top of it.If you want, you can sprinkle a bit of cat nip between the layers.

, Using your needle and thread, hand sew all four sides of your fabric layers. Start at one corner, and move down each side, one at a time. It can be helpful to pin the layers together using straight pins while you sew. Be sure that your thread penetrates all three layers., The trim of your crinkle play sack makes the toy cute and fun. You can select a piece of fabric in a contrasting color or cute pattern. Or you can choose a feather boa, faux fur fabric, or sparkly sequin fabric. Have fun with your choice of trim., Lay out your crinkle fabric, and line up your trim on the 36"" (40.6 cm) edge that you plan to use for the opening. If using traditional fabric (as opposed to a feather boa) fold the trim in half short-ways, so that 2.5"" (6.35 cm) of trim falls on each side (front and back) of your crinkle fabric. If you are using a feather boa or other non-traditional material, you will attach the material to the outside edge of your crinkle fabric, instead of folding it over., Using your needle and thread, carefully attach your trim to your crinkle fabric. Be sure to sew along all four sides of your trim. It can be helpful to secure your trim with straight pins while you sew., The final stage in creating your crinkle toy is to sew your fabric into a sack. In order to do this, you will fold your fabric in half the wrong way (so that the fabric you want on the outside is on the inside)., Now using your needle and thread, sew along the bottoms of the sack. Then, sew together the final unattached side. It can be helpful to pin the bottom and side together using straight pins while you sew., Once both side of the sack have been sewn together, turn the sack right side out, so that the seams are hidden inside. Don't worry about messing up the paper/cellophane. Moving it around will actually help to be more crinkly and enjoyable for your cat!"

Gather Your Materials Grab a big square of fabric that you don't particularly care about (if it gets destroyed by your kitty).,
Start Working Fold your fabric in a place where the edges line up fairly well.,
Filling If you prefer to leave a nice clean edge on your toy, turn it inside-out so the fringe won't show.,
Sewing Shut Now, with all the fillings inside of the toy, sew the opening shut.,
Playtime.",How to Make an Inexpensive Cat Toy," Get scissors, preferably sewing scissors, and some thread and a needle. The less matched the thread is, the more fun and funky the final product looks! You'll also need stuffing, just enough to puff up your toy, and a bunch of catnip. Pins are useful, but not a necessity. Lay it all out so nothing is hiding anything else, you'll need everything in turn.;
, If there is no such place, trim around edges so they line up nicely. If you have pins, insert them now. If you have a sewing machine, sew around the edges of your fabric. It's great to have a machine, simply because they are fast and the stitches hold strong against the tearing teeth and claws of your cat. If not, or you don't know how to use one, a simple needle and thread will work. If you do use the basic needle and thread, take lots of time making small, even stitches. This will make your toy a little more durable! Leave a two-inch opening somewhere along the seam of your toy. You'll sew this up after you're finished stuffing.

, If you don't care (your cat won't) just leave it the way it is. Before you add any stuffing, put a big pinch of catnip into your toy. Shake it around. Then, add a pinch of stuffing, alternating until all your stuffing is in the toy. Don't hesitate and go easy on the catnip! It's a more the merrier situation here.

, You can use either a machine or hand sewing here.

, When you are done, give the toy to your kitty, and watch them rip and tear and have a good time trying to get at the catnip inside!

Choose an old-fashioned ladder that looks like an upside-down ""v"" with several steps on either side that are at matching levels.
It's fine if the wood looks old, but make sure the foundation of the ladder isn't too rickety. You want to be certain your cat tree won't tip over and hurt your cat.
Try to find a ladder that's around four feet tall.A very tall ladder my be less stable or too tall for your cat.

, The ladder is going to be the base of the tree, but you'll need to alter it a bit to make it more cat friendly. Gather these supplies:


A piece of plywood long and wide enough to rest on two rungs of the ladder at the same level. This will provide a platform for your cat. If you want more than one platform, you'll need more than one piece of plywood.
A hammer and 2"" nails
Carpet
An electric staple gun
A piece of canvas, denim, or other sturdy fabric you can use to create a hammock between the two bottom rungs
A can of paint (optional)
A toy that hangs from a piece of rope or string
Sisal rope to wrap around the legs of the ladder

, Use fine-grain sandpaper to sand down the ladder and remove any jagged edges or splinters. Do the same to the pieces of plywood you bought.


Paint the ladder and plywood pieces with a coat or two of paint, if you're using it. Let the paint dry completely.
Use your imagination when it comes time to paint. You could just paint the ladder to match your existing decor. But you could also paint it brown and green to make it look like a tree, or use stencils to make designs up and down the sides.
Instead of painting the platforms, you can make them more comfortable for you cat by covering them in carpet,attaching it to to the platforms after nailing them into place. Use your staple gun and affix the carpet with staples in the perimeter and in the center.Make sure they don't stick up from the platform, tapping them down with a hammer if necessary.

, Position the first piece of plywood so that it is lined up across two ladder rungs of equal height. Use the hammer and four nails to nail the plywood into the wooden rungs, placing one nail in each corner of the plywood.


Make sure the platforms are very secure when you're finished nailing them down. You may wish to use more nails, or substitute wood screws for a firmer hold.If you have a second piece of plywood to create another level, use the same procedure to nail it down.

, Many cats enjoy sleeping in hammocks. If you'd like to add one to your cat tree, measure and cut your piece of cloth so that its four corners stretch between the four legs of the ladder. Nail or staple a corner of the fabric to the inside of each leg, making sure that the nails are all at the exact same height.


Be sure the fabric you use for the hammock is thick enough to hold the weight of your cat. You can double the fabric or hem the edges before nailing it down to make it sturdier.
Fabric that stretches a little is ideal for cat hammocks.
Make sure nails or staples do not protrude in such a way that your cat could be scratched or cut. Tap your staples with hammer if necessary.
Instead of a hammock, you can also use a carpeted concrete form tube, fastened to the ladder by attaching it to two 2X4 pieces of lumber secured to the base of the ladder with bolts, nails, or screws, between the legs.This will make your cat tree less portable, but also sturdier.

, If you want the cat tree to double as a scratching post, you can wrap the bottom of the ladder legs in strong, coarse rope.


Cut the rope in four pieces. Use staples to secure the end of the first piece of rope to the inside of the base of one of the legs.
Wrap the leg tightly with rope, tapping it down with a hammer if necessary. Secure the other end with a staple, making sure it is away from any areas the cat is most likely to scratch often.Repeat with the other four legs.
If you want to, you can cover the legs entirely with rope, from top to bottom, using a new piece of rope between each rung of the ladder. This will allow your cat access to a scratchable surface nearly anywhere on its new cat tree.

, Hang the toy you bought from the top of the ladder, somewhere the cat will be able to reach it, so as to entice your cat to come and play. Add any other finishing touches you want to make your cat tree unique and fun for your cat.

Find a ponytail holder with decorative baubles or the like.,
Tie a long, fancy, but durable ribbon to it.,
Attach this to a long stick.,
Simply shake it in front of the cat to play.",How to Make a Cheap Cat Teaser Toy," It should be a warm colour, such as hot pink or red, because this reminds cats of living prey. A cool colour such as blue will be less exciting for the cat. If you don't have any at home and can't buy one, look around next time you're in a public place. Ponytail holders drop everywhere. If you own ponytail holders, but do not own any with baubles, simply attach a big, warm-coloured decoration to it. A scrunchie will work fine for this too.;
, Again, this should be a warm colour. Something with a design such as stripes or polka dots will make it more exciting for the cat. Tug on the ribbon very hard to see if it will be able to withstand a cat yanking at it.

, A stick with a hole through it will work better, as you can thread it through, creating a more durable toy.

, For a cat, this is hours of fun. If you are busy and your cat wants to play, attach it to the wall and put a low-blowing fan behind it.

Fetch that 2 foot (0.6 m) length of string.",How to Make a Kitty Scratching Post for Your Kitten," Use a marker and a ruler. Measure twice, and then cut. Just make sure you're wearing those eye goggles. Wood chips in the eye are not recommended, and can be painful. Matter of fact, it's not uncommon to be injured by flying debris. So don't be stupid.;
, You can use the level to make sure of this.

,, Measure one square that is 16"" x 16"", and one rectangle that is 4"" x 6"". Carefully cut these pieces, making sure that you don't cut yourself with the sharp blades.

, Then place the 2x4 board on it and trace around it. Cut that part out, just a little larger than the actual dimension of the 2x4, so that you'll be able to fit the board into the hole without obstruction from carpet fibers.

, Then mark & drill 2 more holes, about 3/4"" on either side of the first one.

, Attach the two with hot melt glue and let it dry for 15 minutes. You can also staple through the top of the carpet onto the base. But watch out for staple ends coming through the other side.

, Staple the rope down at the end of the post and then about every 1/2"" as you turn it to come back to one full wrap. Then turn the post, using a glove to hold the rope, and hammering one row against the last one until you get to about 2"" from the top. Then staple as you did at the bottom, until you have come to about 1.5"" from the top. Cut the rope neatly with the blade, being careful to cut away from hands, face, and other vital body parts.

, Locate the remaining small rectangular piece of carpet. Center that on top of the post, making sure that the first, longer edge will reach to the even row of rope (the side without the rope end). Staple that side first. Cut the other side of the carpet to fit the irregular terrain of the other side of the rope. Cut flaps on the narrow sides of the board, and staple all sides down.

, Also clip errant strands of rope.

, Staple the flaps over to the bottom, cut the edges, and fit the opposite edges together. Staple the remaining edges together.

, Push any loose carpet fibers away from the center of the base so you can get an unobstructed fit between the post and base. Hold the 2 together upside down (easier with 2 people), and drill a shallow pilot hole through the base & into the post (about 1.5"" deep). Using the drywall bit, drive a screw with the washer into the center of the base through to the post. If you mess up, reverse the drill and back the screw out. If it bends, toss it, and use another.

, Use the level here. If you've done this right, it will be level when the post is set upright. If there's a minor variance from perpendicular, your cat will never know. But if there's a huge difference, review the preceding steps. Now that we know it's level, drive two more screws in with those washers and clean up. Finally, set that post by the nearest sofa.

,






Go to the most comfortable chair or sofa in the house.






Place the finished post next to the end of whatever you will be sitting on. This is the critical part.... Don't seem too interested in what your cat is doing now. Just drape the string over and down the length of the post and sit there, reading or watching TV (just ignore that critter). When your cat comes to investigate, slowly drag the string up the post. Don't look at the cat. Let him be the predator and he will follow the string up the post. After that, he'll be hooked on scratching on sisal rope.






What you've done here is you've outsmarted you cat. Better yet, you solved one of the age-old problems of cat ownership by being creative - as opposed to flying off the handle and intimidating and terrorizing the little guy. If you remember this in the future, you'll be able to apply this type of solution to other cat problems. There will be many, and if you can just remember that you are smarter than a cat, and infinitely more creative (although sometimes you will doubt this), and that it's always better to be kind and gentle to your cat - well, you will have one world class pet for many years.

Cut the fleece into two large squares.To fit an average sized cat, both squares should be about 19-3/4 inches (50 cm) on all sides.,
Press a 3/4-inch (2-cm) hem around both squares.,

Pin the batting to one fleece square.,
Cut four 12-inch (30-cm) lengths of webbing.,

Sew a parallel row of zigzag stitches around the entire perimeter.Starting 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in from the edge, sew a line of zigzag stitches around all four sides of the perimeter, overlapping the start and end stitches to keep them secure.,
Attach hooks to each loop.,
Hang the hammock from the hooks.,
Introduce your cat to the hammock.",How to Make a Cat Hammock," Use sewing shears to cut the two fleece squares down to size.


Fleece works best for this project because it is durable, soft, and easy to work with. You can use new fleece purchased from a fabric store or recycle an old, clean fleece blanket you no longer wish to use.
You can vary this size based on the size of the cat. Consider using squares as small as 13-3/4 inches (35 cm) for a kitten hammock, or square as large as 36-3/4 inches (93.3 cm) to accommodate multiple cats.

Note that the size of your two squares should be about 1-3/4 inches (4.5 cm) larger on all sides than the desired size of your finished hammock.

;
, Fold a hem measuring 3/4-inch (2-cm) around all sides of one fleece square, keeping the raw edge on the ""wrong"" side of the fabric. Press the hem in place using an iron. Repeat this process with the second fleece square.

, Choose thin cotton batting. Cut the square with sewing shears, making it 18 inches (45.7 cm) on all sides.


This step is technically optional; you may omit it if the fleece is fairly thick or if you're trying to save money on the project. Using cotton batting will make the finished hammock softer and more durable, however.
You'll need to adjust the size of the batting square based on the size of the original fleece. The batting should be cut to your desired finished size, so it should be 1-3/4 inches (4.5 cm) shorter on all sides than the original fleece squares.

, Turn one fleece square so that it is right-side down, then center the batting square over it. Use straight pins to hold the batting in place along all sides of the fleece.


Note that you only need to pin the batting to one piece of fleece during this step.
Make sure that the head and point of each pin is visible from the right-side of the fabric. If you insert the pins from the opposite direction, you may trap them inside the hammock after sewing it together. To avoid the issue completely, you could also tack the batting to the fabric using long, loose straight stitches (made by hand or by machine).
Also note that there should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space in between the edge of the batting and the edge of the fabric around all sides.

, Using sharp scissors, cut four pieces of 1-inch (2.5-cm) wide flat nylon webbing ribbon, making each piece 12 inches (30 cm) long.These four pieces of webbing will become the straps from which you’ll hang the cat hammock. Webbing is finely woven and highly durable, making this material ideal for this purpose. Do not use less durable ribbon, however, since it could pose a safety threat to your cat.

, Carefully apply the flame of a standard handheld lighter to both cut edges of each length of webbing. Pass the flame over each edge for 5 to 10 seconds, or until the material melts into a solid mass.


Melting the raw edges should prevent any fraying from occurring, thereby making these straps safer and more durable for long-term use.
Work carefully. When done correctly, the webbing should not catch on fire, but you should always exercise caution when working with an open flame. Only pass the flame over the cut edges—not along the solid length—and keep it away from other people and materials. Allow the webbing to completely cool to the touch before continuing to the next step.

, Take the empty fleece square (the square without the batting attached) and flip it so that it lies right-side up. Pin one length of webbing to each corner at a diagonal angle.


The corners of one side of webbing should lie flush with the adjacent edges of the fleece square at the corner of that square. Keep the webbing facing inward, across the square, instead of directing it outward. Try to keep the webbing at an approximate 45-degree angle from either edge of the square, as well.
Only the end overlapping the corner of the fleece should be pinned in place. Leave the opposite end free.

, Fold the loose end of the webbing back over its length, continuing until both melted edges meet. This should form a loop measuring about 6 inches (15 cm) long.


Repeat this step with each length of webbing. Re-pin each piece of webbing at the corner of the square, holding both ends and the resulting loop in place.
Note that the length of the webbing loop should still lie at a 45-degree angle from the corner of the fleece, pointing in and over the body of the fleece instead of pointing away from it.

, Sew several loose, long stitches over the ends of the webbing loops and into the fleece beneath them. Remove the pins when finished.


You can sew these stitches by hand or by machine, depending on which seems easiest for you.
Basting the loops should hold them in place more securely than the pins, making the final hammock assembly easier.

, Place the two fleece squares right-sides together, evenly aligning all four edges. Smooth out any wrinkles, then use straight pins to secure both squares together.


Note that the webbing loops should be pinned in place between the two squares, but the batting should remain visible on the outside (wrong-side) of one square.

, By hand or by machine, sew a line of stitches around all four edges of the doubled squares, placing this line as close to the edge as possible. Leave approximately 4 inches (10 cm) of one edge open.


You must leave an opening along one of the edges; otherwise, you won't be able to complete the next step and finish the cat hammock. It does not matter which edge you choose, but keep it along one of the straight edges and do not choose one of the corners.

, Pull the right-side of the stitched fleece structure through the 4-inch (10-cm) opening left along one edge.


When finished, the batting should be sandwiched on the inside and the loops should be free on the outside.
Take a moment to flatten out the fleece structure and straighten out the four webbing loops. You should be able to do this with your hands; an iron won't be necessary.
Remove any pins before continuing. By removing the pins now, you'll still be able to reach inside the hammock to grab any pins inserted from the wrong direction. That won't be possible after the next step.

, Fold the opening so that the raw edges meet and face inward. Stitch over this fold as close to the edge as possible.


It's best to complete this step by hand using a hidden stitch or ladder stitch, since doing so will hide the stitch from sight and create a neater appearance. If you are unable to do this, however, a simple straight stitch would still work to close the opening.

,


The zigzag stitches create more flexibility and a slightly decorative finish, but you can use straight stitches if preferred.
This second row of stitches creates a stronger, more secure bond between both sides of the fabric and the four webbing loops.
The batting should ideally sit to the inside of these stitches, rather than being sewn into them. The project may lose some tidiness if the batting gets caught into the stitches, but it should still remain just as durable.

, Slip one metal carabiner onto each of the webbing loops sticking out from the corners of the hammock.


Carabiner hooks work best because they’re sturdy and latch into a closed loop. Avoid using open hooks or plastic hooks since these may loosen or break under the weight of your cat.

, Identify where you want to hang your cat hammock. Use the carabiners to hook onto the structure and secure the hammock in place.


It's easiest to hang a cat hammock inside a wire kennel cage. Latch the carabiners onto or above one of the horizontal bars so that the hammock stays in place. Leave enough room between the hammock and the top of the kennel for your cat to fit.
Alternatively, you can hang the hammock beneath a bed frame, a chair with four legs, or a coffee table. You may even be able to hang the hammock inside a plastic laundry basket or a sturdy, hollowed out cardboard box.Additional hardware might be needed depending on the dimensions of the structure used for hanging the hammock. Use Velcro strips to tighten the loops around posts with no horizontal support, or bungee cords to provide extra length when hanging the hammock from a posts that are far apart.

, The cat hammock is complete and ready for your cat to use. Make sure your cat sees the hammock, but do not force your cat to climb inside.


Don’t be too disappointed if your cat doesn’t immediately fall in love with its new hammock. Many cats like to approach unfamiliar objects with caution and will naturally climb inside once they get curious enough. Forcing an unwilling cat to sit inside the hammock may make it afraid of it, however, and the cat will be less likely to return on its own later.

, Pull the corners together in the middle to bring all the sides up and around the contents of the sack. Tie together tightly with a piece of yarn, winding the yarn around the closure several times.


There should be a decent amount of the feathers sticking out of the top. Adjust before tightening the tie to ensure this.
If you wish to dangle the toy, leave plenty of yarn length hanging from it for holding from. Knot every so often, as this helps to stop tangling.

, Stitch around the closure using a blind stitch. Although optional, this is a good way to prevent leakage of the catnip and removal of the feathers.

, The feather and catnip toy sack is now ready for play. The cat can play with the rod toy independently, or you can put the stick part on a chair, table, or through a hole so the feather part dangles down.

Inspect toys prior to purchase.,
Watch out for sharp edges.,
Do not buy foil toys.,
Avoid hazardous fillings with plush toys.",How to Choose Safe Cat Toys1," Toys at department stores and pet stores are occasionally damaged. A toy with a small piece falling off or a pointed edge can be dangerous for a cat. Before adding a toy to your cart, inspect it carefully. Do not purchase a toy that is not in good condition.It's a good idea to alert a store clerk if you find a damaged toy. You do not want other shoppers to pick up a damaged cat toy.;
, If you're buying something like a puzzle toy or plastic toy, run your fingers along the edges first. Make sure you do not notice any sharp parts that prick or hurt your fingers. Cats will handle toys heavily via chewing, batting, and kicking. If a toy has a sharp edge, your cat could cut its mouth or skin while playing.Ball toys are a good option as they're unlikely to have sharp edges. Soft catnip mice are also a good option over rigid toys.

, Foil is a fun, colorful material that can attract a cat's attention. However, foil is often prickly and can cause damage. In general, avoid toys made out of foil.Instead, look for toys made of soft materials like fabric or felt.
Many people give their cats balled up pieces of foil as a toy. Avoid doing so, as foil could cut your cat.

, Check the ingredients list on plush toys. Plush toys are overall a safe option, as they're soft and easy for your cat to carry safely. However, plush toys filled with polystyrene beads, beans, or nutshells should be avoided.Toys stuffed with regular stuffing are usually safe for cats.

Choose toys that have non-detachable parts.,
Make sure toys are too big to swallow.,
Look for electronic toys with secure batteries.,
Do not let your cat play with small household items.,
Avoid giving kittens yarns and strings.",How to Choose Safe Cat Toys2," Examine a cat toy closely to see if it has small parts. Oftentimes, toys will have things like buttons, strings, and feathers attached. A mouse toy, for example, may have button eyes and a string tail a cat could easily detach. This can pose a choking hazard, so opt for toys with non-detachable parts only.Instead of going for toys with sewn on eyes on ears, look for toys with eyes and ears stitched or embroidered on.
If you find a toy that's otherwise high quality but has some detachable parts, buy it anyway and use scissors to remove the small parts. A lot of times, small parts are only present for aesthetic reasons and are unlikely to be missed by a cat.

, Avoid buying anything small enough to fit all the way in your cat's mouth. These could be swallowed, posing a choking hazard. This is especially important if you have a kitten, as kittens are more likely to swallow their toys.A toy should be big enough for a cat to hold in its mouth without swallowing. It's best to opt for larger, clunkier toys to reduce choking risks. Usually, things like larger plush mice are big enough for a cat to use safely.

, Electronic toys can be fun for your cat, but make sure the batteries are secure. The best electronic toys will have the batteries secured tightly with screws. Cats may swallow batteries, especially if they are very small, and this can be fatal.Even if a toy's batteries are secured, do not let your cat play with an electronic toy without your supervision.
It is okay to pick up a few electronic toys as these can be perfectly safe for cats as long as you only use them when supervising your cat.

, You may be tempted to let your cat play with small household items that they take an interest in. However, many household items are easily swallowed. They can pose a choking hazard and even be deadly when ingested. Do not let your cat play with the following items:Small caps
Rubberbands or hair ties
Pipe cleaners
Paper clips
Batteries
Buttons and sewing supplies
Houseplants and flowers

, If you do let your cat play with yarn and string, do so only with your supervision. Yarn and string are easily swallowed and can get stuck inside your cat's intestines, which may necessitate surgical removal. If you get your cat yarn and string, never leave it laying around when you are not present.You should also avoid rubber bands, as cats may swallow them.

You can have a lot of fun dragging a fishing pole toy along the floor or dangling it in the air for your cat to catch. However, cats may swallow the string from toys when you're not present. If a fishing pole toy has embellishments like feathers, your cat may swallow these as well. Keep fishing pole toys out of your cat's reach when you are not present.Cats are excellent climbers and tend to get into things, so make sure to pick a very secure location. A cupboard that locks securely, for example, is a good place to keep a fishing pole toy.

, Cat toys break with time. Broken toys may have sharp or pointed edges that can pose a safety risk. If a toy breaks, throw it away and replace it., Toys with small parts can be safe when used under your supervision. Battery-operated toys, for example, are safe to use when you're playing with your cat. Cats may swallow small parts when not supervised, so make sure to keep these toys in a secure location when you're not around."

Laser pointers are also fun for cats, as they can chase the light across your home.Plush toys can be altered to use for chasing. You can, for example, tie a string around a plush mouse and drag it along the floor for your cat to chase. Just make sure not to leave your cat alone with a string.

, As you may leave your cat alone for long hours during the day, make sure they have toys they can use without you. Things like plush mice and small balls can be safe for your cat to use while you're gone.Some stores sell puzzle toys. You put a toy or piece of food inside a contraption your cat must open. These can entertain your cat while you're gone. However, read the label to make sure the toy is safe to use while you're gone.

, Catnip is safe for most cats to use. It is not addictive and will not cause health problems. Invest in toys that are laced with catnip or toys that you can store catnip in. Your cat will be enticed by a catnip toy.Keep in mind not all cats react to catnip, so your cat may not be interested in catnip.
If you have more than one cat, they may fight over catnip. Do not leave cats who fight over catnip alone with it.

, While some household items pose a hazard, many can be safely given to your cat as a toy. The following items are safe for cats to use as toys:Plastic shower curtains
Milk caps or rings
Ping-pong balls
Empty cardboard tubes from toilet paper or paper towels

Use wood slates to stabilize the wheel if you have plush carpets.,
Assemble your cat exercise wheel.",How to Get an Exercise Wheel for Your Cat1," Cat wheels can be a great way to prevent feline obesity and boredom. However, they generally cost between three and nine hundred dollars (US).If you see a product in a pet store, look online to see if it’s cheaper to order it directly from the manufacturer.


Keep an eye out for sales at your local pet stores.
You can also look online for gently used products.;
, The cat wheel market is a relatively new phenomenon. You might come across an online campaign to crowdsource a new product. Check a campaign’s list of perks and see if they offer a cat wheel as a reward when you pledge a set amount of money.Try visiting the homepages of crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo. Enter ""cat exercise wheel"" into the search bars on their pages to see if there are any active campaigns. You can also run a Google search for ""cat exercise wheel crowdfunding.""
You might be able save hundreds of dollars on a cat wheel by donating to a crowdfunding campaign. Just keep in mind that some campaigns, like those hosted on Kickstarter, only offer the reward if the funding goal is met.
You’ll also have to be patient, as it’ll take much longer to receive the wheel from a crowdfunding campaign than to purchase one from a pet store or manufacturer.

, Some cats simply won’t tolerate running on a wheel. Since they usually cost hundreds of dollars, check a product’s warranty or store’s return policy before you make a purchase.Many products come with a 90 day return policy, but you might have to pay shipping and a restocking fee.
Since they’re prone to wear and tear, you should also make sure the wheel’s bearings are covered by warranty for at least a year.

, Most cat exercise wheels have a weight limit of 25 pounds (about 12 kilograms).Most wheels have a four foot diameter and 10 inch (25.4 cm) wheel width, but some manufacturers offer wheels with diameters of either three or four feet (about one meter or a meter and a quarter).A four foot diameter is designed to fit even the longest cats. However, you'll want to make sure your cat is within the weight limit. You can also contact your cat's vet if you have any concerns about your cat's size and safety when using an exercise wheel.

, Cat exercise wheels are most stable on hard floors and thin carpeting. If you have thick or soft carpeting throughout your home, you could place a wood slate beneath the wheel. This will add a uniform, stable surface for the wheel., You'll likely have to assemble the base of your new exercise wheel. Typically, this involves attaching two footed parts with bearing wheels to both ends of a supporting rod. The footed ends sit on the floor, and the wheel sits on top of the bearing wheels.Your product will come with instructions if the base requires home assembly.

Start hold a treat at a quarter of the wheel’s height, then work your way up to a third of its height. Slowly increase the height at which you hold the treat until you can get past half of the wheel’s height.Break up treats into tiny pieces so you can reward your cat without overfeeding it.
Consider wearing a glove to avoid getting scratched when your cat goes after the treat.

, If your cat ignores treats but responds to toys, a wand toy will give you the most control when you train it. Start by shaking the wand on the ground around the wheel to get your cat’s attention. Then move the toy onto the wheel to get your cat to climb onto it.Move the toy on and off of the wheel for 15 to 20 minutes to get your cat comfortable enough to get onto it.
Once it's comfortable with getting on the wheel, shake the toy forward so the cat has to spin the wheel to pounce on the toy., If you have difficulty holding your cat’s attention with the feather wand, try using a laser pointer. You can either use it in place of or in combination with the wand to keep your cat engaged.Experiment with different toys to identify the ones that most effectively lure your cat.
Like wand toys, a laser pointer will allow you to direct your cat where you want it to go.

, Catnip stimulates some cats and makes others mellow. If it makes your cat hyperactive, sprinkle some dried catnip on the wheel to encourage your cat to run on it. You can also hold a catnip-laced toy just out of your cat’s reach so it runs on the wheel and tries to get the toy."

Make pretend prey.,
Scrunch up a piece of paper.,
Use a flashlight or laser lights to act as fast-moving prey.,
Make prey from old socks with holes in them.,
Use a stick from your yard and tie a string to either end as tightly as you can.,
Make a bird.,
Make a mouse.,
Make a snake.",How to Make Cat Toys1," Quite a few things can appear like prey to your playful cat, from pieces of paper, to dangling strings to even you.;
, Attach a piece of string to the scrunched up paper. Dangle it over kitty to make the ""prey"" come to life.

, Cats can chase the beam for ages and they may even stalk it. It can be easy for kitty to run into things when using a flashlight for prey, so be sure to play where it's safe.

, Simply tie an old sock onto a string and wiggle it around the ground. It's a good idea to wash the socks first.

, Then, add a toy or paper ball to the end. Cats love this. Try tying a toy to the end of a child-sized fishing rod for extra fun.

, What cat isn't tempted to chase a bird? Create a base for the bird by using a tennis ball and a golf ball. Glue the golf ball onto the tennis ball in a position that resembles a head on a bird's body. If you have fabric, glue this around the tennis and golf balls with non-toxic glue. For a tail, use pieces of ribbon or string and attach them to the other side of the tennis ball. Add pompom balls for eyes or draw your own with a nontoxic marker. Attach fishing wire to the top of the tennis ball and tie the other end to a stick.

, The most typical prey of all, you must have a mouse toy for your cat! Take two large pompom balls (these sure are handy!) and glue them together. Then take a large square of grey felt and fold it in half. Cut a teardrop shape that is large enough to cover the pompoms. Once you finish cutting, you should have two teardrop shapes that are attached on one side. Place the pompom balls inside, as if you were creating a taco. Secure the open side with non-toxic glue or sew the opening closed. Draw (with non-toxic markers, of course!) two eyes and add a string or ribbon tail.


Another mouse possibility: Cut out two round pieces of cloth or scrap fabric. Make each the same size. Draw a face on the first piece of cloth to look like a mouse. Stuff some catnip in with the stuffing. Sew half of the mouse, then put the catnip and stuffing inside. Finish sewing up the mouse. If you want it to have a tail, break a hair tie in half and cut a little hole in the cloth. Tie the hair tie around it and sew the rest together. If you think your cat would like it better if it was attached to a string, go ahead.
Another mouse: Stuff an old sock with crunched paper. Sew a black button onto the end of the sock. Sew two other yellow buttons for the eyes. Find a thick piece of string for the tail. Get a flashlight and put the pretend mouse under the light. Move the light at the same time move the mouse. The kitten will try to catch it.

, Given the chance, some farm and outdoor cats do kill snakes, so it's an innate instinct to chase after a snake. To make a snake for kitty, take at least three toilet paper rolls (or if you want a bigger snake, paper towel rolls). Find a piece of string that is long enough to be fed through all the rolls and glue it inside each of the paper towel rolls to connect them. This allows the snake to bend flexibly. Cover the entire snake with green cloth and decorate as wished. Leave an opening and one end so you can place treats inside for your kitty to discover.

Make a string toy.,
Try wiggling and tossing about shoe laces.",How to Make Cat Toys2," A three-or-more-feet-long piece of that fabric twisted-cord from the fabric department, with a knot tied tightly at each end, allows you to interactively play ""string"" with your feline. Or, two or more cats can use it to play together pulling and running with it. The thicker the string is, the safer the cats are with it. Slowly pulling it across the floor or bed, then pausing, then ""twitching"" it now and then will entertain most cats for ages––even the older ones who have less rip-and-tear in them often get involved!


For teething kittens, all you need is the tie from a bathrobe. Some bathrobes have strips of material that tie around the waist. Pull this across the floor, so it gets kitty's attention. These are perfect because your kitten can bite into it with ease and without the risk of injury.
Always pick up string after the cats have finished playing with it under your supervision and put it away. Cats, little people and other pets can become entangled in it if left alone with string.

, Cats just love them. If your shoelace is untied, and kittens especially, should chase it around.

"
"
Use light to amuse your cat.",How to Make Cat Toys3," Flashlights and laser pointers are great ways to amuse your cat (and you). Turn the lights off and turn the flashlight or laser on. Cats will chase the lit-up dots or streams of light for a long time if they're in the mood.


Given that cats may run into other things when chasing, exercise caution when moving the flashlight to ensure you will not harm your cat in her attempts to pounce on the light.
When using a laser pointer, be careful not to aim the pointer in your cat's eyes.

Get creative with household items.,
Make a self-serve treat toy.,
Throw a ping-pong ball for your cat to chase and bat around.,
Use small boxes as toy hides.,
Use plastic rings.,
Gather objects from outdoors.,
Transform an ordinary plastic milk bottle into a treat toy.,
Scrunch up a ball from foil.,
Use a napkin as a toy.",How to Make Cat Toys4," A paper bag from the grocery store, empty sewing-thread spools, empty containers (washed thoroughly beforehand) crumpled pieces of paper, and so forth can all be put to good use as a cat toy. Empty toilet paper rolls make great toys on their own, or with items stuffed inside them.

, Put some dry cat food or cat treats inside an uncapped beverage plastic bottle. Your pet will hit and roll the bottle around getting his food out bit by bit. Use a bottle that has a wide cap.

, Just be aware that this can be rather loud on tile or hardwood flooring, so if anyone's napping, try it later.

, Cut out doors and windows that the cat can reach. Hang toys from the top of the boxes and throw in some loosely. You cat will reach in to bat the toys inside. If you use even bigger boxes, your cat can dive in them to play and hide inside. Cats love to hide and believe they are invisible, then spring out at unsuspecting prey, so watch out!

, Cats love the little plastic circle rings that are part of the plastic cap on a 1 gallon (3.8 L) milk jug. They are just right to pounce on and biting the little rough ridges on the inside won't hurt kitty at all. However, always supervise this play, as accidental swallowing of such an item can be extremely harmful!

, Items that are clean, not sharp and that roll or move easily will amuse your cat for free. In particular, cats like pine cones and these are often easy to find in local parks. If you like, attach a piece of ribbon to the pine cone for double the fun!

,


Cut a plastic milk bottle in half. Keep the bottom part and the lid.
Punch 2 small holes through the bottom.
Put some thin string through both holes and both ends, leaving it to stick out inside the bottle.
Attach the bottle top to the end of the string, making sure the lid and string can make its way out the end of the half bottle while still being attached.
Put some treats inside.
Watch your cat having fun trying to get the treats out.

, Smooth it out and toss it to the cat. Easy, sparkly and fun.


Place some catnip in the center before rolling if your cat likes this herb.

,


Take a regular paper napkin (clean) and fold it in half lengthwise. You should get a long, narrow rectangle.
Roll up the rectangle width-wise, so you have a short tube.
Twist that tube by taking both ends and turning them in opposite directions. Be sure to twist it hard enough to stay.
For extra fun, try rubbing catnip on the napkin before rolling it up. However, don't put catnip in the napkin as it can come out during play and make a mess.

Encourage your cat's fishing instincts by making a cat fishing rod.,
Or, try this method.",How to Make Cat Toys5," Attach a string and pompom or small toy onto a garden cane. A simple feather tied with a 3-foot (91cm) length of mint dental floss to the end of a 3-foot (91cm) long piece of wooden dowel rod makes a great toy. This provides hours of kitty motocross across the sofa, on to the bed over the stuffed chairs. Its great exercise for you and your tiger. For that matter, a long feather can make a fun, inexpensive toy on its own.

, Sew some scrap materials together and thread some fishing wire through. Attach to a wooden pole or rod. Your cat may be scared of this object the first time. If so, turn him over on his back and let him attempt to bite your hand. Once this is done, just place the scrap material line above him instead of your hand. Hours and hours of endless fun for free.

Blow bubbles for your cat.,
Play ""mouse under the blanket"".,
Place your cat in front of a full size mirror.",How to Make Cat Toys6," Basically, cats like anything that moves, so bubbles are a great way to have fun with your cat. Children love bubbles too, so this can be great entertainment for both cats and children at once.

, Put your hand under a blanket and move it randomly. Your cat will attack your hand! This can also work for putting your legs under a blanket at night when cozying up on the couch, so be careful!

, This provides hours of free entertainment because cats love to interact with themselves in a mirror. Kitty might become interested or frightened with her reflection. Not all cats will react to a mirror but if your cat does, watch the fun unfold!

"
"
Start by tying a string to the mouses head or body.,
Throw the cat mouse onto the floor, somewhere in front of your cat, yet not too close!

,
If your cat jumps in surprise, as most cats will do, pull the cat toy mouse away from her.

,
Pull a little bit, and then stop.,
Once your cat steps closer, simply pull the cat mouse toy away from her again!

,
Now you've started a game and the more you'll pull away, the more your cat will chase after the cat mouse toy.

",How to Entertain Your Cat With a Cat Toy Mouse1," (If not possible then bind the string to the mouses tail. Not the Tip of the tail!);
,,, Just enough to wake up your cat's curiosity.

"
Give baby toys a new lease of life.",How to Make Cat Toys7," Some baby toys make great cat toys. Usually, toys that are safe enough for infants are safe enough for cats because there are no small parts that can come off easily. Examples of suitable baby toys include: clear plastic balls with spinners inside that twirl when the ball stops rolling, or small stuffed animals that rattle. You could also use old, light, stuffed animals or finger puppets as toys for your cats.

"
"
Cut a length of string or fishing line.,
Collect or buy feathers.,
Attach the length of feathers to a stick or a piece of wood.,
Play.",How to Make Cat Toys8," Make it a decent length, at least from your outstretched hand to the floor when standing.

, Attach these at different intervals along the length of string or fishing line. Use non-toxic glue; staples risk getting caught in your cat's mouth.

, The length of this will depend on how long the feather length is.

, Dangle it in front of your cat; the cat can jump at it or chase it in circles.

Note the material that appeals to your cat.,
Choose wood if your cat spends time outdoors.,
Choose cardboard for a less expensive option.,
Choose fabric for a durable alternative.,
Examine the scratching tree’s base.,
Examine the scratching tree’s height and weight.,
Plan to put the scratching tree in a stable location.,
Accommodate your cat’s personality.,
Consider your cat’s play needs.,
Make your cat at home in their scratching tree.,
Leave room for change.",How to Choose a Cat Scratching Tree," Depending on whether your cat has spent more time indoors or more time outdoors, they may prefer certain materials over others. Take notice of what they are naturally attracted to scratching. Depending on their surroundings, cats may prefer to scratch wood, fabric, carpet, or rope. , If your cat is mostly accustomed to spending time outside, they may prefer a wood material that reminds them of a stump or tree. You can buy a scratching tree made out of natural logs or build your own. Lumberyards sell a variety of woods that you can choose from. , Cardboard scratchers are economical and can easily be replaced. Although they are sometimes less durable than the alternatives, they are often made out of recycled materials and thus offer an eco-friendly choice., Make sure the fabric is tightly wound and rough to the touch. Sisal fabric, especially, is a popular choice among cat-owners, as its rough and durable texture pleases most indoor and outdoor cats. It is also very durable and less likely to look worn as quickly as other materials. , A good scratching tree should contain a post that is attached to a wide, stable base that doesn’t wobble when the cat uses it; or, it should affix to and lean steadily against a wall. , The right scratching tree should be weighted and tall enough to allow your cat to lean their whole weight against the tree and stretch the full length of their body when scratching. This not only allows your cat to successfully sharpen and shed old nails but also affords the opportunity to work out muscular kinks. , Your cat will want to make an accepted scratching post its territory by leaving behind scratches and scents where it pleases. Be sure to place the scratching tree in a prominent, unobstructed, and spacious location in the house where it won’t fall or be knocked over.

, Some scratching trees are rather large and may have multiple appendages, scratchers, ledges, or “condo” areas. Check the appendages for weaknesses or instability. Many cats prefer to use the scratching tree for exercise and to look out from its vertical heights. Some cats are timid and may prefer to hide in one of its “condos.”
Some cats are more excitable than others and need more room to climb and play.
If you have multiple cats, try to provide them with enough space, so as to avoid any competition for territory. , Older cats may be content with a plain tree that affords enough room to scratch, walk, and climb. Younger cats, however, can get bored and restless and often enjoy playing with hanging or spring toys built into the tree.

, Some cats like to eat, sleep, or nest on the same furniture they play with. Many cat scratching trees come with built-in feeding bowls, tunnels, nooks, cradles, or beds.Choose what is best for you cat’s personality, habits, and preferences.

, Cats may grow and alter their preferences over time as they age. You shouldn’t expect your cat tree to satisfy your cat’s needs forever. Luckily, many companies sell accessories that you can attach or detach as needed. Don’t be discourage if your cat isn’t fond of one of the accessories right away. It may just need time to adjust."

Find out how many categories of toys the pet shop really has.,
Pay close attention to the price, many cat toys are rather expensive, especially if they're from a fancy company.,
Check your house for other things that can make good cat toys, also check out other shops, bendy straws from the supermarket will entertain many cats, same goes for crumpled up pieces of paper and plastic bags.

,
Play with the cat, don't be upset if the cat doesn't like some toys, this is why you got cheap stuff to find out what he likes.,
Once you know which category of toys your cat likes buy different kinds of toys from these categories.,
Keep track of what kind of toys your cat likes and use this to figure out what makes him like these toys.,
Impress your cat with your knowledge of what he likes, if you feel confident enough you can start spending a little more money on the toys you know he will love.,
Make the actual top ten once you have the final selection of toys.",How to Find Some Toys for Your Cats," It will often seem like there's a million of different toys while there are generally only a few types:


Wand toys, they consist of a stick and a tail of some kind, usually a feather, a string with something attached to the end or something similar. There are even ones that come with a base with magnets that will cause the string to dance around even without you managing the toy. Some of these can be very expensive.
Balls, these are easy to distinguish, there are still many variations but generally if your cat likes one type of ball it will like the others. The only dangerous ones are the ones filled with bells or similar noise making things, not all cats will enjoy a toy that makes noise.
Mousies/pillows, these won't roll like balls but many cats still like them. Of course this category includes other animals or shapes as well. These often contain something like catnip or Valerian root oil. Not all cats react to either of these though. Sometimes these move automatically or through some wind-up system.
Ball tracks, generally round, will usually either contain a mouse on a spring on a rotating centre or a ball. If your cat tends to bat his toys into his water or food bowls these might be the solution for your kitty. Many cats love these and don't even need you to start moving the ball for them to play with them. Catit Design - Senses Play Circuit is a great option if you have the money because you can build various shapes of track for the ball, you can technically even combine multiple tracks into one giant track. But they tend to be rather pricey.
Learning toys, these are toys that will give a cat treats or food for correctly doing a certain task. There are various forms of these and they can be a good activity for your cat if he gets bored easily, mind to keep an eye open on your cats food and treat intake, a smart cat will learn quickly how to get the most food out of the toy and if you just refill it every time it gets empty and still give your cat his normal food he might get a bit fat.
Concealment toys, tunnels and the likes, will often be in the more fancy types of scratching posts/cat homes/cat jungle gyms. Will let your cat hide and stalk you. Or just gives him some private time.
others, the few toys that either don't really fit into a category or that fit into multiple, generally there won't be many of these. Laser pens also go here though I doubt there are many pet shops that sell those.;
, If your local pet shop only has these fancy toys consider making them yourself or ordering online. Get one or two toys from every category, but stay with the cheap stuff, if you can only get things you find too expensive for what they are remember that many cat toys are easy to make.

,, If he liked catnip or Valerian root toys consider buying a small bottle of these and making your own toys with them. Just sprinkle a few drops on the stuffing you use and your cat will go mad with it for hours.

, Try to not spend too much money on them, your cat might like some toys from one category but not others that are pretty much the same except for one thing. Which naturally matters everything to your cat.

, A few possibilities are:


bright colours
noise, or lack thereof
catnip or other recreational cat drugs ;)
weight
shape

, Keep in mind that cats can be a little weird sometimes and even if something should be everything he likes he might not like it and instead prefer your roll of toilet paper.

, Try to stock up on a few of his favourites if you fear they might go out of fashion. My cat's top ten consists mostly of wands and ball tracks, with of course a laser pen in there, no drugs needed to keep my kitty Zen.

Gather boxes and tubes.,
Gather materials to hold the boxes together.,
Design the structure.,
Get creative with cardboard tubes.,
Connect the boxes.,
Make it cozy.,
Decorate with toys.,
Introduce your cat to the play equipment.,
Observe your cats at play.",How to Make Cat Jungle Gyms and Playgrounds1," You will want as many sturdy boxes of different sizes as you can find. Cardboard boxes can be obtained for free from membership warehouse stores, liquor stores, furniture stores, discount stores, copy shops, toy stores, or grocery stores. Cardboard tubes can be salvaged from paper towels, wrapping paper, mailing tubes, and bolts of fabric.;
, It is important to pick appropriate materials for your cat. For example, if your cat likes to chew cardboard, don't use tape or glue. Pick the materials according to whether you want to be able to disassemble some or all of the boxes after you are finished or whether you want some or all of the boxes to be permanently connected.

, Think about a shape that would fit well in your house and would provide comfort and entertainment to your cat. Decide whether you want different ""rooms"" to have different purposes: you might build an observation deck, for instance, and designate one room for sleeping and hiding, and one room for snacking.


Take the future location of your structure into account. If it is by a window, you will want the cat structure to have plenty of windows, and you will want to build it so that it does not block your light.
You might choose to build next to a wall that will provide support, or it may be freestanding, in which case you will need to reinforce your structure.
Experiment with different ways of arranging the boxes: Put some boxes inside of others. Connect two or more groups of boxes using single, long boxes as tunnels or bridges. Make steps using a series of smaller boxes.
Experiment with different size windows, doors, and trap doors. Draw windows, doors, or trap doors first before cutting.
Do not build your jungle gym more than four levels high. The higher you build your jungle gym, the wider the base should be in each direction.
Make an exit plan. While designing your jungle gym, make an ""emergency hatch"" so that you can access your cat without completely tearing apart and destroying the jungle gym. This is important when you need to give your cat medicine or take them to the vet. If you have multiple cats, you will want to be able to remove them in case they are fighting inside their new space. If your cats are new or if they are needy, they may decide they are trapped and need to be rescued.
Design multiple exits in each box so your cats cannot corner one another.

, Use cardboard tubes as support posts in vertical structures. Cardboard tubes can also be used to create see-saws; fold one or two in half and place inside another for stability, then tape the tube to the bottom of a long, narrow box with holes cut into it. Kittens especially will be entertained by the unexpected rocking as they move from one end to another.

, It is easiest to do this in the room where the play equipment will stay. After it is assembled, it can be difficult to maneuver play equipment around corners, up or down stairs, or through doorways. Connect the boxes by building tunnels out of smaller boxes, and by gluing and taping everything in place.


Make it sturdy. If you build the play equipment more than a couple of boxes high, you will need to reinforce the first couple of levels with something like cut pieces of cardboard. Cut cardboard to fit along the sides of each box and wedge it into the corners. Reinforce the floors and roof of the boxes with flat pieces of cardboard.
Check for safety before you let your cats play on the structure. Try kicking and shaking your structure to test its sturdiness.
Place objects the weight of your cat or cats together in each section of the structure to make sure it will hold them easily.

, Add soft surfaces to make the play equipment comfortable for your cat. Use materials that can be removed for cleaning. Cat size pillows can be made from old socks, potholder mitts, pillowcases, hand towels, shirts, or curtains. Sew up all but one side of your cloth, then stuff with cotton or other washable material and sew closed.

, Stuff socks with catnip, or tie knotted rope so it dangles. Be sure to avoid toxic materials and choking hazards. Add a flutter ""curtain"" over a window or doorway for your cat to bat. If your cat likes mirrors, try gluing one to a box's inside wall.

, Your cat might not instantly be attracted to its new toy. Catnip placed inside could break the ice. Put familiar toys or blankets inside the entrance room to encourage your cat to explore. Try temporarily placing your cat's food dish inside the cat house. If the structure isn't appealing where it is, try moving it nearer a window or under a sunbeam.


Cats may ignore a structure for days or even weeks before they try it out. Give them time.

, Watch your cats as they enjoy their jungle gym to learn what they like and what elements of your design work best. Eventually each cardboard jungle gym will start to sag and wear out. Use your observations to design your next cat jungle gym.

Build a stepladder cat tree.,
Convert a bookcase.,
Buy wall shelves for your cats.",How to Make Cat Jungle Gyms and Playgrounds2," You can buy a new stepladder, or you can use a ladder you have lying around. Measure the ladder and the place you plan to store your tree house. If you are using an old ladder, clean it thoroughly before bringing it into your home. You might want to paint your ladder a cheerful color.


Add boxes. Lash or glue a box or two to some of the steps.
Add a pillow. You may want to string up a sort of hammock between the sides of your ladder and put a pillow on it for your cat to sit. If your cat doesn't like rocking, fix a piece of wood or a platter between the rungs.
Make sure your ladder is balanced. If your cat or cats are sitting on one side, your ladder should not fall over or collapse on them.

, Pick a bookcase you are not using, or buy a new one. If it is sturdy enough to stand on its own, you do not have to modify it much. Otherwise, use furniture straps to tie it to the wall. Cut holes in each shelf large enough for your cat to slink through. Cut carpet squares to fit each shelf, and fix them in place with glue, nails, or staples.


Buy a low-pile carpet to discourage your cats from chewing it. Cut the carpet into squares or rectangles to fit the shelves.

, Sturdy shelves can be fixed to your walls in ""steps"" or zig-zags for your cats to climb. Measure your cat's reach and leave the right amount of space for your cat to get from shelf to shelf. Attach cloth or carpet squares to the shelves so your cats can get a grip on them. Add a pillow to one or two of the shelves for cat comfort.


Glue, nail, or staple everything you are putting on the shelves, as your cat may knock them off otherwise.

Select a section of tree trunk to begin with.,
Cut down your tree and trim it to length, then trim any sharp branches and limbs as close to the trunk as possible.,
Make a straight, square cut on the base of your trunk.,
Square the ends of the trunk (or trunks, if the tree has a fork) with a saw so platforms will sit level on them.,
Build a solid base for your trunk to sit on.,
Mount the trunk on your base with large wood screws or lag bolts.,
Fasten deck boards on the top of the tree truck with one edge flush with the trunk to allow your cat to access the deck.,
Set a small house, or a basket or other feature on the deck for the cat to lay in.,
Attach strips of carpet or wind a small rope around the trunk of the tree house to give your cat something to grip easily when climbing the contraption.,
Stain, paint, or leave the wood in its natural condition if desired.",How to Build a Portable Cat's Tree House," You may use a single trunk tree, or if you are lucky, you might find one with multiple trunks. Make sure it is not too heavy or large so it you will be able to move it during and after construction. Also, choosing a tree like cedar will mean your project will naturally be resistant to insects and decay.;
, You may decide to remove the bark if you like, or to leave it for a more natural appearance, the choice is yours.

, This will allow it to sit flat on the base you will be building later so it can be securely fastened. Use a chainsaw or hand saw for this step.

, You will want to decide how tall your cat tree will be and make these cuts accordingly. Since there are no flat sides on a round tree trunk, squaring the cut will depend on your ability, so cut as little as possible to assure you do not cut too much off if multiple attempts are needed to get it right.

, In the images, 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick red cedar is used, and pieces are assembled with large wood screws. Your base will consist of a band built with lumber fastened edgewise and decked with boards fastened flat on top of this band. The size of the base depends on the height and in the case of a forked truck, width of the tree trunk you are using. In general, you will want at least a 24 inch (61.0 cm) wide base, and for a large, tall, or multiple trunk tree, 36 inches (91.4 cm) or more is needed.

, Since the trunk will be heavy, and will support the weight of your moving feline friend, make sure these screws or bolts are sufficient to hold the trunk upright. Make sure the tree trunk is oriented the way you want it, and if needed, re-cut the base or shim it so it is plumb, or leans the way you want it to.

, You can use light plywood or thin wooden boards to build your deck. Attach a brace if needed diagonally between the trunk and the base to help support it.

, You can fashion a small wooden house to protect your pet from the weather, add blankets, carpet, or other items if you like.

, You may want to wrap the whole truck with strips of carpet so your cat can sharpen its claws on it, too.

, Set it up in a place where it will be protected from the weather, and let your pet learn how to enjoy it.

Think about what your cat enjoys.,
Opt for safe materials.,
Inspect the toy carefully before purchasing.",How to Choose Automated Cat Toys1," Before you choose an automated toy, take some time to consider what types of toys your cat currently enjoys. For example, if your cat likes chasing a laser pointer, you might consider an automated laser toy. If your cat likes pouncing on a plush mouse, you might buy an automated mouse toy.

If your cat likes leaping, consider a hanging toy.
If your cat likes running, consider a toy that moves across the floor.;
, Make sure you choose a cat toy that is made of materials that are safe for cats. For example, you should not buy a toy that is made of small objects like beads, beans, or nutshells. A cat can easily choke on or consume these materials, quickly turning playtime into a visit to the vet., Before you buy a toy, inspect its integrity and construction. Cat toys should be free from loose parts, sharp edges, and metal. If you notice a component of the toy that could be potentially dangerous for your cat, do not purchase the toy."

Cut or buy the base wood.,
Cut the base carpet to size.,
Cut notches for the corners.,
Cover the base in carpet.,
Choose the post.,
Attach the post to the base.,
Cover the top of the post.,
Cut the post carpet to size.,
Wrap carpet around the post.,
Use rope as an alternative to carpet.,
Flatten the hardware.",How to Make a Cat Scratching Post," Use plywood, particle board, or MDF to create a base for the scratching post. Buy a piece that’s 2 ft by 4 ft by ½ in (.61 m by 1.2 m by 1.27 cm) or cut it to the correct measurements using a table saw.Exercise caution when cutting to ensure no one gets hurt.;
, Your carpet should be at least 3 ft (.92 m) by 5 ft (1.5 m) to ensure you have enough to wrap around the base and staple it tightly. Use an X-acto knife and a ruler to ensure you have a neat, straight line.


Choose a stiff carpet, such as Berber, for a longer lasting post.

, Flip the carpet upside down and lay the base in the middle of the carpet.


Draw a line straight out from each side of the base to the end of the carpet so you have squares extending from the corners.Draw a straight line ¾ in (1.9 cm) from the corner of the base that intersects the squares you made.Cut across the straight line first, then cut along the lines you made extending from the corners., Staple the carpet to the bottom of the base on one side, putting staples in every 2 in (5 cm). Pull the carpet tight and staple it on the bottom of the opposite side, putting staples in every 2 in (5 cm). Repeat on the remaining two sides, making sure to staple all the way to edge so your corners are flush., Purchase a 4 in by 4 in (10 cm by 10 cm) piece of wood from the hardware store. Alternatively, nail two 2 in by 4 in (5 cm by 10 cm) pieces of wood together, making sure they line up evenly.

, Put the base upside down (carpeted side facing the post) on top of the post. Ensure it is centered and screw the post into the base using 2 in (5 cm) wood screws. Then, flip the base around so it is on the ground, with the post on top.


The length of the post is up to you, just make sure it is long enough for your cat to stretch on. If you’re not sure how long to make it, measure your cat from nose to end of tail, then add a few in/cm.

, Get a 4 in by 4 in (10 cm by 10 cm) beveled wood square from the hardware store for a neat post topper. Use wood glue to attach the topper to the post.Alternatively, you can cover the top in carpet and staple it down. Put two staples on each side of the post, rather than on the top.

, It needs to be at least 20 in (51 cm) wide in order to wrap around the post, and the exact height of the post. Use an X-acto knife and a ruler to ensure you have a neat, straight line.

, Start at a corner and staple the carpet in place every 1 in (2.5 cm) vertically. Wrap the carpet completely around the post and staple it in place every 1 in (2.5 cm) along the vertical seam. Cut off any excess, and ensure you have a smooth seam so your cat’s claws don’t snag on the fabric.

, Alternatively, you can wrap the post in sisal rope rather than carpet. Cover your post in non-toxic glue to ensure the rope won’t unravel.Wind the rope around the bottom of the post and staple it in place.Continue winding the rope all the way to the top of the post, making sure your rows are neat, straight, and very close together.Add staples if the glue doesn’t seem to be holding the rope well enough., Use a hammer to flatten the staples down. A staple gun does not always create a flush staple, and you want to ensure your cat’s claws don’t get hung up or ripped out due to a staple sticking out of the post.

Consider a toy that flashes.,
Try an automated mouse.,
Try a toy that incorporates lasers.,
Go for an automated catnip toy.,
Consider an app.",How to Choose Automated Cat Toys2," Toys that light up and flash are usually big hits with cats. For example, you can purchase a mat that lights up and flashes, prompting your cat to bat at or tackle the lights. These toys are usually battery-operated and can be purchased at your local pet supply store or online., A fun, simple toy for your cat is an automated mouse. You can purchase a mouse that is operated by battery. You can even purchase an automated mouse that you can control with a remote control. These toys can help stimulate your cat’s hunting instincts and provide hours of playtime., You stimulate your cat’s hunting instincts with automated laser toys. You can go simple with a handheld laser wand, or you can buy a fancy automated laser toy made for cats. Your cat will enjoy chasing lasers around the house, whether you create them yourself or let the automated toy do it for you., There are a variety of automated toys that incorporate catnip into your cat’s playtime. For example, some automated toys move around catnip-filled balls. Toys like this will keep your cat entertained as it tries to nab the catnip., There are apps that allow your cat to play on your tablet. For example, Paint for Cats is an iPad app that allows your cat to create beautiful paintings while chasing a colorful automated mouse around the iPad screen."
"
Always supervise your cat.,
Turn off toys when playtime ends.,
Store the toys in a cat proof location.",How to Choose Automated Cat Toys3," You should always watch over your cat while it is playing with automated toys. This will ensure you can respond promptly should a toy malfunction or if your cat becomes injured. Never let your cat play with automated toys alone., It is important that you disable automated cat toys when you and your cat finish playing. Turn the on-off switch to off, and remove or unplug the power source. These steps can help ensure your cat’s safety., Once you are done playing with the automated cat toys, place them in a container with a lid that seals. Then place the container in a storage space that your cat cannot access. This will prevent your cat from playing with the toys when you are not around."

Socialize your kids.",How to Care for Baby Goats," Part of keeping your baby goat happy and healthy will involve giving them a proper space to live in. Baby goats need a space that is both warm and dry, as either cold or dampness can have an ill effect on their health.Make sure there is plenty of warm bedding, such as pine chips or hay.
Change any bedding that becomes wet.
If the area is cold, consider adding a heat lamp. Make sure the heat lamp is absolutely secure, as it is a fire hazard.;
, The umbilical cord should naturally break away from both the newborn and the mother. However, freshly broken navel cords can become infected and may need additional attention.


Never cut the cord between the mother and newborn. Allow this to break naturally. Only attempt trimming the cord if it is longer than four inches after it breaks.
If you are unsure of what to do, make sure your veterinarian is on site during the birthing process.
If the cord is still quite long, you should trim it closer to the kids stomach.
Trim to about three to four inches in length.
Always used sterilized instruments. Make sure whatever instrument, such as a pair of scissors, are sharp enough to make the cut.
Dip the cord in iodine. This prevents infection and helps the cord to dry much faster.
The cord should fall away from the newborn within three weeks.

, After you help the mother trim the umbilical cord, leave her baby goat with her. The mother will want to lick the baby clean.Allowing the mother to clean the baby will increase the bond between them.
Creating a bond between the mother and newborn is extremely important.
Stay with both the mother and the newborn goat. Help keep the birthing area clean and monitor the baby goat.
A few moments after the baby goat, or goats, have come out the afterbirth will follow. Allow the mother to eat the amount of this she will before disposing of it.

, The first feeding, or colostrum, is extremely important. The mothers milk contains important antibodies that the kid will need to survive.


The kid should feed for the first time within an hour.
Baby goats should feed four or five times a day
Pull a few streams of milk from the doe to make sure the milk isn't blocked.
Watch the baby kid to make sure it drinks milk. If the kid is having trouble finding where to feed from, give it some direction.
If the kid isn't drinking from the mother, bottle feed it the colostrum. The milk needn't be from the mother, it can be from another goat producing milk.
You can also find colostrum in stores. It will require refrigeration.

, You may elect to bottle feed your goat, instead of letting them get milk from the mother. This can result in a more tame and friendly adult goat, once your kid grows up.If allowing the mother to feed them, monitor the kids and make sure the kid is getting milk without trouble. Sometimes the mother won't want to feed her kids and you might have to bottle feed.
If you choose to let the mother feed the kids, try to spend time with both the mother and the new kids. This will help them grow up to be comfortable and calm around people.
Whatever you choose, the kid will need milk for at least eight weeks.
Always sterilize bottles and any other feeding equipment.
If bottle feeding, you can get milk from the mother, another goat producing milk, or purchase it from a farm supply store.
Dramatic changes in their lifestyle or diet can effect their mood and the solidness of their stool. If the vet tells you to give them a special powder with their milk ( if you are bottle feeding them) then don't give it to them in one big dose; maybe give it to them in halves for a period of 2 days, see how they like it and then give the full amount to them.

, Keeping a good feeding schedule will allow your kids to get the right amount of food and nutrition. Follow a schedule similar to this one to help ensure you baby goats are getting fed properly: At one to three days old, 150 milliliters (5.1  fl oz) of milk four times daily.
At four to ten days old, 300 milliliters (10.1  fl oz) of milk four times daily.
At ten to fourteen days old, 400–500 milliliters (13.5–16.9  fl oz) of milk three times daily. Add clean hay to diet.
At two to three weeks old, increase morning and evening milk to 1l, reduce midday milk to 0. Add pasture and 100g of bran to diet.
At three to eight weeks old, 1l of milk twice daily.
At eight weeks or 18kg in weight, 500 milliliters (16.9  fl oz) of milk a day before weaning.

, At some point your baby goat won't need to drink milk, either from a bottle or from its mother. Help it to get to this stage by slowly introducing solid foods, such as hay or pasture feed, while reducing the amount of milk being offered.


Offer hay, grain, time in the pasture, and fresh water to allow your baby goat to start eating these foods instead of milk.
Most healthy goats can start to be weaned at about thirty days old.
A goat can start to be weaned at about twenty-five to thirty pounds or double its birth weight.
You may start to offer grain at about one week of age to help the goat start rumen development.

, Horns are a great fit for wild goats who need them to defend themselves. However, in a domesticated setting, horns can be a danger. Removing horns helps keep both you and your goats safer.If you are unsure of how to de-horn your baby goats, please contact a veterinarian. Improper removal of horn buds can cause serious harm.
Remove horn buds at around one week old. Removing horns only becomes more difficult with an older goat.
Usually, a disbudding iron will be used to de-bud your baby goat. This iron will be heated to a high temperature and will be used to burn the horn buds into inactivity.

, While it's true that some immunities will be inherited from the mothers milk, there will be some diseases that your goat won't be immune to. Vaccinations will prevent common diseases in your kids.At around 30 days of age, administer Clostridium and tetanus vaccinations.
Clostridium will help prevent overeating disease types C and D.
Administer a CD&T booster shot 3-4 weeks later. While you can administer vaccinations by yourself, it's best to learn from your veterinarian or have them perform the vaccination for you.

, If you mix your baby goats in a pasture with other adult goats, make sure the pasture is kept clean. Your baby goats will begin to eat various plants they find out in the pasture. However, if there is too much manure they may quickly fall ill.Consuming food from a pasture full of manure can give your baby goats worms and other parasites.
Keep the pasture as free of manure and waste as you can.
You may want to keep young goats in a separate pasture.

, Your kids, especially when very young, will need regular medical evaluation and procedures. Watch over your baby goats and give them routine care as they grow up.


Schedule regular check-ups with your veterinarian.
Goats and kids should be checked for parasites quite often.
De-worm your goats in spring and late summer.
Check your goat's temperature with a rectal thermometer. Normal temperatures should be around 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit.
Watch for lice. Lice are small insects that will infest your goat's fur. You can purchase lice powder at most farm stores and keep your goat's fur trimmed short to help stop lice.

, If you are training them, the earlier the better! If you train them at a young age, they will be more alert than if you train them when they are older., Even as your goats grow up, they will still need proper shelter and bedding. The shelter will need to block wind, provide warmth, and keep any rain or snow off of your goats. Any bedding offered will need to be kept clean and dry.Make sure there are no drafts in the shelter.
If in a warm and dry climate, you will need at least a three walled shelter.
In colder or wet climates, you will have to make sure that the shelter is enclosed.
A goat needs around ten square feet of space in the shelter, if it is also allowed access to pasture.
Dirt floors can help absorb urine from your goats. Cover with hay to provide a comfortable and warm bed. You can also use wood shavings for bedding.

, Until a month or two your baby goat will drink mostly milk and water. During and after the weaning process, your goat will want to eat some other foods.


Offer the following food items to your baby goat as it grows:

Grain.
Hay (alfalfa).
Grass (pasture feeding).
Corn.
Oats.
Barely.


Avoid having certain poisonous plants near your goats:

Azaleas.
Rhododendrons.
Moldy grains.



, If you want a friendly and loyal goat, who is comfortable around people, it is important that the kid imprint on you. Getting the baby goat to imprint on you is as easy as spending time with them.


The first few moments of life are critical. As they are born, be there with the kids. Spend time with the kids and the mother and let the kids get to know you both.
During the first two days of the baby goat's life, you will want to spend as much time as possible with them. The more time you spend, the deeper the imprint will be.
Allow your baby goats to socialize with other goats. By allowing them to spend time with the rest of the herd, after imprinting, they will view you as another member of the herd.
Don't allow your baby goats to be near other adult goats with any illness. Kids immune systems are not as strong as an adult goats, any exposure to disease can easily effect them.

Choose an ideal place for the basket in your home.,
Purchase or find a decorative, but highly durable basket.,
Select a pillow or blankets that you will use to line the basket.,
Visit the hardware store for wall mounting supplies.,
Mark the spot for mounting the basket.,
Once the mounting marks are in place, place the basket bottom flat against the wall.,
Add a pillow/blanket and/or toys to the basket.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Cat Wall Bed from a Basket," Knowing where you're going to mount a basket is usually the first step because it will help to determine the size of the basket you'll buy or use. You’ll want to find an area your cat loves, but also one that works with your home’s décor. It also needs to be somewhere that the cat can access with ease.


Consider the height and area where kitty likes to sleep. For example, if he enjoys sleeping in your home office, this might make the ideal area where you will house the basket.
Even if your cat loves to sleep up high, make sure he has a way to get to the basket on his own. What objects nearby or underneath will aid this?
Identify an area that will look good with your room layout and décor. Even if the cat loves to sleep next to the front door, placing the basket there may not exactly work in terms of your room layout, etc. Make sure you will be able to live with basket placement before committing on an area.;
, You will want something that not only matches with your décor but one that is durable enough to handle being mounted on the wall and is able to hold your cat’s weight. Most importantly, there must be enough ""sleeping space"" on the side of the basket that will end up forming the base of the cat bed, remembering that the actual bottom of the basket will be mounted to the wall.


Hopefully you've already considered where you'll place the basket and how it will match your décor. You'll be mounting the basket from the bottom, facing outward, so your cat will sleep along (what was) the side or bottom of the basket––keep this in mind when selecting the shape of the basket.
Find a basket that will fit the cat’s size. With a smaller kitty you can get away with choosing nearly any sized basket. However if your cat is pushing 20 pounds (and more), you’ll definitely need something substantial enough to hold his girth.

, The bedding will fit along the bottom area of the basket once it has been mounted on the wall. Therefore, choose something comfortable that will fit along the sides of the basket. It needs to be both cat-friendly and décor-friendly!

, You will need wall mounting screws or nails and wall supports for this project. Take into consideration the size and shape of your basket when selecting the needed hardware:


Pick up heavy duty wall mounting screws/nails and wall supports. You will need at least four mounting screws and two wall supports to hold the basket in place. For a larger basket you may need additional screws, so consider bringing the basket with you to the hardware store in case you have questions.
Make sure the wall supports are strong enough to hold the basket in place, but small enough to be camouflaged underneath. Since this is both a decorative and functional endeavor, you’ll need something that will provide your basket with strength and support but won’t look like an eyesore either. Hold the wall supports underneath the basket to determine how much you'll be able to see when the basket is suspended.

, It's recommended that you use a level to mark off where you will mount the basket before you start adding nails or screws.


Check for studs. Use a stud detector, or knock on the wall. If you knock to hear hollow sounds, then it's good to go. The stud detector will beep if there is a stud. If you come across a stud, move your wall placement out or in accordingly.

, Apply the nails or screws to the four corners of the basket's bottom, to hold securely in place. (If you’ve chosen a round basket, strategically place the nails/screws around the sides, top and bottom for full support.) Add additional nails/screws to the basket if you think it's needed, depending on the basket shape.


Add supports to the bottom of the basket. Follow the directions provided with the wall supports, and firmly nail or screw the supports to the wall, directly underneath the basket. Make sure the basket can rest comfortably on the supports––in the event the cat gains some weight or jumps into the basket at high speed, the supports will need to be able to “catch” the basket rather than letting it fall.

, Finish your kitty wall basket with a comfy pillow or blanket––anything that will welcome him to his new space.


Complete the look by making the wall-mounted bed-basket a comfortable place for kitty to relax. Cats love cushions and snuggling so make sure you add something soft for him to lay on inside the basket.
Consider placing a few treats in the basket at first so the cat gets used to jumping into the basket. He may not understand at first this was made for him so place a few of his favorite treats inside the basket or some catnip laden toys to entice him to jump in.

Gather the things you need.,
Identify the horn buds.,
Apply the disbudding iron.,
Feed the baby some milk or return her to her mother.,
Monitor the healing and enjoy the result.",How to Disbud (Prevent Horns) in a Baby Goat," Have the iron hot, so that you can put a black ring char on a piece of wood instantly. Have a seat, and your friend will put the baby goat into your lap. Cross your leg over its body for restraint, and use your non-dominant hand to hold baby's head against your chest, its ear folded down and covered by your gloved hand. This procedure must be done when the baby goat is as young as three days old, BEFORE the horn tip starts to poke up through the hair. Some horns take up to ten days to start sprouting. Waiting too long is much harder on the baby goat.;
, Feel with a fingertip in the hair, remove hair, and see the point of the horn bud. Find the perimeter of its base so you can see how you will apply the iron centered, covering all the base. (This will ensure that a bit of the horn base doesn't regrow into big deformed curls of horn tissue called scurs. If they do start to grow, just reapply the iron.) Notice that the point of the bud has a spine proceeding toward the nose, so that the perimeter is not circular. (Ideally, you can have your vet anesthetize, but this procedure is very brief and the use of anesthetic is not common.)

, Plant the iron onto the horn base, blow on it to see through the smoke. Baby will cry and wiggle even if the area is prenumbed successfully with anesthetic. Keep it on for a slow count of ten, using a vigorous press and twist to smear through the layers of tissue down to an orange-brown ring (roll out the button of tissue you have removed). Then apply ice cubes on the wound, to stop heat penetration. Staying on too long, like twenty seconds on a very young animal, can heat the sinuses.

, She may sleep more today, but will sustain the wound and thrive.

, It takes two months for the horn scabs to fall off, and they can be slightly junky-stinky underneath. Whenever you hold the baby, you can look for ooze or smell, and then medicate with a wound treatment. If they get bumped, they can crack, so apply a bit of wound cream.

Before starting, check the condition of your cat's paws.,
Let your cat sit next to or with you as you use the iPad.,
Allow her to investigate further by sniffing, walking over, sitting on and pawing at the iPad.,
If your cat shows an interest in the iPad, let her watch and even paw moving items such as a movie, music program or a video.,
Download an app made just for cats.,
Stay with your cat as she plays on the iPad.,
Try to tempt your cat away from the iPad with an ""ordinary"" toy.,
Take photos or videos of your cat playing on the iPad.,
Put the iPad away safely after play.",How to Bring Out Your Cat's Inner Gamer on the iPad," If they're dirty or wet, clean and dry them before playing on the iPad. And be sure to remove anything that might be stuck in the paws, such as a tiny stone or piece of bark, as these could damage the screen (besides which, such grooming ensures that your cat is in good health).;
, Allow her to watch the screen to familiarize herself with the movements, colors and action on the screen.


If you have more than one cat, don't hesitate to show them all at once. It's possible they'll be equally interested.







, Be sure to do this somewhere safe so that the iPad doesn't drop anywhere. Sitting on the floor with your cat or on a sofa or bed are just some safe, flat spots that are also comfortable. Be aware that once she starts playing with the iPad, she is likely to try to push her paws under the iPad to try to find any item that runs off screen, so some flipping or movement of the iPad should be expected. And don't play at the top of the stairs or one iPad in pieces might be found at the bottom of the stairs later.


It's recommended that you're not charging or using the cord for the iPad when your cat plays with it.







, Better still, play a human game on the iPad to see how she reacts. Indeed, some human games are lapped up by cats, such as Magic Piano and Koi Pond.


Show her a photo of herself or of another cat. She might find this really amusing or even try to ""attack"" the other cat.







, There are plenty to choose from and kitty will probably be the best ultimate judge of which work, so it's a good idea to start with the free ones before choosing paid ones. Some choices include:


Game for cats - chase a mouse or a laser dot (free but with a later in-app level purchase)






Purina Friskies' Games for Cats - obviously made to promote their cat products but the games are free






Cat piano Jr. - this creates meow sounds on the piano keyboard at the pitch of each key; the cat walks on it to produce noise (free)






Dog translator (free)






App for cats (free)






Cat toy (free)






Paint for cats - creates a picture from paws that can be shared on Facebook if you wish (paid)






Catch the mouse (paid)







, The interaction time is good for both of you and you should monitor her interaction at all times anyway. After all, should she accidentally log herself into your Facebook account, the results could be meow-o-rific for her but incomprehensible for your friends.


You may be forced to hide from your cat when you want to use the iPad undisturbed. This is a small price to pay for kitty contentment.

, It's probable that your cat won't even notice, as she'll be so engrossed in the iPad game. This will confirm for you that she's really enjoying the iPad game.

, This is a great photo or video opportunity, so have the camera ready at all times. There are plenty of cats playing iPad videos uploaded by proud owners and there are even competitions on occasion, so you might want to share your offerings too.

, Even if it's not switched on, you've now just indicated clearly that this is a cat toy and she'll be curious any time of the day or night, whether or not you're present.

Bring some grain.,
Approach slowly from an angle where the goat can see you and the grain bucket.,
Offer the feed.,
To pin against a wall, place one knee in front of the shoulder blade and the other knee behind the ribs and lean into it.,
Once caught, the goat should be tethered to a secure object by a chain or strong rope.",How to Catch a Goat," Find the goat by checking hedges for hole, looking up in trees (yes, trees!), flower gardens, inside your house, down the road, over the river, etc. Goats naturally explore and can be very curious.;
, Goats know where their escape routes are, and they are faster and more agile than you, so you don't want to startle it.

, Figure out what to grab when the goat starts running. If the goat wears a collar or other such device, try that. Horns can be used as handles as well, but are not always as strong as they appear and can break.

, Ideally the head should be held up as well.

, No fence short of one designed for a federal prison will reliably hold a goat. Tethering in most cases is pretty much the only way to go. A good fence can hold a goat if they are happy. Tethering a goat can be dangerous because they can easily strangle themselves.

Purchase an elastrator from a farm and ranch supply store.,
Buy castration bands.,
Ask your local veterinarian to provide pain reliever and tetanus anti-toxin.,
Plan to castrate your kid within 8 weeks of birth.,
Administer a dose of adult aspirin or a shot of Banamine a half hour before you do the procedure.,
Give a 1 cc shot of tetanus anti-toxin to prevent tetanus.

,
Soak your castration band in alcohol for 5 minutes before placing it in the elastrator.

,
Ask a friend to help you by holding the kid down.,
Attach the rubber band to the front prongs of the elastrator.,
Insert the scrotum and testis inside the rubber band.,
Ensure that both testes are inside the band before you release the elastrator.,
Release the grip on the elastrator slowly.,
Cut the band away right after banding, if you believe it has not been done right.,
Check the kid daily for signs of infection.,
Ensure the scrotum is starting to fall off.",How to Band a Goat," It is a metal tool that is used to secure the rubber band around the scrotum.;
, Don’t use household office supplies for banding. The bands should be thick enough and tight enough to lead to castration within a few weeks.


Store your castration bands in the refrigerator until they are ready for use. This will keep the rubber from breaking down. Always check the rubber ring for elasticity/ breakage before applying it, simply put it on the tool and squeeze the handles to stretch the rubber ring. It should not break/ rip and be free of any cracks.

, You will need some antiseptic spray in case of infection. Take your goat kid to the veterinarian at the first sign of an infection.

, They reach sexual maturity at this time and can begin impregnating your doe (female goats). An uncastrated male goat is called a “buck.”


Make sure both testes have descended before you band your goat. You can have short-scrotum goats if a testis is pushed into the belly cavity.

, Banding is painful to the goat, so administering anti-inflammatories can reduce discomfort. To reduce pain further, you can administer lidocaine to numb the area during the banding period.,,, Set the kid in your helpers lap, so that his belly is up and his front hooves are restrained.

, Squeeze the elastrator handles to expand the band.

, Move the handle of the elastrator closer to the base of the scrotum.

, If you are right handed, put the tool aside for a minute, with your left hand hold the scrotum and feel if both testicles are inside. If not, don't let go, still holding with your left hand, reach with your right hand to the goats belly close to the scrotum, they tend to hold the testicles in sometimes, find them under the skin and push towards the scrotum ""catching"" them with your left hand. Once you can feel both testicles inside you can put the rubber ring on. Still holding the testicles with your left hand, squeeze the tools handles, pushing scrotum through the open rubber ring, carefully place it where you want it to be, close slightly so that they don't escape again, and with left hands fingers help push down the rubber ring from the first two metal ring expanders and then remove it completely. Check for proper placement again. Leave them loose, putting the ring a bit closer to the body. Otherwise it will be very painful for the animal and you will have to redo it. Also, make sure that the nipples are outside of the band., Keep it sterilized to avoid infection.

, Don’t wait until the constriction starts to take place. If a nipple is inside the rubber band or a testis is pushed up, you should replace the band correctly. , Spray with antiseptic if the area looks too inflamed. Administer pain relief beforehand, since this will be painful for the goat.

, The scrotum will start to shrivel. If the scrotum is hanging off by a thin thread of tissue, you can surgically remove it with a scalpel and apply antiseptic.

Put in good fencing.,
Provide adequate shelter.",How to Care for a Goat1," The fencing for your goat should be tall enough for your goat to stay in and to keep predators out. About five feet tall is good.;
, Goats can live in a small shed or large dog house. The shelter should be well ventilated but free from drafts. The bedding should be made of straw. A concrete floor is expensive, but easy to maintain.

Feed properly.,
Allow permanent access to water and provide a salt-lick block preferably containing Selenium.,
Avoid foods that will harm your goat.,
Groom often.,
Trim the hooves.",How to Care for a Goat2," A healthy goat diet consists of hay, and concentrates like oats, bran, and barley. Keep all food off the ground to prevent mold and insects from eating or infesting it. If you so choose, you can put the feed in waterproof trash cans it will keep it elevated and clean. If food is kept on the ground, it could cause diseases.

, If you live in a Selenium deficient area (low Selenium in the soil, hence, in the hay), it's a good idea to have your Vet give your goats a ""BoSe"" shot once yearly. This shot contains Selenium and Vitamin E, which is extremely important for muscle/bone and reproductive health.


This is very important for pregnant dams (given about a month prior to kidding), as it helps the kids in utero to have proper heart and other muscular development, as well as helping the dam avoid kidding complications.

, Goats must avoid ornamental plants, especially those in the Rhododendron family. These can cause severe GI problems including vomiting, diarrhea and even death if the goat has ingested enough and the condition hasn't been treated by a Vet. Be careful of ""friendly"" neighbors who are giving your goats a treat over the fence that may contain rhododendron type plants. This is more common than you might think!

, A complete grooming consists of a long bath and thorough brushing.


If you have children around, they love brushing goats. Make sure you supervise this activity.

, Doing it once a month is a great procedure and does not take a lot of effort. If you don't want your goat's hooves to bend, crack, or get infected make sure you trim them once a month.

Exercise your goat.,
Deworm.,
Get the needed vaccinations.,
Be aware of bloating.",How to Care for a Goat3," Help it to climb a lot. Goats love to climb so give them toys that would involve climbing. They may also enjoy something like a seesaw, which allows them to balance and move up and down in the same climbing method.

, Most goats are very susceptible to internal parasites (e.g. worms), and should be dewormed on a regular basis. The common worms that prey on goats are known as strongyles (bloodworms), hookworms and a different species known as coccidia. Depending on the environment, parasites can cause many health problems (even death) such as weight loss, poor hair coat, reproductive failures and more.


Young kids should receive their first deworming between 6-8 weeks of age. There are commercial dewormers available for goats at your local feed store (such as Safe-Guard). Be sure to follow label directions.
However, the majority of goat dewormers are not effective against coccidia, which can be particularly harmful in young kids and older or immune compromised goats. There are several products available for treatment of coccidia, but the most available is called Corid. Signs of coccidia infestation include difficulty in weight gain, lethargy, inappetence (lack of appetite) and clumped stools (rather like something you may see from a dog)
If there is any question if there is a worm problem in your herd, have your Vet run several fecal analyses on different goats. This will provide a definitive answer, and your vet will be able to recommend the proper treatment.

, All goats should also be vaccinated once yearly with a vaccine called ""CDT"", which includes tetanus.


Kids should be vaccinated at six to eight weeks, then boosted in four weeks. After that, it's once yearly.

, Giving them too much lush green food can cause them to bloat and this can kill them if not treated.
