Set your goals.,
Try everything.,
Study up.,
Be realistic.,
Be flexible.",How to Find Your Non Fiction Writing Style," If you're transitioning from fiction writing to non-fiction, take a good look at why you're making that choice. If your goal is to make money on the side to financially support your creative writing (and potentially end a fast food career), be realistic about what that will take. Are you motivated enough to work from home (blogging or copywriting)? Will you be pursuing non-fiction writing as a full-time job (such as shadow-writing textbooks)?


If you're thinking of pursuing non-fiction as a full-time job, then you will probably need a qualification. Most business and shadow writing jobs accept a BA in English as a minimum.
If you don't have any tertiary qualification in writing, then there are still ways to explore and gain employment from home, but remember that freelancing in any field is often an unstable source of income, at least for the first few years.
If your main focus isn't to work, but just to potentially find out what you could do, then you still need to consider your goals before you begin.;
, There are a variety of styles and voices to write in -- examples of non-fiction writing 'genres' include copywriting (writing the text in advertisements), paid blogging (often part of a larger website, for instance, a health & lifestyle blog on the website of a vitamin company), journalistic writing (news stories), shadow writing or ghostwriting for textbooks, biographies, and other work (you can be like the writers who wrote The Hardy Boys series under the pen name ""Franklin W. Dixon""). Essays and technical documentation are also non-fiction texts, but usually related to a specific field of expertise.


If your aim is to develop your skills or to earn some money, you need to dabble in at least most of these. Think of it as trying on new clothes -- put in the time to get to know a style, but if it doesn't seem to fit, let it go.
If you want to write blog posts or news articles, read a few articles in this style to get warmed up, noting what works about them and what draws you in. Try to emulate the style of what you've read -- don't worry about it looking weird. You will have time to refine your style.
The important thing is to never set your standards too high with what you think you want to do; you never know unless you try.

, You don't need to go back to school to make it as a non-fiction writer. Freelance jobs often pay by the word and hire based on whether you can meet deadlines, not how many years you've studied. There are some amazing resources around the web that will help you figure out the correct formatting for most jobs, and whatever you're planning to do, make sure you keep reading lots of material written in that style.


Pay attention to particular uses of language, such as the lack of hyperbole and adjectives in 'hard news' stories, contrasted with the personal address of blogs, and many advertisements.
Articles providing factual information on a topic (on a website like Wikipedia or Web MD) don't use phrases like ""it seems as though"" or ""we might assume"", whereas a biography or an account of an interview might use a more personal tone to connect with the reader.

, Creative writers write for their readers. As a non-fiction writer, this stays true -- but you're also writing for your bosses. If you're hoping to be able to quit your job and work from home, then do your research on how you're going to make ends meet. Writing online means that you can source work from all over the world (and probably will) but it also means employers have access to more writers, so the pay goes down.


One example is a work-from-home copywriting job for a small real estate firm. The company hiring you (often a third party) will send you the details of a house that is going up for lease, the number of bedrooms, parking spaces, the location, and maybe a picture. Your job is to think of some nice stuff to say about that house -- in fifty words or less. For the fifty words you produce, you get paid maybe one dollar (if not less). So to make $15 an hour, you have to write one 50-word blurb every four minutes. But the real estate business only needs a hundred blurbs written for the whole week, so after six hours, you've written yourself out of work.

, You may never have liked writing essays in high school, and even have left it out when you were trying new styles of writing. Don't give up so quickly! Essays teach the foundational aspects of structure and argument, which are very important in other styles, such as copywriting and even blogging! Everything you write, whether it's 50 words or fifty thousand, will have a beginning, a middle and an end. If you find yourself saying ""I won't do that"" before you've even begun, you're closing yourself off to opportunities to excel. When something comes up, give it your best shot before you dismiss it -- you might learn something new on the way.


This is especially important if you're looking for your 'voice' as a non-fiction writer, or hoping to make money from your writing. If you keep at something for long enough, it becomes natural. When you find something you really enjoy, you'll have had a wide range of experiences that show you what you really care about... and you'll know you've found your style.

Be yourself.",How to Write an Autobiographical Essay," One of the best ways to write a good story is to choose a story that you really care about telling. Remember, you will need to write about a specific aspect of your life, not your entire life. The story of your entire life could fill the pages of a book. Instead, choose a topic that you can discuss in a detailed way over the course of your essay.Some options you might consider include:


an accomplishment like winning an award, getting a job, or graduating from high school
a trial like a difficult class, an injury, or losing a loved one
a meaningful experience like discovering a hobby, meeting your best friend, going away to camp, or learning something about yourself;
, Think about what you want to accomplish with your autobiographical essay. Why do you want to tell this story? What do you hope to accomplish by telling this story?If you are writing an autobiographical essay for an application, make sure that you read the instructions well. If the application includes a prompt or question that you need to answer, make sure that the story you intend to tell will respond to this prompt or question.
If you are writing an autobiographical essay for a class, make sure that you read the assignment guidelines well. Make sure that the story you intend to tell will work for this assignment. Ask your instructor if you have any questions about the assignment.

, Think about who will be reading your autobiographical essay. Consider the needs and expectations of your readers before you begin writing. Jot down some of the things that you will need to keep in mind about your readers as you write your autobiographical essay.If you are writing your essay as part of an application, consider what your readers will be most interested in hearing about.
If you are writing your essay for a class assignment, consider what your instructor will expect you to include in your essay.

, Before you begin writing your essay, you should take some time to flesh out your ideas and get some things down on paper. Invention activities like listing, freewriting, clustering, and questioning can help you to develop ideas.Try listing. List the ideas that you have for your autobiography and then look over the list you have made and group similar ideas together. Expand those lists by adding more ideas or by using another prewriting activity.Try freewriting. Write nonstop for about 10 minutes. Write whatever comes to mind and don’t edit yourself. Review what you have written. Highlight or underline the most useful information for your autobiography. Repeat the freewriting exercise using the passages you underlined as a starting point. You can repeat this exercise many times to continue to refine and develop your ideas.Try clustering. Write a brief explanation of the subject of your autobiography on the center of a piece of paper and circle it. Then draw three or more lines extending from the circle. Write a corresponding idea at the end of each of these lines. Continue developing your cluster until you have explored as many connections as you can.Try questioning. On a piece of paper, write out “Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?” Space the questions about two or three lines apart on the paper so that you can write your answers on these lines. Respond to each question in as much detail as you can., Once you have gotten some of your ideas on paper, organize those ideas into an outline before you begin drafting your essay. You can Write an Essay Outline to plan out your whole essay, develop more ideas, and figure out if you have forgotten anything., Use the first person perspective (I, me, my, mine) when writing your autobiographical essay. You share your own experiences in an autobiographical essay, so use the first person perspective. Do not use the second person perspective (“you”) or switch back and forth between “I” and “you.” Use the first person perspective (“I”) throughout your entire essay.

, Your introduction should immediately begin telling your story. Think about what you will discuss in your essay to help you determine what you should include in your introduction. Your introduction should also identify the main idea of your autobiographical essay and act as a preview to your story.Jump right in. One way to begin a story is to immediately begin describing something that happened, even if it happened in the middle of your story. You might start with something like, “There I was, standing in front of the entire 10th grade reading a story I had written.”, Use vivid details to describe the setting of your autobiography to your readers. Provide context and background that they will need to understand the rest of your essay.Say something tantalizing to your reader. For example, you might start with something like, ""I never expected to be as happy as I was on that day."" Or, ""Many things have happened to me in my life, but this was the worst.” Just make sure that the opening fits with your topic.
Avoid beginnings that are too general or broad. Never open with, “Since the dawn of time…” This type of opening does not help your reader understand what your story is about. ""Too general"" openings are boring as well.Avoid opening with a quote, unless it is meaningful to you and crucial to your story. If you want to include a meaningful quote in your autobiographical essay, it should have something to do with your story. You should talk about what it means to you when you provide it., After you have introduced your story and hooked your readers, you will need to transition into telling the story. End your introduction with a sentence that will leave your readers excited to continue reading.You might say something like, “Under these circumstances, I began the most challenging year of my life.” Or, “Before this happened, I had no idea that I could do something so huge.” Choose a transition that fits your introduction and that will connect with the ideas in your next paragraph.

, After you have introduced your story, you will need to tell your readers what happened, step-by-step. Your second paragraph and the ones that follow will depend on where you left off in your introduction. Make sure that you do not skip over important details that your readers might need or want to know about.

, Your conclusion should be memorable and interesting. You should end your story in a way that wraps up your loose ends and provides some reflection on the experience.Talk about why this story is significant to you and what you learned from it.Refer to the beginning of your story in the end by mentioning a situation or person that was central to your introduction.Tell your readers about something that came out of this experience that you were not expecting., Vivid details and dialogue help bring your story alive for your readers. Describe the people, surroundings, and other relevant aspects of your autobiography.Instead of saying that your teacher wore a blue dress, say that it was aqua blue with white lace trim on the sleeves.
Instead of saying you felt nervous, describe your trembling hands, the knot in your stomach, and the weak feeling in your knees.
Instead of saying that you spoke to your teacher about something important, put the conversation that you had with your teacher into dialogue.

, Telling your story in the order it happened is effective, but there are other ways of organizing an autobiography. Consider different organizational patterns before you pick one.Use chronological organization if you want to start at the beginning and describe your story in the order that it happened.
Use starting in the middle organization if you want to put your readers into the midst of your story and then go back to the beginning.
Use starting at the end organization if you want to tell your readers how your story ended up and then explain how you got to that point.

, One of the worst things you can do when writing an autobiographical essay is to represent yourself in a way that does not reflect who you are. Make sure that your essay reflects your experiences and personality.Don’t be afraid to show your sense of humor, as long as you don’t think it will disrupt the tone of your essay. In other words, if you are telling a sad story, using sarcasm or making a joke about something serious might not be appropriate.

Choose which animals you want to include.,
Look up facts on each animal.,
Write down facts as you research.,
Get pictures for each animal.,
Gather the necessary materials.,
Make a fact page for each animal.,
Add pictures and decorations to each page.,
Order the pages.,
Write a table of contents.,
Bind the book together.",How to Make an Animal Fact Book," This is your own fact book, you can choose the animals that you want to research and write down facts about. Perhaps you want to research animals specific to one continent or region? Alternatively, you can choose any variety of animals that really interest you.Make a list of the animals you’re interested in and keep it with you when you’re researching.;
, After you have chosen your animals, the fun can begin. You now get to find out new and interesting facts about all of these animals. Do some searches online or go to your local library and check out some books about each animal.The site http://www.animalfactguide.com/ is a great resource.
Ask a parent or friend to help you with your research.

, While you are reading about each animal, jot down your favorite facts on a piece of paper or notecard. Be sure to keep your notes organized by animal, so you don’t get them all mixed up for later. Write down as much as you want during this step. You can decide which facts to include in the final book later.


You might also want to write down the source of the information next to each fact to reference later.

, If you are searching online, you can also choose some pictures to printout for your book. Alternatively, you can look through old nature magazines and cut out pictures of your animals. You could also buy some stickers to decorate your book with.Ask permission from whoever before printing a lot of color pictures because printer ink is expensive.

, To assemble your animal fact book, there are a few supplies that you will need: colored construction paper, markers/crayons/colored pencils, a glue stick, scissors, pictures of animals, and white paper. Get all of your materials together before you begin, so you don’t get distracted while constructing your book.Other optional decorations include stickers and glitter.

, Choose a piece of colored construction paper for your animal. Write the name of the animal on top of the page.Look through your notes from your research and write your favorite facts down. Aim for about 4-5 facts for each animal.


To make your book look nicer, write the facts on a separate piece of white paper and then glue that to the construction paper.

, Around the facts that you wrote down, add pictures of the animal. You can add as many as you like, but avoid making the page look too crowded. Use stickers, borders, and markers to decorate the rest of the page if you’d like.A glue stick works better than white craft glue for this because it dries faster.
If you don’t have printed pictures, draw your own picture of each animal.

, Before you finish up your fact book, choose an order for all of the pages. You can order it alphabetically by animal, by type of animal (birds, mammals, reptiles), or by the region of the world they come from. The order is completely up to you so do what you want.When you have chosen an order, stack the pages in that order.

, Once you have determined the order of the pages, you’ll want to make a table of contents so you can easily locate the fact page you want to look at. Write a list of the animals in the order that they will appear in your book.


To make it even easier to navigate, you can add page numbers at the bottom corner of each page and include these in the table of contents.

, There are a number of ways you can turn this into an actual book. The easiest way is to either staple all of your pages together or use a three-hole punch and tie the pages together with string.If you want the book to be a bit fancier, you can take it to a paper/print store and get it bound together with spiral binding.


If you are getting the book bound together, consider getting the cover and back pages laminated as well to protect them.

Decide why you are writing the cookbook.,
Select your best or favorite recipes.,
Prepare the recipes.,
Take photos.,
Bring the recipes together.,
Proofread.,
Seek publication.",How to Write a Cookbook," You need to make a decision about this in order to know how to approach your cookbook and to whom you will target it.


For example, if you simply wish to write a cookbook for your own personal use, creating it on your computer in a readable PDF format that can be printed and bound simply with staples and a little scrapbook artistry might be sufficient for you.
If it's for a family reunion, for local or national publication, or to commemorate an event, it's likely that you'll want to produce something more formal and you will probably need to consider photographs and decent printing services, including good binding.
If it's for professional publishing, you may wish to explore contacting the publisher before even embarking on the project, to garner potential interest and to get advice.;
, A good cookbook is an assemblage of a well thought-out collection of recipes that reflect themes, such as starters, appetizers, entrées, desserts, baking, etc. Generally you stick to one cooking style rather than being too eclectic, for example, raw, homestyle, old-fashioned, family friendly, easy cooking, fast cooking, dinner party cooking, fresh, seafood focused, etc.


You might also consider the recipes that are always a hit with family and friends and that are fairly fail-proof. These virtues can be touted and will encourage readers to give such recipes a try.

, If you have them in a variety of places such as your head, different pieces of paper, various cookbooks etc., it's time to draw together your collection.


Always use your own words when writing up the recipes. While lists of ingredients are not covered by copyright and common ways of performing recipe actions are usually not copyright either, the words used to describe the methods in each step or as a whole are copyright, so you must use your own words where you are relying on your cookbook collection.
Acknowledge where possible. If you know you've used a recipe from a favorite chef for the past few years, consider acknowledging the original source, even though you've long since deviated from the exact same ingredients. It's a common courtesy and helps to maintain the sense of ongoing sharing and pride that is commonplace in the cooking community.

, If you are adding photos to your cookbook, make up the meals or items and photograph them. Contemporary readers tend to expect more images in cookbooks than was the case in cookbooks of the past. Photos help the reader imagine the end result more concretely and give inspiration to try the dish out.


Take several photos from differing angles to get the best possible final shot of each recipe being photographed.
You don't need a photo for all recipes unless that's the sort of cookbook style you're after; just select the recipes that you'd most like featured as part of the photos.
Make any changes to photos using photo fixing software.
If you can't take photos or don't like doing it while juggling the cooking, find a friend or family member willing to help. Some printing places will do this for you but it adds to the cost, so it's best to do it yourself if you're self-publishing.

, Select the order in which you would like to place the recipes in the cookbook. Write an overview and a table of contents to help guide your placement.


Look at existing cookbooks for ideas of the way that recipes are usually ordered. While it's okay to be slightly quirky, remember that readers have fairly set-in-stone ideas of the usual direction of recipe books, which tends to be savory to sweet, starters to mains to dessert, and so forth, depending on what food selections you're bringing together.

, Edit your work several times, and have others read through it as well. Check for accuracy of ingredients, measurements, cooking times, etc. Recipes are not something that leave a lot of room for error.


If you have willing cooks among your family or group of friends, consider dividing up different recipes in the book and asking them to road-test the recipes. Twice- or triple-tested recipes are a value-added promise that you can include as part of the marketing pitch for encouraging readers to trust in your cookbook. Promise your helpers a free copy of the final book as a thank-you for their help.

, There are great self-publication possibilities, both in online version and in printed versions. Check the prices set the amount of copies you want and be open to the possibility of making an ebook, printing a hard edition or perhaps a combination of both.


If hard printing, consider whether you want color printing, gloss or matte finishes, cover art, etc. as well, so that the total price includes everything.
Alternately, send your cookbook off to publishers to have them handle printing and sales. This will result in numerous rejections but if you have done your job well, it's likely that someone will be interested if you are polite, persistent, available for discussion and give it a good sales pitch. Even more helpful is to pitch the idea before writing it, and getting your publisher up-front.
Seek professional advice if you are looking for a professional publication of your work.

Ask the subject for permission to write the biography.,
Look for primary sources about the subject.,
Conduct interviews with the subject and those close to them.,
Visit locations that are important to the subject.,
Study the time and place of the subject’s life.,
Make a timeline of the person’s life.,
Go for a chronological structure.,
Create a thesis for the biography.,
Use flashbacks.,
Focus on major events and milestones.,
Identify a major theme or pattern in the person’s life.,
Include your own opinions and thoughts about the person.,
Show the biography to others for feedback.,
Proofread the biography.,
Cite all sources used in the biography.",How to Write a Biography," Before you dive into your research, make sure you get the okay from the subject to write their biography. Ask them if they are willing to be the subject. Getting their permission will make writing the biography much easier and ensure they are open with information about their life.If the subject does not give you permission to write the biography, you may want to choose a different subject. If you decide to publish the biography without the subject’s permission, you may be susceptible to legal action by the subject.
If the subject is no longer alive, you obviously do not need to ask permission to write about them.;
, Primary sources could include books, letters, pictures, newspapers and newspaper clippings, magazines, internet articles, journals, videos, interviews, existing biographies, or an autobiography by the subject. Look for these sources at your local library or online. Read as much as you can about the subject and highlight any key information you come across in your sources.You may create research questions to help focus your research of the subject, such as, What do I find interesting about the subject? Why is this subject important to readers? What can I say that is new about the subject? What would I like to learn more about?

, Interviewing people will breath life into your research--people you interview can tell you stories that you can’t find in a history book. Interview the subject as well as people close to them, such as spouses, friends, business partners, family members, coworkers, and peers. Conduct the interview in person, by phone, or through e-mail.For in person interviews, record them with a tape recorder or a voice recorder on your computer or phone.
You may need to interview the subject and others several times to get the material you need.

, To get a feel for the subject’s history, spend time in locations and areas that are meaningful or important to the subject. This could be the subject’s childhood home or neighborhood. You could also visit the subject’s workplace and regular hang out spots.You may also want to visit areas where the subject made a major decision or breakthrough in their life. Being physically in the area can give you a sense of how the subject might have felt and help you write their experiences more effectively.

, Contextualize the subject’s life by looking at what was going on around them. Consider the time period they grew up in as well as the history of the places where they lived. Do research on the economics, politics, and culture of their time period. Look at the news events happening in the place where they lived or worked.When researching the time period ask yourself: What were the social norms of that time? What was going on economically and politically? How did the social and political climate affect the subject?

, To help you organize your research, make a timeline of the person’s entire life, starting from birth. Draw a long line on a piece of paper and fill in as much of the person’s life as you can. Highlight key events or moments on the timeline. Include important dates, locations, and names.You may also include historical events or moments that affected the subject on the timeline. For example, maybe there was a conflict or civil war that happened during the person’s life that affected their life.

, Start chronologically from the subject’s birth to their death or later life. Use the timeline of the person’s life to structure the biography. Start with birth and childhood. Then, go into young adulthood and adulthood. If the person is still alive, include information on their later life. If they are no longer alive, include information on their death.You may end up focusing on particular areas of the person’s life. If you do this, work through a particular period in the person’s life chronologically.

, It may be helpful to create a thesis statement or a sentence with your main idea for the biography. Use the thesis to help you organize the rest of the biography. Make sure all of your content refers back in some way to your thesis.For example, you may have a thesis statement about focusing on how the person impacted the civil rights movement in America in the 1970s. You can then make sure all your content relates back to this thesis.

, Flashbacks are when where you move from the present to the past. You may start with a present moment and then include a scene of the person’s past. Or you may have one chapter that focuses on the present and one chapter that focuses on the past, alternating as you go.Flashbacks should feel as detailed and real as present day scenes. Use your research notes and interviews with the subject to get a good sense of their past for the flashbacks.
For example, you may jump from the person’s death in the present to a flashback to their favorite childhood memory.

, Major events could include marriages, births, or deaths in the person’s life. They may also have milestones like their first successful business venture or their first civil rights march. Highlight key moments in the person’s life so the reader gets a good sense of what mattered to the person and how they affected the world around them.For example, you may focus on the person’s accomplishments in the civil rights movement. You may write a whole section about their contributions and participation in major civil rights marches in their hometown.

, Look over your research for any similarities between events or moments in the person’s life. Check for any recurring phrases or situations in the person’s life.For example, you may notice that the person’s life is patterned with moments of adversity, where the person worked hard and fought against larger forces. You can then use the theme of overcoming adversity in the biography.

, As the biographer, you play a role in the person’s life story. Do not be afraid to put your own thoughts about the person in the text. Reflect on your research and comment on how you view the person.For example, you may note how you see parallels in the person’s life during the civil rights movement with your own interests in social justice. You may also commend the person for their hard work and positive impact on society.

, Once you have completed a draft of the biography, show it to peers, friends, teachers, and mentors for feedback. Ask them if they get a good sense of the person’s life and if the biography is easy to read. Be open to feedback so you can improve the biography and make it better.Revise the biography based on feedback from others. Do not be afraid to cut or edit down the biography to suit the needs of your readers.

, Check the biography for spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Circle all punctuation in the text to confirm it is correct. Read the text backwards to check for spelling and grammar errors.


Having a biography riddled with spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors can turn off your readers and result in a poor grade if you are handing in the text for a class.

, Most biographies will include information from sources such as books, articles, magazines, and interviews. Make sure you cite any sources you quote directly or paraphrase. You may use in-text citations, footnotes, or endnotes.


If the biography is for a class, use MLA, APA, or Chicago Style citations based on the preferences of your instructor.

Always contribute in any task provided.,
Look presentable.,
Come up with good ideas.,
Be ambitious.,
Be kind to others.,
Be cheerful.",How to Be Like Denise Lovett from The Paradise," This is the perfect chance to tell people your ideas, to make new friends, and to be recognised with honour.;
, Do something nice with your hair. Denise always wears a fancy updo/bun while working at the paradise. Wear a dress or a skirt to look more feminine, or if you are at school or work, wear your uniform with class. Don't wear a baggy jumper that hangs off of you. Look tidy. Also, maintain good hygiene, this includes: having a bath/shower regularly, brushing your teeth, wearing deodorant, washing your hair, and smelling nice.

, This might seem hard, but you can tackle it. First of all, think about things that may be associated with what you are trying to come up with. If you are trying to think of an idea for a book, think of other books you have read, or past experiences that have occurred to you. If you are trying to come up with business ideas, think of things that you like, e.g technology, then open a centre dedicated to technology, where people can share their opinions with you, about devices they have used and you haven't.


Read as much as you can; the more you read, the more fascinating ideas you will come up with. Ask someone who is older than you, that way someone else can express a completely different vision from your own. Learn from others around you. In one of the most recent episodes of the paradise, Denise is given the opportunity to go to Paris in order to observe the latest french fashions. You don't have to go to another country, but even advice from other people can make a difference.

, Denise marvels at the thought of leadership. If she wants something, then she will go for it. Stage a debate with your peers. Denise would love to do this as it gives everybody a chance to speak their own opinion. If you are torn between two, then have a vote; make sure everyone is included and everyone is given a chance.

, Never forget to be kind to others, whether they are somewhat below you, or are poor. Denise is always nice to everyone, whether she likes them or not. Don't get caught up in rumours; they are a waste of time. Make sure you keep your morals, though, and aren't vulnerable or naive.

, If you are having a bad time, then think of the times to come. The future can always change, and life can be made to suite your better needs. Never forget that better times will come. Denise has to remember that Moray will reclaim the paradise, and that she will no longer be tormented by Katherine Western.

For example, if you're writing a professional bio for your website in order to market yourself and your skills, look at websites created by others in your field. See how they present themselves, and figure out what you think they do well.


Good places to look for professional bios could be professional websites, Twitter accounts and LinkedIn pages.

, Be ruthless here—–even the most interesting of anecdotes may not be appropriate. For example, an author's bio on a book jacket often mentions past writing accomplishments, whereas an athlete's bio on a team website often mentions the person's height and weight. While it's often okay to add a few extraneous details, they should not make up the majority of your bio.


Remember that your credibility is important here. While you may enjoy going on pub crawls with your buddies on a weekend, that may not be what you want to advertise in a bio aimed at finding a job. Keep your details relevant and informative.

, Writing in the third person will make your bio sound more objective – like it’s been written by someone else – which can be useful in a formal setting. Experts recommend that you always write professional bios in the third person.


For example, begin your bio with a sentence such as ""Joann Smith is a graphic designer in Boston,"" rather than ""I am a graphic designer in Boston.""

, This should be the first thing you write. Assume that the people reading the bio know nothing about you. Give your full preferred name, but avoid nicknames.


For example: Dan Keller


, What are you known for? What do you do for a living? How much experience or expertise do you have? Don't leave this to the end or make your readers guess—they won't and they may well lose interest quickly if it's not up front. This should be explicitly stated in the first or second sentence. Usually, combining it with your name is easiest.


Dan Keller is a columnist for the Boulder Times.

, If you have earned achievements or awards that are relevant, include them. However, this element is tricky and might not be applicable in all situations. Remember that a bio is not a resume. Do not simply list your accomplishments; describe them. Remember that your audience may have no idea what these accomplishments are unless you tell them.

, This is a nice way to invite the reader to care. It’s also your chance to get some of your personality across. However, avoid too much self-deprecation in your tone, and don't include details that are too intimate or potentially embarrassing for either you or your audience. Ideally, these personal details will serve as conversation-starters should you meet your audience in real life.Dan Keller is a columnist for the Boulder Times.

, For example, if you're a writer, state the title of the new book you're working on. This should be kept to a sentence or two.

, This is usually done in the last sentence. If it's to be published online, be careful with the email address in order to avoid spam. Many people write email addresses online as something like: greg (at) fizzlemail (dot) com. If space permits, include a couple of ways of contacting you, such as your Twitter profile or a LinkedIn page.

, For an online blurb, this is just enough to give the reader a taste of your life and personality without becoming a bore. Avoid a profile that is longer than 500 words.

, Rarely is writing perfect the first time it hits the pages. And because personal bios are only a small snapshot of a person's life, upon rereading your bio, you might realize there was information you forgot to include.


Have a friend read your bio and give you their feedback. This is important because they can tell you if all the information you want to get though is coming across clearly.

, Every once in a while, go back and update your bio. By putting in a little work frequently to keep it up to date, you'll save yourself a lot of work when you need to use it again.

Gather inspiration for your skit by watching and reading other comedy sketches. You can go onto YouTube and watch videos of sketches which are produced both professionally, and in an amateur sense.


Watch sketches by Key & Peele, SNL, W/ Bob and David, and Monty Python to gather inspiration. Take note on what these professional sketches have in common. What separates these sketches from other ones?
When watching other sketches or skits, think about what makes the one you're watching original. You don’t want to copy a skit you’ve seen before, but you may be able to find a new angle.
Pay attention to what’s happening around you. A lot of the best skits work because there is a relatable component in the sketch that makes us think of our own lives. Pay attention to how people around you interact with one another. Look for real life scenarios that are funny to you.;
, Write down a bunch of ideas. You can do this with a group of people who are going to be working on the skit, by yourself, or both. Grab a notebook that you can carry around with you and jot down ideas as new ones come to you.


If you encounter a funny interaction between people, that might be a great starting idea for a skit. For example, you witness someone at a coffee shop ordering an overly complicated drink and holding up the line. Write down what happened and why you think there might be humor in this situation. Maybe the idea of ordering such a complicated coffee is funny to you.
Meet with your group and share ideas. It’s good If you have a place to write your ideas down so everyone can see each idea. Otherwise, designate someone to write each idea down in a notebook.
Don’t censor your ideas right now. At this stage, you just want to get everything out. You may find that one silly idea turns into something great.
If you laugh at an idea, make a note that you thought it was funny. Ask yourself why you’re laughing. Is it something visual about the idea? A certain word or words? Or maybe it’s because the idea is relatable to your own life. Knowing why something made you laugh will be helpful when building out your skit and ultimately performing it.
Think about what kind of skit you may want to do. There are a number of types of skits and sketches from parody and satire, to character sketches and even absurdist sketches. , Every successful skit or sketch has a solid point of view (POV) that can be easily identified. It’s the same principal as having a thesis statement in a paper. Your POV should be easy for people to understand. A POV is the lens in which viewers of your skit see the world as you see it. In a sketch, this can be blown up for comical effect.


A POV is your opinion expressed as a fact. You can discover your point of view through a couple steps. First, you see someone order an overly complicated drink at a coffee shop. Second, you decide to write a skit about people ordering complicated drinks at a coffee shop. Each drink that a new person in your skit orders is more complicated and ridiculous than the one before it. Third, you reach your point of view, which is that people are becoming too obsessed with unnecessary options and materialism.
Your point of view isn’t expressed by one character in your skit complaining about someone ordering an overly complicated drink. It’s expressed by the action that takes place in your skit.
Having a clear point of view and expressing it as a fact is a great way to make any skit more original. Even if the content of the skit has been done before, it’s original enough because it comes from you.

, Every story, no matter how short needs a beginning, middle, and end. When writing a skit try and map out these three different sections.


Since skits are usually comedic in nature, your beginning can depict normal, everyday life. People at a coffee shop waiting in line to order coffee is normal.
The middle of your sketch happens when something out of the norm occurs. People start ordering crazier drinks than the person before.
The end of your skit is when there’s a climax and resolution. Perhaps the barista decides to dump everyone’s coffee on the ground. Or maybe the barista snaps and takes out a weapon and steals the money from the cash register.

, There are several formats to writing skits and sketches. You don’t have to have a professional format, but you should have an easy to follow one.


The top of your script should have the title of your skit. Below you may want to write out the names of the characters involved, and even the name of the actor playing that character.
To write dialogue, center and capitalize the character’s name who is speaking. On the next line, left indent the cursor and type the dialogue.
Actions can be written on a separate line in parentheses.
When writing your first draft, don’t concern yourself too much with getting everything perfect. You just want to get the general script down. You will edit it later.

, Whether you’re filming or performing your skit live, your skit will most likely be under five minutes in length. This means that you have to get into the meat of your skit quickly. Don’t spend time setting up characters and backgrounds. Simply start at a point which is funny or where the action is happening.


If you’re writing the coffee shop skit, try beginning your skit with the barista asking the person at the front of the line what this person wants to order.
The person who orders the drink should describe a complicated drink but not something that is so crazy that you can’t begin to build on it as the next few people order drinks.
At the top of your skit, your goal is to give your audience enough information as quickly as possible. The barista can say something like “Welcome to Good Coffee, what can I get for you?” With one line you have established where you are, who the characters are, and what is happening.
In a skit, every line is important. You don’t have time to waste developing elements that don’t matter in this scenario. Avoid discussion of things in the past/future, people who aren’t present, and objects that aren’t relevant to the skit.

, Keep your script to less than five pages. If you go over five pages in your first draft, that’s fine, you can cut parts out. On average, one page of a script equals one minute of performance time.


You also want to keep your skit short because you can lose the humor if you drag it on for too long. A fast-paced script that ends quickly is easier to stay engaged in than a skit that stops being funny because the joke has run its course.

, The rule of three means that you repeat something three times, or include three similar elements into your skit. It’s like having your beginning, middle, and end, you have three components making up a whole.


In our coffee shop skit, you can have three different patrons buying coffee. Each patron has a more ridiculous order than the last.

, When writing your script you want to start at a place that you can build on. A skit should have a rising action before hitting the climax and then ending.


Using our coffee shop example, the first person will order a complicated drink. You can have the barista and customer talk for a few lines. Maybe the barista tries repeating the drink back to the customer and gets part of it wrong. The customer then has to correct the barista.
The second customer has a crazier drink order. The barista tries repeating the drink order back and the customer decides to change the order. The barista then tries repeating this order back or has to ask what one of the ingredients is because it’s not common in a coffee drink. The customer complains and moves on.
Finally, the third customer comes up. The barista is already upset and confused by the first two orders. The third order is by far the most outlandish order. The barista tells the customer that the coffee shop doesn’t even carry half of the ingredients and that the remaining options are black coffee, or coffee with cream. The customer throws a fit and calls for the manager.
Now the barista has finally snapped and acts in a way that is just as crazy as the customers only with real life implications. This could mean the barista robs the coffee shop, throws hot coffee in the customer’s faces, or gets fired.

, After you write your first draft, read it out loud to your group, assigning each person a character. Then get feedback and discuss what everyone thought did, and did not work.


Show your sketch to someone whose opinion you trust. It’s good to get feedback from someone who will give you an honest opinion.
Take notes on what people thought was funny, and not funny. It’s a good idea to understand what doesn’t work in a skit. Though you may like a line or joke, it may not work in your skit.
Cutting out what doesn’t work is a great way to trim the fat in a skit. You want your skit to be lean and quick. Consider removing lines of dialogue that don’t directly contribute to forwarding your skit.

, Depending on how serious you are about producing your skit or sketch, you may want to hold auditions for actors. If you wrote your skit with a group and already know who is going to perform you don’t have to hold auditions, but you should do a read through.


Although you should be looking for talented people, you should also find people that you know can be reliable and trustworthy. You don't want to hold empty practices and rehearsals.
If you are writing a skit as part of a larger show at school or a theatre, ask your teacher or theatre director for information about auditions. There might be one large audition set up for everyone, or you may have to hold your own.
If you are holding auditions, put signs up around your school or post information about it on social media.
When you do hold auditions, ask actors to bring in a headshot. You should also provide sides, which are a few pages of your script, for the actors to read.

, Since your skit is short you don’t need to have many rehearsals, but one or two is always a good idea. Make sure that your actors know the lines and understand the direction and point of view of your skit.


Plan for your props and other equipment. Some skits work best with no props or backgrounds while others need a few more theatrics. Skits by definition aren't too elaborate, but there may be props required to make the skit make sense.

, When you’ve rehearsed your skit a few times, it’s time to perform it live or shoot it for the web. Give yourself plenty of time to make sure that any props, costumes, and camera equipment are set.


If you’re filming your skit, you should have at least one camera, as well as sound and lighting equipment if you can.
You can also upload your skit to YouTube or Vimeo so others can view it.

Tell a story.,
Keep the focus on yourself.,
Don’t say what you think the board wants to hear.,
Don’t try too hard to sound smart.,
Show, don't tell.,
Use active verbs.",How to Write a Personal Bio2," The structure outlined above probably won’t apply for most college entrance exams: though its simplicity makes it very handy for quick, inconspicuous bios, the whole point when applying to college is to stand out. The best way to do this is to make the structure your own by telling a story, not outlining key factoids. There are many possible structures to choose from, including:



Chronological: This structure starts at the beginning and ends at the end. It’s the most straightforward and works well if you’ve had an interesting life that has taken you from A to B to C in unusual or impressive ways (for example, truly beating the odds).

Circular: This structure start at an important or climactic moment (D), backtracks (A), and then explains all the events leading up to that moment (B, C), eventually bringing the reader full circle. This is good for building suspense, especially when Event D is so strange or unbelievable that the reader doesn’t mind being led around for a bit.

Zoomed In: This structure focuses on one critical event (for example, C) to symbolically tell a larger story. It might use a few small, surrounding details (a, d) to orient the reader, but otherwise, the moment is important enough to stand on its own.

, Colleges want to hear your life story so that they can figure out whether or not you’re a good fit for them. That said, showing how good a match you are for the school doesn’t mean getting sidetracked by trying to describe the school as well.



Incorrect: ""UCSF has one of the top-ranked research-based med schools in the world, which would provide me with the foundation necessary to achieve my lifelong dream of becoming a doctor.""
The school you’re applying to already knows what its programs and facilities are like, so don’t waste the reader’s time. On top of that, praising the school at the expense of describing yourself makes you sound unworthy to attend.

Correct: ""Watching a trauma surgeon save my brother’s life at the age of five is a moment I’ll never forget. Since that day, I’ve known without a doubt that I would dedicate my life to medicine. My brother was lucky that his surgeon studied at one of the best programs in the country. By doing the same, I hope to one day mean to another family what Dr. Heller does to mine.""
This description of the narrator is on-point, personal, and memorable. Though it still subtly praises the UCSF facilities, it doesn’t sound like it’s trying to score brownie points.

, Even if you manage to do it well, which is hard when you’re not inspired by truth, the best that will happen is that you will seem like hundreds or thousands of other students who used the same strategy. Instead, talk about what’s real and what matters to you. Don’t have the most amazing life? Embrace it – and whatever you do, don’t fight above your weight class. Trying to force a ho-hum story to be more dramatic will just make it look silly, especially compared to the truly epic tales some of your co-applicants will have.



Incorrect: ""Reading The Great Gatsby was a pivotal moment in my life that made me completely rethink my own preconceptions about what it means to live in modern America. Thanks to that assignment, I now know I want to pursue American Studies.""

Correct: ""My family’s ties to this country aren’t particularly glamorous. We didn’t arrive on the Mayflower, or have our surname butchered at Ellis Island, or receive amnesty after fleeing a foreign dictatorship. What we did is settle in four states across the Midwest, where we’ve lived happily for over a hundred years. The magic of that simple act isn’t lost on me, which is why I’ve chosen to major in American Studies.""

, That’s what your SATs were for. While you shouldn’t use slang or dumb your essay down, your content should speak for itself; going nutty with the vocabulary will just be a distraction. Plus, the admissions board slogs through you-don’t-even-want-to-know-how-many essays every year, and the last thing they want to hear is another person trying to wrestle a five-syllable word into a place where it has no earthly business.Incorrect: ""Having had a rather minimalistic upbringing, I find that I continue to assiduously value hard work and frugality above all else.""
Unless you’re a Dickensian countess or one of Jane Austen’s comic relief characters, this just doesn’t work. It sounds like you're trying too hard.

Correct: ""Growing up very poor taught me that hard work and thrift are sometimes the only things a person can afford.""
Impactful and to-the-point – all with no words longer than two syllables.

, This is one of the most important things you can do to help your bio stand out. Many students will state things like ""I learned a valuable lesson from this experience"" or ""I developed a new understanding of X."" Showing through concrete detail is much more effective.Incorrect: ""I learned a lot from my experience as a camp counselor.""
This says nothing about what you actually learned, and is a sentence that will probably be in hundreds of college bios.

Correct: ""I came out of my time as a camp counselor with a better understanding of empathy and connection than I had previously. Now, when I see my younger sister acting up, I understand better how to help her without sounding bossy or controlling.""

, The ""passive voice"" occurs when you use forms of the verb to be, and it usually makes your sentences wordier and unclear. Using active, present-tense verbs makes your writing more alive and interesting.


Consider the difference between the following sentences: ""The window was broken by the zombie"" and ""The zombie broke the window."" In the first, you have no idea whether the window by the zombie just happened to be broken. The second is very clear: the zombie broke the window, and you need to hit the road.

Consider your purpose for writing.,
Understand any length restrictions.,
Consider what details you want to share.,
Include your name, profession, and accomplishments.,
Avoid buzzwords.,
Use humor to express yourself.",How to Write a Personal Bio3," Are you writing to introduce yourself to a particular audience, or is your bio to provide a general introduction to whomever? A bio written for your Facebook page will be very different than a bio written for a website.

, Some social media sites, such as Twitter, restrict your bio to a certain number of words or characters. Make sure you use that space to make the biggest impact possible.

, This information will vary depending on who you're targeting as your audience. For a strictly personal bio, you can include details such as hobbies, personal beliefs, and mottos. For a bio that falls somewhere between ""professional"" and ""completely personal,"" consider sharing details that give a sense of who you are but are not likely to alienate others.

, Like a professional bio, your personal bio should give your reader a clear idea of who you are, what you do, and how well you do it. However, you can be more informal in your tone than you would in a professional bio.


Joann Smith is a passionate knitter who also happens to own and run her own paper supply company. She has been in business for over 25 years and has won multiple awards for business innovation (although never any for knitting). In her copious free time, she enjoys wine tastings, whiskey tastings, beer tastings, and wine tastings.

, These words are so overused that they have ceased to mean anything to most people, and they're too general to convey real meaning: ""innovative,"" ""expert,"" ""creative,"" etc. Show through concrete examples, don't just tell.

, A personal bio is a great place to connect with your audience through the use of humor. This can help break the ice between you and your reader, and convey a sense of who you are in a few short words.


Hillary Clinton's Twitter bio is an excellent example of a very short bio that conveys a lot of information in a humorous tone: ""Wife, mom, lawyer, women & kids advocate, FLOAR, FLOTUS, US Senator, SecState, author, dog owner, hair icon, pantsuit aficionado, glass ceiling cracker, TBD..."""

Determine how many parts you need to cast.,
Write a cast list.,
Find a location.,
Create a website for your play.,
Advertise.",How to Cast a Play1," Not only will you have to cast the major roles in the play but also chorus members, extras, understudies, dancers, and musicians. Count how many different actors you will need. Consider whether or not actors will play multiple roles., Sometimes, plays come with cast lists. Sometimes, you will have to draft your own. Each list should contain the necessary elements for each character. Important details include:



Age: You should try to cast actors who are in a similar age range to the role.

Gender: Some directors like to encourage people to play roles of a different gender. For example, Peter Pan is often played by a woman. Specify if this is the case in your list.Race: Try not to cast people with different types of races to play a character whose race is important to the storyline. For example, if you are producing a play about the Vietnam War, you should not have white actors play Vietnamese characters. On the other hand, some plays do not require actors of any particular race or ethnicity. You can cast a colorblind play, casting the best actor for the role regardless of race. For example, in a colorblind adaptation of Henry IV, you may have an African-American actor play the king because that actor performed the best audition. Whether you are looking for actors of a particular race or if you plan to cast a colorblind play, specify this upfront in your cast list.

Archetype: These are common role types that allow potential actors to determine if they are right for the role or not. Some common archetypes include the damsel in distress, the mob boss, the wise old sage, or the innocent., You will need a stage or open space to audition your cast. If you have a theater already available, you can use that space. You may also look for public venues that offer plenty of clear room. You want to be able to see, hear, and speak to each actor. You also want a separate room for people to wait in before they audition.Such places include churches, schools, community colleges, and amphitheaters. You will have to reserve these spaces in advance.

, You should have a website to refer people to so that they can get more information about the play. On this website, post a summary of the play, the cast list, and your dates of production. You should also list an email address so that actors can contact you with questions. You may want to create a special email address for the play instead of using your personal account., You want as many people as possible to know about your auditions. Create flyers to post around town. Post the cast list online, and ask actors to bring a photo and resume. State whether your play is a professional paid production or a volunteer community event. If it is a school or university play, take advantage of social media networks and drama organizations to recruit talent. Clearly note which play you are auditioning for so that actors can research their roles and prepare. Some good places to advertise include:


School bulletins boards

Take notes.,
Provide scripts to the actors.,
Request a song if casting a musical.,
Choreograph a short dance.,
Record actors.,
Collect a photo and a resume from each actor.",How to Cast a Play2," Throughout the auditions, you should be taking notes on each actor’s ability, expression, strengths, and weaknesses. This will help you remember how well each actor did, and it will make the decision process easier.

, Give each auditioning act an excerpt from the script. These should be no longer than three pages. They may request to audition for a certain role, or you may ask them to read a particular part. This will allow you see how well they fit with the character or role. You or another casting director should read the other roles in this excerpt so that the actor can respond to the lines naturally.You can also ask them to perform a prepared monologue from another play.
If you like a particular actor but are uncertain if they are right for the role, you can ask them to read a larger part of the play. You can also ask them to read a different role if you think they will be better suited for it.

, Musicals require all actors to be able to sing. You want to make sure that your leads are comfortable singing as well as speaking. Allow your actors to sing a prepared song. They may or may not bring their own music. Note the strength of their voice, their tune, their pitch, and how well they project their voice.

, Musicals also require dancing, especially from chorus roles. While lead actors may be able to get away with minimal dancing experience, they should be able to learn a simple dance fairly easily. If you can, gather your potential actors together. Teach them a short dance from the musical, and see how well they pick it up. While a few mistakes are acceptable, look for how well they keep in tune and move with the other dancers.

, If you have many actors coming to audition, you may also decide to record them. This will help you reflect later how well they acted. It will also allow you to compare two or more actors easily. Be sure to ask the actor’s permission before you start the camera., It is standard practice for actors to carry with them a photograph and resume to auditions. Before each audition, take these from the actor. This will help you remember individual actors from a large pool of potential players.If it helps, you can also make notes on each actor on their resume.

"
"
Consider how well they acted.,
Watch how they recover from mistakes.,
Factor in all of the needs of the role.,
Cast and rehearse more people than you need.,
Call back actors you liked.",How to Cast a Play3," You want players who acted the role with emotion, expression, and engagement, not just those who read off the script. Good actors should be able to clearly enunciate their words, express emotions with their face and body, and convey the motivations of their characters. They should speak naturally, if a bit slowly, and they should not over-emphasize their words or actions., There is no such thing as a perfect actor. If a potential actor makes a mistake during the audition, note how they react. If they keep going without stopping, it is a sign that they are a professional. You may still want to cast them. If they become flustered, apologize, or ask to start over, it may be a sign that they will not be able to gracefully recover in front of an audience., Some roles require not just a good voice but strong facial expressions, musical talent, dancing, or stunt work. For example, if an actor can sing but not act, they may not be right for a lead role.

, People without lead roles tend to drop out. Be sure to cast enough understudies for each role. Some understudies can fill in for multiple minor roles.

, If you had a few potential actors for a role, you can call them back for a second audition. Once you have decided who gets the part, you can call them to let them know or you can post the list in a public place (such as a school bulletin board or outside the community theater).

Advertise your show and sell tickets.,
Sit back and enjoy the show!",How to Organize a Dramatic Play," You may already have a play chosen for you, but if not, pick something you feel would work well with the people you will be working with. For example, a school play cannot have adult themes, and school children need to be able to understand and convincingly act it.;
, This will involve interested people coming in and reading a few lines of the script in front of you. Choose the people who fit best in the roles of the play. For example, having an old, frail lady cast as an energetic young boy will not work.
, A read-through involves the entire cast being present and reading the play aloud. This lets the entire cast familiarize themselves with the play, and ask questions about anything they are confused or concerned about. The actors have to learn their lines within a limited time, usually a couple of weeks.

, Give a copy of the rehearsal schedule to the entire cast. If possible, rehearse in the space you know the play will be performed in, so the actors can familiarize themselves with where they'll be acting. If the play chosen is a musical, you will need to organize additional rehearsals for singing and dancing practice.

, Choose costumes that fit the character and time period the play is set in. For example, an aristocrat from the Victorian era would not be wearing 70's disco pants. It is also important to do this for the set - a Medieval princess would be in a castle, not a modern hairdressing salon, unless specifically stated otherwise. Some plays require a lot of set and others don't - if the set needed isn't specified in the script, read through the play for cues about what set is needed. For example, if you notice at one point a character sits down and pours a cup of tea, you need a chair, a teapot, a tea cup, and a table to put the teapot on.

, This can involve putting up posters, advertising online, and using your community newsletter, among other methods. You can choose to charge for tickets, or let people in free of charge, but make sure you state which one you're advertising, and whether people can buy tickets in advance or whether tickets will only be sold at the show.

, Do not make unsolicited submissions of your project to companies. Ask for referrals, or direct permission to submit your project to production companies.

, This is the most common route to working as a TV Writer. You can find job listings within the industry online.

, If you're serious, get professional help. Google 'professional TV advisors' and get the experts to assess your work, steer you to the right production companies and make the right introductions, otherwise you'll spend a lifetime 'door-knocking'!,"

Read the script.,
Cross out stage directions for plays.,
Look up unfamiliar words and concepts.,
Write down your questions.,
Read the script again.",How to Annotate a Script1," Before you start marking up your script, it is a good idea to read through it once and just get a basic understanding of the story. You can read with a pencil in hand and make some general notes in the margins if you like.


For example, you can mark lines that are confusing, surprising, important, or just interesting.You can also look for scenes or lines that are repeated or that seem to connect to other scenes or lines.;
, If you are acting in a stage production, then it is a good idea to put an X through any stage directions included in your script. The director of the production you are working on will probably design his or her own stage directions, so you will probably not need these.If you want to be sure, you can always ask the director if he or she will be following the scripted stage directions before you cross them out.

, There may be times when a word or concept in a script is unfamiliar to you. If this happens, make sure that you look it up. It is important to be fully aware of what your character’s lines mean.You can define unfamiliar words or concepts in the margins of your script or keep a log of them in a journal.
You might have to look up lots of words and concepts if you are working with an old script, such as a play by Shakespeare.

, You may not be able to figure out everything on your own. As you read your script, another way to annotate it is to write down your questions. Then, you can bring up these questions during rehearsal.For example, if you encounter an unfamiliar concept and you don’t quite understand what it means after looking it up and reading about it, then you could include a question about it.

, It is important to read the script multiple times to gain a good understanding of it and to do a thorough annotation. Make sure that you give yourself plenty of time to read through the script at least twice before you start memorizing your lines.

Identify beats with two slashes (//).,
Note intention.,
Clarify action in parentheses.,
Consider subtext.,
Emphasize important words and phrases.",How to Annotate a Script2," A beat in a script is when something shifts, either in the script’s tone or in a character’s development. Identifying beats can help you to see when you need to alter the way that you deliver your lines from one sentence to the next.Mark beats with two slashes (//) to help you identify these crucial moments in your script.


For example, you might identify a beat in the following lines: “John, I love you. // Don’t you love me?’’ In this situation, the character speaking the lines might be going from feeling love and affection, to being afraid that John does not feel the same way about her.

, It is important for actors to get inside of their characters’ heads and figure out what makes them tick. Intention is what is driving a character’s actions and words. Write your character’s intention for a scene at the top of the page where the scene begins.For example, the intention might be “I want to get him to admit that he loves me.” Or, “I want to convince my friend that he should not seek revenge.”

, Through rehearsals and becoming more familiar with your character, you will start to develop actions to go along with your lines and other character’s lines as well. Writing these actions in the margins can help you to link them with the lines.For example, you might decide that your character would reach out and grab John’s arm while your character asks him, “Don’t you love me?” Or, you might decide that your character would be clenching his fists and shaking while another character is yelling at him.

, Subtext is what your character is thinking and this might be quite different from what your character actually says. Noting your character’s subtext can help you to decide how to deliver certain lines.For example, if your character says, “Of course, I love you,” but the subtext is that he is in love with someone else, then you might say the line in a somber way or say the line while looking in the other person’s direction.

, As you read through a script, make sure that you underline any important words or phrases that you think you will need to emphasize. These words and phrases may seem insignificant to a casual reader, but you may identify them as important based on what you know about your character.For example, in the line, “Of course, I love you,” you might decide to place the emphasis on “love” or “of course.” Delivering the line with emphasis on “love” might make it seem like the character is being defiant while delivering it with emphasis on “of course” could make it seem like the character is being sincere.
Experiment with different types of emphasis to figure out what best expresses your character’s intention and subtext.

Learn abbreviations to note your stage locations.,
Note when to enter and exit the stage.,
Identify when to cross the stage.,
Use abbreviations for other actions and positioning.",How to Annotate a Script3," Annotating your script with your director's blocking instructions can make it easier to remember where you are supposed to be and what you are supposed to be doing during the performance. Some common abbreviations for blocking include:CS = Center Stage
OS = Off Stage
DC= Down Center
UC = Up Center
SR = Stage Right
DS = Downstage
SL = Stage Left
US = Upstage

, Knowing when and where to enter and exit the stage is important. Your character might need to enter before her lines begin or exit a while after he or she has finished speaking. Note when to enter and exit the stage in the margins of your script by using abbreviations.


ENT or Ntr = enter
EXT or Xit = exitYou can combine the abbreviations for entering and exiting the stage with other abbreviations to help you remember where to enter and exit. For example, you could indicate that you need to exist stage left by writing EXTSL in the margins of your script, or indicate that you need to enter stage right by writing NtrSR.

, Knowing when to move to a different part of the stage is also important. You can mark these instructions in the margins of your script using abbreviations as well.X = cross
You can combine the cross abbreviation with others to identify where to cross to in a scene. For example, you might write XSL to indicate that you need to cross to stage left, or XCS to indicate that you need to cross to center stage.

, Your character might have to do other things, such as sitting, standing, kneeling, or picking up an object. You can abbreviate these actions in the margins of your script as well. Some abbreviations you might use to indicate different actions might include:


KN = kneelSD = sit down
SU = stand up
LD = lay down
PU = pick up
PD = put down

Use a pencil.,
Review your annotations.,
Ask questions.",How to Annotate a Script4," When you annotate a script, it is a good idea to use a pencil rather than a pen. This is because you may develop new ideas as you familiarize yourself with the character and story. Using a pencil makes it easy to erase a note if you change your mind about it and write in a new one., After you have finished annotating your text, make sure that you review your annotations. Take time to read through all of them and make changes or additions to your annotations if you have developed new ideas about something.


You can use what you have written to help guide your actions, tone, and gestures during rehearsals. For example, your notes on your character’s intention can help you to decide how to stand, how your face should look, and what tone to use when delivering your lines.

, Your director and fellow actors can help you if you have unanswered questions or if you are struggling with something within the script. Bring up any unanswered questions that you have during rehearsals and listen to what your director and fellow actors have to say.


By collaborating with others, you may gain an even deeper understanding of your character and use this knowledge to improve your performance.

Surround yourself with people you trust.",How to Break Into Hollywood As a Writer," The most important key to being a successful writer is being a good writer. Your skill as a writer is like a muscle—the more you exercise it the stronger it will become. Whether you’re working on a full-length feature film or a short scene for TV, try to write something every day.;
, You may be determined to finish your full-length feature, but that shouldn’t stop you from working on other projects. Besides, if you find yourself at a dead end on a script, you may find it refreshing to write something completely different for a while. Not to mention, it’s a good idea to be able to discuss several projects if you happen to meet a producer or director—or someone who knows one.

, Research what kinds of scripts are being bought by production companies. Zombie films? Murder mystery TV shows? Read Hollywood Reporter or Variety to get a good idea. You want to stay true to what you know, but don’t be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and write scripts that people are currently interested in.


At the same time, think outside the box of what is currently popular. It may be refreshing for a producer to come across an engaging and original script that goes against the grain of what they're used to seeing.

, All writers face the dreaded “writers block” at some point. If you’re feeling burnt out on whatever you’re working on, or you just can’t figure out what should happen next in a story, take a break. Go for a jog, take a nap, or meet up with friends. Turning your brain off for a while may actually help you find the inspiration you’re looking for. , It’s never a bad idea to have multiple sets of eyes on your work. If you know people who are good writers themselves, or people who simply have a mind for great ideas, ask them to read your scripts. Tell them to be honest about what they think, and take their suggestions seriously.


Consider taking on a writing partner. You and your partner can either work on the same script and exchange ideas, or work on different scripts and regularly get feedback from one another.
Alternatively, you can join a writers group, which will allow other people to comment on your work and, if you struggle to find motivation, creates deadlines for you.

, When you aren’t writing, read scripts. Watch films and TV shows. Pay attention to structure, style, and dialogue. The best way to improve as a writer, aside from writing every day, is observing what good writers are doing and how they are doing it. , If you think your script is ready, send query letters to production companies and directors asking for permission to send them your script. Your main goal is to promote yourself and your work. Your query letter should address the appropriate person (instead of “to whom it may concern”) and should include the following:


A one sentence logline that describes what your story is about.
A plot synopsis (up to a paragraph) that describes your story in further detail, including characters, their journeys, and what’s at stake. You should convey what is unique about your script and why the company needs it.
A short biography. Let your reader know what experience you have in the film industry. It’s okay to brag a little here. Be specific and tell them about awards you have won and what you have achieved. If you don’t have any experience, you may want to explain your background and why you are interested in the film industry. , Your story may be good. It may be great. Still, only around two percent of scripts make it past the first desk. If yours is rejected, or you never receive a response, don’t be discouraged. Keep sending your script out. Alternatively, you may consider making some improvements to your script that might get it accepted.

, Los Angeles is still where most of the action is. However, cities like Atlanta, New York, Chicago, and Austin boast lively film scenes and are home to many production companies. If you see screenwriting as a future career and not just a hobby, you should be prepared to relocate for that career. Living in L.A. or cities like it will make you available for meetings with producers or agents, and they will be more likely to take you seriously if you’re local. , Whether you’re at your job or at your local coffee shop, talk to people. Depending on who you meet, you may find they work in the film industry, or perhaps they know someone in the film industry. Be ready to give them your contact information—or better yet, a business card—and keep a notebook of people and their titles. Making it in Hollywood isn’t always about who you know, but knowing important people certainly doesn’t hurt. You could end up selling your script simply because you met the right person.

, Any job. Even if your job is to go on coffee runs for the cast and crew, you are making yourself known. Whatever job you end up with, be good at it. Higher-ups will notice and appreciate you, and you may get an opportunity to pitch your story. If that happens, be prepared to send it immediately—producers may not remember you a few months down the road. , If you finally catch a break and a producer is interested in your script, they may want you to make some changes. Successful producers are successful for a reason: they know what sells and what makes a great film. Even if you think your script is perfect, be prepared to swallow your pride and edit your script. , You don’t want to lose the opportunity to sell your work by never compromising. However, you should feel allowed to defend parts your script every now and then. You could convince the producer to change his or her mind, and they may be impressed by your inclination to stick to your guns.

, If you get a meeting with a producer, arrive on time. Dress as you would for a job interview, and speak clearly and confidently.

, Stay in regular contact with friends and family who have your best interests in mind. Unfortunately, you may run into agents and producers who only see the value in your script, not you. Once you’re in the process of selling a script, ask the people you trust if they believe you’re making the best decisions.

Read the screenplay out loud.",How to Write a Screenplay," Unlike a short story or a novel, the form of a screenplay is based around dialogue, rather than prose or description. The big rule in screenwriting is: you are writing visually. Movies are a series of images, so the images in your screenplay should be striking and engaging.Another big rule is: Every paragraph of action lines should be three lines or less. This means that the descriptions about what each character is wearing or how they are acting in a scene should be no more than three lines. Use the least amount of words possible describing action or setting and let the dialogue do the ""talking.""Character backstory and motivations should come from a character’s actions and dialogue, as opposed to the descriptions. The best screenwriters keep their action description to two lines per paragraph throughout most of the script. But there should still be a lot of description through the power of the dialogue.
Keep all writing in the present tense. This keeps things moving forward in your screenplay, which is really what your screenplay should be doing: moving action and character forward.
Like everything, there are exceptions to this rule of three description lines or less per scene of text. For example, the screenplay for the 2011 film “All is Lost”, written by J.C. Candor and starring Robert Redford, only has about 4-5 full pages of dialogue in the entire script. The majority of the main character’s actions are shown through long sections of description of the character’s actions.These types of screenplays are rare though, and difficult to do well.;
, Screenplays are formatted differently than other types of writing. The format of a screenplay is very specific and can involve a lot of tabbing and hitting Enter if you are working in a word processing document. You can use software that does the formatting for you, such as Final Draft, Scrivener, and Movie Magic.You can also access basic versions of screenplay formatting programs for free online.Take note of elements of a screenplay format, including:The slugline: This appears in ALL CAPS at the beginning of a scene and briefly describes the location and time of day. For example: INT. DINER - NIGHT. Sometimes sluglines are abbreviated to something as simple as “LATER” or “BEDROOM”.

INT/EXT: INT stands for an interior of a setting, such as an INT HOUSE, and EXT stands for the exterior or outside of a setting, such as EXT HOUSE.

Transitions: These help you move from scene to scene in the screenplay. Examples of transitions include FADE IN and FADE OUT, which are a gradually opening and a gradually closing to a new scene, and CUT TO, which is a quick jump to a new scene. You can also use DISSOLVE TO, as one scene fades out, a new scene fades into place.

CLOSE UP or TIGHT ON: This indicates a close up to a person or object on screen. For example: “CLOSE UP on Mia’s face.”

FREEZE FRAME: This is when the picture will stop moving and become a still photograph on screen.

b.g.: Stands for “background” to note when something is occurring in the background of the main action. You can use “b.g.” or “background” to note this in the script. For example: “Two characters are fighting in the b.g.”

O.S. or O.C.: Stands for off-screen or off-camera. This means the character’s voice will be speaking off camera or from another part of the setting. For example: “Harry yells at Sally O.S.”

V.O.: stands for voice over, which is when an actor reads script over a scene, narrating the scene. This appears under the character’s name, before their voice over dialogue.
Montage: A series of images showing a theme, a contradiction, or the passage of time. Usually used to show the passage of time in a short period of time on screen.

Tracking shot: A tracking shot means a camera follows a person or an object. As long as the camera isn’t locked down in place on a tripod and is following a subject, it is a tracking shot.

, There are several screenplays that are considered nearly perfect, such as the screenplay for the 1942 classic “Casablanca”. Other screenplay examples illustrate the different ways you can play around with the form. For example:


“His Girl Friday”, a screenplay written by Charles Lederer.“Pulp Fiction”, a screenplay written by Quentin Tarantino.“When Harry Met Sally”, a screenplay written by Nora Ephron.“Thelma & Louise”, a screenplay written by Callie Khouri., The title cards display the setting of the scene, sometimes with specific or general timestamps.


In “Thelma & Louise”, the first scene has the slugline: INT. RESTAURANT- MORNING (PRESENT DAY).In “When Harry Met Sally”, the first scene has a slugline that does not refer to a specific place or setting: “DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE”. This indicates the film is going to begin with documentary footage rather than a specific setting., These elements should be done in the least amount of words, but with lots of detail.


In “Thelma & Louise”, we are given an introductory paragraph about Louise:LOUISE is a waitress in a coffee shop. She is in her early-thirties, but too old to be doing this. She is very pretty and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her shift. She is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus tray underneath the counter. It is making a lot of RACKET, which she is oblivious to. There is COUNTRY MUZAK in the b.g., which she hums along with.


The screenwriter provides a clear sense of who Louise is through her profession (“waitress in coffee shop”), her clothing and appearance (“early-thirties, but too old to be doing this,” “pretty, meticulously groomed”) and her actions (“slamming dirty coffee cups,” “oblivious” to the racket). The inclusion of sounds (which also appear in all caps in scripts) like country muzak, also paints a clear setting with very few words.
In “Pulp Fiction”, we are given an introductory paragraph about the setting:A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching on bacon and eating eggs.
Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're going out of style.
It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or how old she is; everything she does contradicts something she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is to be said in a rapid pace ""HIS GIRL FRIDAY"" fashion.


Tarantino gives us basic details about how many people are in the setting (“healthy number of people”, young man and young woman), and he provides specific but short descriptions of both characters. He also references “His Girl Friday”, a 1940s film famous for its rapid fire dialogue. All of these details create a basic sense of description and character which is then fleshed out through the dialogue.

, Most screenplays are dialogue-heavy for a reason. Dialogue is the main tool a screenwriter has for telling the story in a film. Note how a certain character uses language in their dialogue.


For example, Tarantino has Jules in “Pulp Fiction” use slang like “Whaddya mean?” instead of “What do you mean?” and inserts swear words in Jules’ dialogue. This helps to create Jules’ overall character and personality.In “Thelma & Louise”, Louise’s character uses “Jesus Christ” and “for God’s sake” throughout her dialogue. This contrasts Thelma’s dialogue, which is more prim and proper. By doing this, the screenwriter Khouri makes both characters distinct from each other and shows the audience how each character thinks and acts through her dialogue., Visual cues are small notes of description that appear before dialogue is spoken. These notes will appear in parentheses before the character’s dialogue.


For example, in “When Harry Met Sally”, Ephron notes “(makes a buzzer sound)” before a line of dialogue from Harry. This is a small note but it makes it clear that Harry has a certain sense of humor and way of speaking as a character.This can also be done with only one word of description between dialogue. In “Pulp Fiction”, Tarantino notes that a waitress is “(snotty)” as she says something to one of the characters. This gives the waitress’ lines a certain attitude and provides context for her dialogue.Only provide visual cues when necessary. Don’t depend on visual cues to tell the story for you. The dialogue and actions of the characters should be able to tell the story effectively, without visual cues.

, Most screenplays will move from scene to scene with a note “CUT TO:” which indicates there will be a cut from one scene to the next scene. Cutting to a scene should only be done when you are moving to a new scene or image, such as in “Pulp Fiction”, where Tarantino has two characters talking in a car and then the same two characters opening the trunk of a car.You may also see the note: “FADE IN” or “FADE OUT”. Fade ins are usually done at the beginning of a film, such as in “When Harry Met Sally” and ending of a film, which is known as a “fade out”. Fade ins provide a gentle opening to a scene that gives the viewer time to get settled into the scene.

, Notice how the screenwriter uses a specific shot note to create a certain image or moment of character. Most screenwriters only use shot notes when they feel it is absolutely necessary and the shot will best serve the story.


For example, in “Pulp Fiction” Tarantino opens a scene with a tracking note:EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING
Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.
We TRACK alongside.


This indicates the camera will be moving along with the hit men as they walk, creating a sense of movement on screen.

, One of the best ways to do this is to think about films or movie characters that you love and enjoyed watching on screen. Do you love a particular genre, such as romantic comedies, action films, horror? Consider writing a movie script in a genre you enjoy. It’s likely you know the most about a genre you are interested in and your passion will come through in your writing.You can also think about a childhood memory that has always haunted you as an adult or an adult experience you can’t stop thinking about.
You may be interested in a specific time period, such as 50s downtown New York, or 70s California, and begin to generate story ideas that have characters interacting in a specific time period or setting.
Write about feelings and types of people you know and are passionate about. This will help you convey your story to others., Create a character's storyline that you feel you can write about for a total of about 300 pages and who will hold your and your audience's attention. Think about people you know, people you read about in newspapers, or people who catch your eye on the street or in the supermarket. Your hero or heroine may be tied to a theme, such as war, loneliness, or love. Or your hero or heroine may be a reaction against the stereotypes of a genre or theme, such as a lonely, lovesick witch or a caring, gentle gangster.Create a character profile for your main character. Character profiles are questionnaire style writing prompts that help writers get to know their characters better.The details you write in a character profile won’t all appear in your film script. But knowing as much as possible about your character will help you think of them as a real person. You can ask yourself: “What would my main character do in this scene? What would my main character say or respond to this?” And feel confident you have the answers that will move your script forward.

, A log line is a one-sentence summary of your story. They are usually used as a marketing tool, such as when a studio executive asks you to give her your best pitch. Your best pitch should be your log line. A log line can also help you focus your writing on the most important aspects of your story and keep your story on track. A log line generally contains three elements:A protagonist: This is your hero or heroine, the person your audience will root and cheer for, or at least feel for. You can have more than one hero or heroine, but each protagonist must be distinct and each have their own redeeming qualities. For example, in “Thelma & Louise”, the protagonists are Thelma and Louise, but both characters are given different goals, motivations, and perspectives in the script.

An antagonist: This is your anti-hero or heroine, the person acting against your protagonist. In “Thelma & Louise”, the antagonist is a man who tries to rape Thelma at a bar. However, the antagonist in the script becomes “the law”, as Thelma and Louise are on the run from shooting the man who tried to rape Thelma.

A goal: This is what will motivate and propel your protagonist forward in the story. What does your protagonist want? Thelma and Louise both want different things at the beginning of the script, but once the antagonist appears, both characters now want to stay out of jail. Both characters have a unified goal that propels them forward in the script.
A complete log line for “Thelma & Louise” might look like: “An Arkansas waitress and a housewife shoot a rapist and take off in a '66 Thunderbird.” Note that the log line does not use names of characters, but instead focuses on their personas or character type.

, In the screenwriting business, the treatment will give your studio executive an idea of whether the idea is worth their money. For a first draft of a script, a treatment can also be a helpful tool to frame your story and figure out a first sketch. Treatments are two to five page summaries that break the story into three acts:Title of the Film: The title of your film may change over time, but it’s a good idea to come up with a working title that summarizes your screenplay. The best titles are usually the most simple and to the point, such as: “When Harry Met Sally” or “Pulp Fiction”. The title should tell your reader or viewer about the script as a whole, but also leave them interested enough to keep reading or watching. Avoid long or cumbersome titles, such as those that have to use colons. While these may be common amongst big films (especially sequels), they can convey that your ideas aren't focused.

Log line: Take the log line you crafted in the previous step and place it at the beginning of your treatment.

Synopsis: Expand on your log line to include the names of characters, short details about their characters, and a basic idea of how they get from A to B in the story. For example, a synopsis for “Thelma & Louise” might be: “Meek housewife Thelma joins her friend Louise, a strong headed waitress, on a weekend fishing trip. But their trip becomes a run from the law when Louise shoots and kills a man who tries to rape Thelma at a bar. Louise decides to flee to Mexico, and Thelma joins her. On the way, Thelma falls for a sexy young thief named J.D. and a sympathetic detective tries to convince the two women to surrender before their fates are sealed.”
Treatments may also include snippets of dialogue and description. But the main focus of a treatment is to summarize the overall story.

, This is where you focus on the structure of the script. The script outline is a guideline for you to tell the story effectively. A feature length screenplay is made up of 50-70 scenes. Each scene should have a setting and something that happens to or happens as a result of the characters' actions. These 50-70 scenes should be essential to the story. Most full-length screenplays are 100-120 pages long, and are broken into three acts:Act 1 is about 30 pages long and introduces the setting, the characters and the inciting incident. The inciting incident, or the event that gets your protagonist moving, normally takes place about 10 to 15 pages into the script.
Act 2 is about 60 pages and is the main bulk or meat of the story. This is where your protagonist identifies her goal or purpose and encounters obstacles that work against her goal or purpose. Her problem or issue gets worse, or her goal becomes more difficult to achieve. There should be urgency and tension in Act 2 that continue to builds up.
Act 3 is often shorter than Act 1, and should be about 20-30 pages long. This is where you have the story’s climax, the last-ditch attempt by the protagonist to achieve her goal. This climax will also determine the end of the script. The dust settles and your heroine could ride off into the sunset, or get knocked down by her horse.
Keep in mind you don’t have to nail down exactly how many scenes your screenplay is going to have until after you have completed a first draft or flash draft of the script. But keep these numbers in the back of your mind as you write. You will likely have to trim and edit down your draft to create a more structured script based on three acts.

, A flash draft is your first attempt at the script, where you write quickly, don’t think too much about what you are writing, and avoid editing. Some screenwriters try to write flash drafts in one week, or several days. If you begin with a strong logline, a strong treatment, and a strong story outline, you should be able to pull off a strong flash draft.Focus on getting your ideas out when composing your flash draft. Stopping to agonize over word choice or proofread can hamper the composing process. Just brainstorm and write freely.

, Remember that you are writing for a visual medium. Focus on the things that can be seen or heard on screen and don't require things to be explained to the viewer.For example, in “Pulp Fiction”, Tarantino describes drug use in a series of quick close ups that show what is being seen and heard on screen.CLOSEUP – THE NEEDLE
Going into Vincent's vein.
CLOSEUP – BLOOD
Spurting back into the syringe, mixing with the heroin.
CLOSEUP – VINCENT'S THUMB
Pushing down on the plunger.


Tarantino doesn’t use a lot of vivid adjectives or descriptors, but the spacing on the page and descriptions that are used paint a vivid picture. When you use descriptions, make them specific and arresting, such as “spurting” rather than “moving” and a “vein” instead of an “arm”.
Don’t be afraid of white space on the page. Tarantino uses white space to show that each scene will hit the viewer quickly and with maximum impact. The audience will get to experience the sensation of drug use without having to go into long shots or take up too much screen time.

, About 95% of your dialogue should be short and to the point. The use of monologues in screenwriting is also important, and can be done well (such as Jules’ last monologue in “Pulp Fiction” or Harry’s monologue at the end of “When Harry Met Sally”). But the majority of your dialogue should be quick back and forth exchanges. Avoid prose-y speeches. Back and forth banter will keep things moving in your script.


For example, in the diner scene in “When Harry Met Sally”, Ephron uses dialogue to keep the scene moving and to reveal character:HARRY
So, how come you broke up with Sheldon?
SALLY
How do you know we broke up?
HARRY
Because if you didn’t, you wouldn’t be with me, you’d be with Sheldon the Wonder Schlong.
SALLY
First of all, I’m not with you. Second of all, its none of your business why we broke up.
HARRY
You’re right, you’re right. I don’t want to know.
SALLY
If you must know, it was because he was very jealous and I had these Days of the Week underpants.
HARRY
(makes a buzzer sound)
Judge’s ruling on this. Days of the Week underpants?
SALLY
Yes. They had the days of the week on them, I thought they were sort of funny--and one day he said to me, you never wear Sunday. He got all suspicious. Where was Sunday? Where had I left Sunday? And I told him, but he didn’t believe me.
HARRY
What?
SALLY
They don’t make Sunday.



, Your characters are all living, breathing individuals, so make their dialogue correspond to their upbringing, their background, and their perspective on life. A young man who grew up in the Bronx, for example, likely will not have the speech patterns and slang as an older woman who grew up in 1960s England. Dialogue should feel like things that real people would say in their location of the world during their living time period.Its especially important to make your characters’ dialogue different if you have more than one character speaking in a scene (which most good screenplays will have). In “Thelma & Louise”, Khouri gives each character distinct speech patterns and slang to illustrate their different views and thoughts when they are both in the same scene.
Leave the obvious dialogue out. Dialogue should always be about doing more than one thing at a time. Dialogue that only tells the reader some backstory about a character or only functions to answer a character’s question is not doing enough on the page. The diner dialogue in “When Harry Met Sally” is not simply a way for the characters to make conversation. Instead, the story Sally tells Harry illustrates her perspective on relationships and on her own ideas about intimacy and honesty.
If you are going to use monologues in your script, only use one or two in the entire script and make them count. They should be brilliant and necessary for the development of your story and/or the development of your characters.
It can be tempting to make your characters sound ""fancy"" by using archaic language, especially when you're writing a period film or historical piece. So, remember that your characters still need to sound like real people to modern viewers. Don't get so wrapped up in stuffy language that your characters aren't engaging.

, Avoid the temptation to ramble on in descriptions of your characters or of a setting or scene. Screenwriting is less about the beautiful details and more about ending a scene early to give the viewer a reason to keep watching. A good trick is to cut out the first sentence and the last sentence of a scene. If the scene still stands without both sentences, leave them out.For example, in “Pulp Fiction”, Tarantino ends many scenes right at a pivotal moment, such as two hit men killing a target or a fighter knocking someone out. He then cuts from the pivotal moment directly to a new scene. This keeps the action of the story moving and the viewer engaged.

, One of the big draws of film writing is that you can show big events and images in a large format, also known as “set pieces”. Set pieces are usually high impact sequences that are captivating and in the case of most action films, grandiose. But even in a film about two people talking to each other in different settings (“When Harry Met Sally”) or about two women on the run (“Thelma & Louise”), there should always be big stakes and big goals for the characters.Harry and Sally are both looking for love and companionship, and after a decade of friendship, realize they have found it in each other. So the stakes are high because their friendship may end if their romantic relationship doesn’t work out and the goals are high because they are both after a universal goal: love.
Thelma and Louise also both have high stakes and goals. A series of events in the film push both characters into a situation where they could both end up in jail, which is high stakes. So their big goal is to elude the law and somehow, get out of their situation with their freedom intact.

, It all comes back to the three-act structure. Your screenplay, no matter how unique or interesting the subject matter is, should be able to fit into three acts. There should be an Act 1 with an inciting incident, an Act 2 with the protagonist’s goal and rising action or obstacles that get in the way of their goal, and an Act 3 with a climax and an ending.

, Your screenplay has now gone through at least one draft, or several drafts. But before you can read it to others or send it out to interested studio executives, you need to check that the script is formatted properly.Check that your script begins with a “Fade in”, a title card, and a description of setting.
Confirm your script contains with lines of description of each character, especially if this is the first time that character appears in the script.
Note that all character names appear in caps and all sounds appear in caps.
Confirm all visual cues are in parenthesis.
Check for transitions, such as “Cut to”, “Fade to”, or “Dissolve to” between scenes.
Confirm there are notes at the bottom of the page that say (MORE) or (CONTINUED) if the page breaks in the middle of dialogue or a scene.
Check for page numbers, top right, on each page.

, In the movie business, once you’ve sold the script, this read-through may occur in a round table with the actors and actresses who have signed on to play your characters.Even if you haven’t sold your script to your dream studio yet, it’s still important to have a read-through of the screenplay. Ask a few friends to play different characters in a scene. Note how the dialogue is working to propel the story forward and how the scene transitions are working. Listen to how your characters speak and ask yourself if the screenplay would work well on the big screen.

Consider the news value of your idea.,
Call in a news tip.,
Tweet a news tip.,
Send CNN a text message.,
Send in a program idea.",How to Contact CNN3," CNN will probably not consider your tip or idea unless it is something newsworthy and that they have not yet reported on. Make sure they haven’t covered the idea already in a news report and also consider whether or not it has news value.


Journalists generally consider news value to be topics that have at least some of the following: Conflict, unusualness, prominence, humor, impact (significance), proximity, human interest, and timeliness.Conflict can be clashes of ideologies and ideas, not just physical altercations. Human interest means the story provokes an emotional response in the viewer. Impact means the story has a direct effect on a large portion of the viewing audience (think a snow storm closing down large swaths of the east coast.)
Prominence means the story relates to a person or thing that most people know. Unusualness is a deviation from the norm. Proximity means there is a local tie in. Proximity is less important to CNN than most news stations because CNN covers the entire world (however a U.S. bureau may favor U.S. news, and so forth). Timeliness means the idea involves something ongoing or recent or at least that we didn’t know before. Humor is something that viewers will find funny or unusual. News isn’t always serious.

, CNN accepts news tips and story ideas from the general public as well. CNN is interested in images or information relating to breaking news. If you know about something you think CNN will want to cover, then give a call and leave a message about your tip or idea.


Call 404-827-1500 and select option 1 to leave a news tip or story idea by phone. Keep in mind that you can only leave a recording. You will not be able to speak with an actual person.After you select option one, you will have the opportunity to leave a recorded message with your news tip. Make sure that you include your name, your news tip or idea, and a phone number where someone can reach you if they would like more information. Speak clearly and keep your message short and to the point.
For example, you might try saying something like, “Hello. My name is Sally Jones and I have an idea for a story. I think you should do a report about the environmental impact of the new factory in my hometown of Smithshire, NY. It is having a negative effect on the water quality, but people are not yet aware of this. Please call me back at 555-555-5555. My name is Sally Jones and my number again is 555-555-5555.”

, You can also tweet your news tip or idea to CNN if you prefer. Tweet the idea to @TeamCNN along with any relevant pictures or links that might provide information and/or generate interest.For example, you might twee something like, “@TeamCNN Please report on the water pollution problem in Smithshire, NY! People are getting sick and someone needs to stand up for them!”

, If you want to send a news tip to CNN via text message, simply text the word CNN, put a space, and then include your news tip. Text it to 55333.


If you want CNN to call you back, include your cell phone number in the message. Message and data rates may apply.To submit a news tip to CNN Headline News, text CNN space and your tip to 772937.
Try sending a text that says something like, “CNN Smithshire, NY has a serious water pollution problem. Please cover this problem in a report. Call back Sally Jones at 555-555-5555 for more information.”

, Maybe your idea is broader than a single story and you have an idea for CNN to make an entire new program. How do you tell the channel this?


You can email the idea to: Public.Information@turner.com.In the email, make sure that you include a brief summary of the idea, your name, and your preferred contact information, such as a phone number if you want to be contacted by phone.

Understand what a script is.,
Read the scripts of some of your favorite movies.,
Flesh out your concept.",How to Write Movie Scripts2," The script, or screenplay, outlines all of the elements (audio, visual, behavior, and dialogue) that are required to tell a story through movies or TV.


A script is almost never the work of a single person. Instead, it will go through revisions and rewrites, and ultimately will be interpreted by the producers, directors, and actors.
Movies and TV are visual mediums. This means that you will need to write your script in a way that encompasses the visual and auditory aspects of the story. Focus on writing pictures and sounds.

, Find movie scripts online and decide what you like (and don’t like) about them. Get a feel for how the action is portrayed, dialogue is written, and characters are developed.

, Assuming you already have an idea you want to write about, sketch out all the necessary plot details, relationships, and personality traits that will guide your story. Which elements are the most integral to your concept? How do your characters interact and why? What’s your larger point? Are there any plot holes? Write notes addressing these points in any format you see fit.

Outline your story.,
Write your story in three acts.,
Add sequences.,
Start writing scenes.,
Begin writing dialogue.,
Cut away the dead weight.,
Show your finished work to a few friends.,
Revise your work as many times as necessary.",How to Write Movie Scripts3," Begin with a basic flow of your narrative. Focus on the conflict of the story; conflict drives drama.


Keep length in mind. When in script format, each page is roughly one minute of screen time. The average length of a two hour script is 120 pages. Dramas should be around the 2 hour mark, comedies should be shorter, around one and a half hours.
Also keep in mind that unless the writer is already known, has connections, or is extremely bankable, a long screenplay doesn’t have a realistic chance of getting picked up. If the story you need to tell can’t be condensed into less than two hours of screen time, you might be better off turning it into a novel.

, The pillars of a screenplay are the Three Acts. Each act can operate independently, and when taken together provide the full arc of a story.


Act One: This is the set-up for the story. Introduce the world and the characters. Set the tone of the story (comedy, action, romance, etc.). Introduce your protagonist, and begin exploring the conflict that will drive the story. Once the protagonist is set towards the objective, then Act Two begins. For dramas, Act One is typically 30 pages. For comedies, 24 pages.
Act Two: This act is the main portion of the story. The protagonist will encounter obstacles on the path to the resolution of the conflict. Subplots are typically introduced in the second act. Throughout the second act, the protagonist should be showing signs of change. For dramas, Act Two is typically 60 pages. For comedies, 48 pages.
Act Three: In the third act, the story reaches its resolution. The third act contains the twist of the story, and ends with the final confrontation of the objective. Because the story has already been established in the second act, the third act is much faster-paced and condensed. For dramas, Act Three is typically 30 pages. For comedies, 24 pages.

, Sequences are parts of the story that operate somewhat independently from the main conflict. They have a beginning, middle, and end. A typical sequence will be about 10 to 15 pages in length. A sequence tends to focus on a specific character.


Sequences operate with a separate tension from the main story, and often affect how the main story will play out.

, Scenes are the events of your movie. They take place in specific locations and always serve to drive story forward. If a scene does not do this, then it should be cut from the script. Scenes that serve no purpose will stick out in the audience’s mind as flaws, and will drag the story down.

, Once you have scenes, you will have characters interacting. Dialogue can be one of the hardest things to write. Each character needs to have its own distinct, believable voice.


Realistic dialogue is not necessarily good dialogue. Dialogue should be focused on moving the story forward and developing characters. You should not worry about trying to capture reality with dialogue, because in reality conversations are often dull and lifeless.
Read your dialogue aloud. Does it sound halting, stereotyped, or over-the-top? Do all of your characters talk the same way?

, Now that all your ideas are on paper, look for weak links, distractions, or anything that drags. Does the story ever get sidetracked? Are there unnecessary details or repetitions? Do you give your audience enough credit? If it over-explains or doesn’t move your story forward, cut it.

, Choose people with different tastes and backgrounds to get a variety of opinions. Be sure to ask for the cold, hard truth; you want constructive criticism, not flattery or lies.

, This may be painful at first, but when all is said and done, you’ll be glad you took the time to properly convey your vision.

Set your page size.,
Set your font.,
Format your script elements.",How to Write Movie Scripts4," Screenplays are written on 8 ½” x 11” paper, typically 3-hole punched. Top and bottom margins are set between .5” and 1”. The left margin is set to 1.2”-1.6” and the right margin is set between .5” and 1”.


Page numbers go in the top right corner. The title page does not get numbered.

, Screenplays are written in Courier 12 point font. This is mainly because of timing. One script page in Courier 12 is roughly one minute of screen time.

, There are several different parts of the script that require specific formatting so that they conform to industry standards:



Scene Heading: This is also called a “slug line.” It sets the stage for the reader by describing the location. The scene heading is written in all caps. First, denote whether it is an interior or exterior scene by writing “INT.” or “EXT.” Then, follow that with the location, then the time of day. Never end a page with a scene heading, push it down to the next page.

Action: This is the descriptive text of the screenplay. Write in the present tense and an active voice. Keep the paragraphs short to hold the reader’s attention. A good paragraph size is 3-5 lines.

Character Name: Before dialogue starts, the character speaking is typed out in all caps and indented 3.5” from the left margin. The name can either be the character’s actual name, a description if the character is not named in the movie, or by occupation. If the character is speaking off screen, then “(O.S.)” is written next to the character name. If the character is narrating, “(V.O.)” for voice-over is written next to the name.

Dialogue: When a character is speaking, the dialogue is indented 2.5” from the left margin, and between 2-2.5” from the right. The dialogue goes directly beneath the character’s name.

You can Find the correct editor’s email address on www.igaffluentresearch.com .Smaller magazines typically have only a single editor, while larger magazines with multiple departments typically have an editor for each department.,
Introduce yourself.,
Submit a proposal.,
Follow up in 1 to 2 weeks.",How to Contact a Magazine Editor1," Addressing your correspondence to the right editor, by name, will get you faster responses to your queries and establish you as a professional.


If you’re having a difficult time locating an editor for a particular department or topic, try contacting the managing editor or the articles editor. They would be the best resource at pointing you in the correct direction.Another option for tracking down an email address of an editor is to look it up on the magazine’s website. There should be a submissions page or a contact page that should provide the useful information.;
, If the magazine doesn’t accept unsolicited queries or pitches, send the editor a short email introducing yourself and summarizing your story idea in 1 to 2 sentences.


A brief introduction of yourself can sound like this: “Good afternoon, Mr. Jones. My name is Jane Doe and I am a freelance writer who is interested in writing an article for your magazine. I am currently working on a story about the consequences of fracking on small towns. Would you be interested in this story being published with Readers Digest?”

, Your email should be equivalent to 1 to 1 ½ pages and should be in the body of your email, not as an attachment.The first paragraph should feature either a short summary of your article or an excerpt that communicates what the story is about. This paragraph should be written in a compelling style, one that grabs the attention of the reader.The second paragraph should give the main reason why the magazine would want to feature your story and why its readers would care about the story to be covered in your article.The third paragraph should give a secondary reason to care about the story. If there is only 1 reason, omit this paragraph, as this may seem redundant and unnecessary.The fourth paragraph should tell the editor how you plan to cover the story: whom you'll interview, where you'll visit, and other sources that show you have researched and are prepared to write your story. Be succinct, but specific.The fifth paragraph should tell the editor why you're writing the piece and how the magazine's readers will benefit from reading it.Additionally, it may be helpful to end your pitch with a short biography of yourself, a list of other publications you have done for other magazines, as it relates to your current pitch. Inform them that you are willing to send clips or videos upon request., You should not expect an immediate response to your query, but if you don't hear anything within 1 to 2 weeks, send a short follow-up email to remind the editor. Don't repeat the entire pitch, but do ask if the editor has had a chance to read it."
"
Make the call.,
Be brief but thorough.,
Submit the proposal.",How to Contact a Magazine Editor2," Call the editor and pitch your idea or story and inquire whether they would be interested in your subject..


An example of a phone call: “Hello Mr. Jones. How are you? My name is Jane Doe and I’m calling you to let you know I am currently considering doing a story about the consequences of fracking on small towns. If I can gather up enough citizens of Smallville, USA to interview, would you be interested in this article for your magazine?”
It would be helpful to have general commitments already from those you wish to interview for your story. This can help you sound more reliable, prepared, and ready to write your story to the editor.

, If you receive a positive response from the editor, thank them for their time and inform them of when you will be sending them the pitch via email.For example you could end your call with: “Great. I will send you an official pitch within the week. Just to verify, your email is sam.jones@everythingmagazine.com? Ok, awesome. Thank you for your time and I look forward to working with you.”

, Once you have been given the go-ahead to send your pitch, follow the guidelines and instructions the magazine has for submitting pitches.If for any reason you feel or know you will be delayed in emailing the prompt in, send an email to the editor explaining your delay and try to give them an estimate on when they can expect the pitch.
Most magazines have their guidelines online. Make sure you have reviewed them so you have the best chance at getting your pitch reviewed.It would be helpful to get a few copies of your target magazine to read in an effort to get a feel for the type of style they are looking for as well as average length for the articles they publish."

Find the magazine or editor on the internet.,
Send a friend request.,
Pitch your idea.",How to Contact a Magazine Editor3," Social media is the epitome of communications this day in age. Many publications now have Facebook and Twitter accounts to promote their individual uses. Use the various platforms to locate the specific magazine and most likely it will provide you with the name of the editor of the magazine.

, Whether you are using Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn, each platform provides the user with the ability to send a friend request or the option to ‘follow’ the person or company. You can use this as an opportunity to introduce yourself to the staff.


Reposting or replying to a magazines articles or editors will enable you to build a rapport with them and will allow them to become familiar with you.
LinkedIn offers a number of writing-related groups among its many discussion groups; you can use these to build a reputation and then request to add editors who belong to the same group to your LinkedIn network.

, Once you have established a relationship or rapport with the magazine and the editor, send them a direct message pitching them an idea and inquiring whether they would be interested in the story."

Decide whether you prefer heavier photography or more articles.,
Consider your age, lifestyle, and interests.,
If you have time, page through magazines that interest you.,
Subscribe to magazines you consistently enjoy.",How to Choose a Women's Magazine," Some popular women's magazines, such as Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and W, are devoted primarily or exclusively to covering developments in couture fashion and often feature many photograph spreads. Others, such as Marie Claire, More, or O Oprah Magazine, tend to favor longer articles and more text.;
, Most women's lifestyle/general interest magazines orient themselves to a particular demographic of female reader. For example, More, O Oprah Magazine, Redbook, Good Housekeeping and Ladies' Home Journal are typically geared towards women over 40. Marie Claire, Elle, Glamour and Cosmopolitan are marketed towards younger women in their 20's and 30's, while Nylon targets a younger, more ""alternative"" minded woman. Other magazines have a narrower focus than lifestyle magazines. Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and W emphasize couture fashion, Allure focuses on hairstyles and beauty, Self and Shape on health and fitness, and InStyle, Lucky, and People StyleWatch on a more mass-market, ""shoppy"" type of fashion.

, If a cover headline or image attracts your attention, flip through the magazine to see if it looks like something you'll enjoy.

, A so-so magazine is okay when you're spending $3.99 for something to read on a flight or take to the beach, but don't spend the money to subscribe to magazines unless you genuinely enjoy that particular publication.

Write a headline.",How to Write Articles," As you’re figuring out your topic and focus, think about the type of article that will best suit the points that you want to convey. Some article types are better suited to certain topics. Some of the most common types of articles are:


News: This type of article presents facts about something that happened recently or that will happen in the near future. It usually covers the 5 Ws and H: who, what, where when, why and how.
Feature: This type of article presents information in a more creative, descriptive way than a straight news article. It can be an article about a person, a phenomenon, a place, or other subject.
Editorial: This article presents a writer’s opinions on a topic or debate. It is intended to persuade the reader to think a certain way about a topic.How-to: This article gives clear instructions and information about how to accomplish some task.
Profile: This article presents information about a person, using information that the writer typically gathers through interviews and background research.;
, Make a list of potential topics. You might want to write about immigration or organic food or your local animal shelter. In order to write a coherent yet concise article, you need to narrow the topic. This will give you something more specific to write about, which will make for a more forceful article. Ask yourself these questions:


What interests you about this topic?
What is a point that people usually overlook?
What do you want people to know about this topic?
For example, if you want to write about organic farming, you might say to yourself, “I think it’s important to know what organic labeling means on food packages. It can be very confusing to know what it all means.”

, Make sure it's something you can write a lot about. You should care about the topic you choose to write about. Your enthusiasm will show in your writing and will be much more engaging for your readers.


Your goal is to convey enough passion that your readers think the issue in your article is worth caring about.

, If you’re not at all familiar with your topic (if, for instance, you need to write on a specific topic for a class assignment), then you will need to start conducting some preliminary research.


Enter some key words into an online search engine. This can lead you to sources that write about your topic. These sources can also give you an idea of different approaches to the topic.
Read as much as you can on the topic. Visit your local library. Consult books, magazine articles, published interviews, and online features as well as news sources, blogs, and databases for information. A good place to start looking for data not readily apparent on the Internet is the Gale Directory of Databases, which exists in both book format (available in libraries) or online.

, When you have decided on your topic and you’ve narrowed it down to something more specific, think about how you can make this article stand out. If you are writing an article about something that other people are also writing about, try to be unique in how you approach the material. You should add to the conversation, not exist alongside it.


For example, for the organic food topic, you might focus on one grocery shopper who doesn’t understand organic food labeling. Use that opening anecdote to lead into your main argument, known as a ""nut graph,"" which summarizes your unique idea or point of view.

, In most articles, the writer makes an argument. This is the main thrust of the article. Then the writer finds evidence to support this argument. In order to make a quality article, you need a quality argument. After you’ve settled on your unique angle, you can really zero in on the argument that you’re trying to make.


For example, if you are writing about how one person learns how to read organic labels, your overall argument might be that the public needs to be aware that many companies misuse organic labeling. This leads to dishonest practices in product advertising. Another topic might be: it’s important to know who owns your local media outlets. If corporate media organizations own your local newspaper, you may get very little media coverage of your area and not know much about your own community.
Write your argument in one sentence. Post it near your computer or writing area. This will help you stay focused as you start working on your article.

, Start researching your specific topic and argument. Go beyond the preliminary research you already conducted. Learn the fundamental issues at stake, the pros and cons, what the experts say, and so on.


The best writers have a ""documents state of mind."" They search both for primary (original, unpublished) documents as well as secondary documents on that subject.


Primary sources can include a transcript from a legislative hearing, lawsuit filing, county property indexes with folio numbers, discharge certificates from the military, and photos. Other primary sources could include government written records in the National Archives or special collections sections of your local or university library, insurance policies, corporate financial reports, or personal background reports.

Secondary sources comprise published databases, books, abstracts, articles in English and other languages, bibliographies, dissertations and reference books.


You can find information on the internet or in a library. You can also conduct interviews, watch documentaries, or consult other sources.

, Start identifying ways that you might support your overall argument. You should gather about 3-5 solid examples that support your overall argument.


You can make a longer list of evidence and examples. As you gather more evidence, you will be able to prioritize which ones are the strongest examples.

, Be wary when researching online. Draw only from reliable sources like reputable newspapers, experts on the topic, government websites, or university websites. Look for information that lists other sources, since this will help back up any claims made by your source. You can also find sources in print, and the same precautions should be taken there.


Don’t assume that one source is completely accurate. You'll need several unrelated sources to get the full picture.

, Write down where you get your information so you can cite the sources. Typically, the bibliographic information for a source includes the author’s name, article title, publication title, year, page number, and publisher.


Choose a citation style sooner rather than later, so you can compile citation information in the correct format. MLA, APA, and Chicago are some of the most common citation styles.

, When you are looking at other sources, be careful about how you compile information. Sometimes, people copy text into a single document to use as notes for their article. But in doing so, they risk potential plagiarism because the copied text gets mixed up in their own written work. Be sure to keep careful track of which writing is not yours.


Don’t copy any text directly from another source. Paraphrase this text instead, and include a citation.

, Does this article have a word count? Do you need to fill a certain number of pages? Consider what type of content you’re writing about and how much space this will fill. Also, think about how much needs to be written in order to cover the topic adequately.

, Think about who is going to read your article. You need to take into account the reading level, interests, expectations, and so on.


For example, if you are writing an article for a specialized academic audience, your tone and approach will be vastly different than if you’re writing an article for a popular magazine.

, Before you begin to formally write, write up an outline of your article. This outline will break down which information goes where. It serves as a guide to help you figure out where you need more information.


It’s helpful to start with the five-paragraph essay outline.This outline devotes one paragraph to an introduction, three paragraphs for supporting evidence, and one paragraph for a conclusion. As you start plugging in information into your outline, you may find that this structure doesn’t suit your article so well.
You might also find that this structure doesn’t suit certain types of articles. For example, if you’re doing a profile of a person, your article may follow a different format.

, You will likely come across information that succinctly supports what you’re saying. This might include a statement that someone has made, or a sentence within another article that is particularly relevant. Choose the most important and descriptive part to use in your own piece. Add these quotes to your outline.


Make sure to fully attribute your quote and use quotation marks around anything that you didn’t write yourself. For example, you might write: A spokesperson for the dairy brand Milktoast says, “Our milk is labeled organic because our cows are only fed organic grass.”
Don’t overdo the quotes. Be selective about the quotes you do use. If you use too many quotes, your reader might think you’re using them as filler instead of coming up with your own material.

, A compelling introductory paragraph is crucial for hooking your reader. Within the first few sentences, the reader will evaluate whether your article is worth reading in its entirety. There are a number of ways to start an article, some of which include:


Telling an anecdote.
Using a quote from an interview subject.
Starting with a statistic.
Starting with straight facts of the story.

, You’ve drafted your article in outline form, and this will help you focus on writing a solid and coherent article. The outline can also help you remember how details connect to each other. You will also be reminded of how certain quotes support certain points that you’re making.


Be flexible, however. Sometimes when you write, the flow makes sense in a way that is different from your outline. Be ready to change the direction of your piece if it seems to read better that way.

, Don’t assume your reader knows as much about your topic as you do. Think about the kinds of background information that your reader needs in order to understand the topic. Depending on the type of article, you might give a paragraph with background information before proceeding into your supporting evidence. Or, you might weave in this contextual information throughout your article.

, Use eloquent and descriptive language to give the reader a good picture of what you’re writing about. Carefully choose descriptive verbs and precise adjectives.


For example, you might write about the grocery shopper having trouble with organic food labels: “Charlie concentrated on jars of peanut butter on the shelf. The words ‘organic’ and ‘natural’ seemed to jump out at him. Every jar said something different. He felt they were shouting at him: ‘Choose me!’ ‘Buy me!’ The words started swimming in front of his eyes. He left the aisle without buying anything.”

, Link each separate idea with transitions so that your article reads as one cohesive piece. Start each new paragraph with a transition that links it to the previous paragraph.


For example, use words or phrases such as “however…,” “another important point is…,” or “it must be remembered that…”

, You will want to write with a style, structure, and voice which makes sense for the type of article you are writing. Evaluate your audience to determine what the best method would be to present your information to them.


For example, a newspaper article will need to offer information in a narrative, chronological format. It should be written with accessible and straightforward language. An academic article will be written with more formal language. A how-to article might be written in more informal language.
When writing your article, use a strong ""anchoring"" sentence at the beginning of each paragraph to move your reader forward. Also, vary the length of your sentences, both short and long. If you find all your sentences are about the same word length, chances are your reader will be 'lulled"" into a standard rhythm and fall asleep. Sentences which are consistently choppy and short may give your reader the impression you are writing advertising copy instead of a well-thought-out article.

, Wrap up your article with a dynamic conclusion. Depending on your article, this might be a conclusion that empowers the reader. For example, if you’re writing an opinion piece about food labeling, you might convey to your readers how they can learn more about labeling.


If you started with an anecdote or statistic in your introduction, think about reconnecting to this point in your conclusion.
Conclusions are often strongest when they use a last, brief concrete example that leads the reader to new insights. Conclusions should be 'forward thinking' -- point the reader in a direction that keeps his or her ""thirst"" for knowledge going strong.

, You can help your reader understand your topic more clearly by including graphics or other supplemental material.


For example, you could include photographs, charts, or infographics to illustrate some of your points.
You could also highlight or develop a major point more with a sidebar-type box. This is an extra bit of writing that delves more deeply into one aspect of the subject. For example, if you’re writing about your city’s film festival, you might include a sidebar write-up that highlights one of the films. These types of write-ups are usually short (50-75 words, depending on the publication outlet).
Remember, these materials are supplemental. This means that your article should stand on its own. Your writing needs to be understandable, clear and focused without the help of charts, photographs or other graphics.

, Take some time to edit and revise your article. If time allows, wait for a day or two before editing. This will give you some distance from your article. Then you will be able to view your article with fresh eyes.


Look closely at the central argument or point you’re trying to make. Does everything in your article serve this central argument? Do you have a paragraph that is unrelated? If so, this paragraph should be eliminated or reframed so that it supports the main argument.
Eliminate any contradictory information in the article or address the contradictions, showing how the contradictory information is relevant to readers.
Rewrite sections or the entire thing as necessary. Revisions like this are common for all types of articles, so don’t feel like you’ve failed or are incompetent.

, Even when an article is well-written, it will not be taken as seriously if it has grammatical errors or spelling mistakes. Make sure your writing is forceful by cleaning up your grammar.


It’s helpful to print out a hard copy of your article. Go through it with a pen or pencil to catch mistakes. Then go back and correct these mistakes on the computer.

, Listen for tone, rhythm, sentence length, coherence, grammatical or content errors, and compelling argument(s). Think of your writing as a piece of music, an auditory experience, and use your ears to evaluate the quality, strengths, and weaknesses.


It is common to be able to identify your own mistakes in grammar or writing while reading aloud as well; this could cut down on the feedback that you may receive from someone else.

, Try showing the article to a friend, teacher, or other trusted individual to read it. Does this person understand the points you’re trying to make? Does he follow your logic?


This person may also catch errors and inconsistencies that you have overlooked.

, Give your article a suitable headline. The headline is short and to the point, using no more than about 10 words, if that. A headline should be action-oriented and should convey why the story is important. It should grab readers and draw them into the article., If you want to convey slightly more information, write a sub-headline. This is a secondary sentence that builds on the headline.

Wait until your question is most likely to be answered.,
Be polite.,
Introduce yourself and your official affiliation.,
Thank the person for allowing you to ask the question.,
Speak loudly and articulate clearly.,
Keep the question itself brief and to-the-point.",How to Ask Questions in a News Conference1," In general, those who organized the news conference will dictate when journalists are allowed to ask questions. Asking out of turn will increase the likelihood that your question is not addressed, and risk your removal from the conference altogether. In this sense, the speaker and organizers will dictate control over who gets to ask questions, but by following standard protocol, you can increase your chances of getting to ask a question and receiving an answer - neither of which are ever guaranteed.Specific protocol will vary based on the type of conference.
Most commonly, expect to raise your hand and wait for the speaker or a supporting organizer acknowledge that you have a question.;
, It is in your best interest to be patient and polite during all facets of the conference, if only for the sake of developing of professional rapport with the organizers, speaker, and your fellow journalists. Developing the favor of those you're working with, alongside of, or covering will greatly improve that you are called on and receive sincere responses.Even if you strongly disagree with the speaker, or have been offended by their perspectives or behavior, rudeness on your part will all but guarantee that your question will not be taken seriously.

, Though it may seem formal, you should always quickly state your name and employer or media affiliation. Especially if there are people in the room who do not know who you are, this will help solidify your reputation as a journalist, and allow others, including the speaker, to easily follow up with you after the conference.For example, quickly state, “Hello , with .
If you are not a journalist, briefly state the reason you are in attendance. For instance, say something like “Hello , my name is _____, and I’m here today because _______.”

, At formal conferences, consider also quickly thanking the speaker for taking your question. Simply add “Thank you for taking my question” to the end of your introduction., Most importantly, you need to ensure the speaker hears you with absolute clarity. Further, if the conference includes radio or television coverage, speaking loudly and clearly will also help ensure that any microphones being used are able to record your question., Following your introductory statement, your question should only be one or two sentences long. If you have multiple questions, choose the most important and lead with it. Limiting yourself to one specific question increases the chances that you will successfully solicit a meaningful answer.Ask two questions maximum, and only when one is extremely specific and can be answered simply. For instance, you could ask a quick yes-or-no type question and then another that would require the speaker to elaborate.

"
"
Do your research.,
Prepare a list of questions in advance.,
Arrive at the news conference early.,
Take notes.,
Listen for what the speaker doesn’t say.,
Ask for a private audience following the conference.,
Stay late.",How to Ask Questions in a News Conference2," Aside from the vital importance of research to the process of providing accurate coverage, specific, in-depth research will also help you choose the most productive question to ask. News conferences in particular are usually held to update the public about a storyline that is already being covered. As such, you will be expected to have a base knowledge on the topic of the news conference, especially as a journalist.Your own organization’s coverage is a great place to get up to date, as is talking to any co-workers that have been involved in coverage of related topics, or those who may be familiar with the speaker in particular.
Research both the topic, and the expected speaker in particular.

, Particularly if the topic being covered is not immediately attention-grabbing, you and the other journalists may need to pull more information out of the speaker during the question and answer session than they volunteer. If you expect an announcement about something that could go one way or the other, prepare questions that would address the specifics of either scenario., This may benefit you in multiple ways. For one, your literal position in the room may prove to be the deciding factor in your getting the chance to ask a question. Further, arriving early allows the chance to speak with other journalists and maybe even conference organizers. Ideally, shoot for a spot near where the speaker is sitting, or in the middle of the front row.
If you are able to speak with a conference organizer, request the opportunity to speak with the speaker privately after the conference right off the bat. They may be planning to allow a few journalists a bit more nuanced perspective of a situation, and coming first to the table increases the chances you’ll get dessert.

, News conferences can be fast-paced, so having notes handy as a reference can be helpful. On a notepad, jot down the important points the speaker makes and any word-by-word verbatim quotes that may be relevant to the story you intend to write or the interest of the organization you’re affiliated with. In particular, take note of points you hope are revisited, and consider questions that would dictate a more extensive response regarding these points. Good notes will allow you to cite a speaker’s own words to them. For instance, you can later begin a question with “Earlier, you stated that _________, could you expand on that further or tell us explicitly what you meant be that?”

, Often, what a speaker chooses not to say is of equal importance to what they’ve said. The more familiar you are with the topic, the more likely you’ll be able to predict or look for certain types of comments, and know that their absence may also be significant.For instance, if you’re aware of a certain facet of the topic that you know should be addressed and is not, structure a question accordingly. You know there’s a reason it wasn’t brought up.

, Especially if you are affiliated with a reputable organization, it is always worth asking for the chance to speak with the speaker one on one after the conference. If they are hesitant to grant the audience, specify that you only have one question to ask.Further, specify that you have a question you’d rather not ask during the conference.


You can even apply a bit of pressure to earn a private audience by implying or telling the speaker you know something that not everyone does, and you wish to discuss it discretely.
While this may backfire and risk coming off as brash, it may also intrigue a speaker enough to hear your question.

, Unless you simply want to get your write-up to print as quickly as possible, hang around. This will increase the chances of seeing or hearing more than what was conveyed in the context of a formal news conference. The speaker may even be willing to speak casually with members of the press off the record, or speak further about topics unrelated to the topic of the press conference after it has concluded."
"
Ask answerable questions.,
Avoid making comments.,
Ask a courtesy question to start the question and answer session.,
Ask off-topic questions rarely, if at all.,
Avoid asking overly esoteric or fluffy questions.",How to Ask Questions in a News Conference3," Most of the time, the most important criteria of your question is how likely it is to solicit a response with substance. Specificity is your ally in this regard; choose questions that are extremely answerable by explicitly addressing specifics. For example, great questions include requests for clarification regarding details of how, when, or where something occurred, or why someone is behaving in a certain manner.Don’t ask a question you know the speaker will be unwilling or unable to answer. While this is a stunt often featured in video entertainment and perpetuated by activists, it’s a sure way to stop being allowed into press conferences.

, If you purpose to make a political statement, understand that this is an entirely different goal than asking a question. Your job is not to convince the speaker of anything, it’s to get information from them that you can report in your coverage. Any commentary, accordingly, belongs in your coverage, not during the question and answer session of a news conference. Comments risk understandably bothering the speaker as well as your fellow journalists, and, at best, will simply bore most of the others in the room., If crickets greet the speaker when they’re finished speaking, and it seems no one intends to ask a question, you may want to lead with a softball pitch before asking the question you really want answered. Starting the session with something the speaker can easily and safely answer will ingratiate them with you, and increase the likelihood they give a more serious question more attention.For instance, ask for a quick clarification of a statement that was less clear when the speaker initially made it, allowing them to revisit something they prepared to speak on while reframing it in a way that may lead to additional information.
Similarily, open-ended questions will allow the speaker to expand on something they may have forgoten to mention. Consider by starting with something like. “How do you feel about _____.” Open-ended questions will essentially allow a speaker to say whatever they want, which they will appreciate - as long as you don’t ask them too often.

, Questions at news conferences should be framed and informed by their relevance to the topic of the conference. If you have questions for the person unrelated to the topic of the news conference, it will likely be most effective to wait until the end of all the questions and ask it once the topic of the conference has been covered.A good benchmark for deciding whether a question is appropriate to ask during a news conference is whether it will be of interest to a good amount of people in the room.
In situations where you’re intentionally putting the speaker on the spot, understand that your question may not be answered, and you may simply be reducing the chances they or other speakers will call on you again in the future.

, You want everyone in the room to understand your question, not just the speaker. Don’t try to demonstrate your knowledge of the topic - let the speaker do the talking. Similarily, avoid lingo and buzzwords too; this will allow the speaker to simply repeat any trending terminology back at you without actually saying anything.When considering a potential question, make sure your phrasing either conveys a desire for a statement to be clarified, or for new information. This will ensure clarity and straightforwardness while diminishing unnecessary clauses or commentary.

Continue fine tuning.",How to Start Your Own Magazine," Before you start building your publishing empire, you need to create something. If you have not done so already, sit down with a trusted friend and start bouncing ideas off each other, and see what emerges. Ask questions like:


What will be the topic of your magazine? Focus on things you love and know well, whether that is sports, fashion, computers, or social networking. Creating a magazine based on your passions will be more engaging, relevant, and useful to your readers than a topic you have no relationship with.
Who is your target audience? This will help you focus on your possibilities. For example, if your topic is fashion, your demographic will have a huge impact on the style and substance of your magazine, as well as potential ad revenue. If your target market is teenage girls/boys, for example, you'll approach the writing, content, even the logo and color scheme much differently than you would if you were targeting men over 40, or gender-neutral 20-somethings. Determine the age, gender, income level, geographic location, and education level of your target audience.
What caliber will your magazine be? As odd of a question as this may be, you will have to decide if you want your magazine to be an authority on a subject (like cooking or fashion) or if you want your magazine to be light, gossipy publication (think Ok! or Us.);
, It will take time, effort, and money to get people interested in reading your magazine. Make sure you can keep them once they've started reading by reaching people who have a continuing need.For example, consider buying a home. There are three groups of people who could be reached with a magazine: the buyer, the seller, and the real estate agent. However, of those three groups, only one has the potential of being a repeat customer, and that's the real estate agent. Unless you target investment buyers and sellers—which is really a completely different market—your best target audience for repeat business will be the real estate agent.

, To make any business venture a success, you need to interact with a broad range of people—people who will help make your magazine successful. Influential people in your market are very important to know and engage with.For example, if you're creating a magazine for rock climbers, you will want to meet the top climbers, content creators, and other stars in that firmament. It may be that they do nothing more than tell their friends, ""Hey, there's a rad new mag coming out in a couple months"", or they may say, ""Hey, there's a rad new mag coming out in a couple months, and I'd love to do a spread on your trip to Smith Rocks."" Either way, you're a winner.
Talk to people with experience starting and financing business ventures, and people in the printing industry. Talk to your banker, your attorney, printers, website creators--anybody who might have a wealth of knowledge and experience that touches your venture is good to know.

, Do your homework and find out what magazines already exist in the field that you want to cover. What makes these magazines successful? What do you think you could do better than them? Find something about your concept that would make your magazine stand out in the crowd.

, This will help you define what you are going to do, and help you plan for the future. You will have to develop hard numbers for revenue, understand the competition, and codify your needs so that you will always know what you're doing—even when you don't!


You will also need a business plan when you approach the people who will fund your venture. They're much more likely to invest in your venture when they see you've invested time and effort yourself.
Consult a business plan consultant or writer who can help you to create a solid, cost-effective plan. While this will cost you money, it will ultimately save you money in the long run.

, Once you've gone through the process of defining your magazine and what group of people it will serve, you will want to put together a small team of people who can create that vision. If you began this project with a partner, even better. You might be tempted to think, ""I can do it all, myself."" Don't fall into this trap. Ask people who are as passionate about your subject as you are to join you on this adventure.It takes a lot of time to write articles. It takes more time to photograph or source and edit images. It takes still more time to do the page layout, ad sales, manage the printing process, sales, distribution, and customer support. Each of those disciplines require their own levels of expertise. Unless you plan on publishing one copy every 6 months, it would be wise to build a staff at this point.

, You'll oversee everything, do the books, look for funding, find printers, and more. However, on top of the stuff you do, you will also want to pick up managers to head the different parts of the publication process. These include:


Publication manager. Somebody has got to be out there sourcing printing houses, paper costs, doing spot checks, proofing, and being the point person for everything to do with the nuts and bolts of publishing.
Sales manager. All those ads have to come from somewhere, because that's where a lot of the revenue is going to come from—especially at first, as you give away copies as fast as you can. Having somebody working that revenue stream every day will make a huge difference on your bottom line.
Marketing manager. Even if you build it, they're not going to come unless they know about it. A marketing manager will spread the word, get your magazine placed on newsstands, bookstores, distribution houses, and more. Your marketing manager will also know what the competition is doing—what's in their press kit, what promotions they're running, and how they're being successful—and then do it better!

, In the beginning, you might want to consider picking up freelance writers, editors and photographers. Freelancers will save you money as they are not full-time staff but still produce (mostly) high-caliber work. For the graphics side of things, you may want to consider hiring a design consulting firm who has experience working with magazine startups.


Writing and editing. All those fine and witty words, the articles, even the page numbers and table of contents all need to be written and edited. Emphasis on editing.
Graphic designer. What does the magazine look like? Again, different markets need different design approaches, and people will respond accordingly. Consider the difference between, for example, Wired and The New Yorker. Wired made their mark with day-glow colors, cutting edge page layout, and bold use of white space. It appealed to the geekdom like nothing else at the time. Now consider The New Yorker, with it's wry, pastel art, witty cartoons, and probing articles, all wrapped up in traditional fonts and page layout.

, You will only need a printer after you have actually created your first issue (see Part Three.) Before you decide on a printer who will be solely responsible for creating the first edition of your magazine, you should meet with several printers. Find out what they charge for a magazine like yours, what experience they have with magazine printing, etc.


You should also see if you can find reviews for the publisher. If you find reviews like “All of the pages were diagonal and they still charged us!” run away as fast as you can.

, Come up with stories you want to cover--be they written or photo stories. Decide how many photo-only sections of the magazine you want to have (if any.) Even if you don’t have the content yet, you can still map out each page. Do mock-ups of the layout--use ""lorem ipsum"" text to fill in the empty spots (latin text that many publications use as placeholders for articles before the actual article is finished,) drop in pictures from the internet as picture placeholders—anything that lets you visualize and plan your first issue.Armed with your mock-up, your writers and designers will know what to create, your marketing and sales people will know what to sell, and your publishing people will be able to start pricing things out and getting bids.

, While your staff is creating the content for the first issue, rough-plan the next 6 publications. It's easy to get started, but deadlines in the publishing industry come fast. If you're really prepared, you will have the second magazine ready to finish as soon as the first one is out the door. Always try to stay at least one month ahead of schedule.

, Sometimes, you will have to cut stories because of space issues, content issues, relevance issues...the list goes on. That doesn’t mean those stories won’t be able to be used in the future.


Maybe a freelance writer came across a story about a Christmas tree farm that inexplicably gets visited by a herd of wild reindeer every Christmas eve. But you are currently publishing your July issue. No worries--stick it in your ‘To Be Used’ article log and plan on running it in the December issue.

, As you're about to launch your magazine, put up a website. It doesn't have to be elaborate, at least not at first, but it will give people a place to see teasers to your publication and the content before they buy it. It'll also be a place where you can have an active community forum for feedback and commentary—invaluable if you want to grow into a successful publication.Set your website up so that some of the articles are open to public browsers, but others require a subscription to your magazine to be viewed.

, Now that you have your team in place, the design firmed up, and content creators ready to create, make your first issue. You'll inevitably have kinks to work out, but the only way to know that is to do it. It'll be a process you'll never forget, but at the end, you'll have a magazine!

, Your first issue will be an incredible learning experience, and a heavy moment, but that's just the beginning. When people start reading it, and advertisers see it in print, you'll undoubtedly get feedback. Pay attention to it.


Do they love the content, but hate the layout? Find out why they hate it. It might be a perfect layout for a different demographic, but not yours. Before changing things willy-nilly, analyze the pros and cons.
Is it priced right? People often complain about the price of things that they buy, but the key here is ""did they buy?"" If you get a lot of feedback saying, ""It looked nice, but was too much, I didn't buy it"", you might have to readjust your numbers. That could be just adjusting your expectations, or it might mean selling more ads instead of charging more per issue.

, Promotions that work—keep them. Columns that got rave reviews—do more in that style. That little chatty throwaway section of witty comments about the field? They loved that? Feature it! The key is to pay attention and respond, both to what went wrong, and what went right.

, Always keep track of the numbers, of what's working, and what isn't. Your market will change, the times will change, and whatever your topic is, will be subject to good times and bad times. Stay ahead of the game by knowing your chosen industry intimately, and you'll do great. Good luck!

,How to Write a Press Release1,
"
Write a genuine headline.,
Write the body copy.,
Communicate the ""5 W's"" (and the H) clearly.,
Make it clean, crisp, and applicable to your audience.,
Tie it together.",How to Write a Press Release2," It should be brief, clear and to the point: an ultra-compact version of the press release’s key point. Plenty of PR professionals recommend writing your headline at the end, after the rest of the release is written. If you follow that instruction, continue on and come back to writing the headline once the rest is done. The headline is known as the eye-catcher and is very important to the whole release.



wikiHow recognized as most reliable information source. See how that works? Now you want to know more! News release headlines should have a ""grabber"" to attract journalists, just as a newspaper headline is meant to grab readers. It may describe the latest achievement of an organization, a recent newsworthy event, a new product or service.

Headlines written in bold! A bold headline also typically uses a larger font size than the body copy. Conventional press release headlines use the present tense and exclude ""a"" and ""the"", as well as forms of the verb ""to be"" in certain contexts.

First word capitalized. As are all proper nouns. Most headline words appear in lower-case letters, although using a stylized ""small caps"" font style can create a more graphically news-attractive look and feel. Do not capitalize every word.

Extract important keywords. The simplest method to create the press release headline is to extract the most important keywords from your press release. From these keywords, try to frame a logical and attention-getting statement. If including a summary sentence after the headline, the same rules apply. Using keywords early will give you better visibility in search engines, and it will be simpler for journalists and readers to get the idea of the press release content. Look at the actions in this first step, and notice how every one of them could be a press release headline.


, The press release should be written as you want it to appear in a news story. And remember this: most journalists are very busy, and don't have time to research your company's big announcement, so much of what you write for your press release will be what the journalists use in their writeup of your big event. Whatever you want them to say, this is where you put it.


Start with the date and city in which the press release originates. The city may be omitted if it will be confusing –– for example if the release is written in New York about events in the company's Chicago division.
The lead, or first sentence, should grab the reader and say concisely what is happening. For example, if the headline is ""Careen Publishing releases new WWII novel,"" the first sentence might be something like, ""Carpren Publishing, Ltd., today released their first World War II novel by celebrated writer Darcy Kay."" It expands the headline enough to fill in some of the details, and brings the reader further into the story. The next one to two sentences should then expand upon the lead.

The press release body copy should be compact. Avoid using very long sentences and paragraphs. Avoid repetition and overuse of fancy language and jargon. Strive for simplicity, and no wasted words.
The first paragraph (two to three sentences) should sum up the press release, and the additional content must elaborate it. In a fast-paced world, neither journalists, nor other readers, would read the entire press release if the start of the article didn't generate interest.
Deal with actual facts –– events, products, services, people, targets, goals, plans, projects. Try to provide maximum use of concrete facts. This is news. A simple method for writing an effective press release is to make a list of following clarifications: Who, what, when, where, why, and how.


, Who, what, when, where, why ––and how–– should tell the reader everything they need to know. Consider the checklist in context with the points below, using the example above to generate our press release:


Who is this about? Carpren Publishing.
What is the actual news? Carpren Publishing is releasing a book.
When does this even happen? Tomorrow.
Where does this even take place? In all major markets, tomorrow.
Why this is news? It was written by renowned author, Arcy Kay.
How is this happening? The main event is at a book signing in Chicago, followed by a book tour to all the major metropolitan areas.

With the basics defined, fill in the gaps with information about the people, products, items, dates and other things related with the news.
If your company is not the main subject of the news, but is the source of the press release, make it clear in the body.


Keep it short and to the point. If you are sending a hard copy, the text should be double-spaced.
The more newsworthy you make the press release copy, the better the chances of it being selected by a journalist for reporting. Find out what ""newsworthy"" means to a given market and use this knowledge to hook the editor or reporter.


, Odds are whoever you sent your press release to has a dozen just like it in his/her inbox just waiting to be ignored. If you want yours to be chosen, it's got to be good. Not only does it have to be good, but it has to be as close to ""ready for press"" as possible.


When an editor looks at your piece, he/she is thinking, from the first second, about how long it's going to take them to get it to print. If your work is full of errors, lacking content, or just needs to be revised, they're not going to waste their time. So make sure you have good grammar, all the basics, and have something to write about.
Why should these people care what you have to say? If you're sending it to the right audience, it'll be obvious. If you're not, well, why are you wasting your time? Give the right people a piece of news (news, not advertising) and you're on the right track.

They'll care more if you send it in the morning. That gives them time to pad your piece into what they're already working on. Be considerate.



, Provide some extra information links that support your press release. Does the company you're selling have additional information online that readers may find useful? Great. Add it in.


If you're nervous about what you've got, do some research on what's already out there. Someone probably wrote something on an event just like the one you're covering. PR Weband PR Newswireare good places to start.

Get the basic structure down.,
Write a boilerplate underneath the body of your release.,
Add your contact information.,
If possible, include a link to an online copy of the same release.,
Signal the end of the press release with three # (hash) symbols.",How to Write a Press Release3," All right, now that you've got the meat of it together, how do you put it onto paper? Well, for starters, cut it to length. It should be a page long at most, if that. No one's going to waste time on 5 paragraphs unless you're covering WWIII. Here's what you need (some of which we've already covered):FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE should go at the top of the page, on the left margin.

If the release is embargoed, put ""EMBARGOED UNTIL..."" with the date you want the story released. A release with no release date is presumed to be for immediate release.


The headline, usually in bold, should be centered below that.

If you'd like, put a subhead in italics (briefly elaborating the headline).



First paragraph: most important information. May be quite news-like in that, it starts with a date or where the news is coming from.

Second (and probable third) paragraph: secondary information. Should include quotes and facts.

Boilerplate information: more on your company. Who are you, really? What achievements do you have? What's your mission?

Contact information: more on the writer (probably you!). If you grab someone's interest, they'll want to be able to find out more!

Multimedia: in today's day and age, there's always some Twitter handle to be had.

, That means it's time to include information about your company. When a journalist picks up your press release for a story, he or she would logically have to mention the company in the news article. Journalists can then get the company information from this section.


The title for this section should be ""About .""
After the title, use a paragraph or two to describe your company with 5 or 6 lines each. The text must describe your company, its core business and the business policy. Many businesses already have professionally written brochures, presentations, business plans, etc. That introductory text can be put here.
At the end of this section, point to your website. The link should be the exact and complete URL without any embedding so that, even if this page is printed, the link will be printed as it is. For example: http://www.example.com, not Click here to visit the website.
Companies which maintain a separate media page on their websites must point to that URL here. A media page typically has contact information and press kits.


, If your press release is really newsworthy, journalists would surely like more information or would like to interview key people associated with it. If you are comfortable with the idea of letting your key people be contacted directly by media, you can provide their contact details on the press release page itself. For example, in the case of an innovation, you can provide the contact information of your engineering or research team for the media.


If not, you must provide the details of your media/PR department in the ""Contact"" section. If you do not have dedicated team for this function, you must appoint somebody who will act as a link between the media and your people.
The contact details must be limited and specific only to the current press release. The contact details must include:

The company's official name
Media department's official name and contact person
Office address
Telephone and fax numbers with proper country/city codes and extension numbers
Mobile phone number (optional)
Times of availability
Email addresses
Website address



, It's good practice to keep a log of all of your press releases housed on your own website. This can make providing such a link easier to produce, as well as keeping a record for historical purposes.


, Center these directly underneath the last line of the release. This is a journalistic standard. It may look like you're over-tweeting, but you're not. This is how it's done.

Find your voice.,
Have an opinion.,
Share your personal experiences.,
Write in the first person.",How to Write a Newspaper Column1," As a newspaper columnist, you’re charged to have distinct opinions and a voice. Your voice could be humorous or dark, for example.A good way to find your voice is to read newspaper articles that simply report the facts and then freewrite a response to the story. Do this with five or six articles, and then chart how you reacted. You might notice that you consistently take a sarcastic tone or maybe you’re always optimistic.
Your editor will also be able to help you refine your voice, so don’t be afraid to reach out.;
, What distinguishes a newspaper column from an article is that a column inserts an opinion where the article only reports facts in an objective way. Forming an opinion is a good way to speak your voice.A good way to test your opinion is to ask yourself, “Will someone have a strong reaction against my article?” If the answer is yes, you’ve successfully formed an opinion. If your stance doesn’t elicit any reaction then you’ve probably written a very neutral piece.
Make sure you can back that opinion up with researched evidence. This will help persuade your readers to buy into your opinion.

, A good way to develop a voice and opinion is to draw from your own personal experiences. Including anecdotes from your own life will not only make you more relatable to your reader, but also more credible.If you’ve had a situation where prescription drug costs buried you financially, start off your column with an anecdote about this time in your life before you lay out your fiery opinion on the high cost of prescription drugs for seniors.

, Since a column is based on your opinion, incorporate your voice by using “I.” This will remind the reader of your presence and will help establish which opinions presented are yours.Instead of saying, “The facilities for race horses are frequently not up to snuff,” you can make this statement more compelling with the use of first person. For example: “The horse racing facilities that I, as a trainer, have visited are routinely inadequate for the needs of horses, and this impacts their performance and well-being.”

"
"
Look to current events.,
Find an interesting angle for your topic.,
Choose a topic for which you have a solution.",How to Write a Newspaper Column2," Your readers will be most interested in topics that are dominating the news, such as politics or pop culture, and not some obscure event that’s no longer relevant. Stay on top of the news cycle and be ready to jump in with your own opinion.Scan the headlines of a couple of newspapers and magazines and see what events are most frequent amongst them. These issues that are occurring frequently across various media are ones that the general public will be interested in.
Often newspaper columns are about politics, but they can draw on social issues also, such as prison conditions.

, Providing your readers with a fresh approach to a story can make your column appealing. Thinking about new angles for a topic on current events will be sure to speak to readers.Don’t be afraid to include yourself in your topic. Look at your own personal history for a way to contribute something unique to your column.Dive into the details and see where they take you. Looking closely at details may provoke a new idea.Focusing on local angles is a great way to make your column relevant to your reader., Have the conviction to suggest a solution or two for the opinion you’ve stated. Readers are looking for answers when they pick up a newspaper column, and it’s your job as the columnist to provide them.If, for example, you’re going to say, “Social media use by students during school hours is crushing student productivity,” you’d better be prepared to offer a solution to get students to put aside social media and concentrate on the tasks at hand.
If you’ve got a strong point of view on a particular topic, but have no solutions to offer, you should wait to write the column until you’ve got more concrete solutions.

"
"
Have a catchy title.,
Open with a “hook” that will grab your reader’s attention.,
Tell your reader why they should care.,
Write conversationally.,
Use active voice.",How to Write a Newspaper Column3," Providing an appropriate title for your column will help set the reader's expectations and grab his or her attention.Catchy titles often include numbers, fun adjectives, and a promise to the reader.For example, “Getting Stains Out of Your Carpet” is a title that’s not likely to capture your reader’s attention. However, this title will: “3 Unusual Household Items That’ll Get Red Wine Stains Out.” This title uses numbers, gives the reader a promise, and lures them into reading on to find out what these unusual household items are.

, Make that first sentence count by enticing the reader with your words and ideas. Remember that your opening also lays the foundation for your argument, so make sure it’s relevant.Opening lines that will catch your reader’s attention include dramatic anecdotes, a controversial statement, irony and wit, a major new study, or a statement that turns conventional wisdom on end.In his health and well-being column, columnist Oliver Burkeman begins his story: “About a month ago, to my embarrassment, I learned I’d been tying my shoelaces wrongly my whole life.” This opening line grabs our attention with a catchy anecdote and makes us want to read on to find out what he was doing wrong and what the correct way to tie a shoe is., As you write your article make sure every paragraph can answer the question: “Who cares?” Explain why your topic is relevant to your readers and how it will positively or negatively affect them.For example, if you’re writing against a new tax proposal explain to your readers that this new policy will increase their taxes.

, While you shouldn’t throw all the writing rules out the window, you should avoid jargon, technical language, and complex sentence structure. By writing in a more conversational manner, you’ll be able to communicate your point to your audience more effectively.Try writing in shorter sentences or using contractions to adopt a more conversational style.
Pretend that you’re writing to a friend and address the reader directly.
Try talking in your head as you write and then read it aloud afterwards to see how it sounds., Using active verbs comes across as more authoritative and it’ll help cut down on wordiness. Since you’re trying to convince a reader of your opinion, using strong, active verbs will help you do this.Stating that, “It is believed by the city council that the townspeople were misled by the mayor” is wordy and leaves the author wondering if the city council is an authoritative source. Instead, try writing that, “The city council believes that the mayor misled the townspeople.” You can note how the active voice sentence is more authoritative and straightforward.

"
"
Keep your column short.,
Make sure your topic is clearly defined.,
Do your research.,
Use Associated Press format.",How to Write a Newspaper Column4," Newspaper columns are typically only 400-800 words so you should get to your point straightaway.Get used to whittling down your initial drafts. After you read each sentence ask yourself, “How is this sentence contributing to my argument? Is every word in this sentence necessary?” If you find yourself unsure whether words or sentences contribute to your argument, take them out and read the article again to see if their absence alters your argument.

, Because newspaper columns are short, your topic and point of view must be clearly defined and focused.Begin by stating your topic and opinion in an opening paragraph. The following paragraphs should then relate back to this idea. If you’re writing that long-distance relationships are a bad idea, introduce this idea in the first paragraph. Then each of the following paragraphs supports this statement by presenting problematic aspects of long-distance relationships, such as trust or romance., While column writing does leave a lot of room for your own personal voice, it should be anchored in facts. Backing up your opinion with facts will help make your case for your readers.You can conduct research at the library or from your computer, but you can also conduct field research by interviewing people involved in your story.Always make sure you properly cite your sources.
If you include a quote be sure to name your source and their expertise. This way the reader is able to assess the reliability of that person's statement.

, Journalism has its own specific writing style that ensures that all newspaper writers have consistent guidelines to follow.Journalism's punctuation is very different from your normal English formatting so you’ll need to review the AP format carefully.

See if the site is openly fictional.,
Check the site’s URL.,
Read the “Contact Us” page.,
Notice how professional the website looks.,
Look up the website itself.",How to Spot Fake News Sites1," Some fake news sites clearly state that they are fake. However, this information may be hidden in the fine print at the bottom of an article. In these cases, fake news sites count on readers to be shocked by a sensational headline without reading through to the article’s conclusion.For example, the fake news site “WTOE 5,” which published a fake news story about Pope Francis endorsing Donald Trump, openly states that it publishes “fantasy news.”Satirical articles can also be mistaken for factual news, although not by the intent of the site itself. Sites such as The Onion, the Daily Currant, Duffle Blog, and National Report publish satirical articles that are sometimes mistaken for actual news.If you think something may be satirical, search the website's name along with the word ""satire"" and see what comes up.;
, Fake news writers will often try to trick people by using a URL similar to that of an established news site. If you think a news site may be fake, check the URL for any extra suffixes or unexpected numbers or letters.For example, rushed readers may be fooled by the URLs of fake news sites “nbc.com.co” and “abcnews.com.co.”
However, the extraneous “.co” is a clear giveaway that these are not the sites of the real NBC or ABC News, and that the sites likely generate fake news.
Strange domain names usually mean that the content is also strange., A genuine news website should provide a method for readers to reach out with questions or concerns. The site should also offer detailed information about the individuals who work there. If a website does not have a “Contact Us” page, and no way to reach the author(s), the site is likely a fake.For example, the website of the Boston Tribune only lists an email address under the “Contact Us” section, which raises suspicion that the site may provide fake news.
Also, if a purported news site only lists a single individual as the author of every article on the site, it is likely fake. Genuine news sites have many staff members in a variety of positions., Official news sites are usually designed by professionals who know how to make sites look good. The format should be neat, and similar to how other news sites are formatted. Bad design often means the site is not legitimate.All caps is usually a sign that something is not professional.News websites always use plain fonts (usually sans serif), with black text on a white or whitish background.

, Search the website's name in a search engine and see what comes up. Read the ""About Us"" page, and descriptions of the site such as on Wikipedia and Snopes.Check their social media. Are they posting clickbait, and do the headlines match what the articles actually say?
If you suspect an organization might be biased or controversial, try adding the word ""controversy"" to your search terms and see what comes up.

"
"
Look into the article’s authors.,
Check out the sources.,
Beware of sensationalism.,
Try a reverse image search if you suspect a photo could be misused or taken out of context.",How to Spot Fake News Sites2," Although fake news sites typically provide a byline at the top of the article and name an author, a little research on your part can help you tell if the individual exists and if the news site is genuine.If no other information about the author is given on the website, or if the article does not provide a byline, you’re probably looking at fake news.


For example, if the byline of a potentially fake news article gives an author’s name, Google the author and see if they have written any journalism for other sites. Reputable journalists should have multiple publications, and often a personal website as well.
Even if a news site provides a “biography” of the suspicious author, but provides suspicious or seemingly bogus information therein, the individual may not be real.
Genuine news sites are scrupulous about documenting their writers’ achievements and providing access to contact authors and journalists.

, Look into the sources and citations that the article provides. Genuine news stories will quote interviews, provide statistics, and back up their claims with references to facts. Check out the sources themselves—follow links given in the article—and make sure that these websites are factual as well.If the article does not provide any sources for its information and does not link to any corroborating news stories, it’s likely providing fake news.If the article has no quotes, quotes from only one person, or quotes from people who don't exist, then it is likely fake.Be wary of fake quotes. If you see a sensationalist quote, try copying the quote and pasting it into a search bar. If it's real, then it's likely that other news outlets will have the same quote., Often, fake news sites try to pass off outlandish claims as being true, with the hope of shocking gullible readers. Read past the headline, and continue past the opening paragraph. If the logic of the article seems to fall apart as you continue, or if the article cites clearly inauthentic sources, you’re dealing with a piece of fake news.News stories that are extremely ridiculous or rage-inducing may be fake.In extreme cases, the content of the article may have nothing to do with the sensationalist, attention-grabbing headline.
The previously mentioned fake news article about Pope Francis endorsing Donald Trump is a good example of a sensationalistic piece. The article is designed to create an emotional response in specific readers (Catholics and Republicans), although the basic premise is absurd.

, Sometimes fake news sites will use stock images, or steal an image from someone else. Right-click on the image and you will have the option to search Google for it. (You can also search the URL and it will offer an image search option.) This way, you can see if other news outlets are using the image, and what they are saying about it.Sometimes it is normal to use stock images. For example, an article about healthy eating might have a stock image of food on it. However, if they are using a generic stock image and claiming that it is a specific person, it is likely that this person doesn't exist.

"
"
Follow the history of the news.,
Beware of explicitly partisan news.,
Search keywords related to the event, and see what you find.,
Check fake-news debunking sites.",How to Spot Fake News Sites3," Fake news is often “recycled”; a popular fake-news story from five years ago may be resurrected by an unscrupulous site. Click through the links and sources in a potentially fake news article, and check the publication dates of every article. If a current article cites sources from a decade ago, the news is likely fake.Fake news can also circulate internationally. For example, a fake story could originate in the United States, die out over time, and be presented as “breaking news” in the UK three years later.

, Especially during national elections, fake news sites will publish information that plays directly into the hands of one political party. Fake news sites often accomplish this by playing into the fears of a specific group or political party, and relying on individuals in that party to believe the fake news that confirms their fears without evaluating the source for authenticity.This phenomenon is known as “confirmation bias”: individuals with strong beliefs are eager to read news that affirms those beliefs, and hesitant to believe sources that they disagree with.

, When something groundbreaking or surprising happens, multiple news outlets will report on it. If only one website is reporting on a newsworthy event, then it is unlikely that it is real., Websites such as Snopes and FactCheck.org will fact-check bogus news stories and report on their authenticity. Before you believe a suspicious-looking news article, check a “debunking” site. These sites have the time and resources to investigate news articles and their sources, and provide unbiased evaluations of news authenticity.When evaluating news, it can help to be a skeptical reader. Doubt claims that seem engineered to anger or shock you, and turn to sites like Snopes when in doubt.
Fake news is often engineered to appeal to irrational readers, so by methodically evaluating the news site and article, you can prevent yourself from believing falsities.

Finger paint
Colored glue
Gel pens
Stickers
Construction paper (to cut out letters or shapes, but don't forget to buy glue if you plan on using some other paper to put on the poster board)
Feathers
Small, battery-powered lights
Fake gemstones
Real gemstones (keep in mind that posters are often thrown away, and that precious gemstones, while they may make the poster really shine, are costly)
Yarn
Ribbon
Mechanical pencils

, Feel free to Google around for inspiration. Try to make the message short and sweet (for example, ""Getting Hitched!"" or ""Promotion for this Guy!"" or ""I got a puppy!""), thinking of your audience. What phrase would best capture the happy news and also interest your audience? Write that phrase on the poster.

, Though this step is optional, bubble letters are typically your safest option to ensure that your audience will be able to read the poster from a fair distance away. (Tip: If you don't know how to make bubble letters, you could watch a tutorial or enlist the help of a friend who knows how to make bubble letters).

, Typically, designs that go along with the happy news are the best ones to put on the poster. For example, if the happy news is that you are growing a garden, it may be appropriate to draw large flowers around the message.

,,"
"
Think of what exactly you want to say.,
Examine what social media you believe is appropriate for sharing the news.,
Type the happy news into the desired social media platform with the keyboard on your computer or your smartphone.

,
Have a friend or close relative read over the message, to make sure that it is free of spelling and grammar errors.

,
Post the message of happy news!

",How to Communicate Happy News2," Remember, social media is a good way to communicate happy news, but only if you want all of your followers to know the good news. While thinking about what you want to say, you may want to avoid sharing too many personal details. (For example, saying ""The Jones house is now expecting a new baby girl!"" would be much better than saying ""After many unsuccessful attempts at a pregnancy, 1234 Cherry Tree Lane is now expecting a new baby girl!"").


Do not share your address online.
Avoid giving too many personal details.
Never give out credit card or social security information.
Don't tag any people who may be upset by your success.
Add a picture when appropriate and if you feel like it.

, Is it just Facebook news, or does it deserve a Tweet as well? Is there some way to Instagram it? These are the things you must consider.

,,,"
"
Decide with whom you want to share the happy news.,
Contact the person/people you want to tell.,
Meet up with the person/people you plan on sharing the news with.

,
Prepare to actually say the happy news.,
Don't look too excited.,
Share the happy news.",How to Communicate Happy News3," Do you want to tell a small group of friends and family? Do you want to tell your significant other? Do you want to tell a coworker? Do you want to tell it to just about whomever will listen? You must consider who specifically you want to tell, because, if they are not found together naturally, you might have to call together all the people you want to see to tell them the news.

, Unless it's a person you are scheduled to see anyway (for example, coworker, parole officer, etc.), you may have to set aside a time to see them and tell them the news. This can be something as great as a party or as simple as a cup of coffee.

,,


Clear your throat, to ensure there is no junk in your throat
Make sure you are prepared to speak loudly
Think of the actual words you are going to say (you don't want to stammer, entirely ruining the effect of the happy news)
Quickly check to make sure there is nothing in your teeth
Take a deep breath

, The element of surprise can be completely ruined if your demeanor gives it away. (Hint: oftentimes, a way to really get the best audience response from good news is to actually pretend like you have bad news to share. Then, at the last second, you share that you do in fact have good news, now bringing your audience from sadness to great surprise and happiness)

, Make sure to keep eye contact with your audience. If you don't, they may think you are lying.

Make sure that you have the proper materials that it takes to accomplish this.,
Let the grass grow.,
Consider what you want the actual message to read.,
Make sure you have access to a lawn mower.,
Mow the message into the overgrown lawn.,
Bring whomever you want to see the happy news to the lawn.,
Once the happy news has been communicated via lawn, you may enjoy it for a while but then should mow the rest of the lawn.

",How to Communicate Happy News4," You must have access to a fairly large lawn that can be seen in its entirety from a location higher above.

, For this method to really work, you must allow the grass to become overgrown, so that the mowed message will stand out.

, Remember, you probably don't have a ton of space, and writing a letter in a lawn is tricky, so less is more. Try to make the message as short as possible. If at all an option, try to use text lingo or letters in place of words (for example, the letter ""R"" instead of the word ""are""), to shorten the message.

, If you do not, you can probably borrow one from a friend or rent one.

, If you've never mowed a lawn before, you should try to enlist the help of a friend that has. (Tip: make sure the friend knows that you are trying to write a message with the lawn mower, not just trying to mow the whole lawn. If they do not know that you're writing a message, they may just mow the whole lawn.)

, To add extra suspense and drama, make them wear a blindfold until you are right in front of the lawn. (Do not put a blindfold on someone who will not consent to being blindfolded).

Find a bottle that is sealable and waterproof.

,
Write down the happy news on a piece of paper.,
Put the message into the bottle.

,
Go to your nearest ocean, lake, river, or pond.

,
Prepare to throw the bottle in.,
Throw the bottle containing the happy news into the water.",How to Communicate Happy News5,", If you don't trust the seal of the bottle, you might want to laminate the paper or put it in a sealed plastic bag.

,,, Make sure there are no people around the area where you're planning to throw the bottle, seeing as you could possibly hit them in the head or back. Also make sure that you're throwing the bottle gently enough that it will not break, because broken glass is bad for the environment.

, This method is best used if you don't care who sees your happy news or when they see it (if they see it), but you feel the need to poetically share your happy news.

"
Read the whole article carefully.,
Look at the headline.,
Ask yourself if the article helps or hurts anyone.,
Figure out who’s reading the article.,
Look for exaggerated or colorful language.,
Identify the reporter’s tone to see how they feel about the topic.,
Check out the images to look for bias.,
Make a list of the sources in the article.,
Examine the statistics and studies cited in the article.",How to Recognize Bias in a Newspaper Article1," Reading every single word in a newspaper article can be super time consuming, but it’s worth it when you’re trying to find bias in the reporting. Biases can be really subtle and hard to catch, so pay careful attention to the entire article.Set aside time each day to tackle one article at a time. This will help you practice the kind of skills you need to recognize bias, and you’ll go faster each time. Start by giving yourself about a half hour for an article that’s a few pages long.;
, Some people only read headlines, so they’re designed to communicate a clear point as quickly as possible. This means that using just a few words, most headlines make an argument. Evaluate each word to check whether they describe something positively or negatively. Ask yourself why the headline might not be totally neutral.For example, the headline ""Hundreds Attend Peaceful Protest"" tells a different story than ""Angry Riot Confronts Police.""

, Look at the words used to describe the people, political issues, and events mentioned in the article. If the language makes them sound good or bad, rather than just neutral, the reporter may be trying to influence you to favor one side over another.After you’re finished reading, take a minute to think about how you feel about the issue the article covered. Do you suddenly want to support a particular politician or fall on one side of political debate? If so, you’ll need to think about whether the article convinced you with facts or slanted language.

, Think about who typically reads this kind of article. Reporters might want to write stories that their readers will appreciate, which could lead to biased reporting. Try running a Google search to look for descriptions of the typical age, gender, racial background, income, and political leanings for the audiences of several newspapers and media outlets.Enter something like “demographics of New York Times readers” into the Google search bar. You may find information that’s a few years out of date, but your search should still give you a broad idea of who reads the paper.
Understanding newspapers’ usual demographics can help you think about what various groups of people care about. Younger readers might have strong feelings about education, since they’re still students. Older readers might want content about taxes and retirement.

, Consider whether the words the reporter uses in the article are informational or emotional. Watch out any time that a word or description makes you feel a strong emotion. If overly descriptive words are used to represent a particular group of people or side of a debate, this could be an especially big red flag.For example, an informational description of a politician could look like this: “Senator Smith is originally from Connecticut and is thirty years old.” Check out how this description makes the same content emotional: “Senator Smith comes from a rich town in Connecticut and is just barely out of her twenties.”
Look for words that reveal the reporter’s double standards. For example, one person might be described as ""passionate and inspired"" while another might be described as ""stubborn and rash,"" even if both people are showing dedication to a particular cause.

, Take note of any language that gives you a positive or negative feeling about information. If this emotion is coming from the way the reporter is writing the story, ask yourself why the reporter feels this way. They may be sad or happy about a particular event, or angry at someone.The best way to monitor your own emotions is to think about whether it’s the topic that’s making you feel something, or the way the article is written. Maybe the article is about a new amusement park opening in your town. This could be great news, and you may just be pumped about it. But if the article is about something you wouldn’t normally feel strongly about, and you do, ask yourself why.

, Photographs, cartoons, and other images tell stories just like words. Look for the main subject in the image and think about how this person or thing looks. Take note of any shadows or colors that make the subject appear scary or triumphant. Consider how the picture makes you feel, especially if you’re suddenly feeling sympathetic toward a particular group of people or side of a political debate., Determine how the reporter made their point. Look at every person who’s quoted, and check which company or organization they represent. Consider whether one type of organization gets more coverage in the article than others.Maybe the article is about a military conflict in a different country. Did the reporter quote from a balanced list of all the different people involved in the conflict? This list would probably include military officers and leaders, diplomats, politicians, and, most importantly, people from the actual country where the conflict is located. If the article only quotes, say, military personnel, read carefully to try and understand why that is.

, It’s hard to argue with numbers, which is why they’re included in so much reporting. Don’t let statistics intimidate you, even if you’re not a math person. You can still evaluate how the reporter used these numbers. Determine the connection between the stats and the author’s main point, and check to see if the stats make sense.Is the data cited in the article, or only the conclusions of the study? Did the author give you access to the full study? Did the author skim over the statistics without much detail and then make a strongly worded conclusion based on evidence they didn’t really give you?
If the article is only citing a small amount of information or data, ask yourself why that is. There may be other information in the study that the reporter decided to leave out.

"
Research the newspaper to find out their reputation.,
Look at the URL if you’re online.,
Read the “About Us” section for online media sources.,
Observe the placement of stories online or in a paper.,
Spend some time looking at the ads.,
Keep a record of the articles you read and biases you find.",How to Recognize Bias in a Newspaper Article2," Some newspapers and media outlets have a reputation for giving a particular slant on the news. Take note of the newspaper’s typical audience and the issues they usually support. However, don’t allow this research to keep you from reading each article critically. If we assume that something’s biased, we’ll believe that it is before we even read it!Check out websites such as Wikipedia and Snopes to see if the newspaper is known to have a particular bias.

, Sometimes, the website itself can give you a clue about whether your article is biased or even made up. A weirdly named outlet that you’ve never heard of may not be reliable. If the URL ends in .co, this could be a sign that you’ve found an illegitimate outlet posing as a real source of news.You should also be suspicious of weird language and typing in either the URL or the article. Anything that has lots of typos, all CAPS, or exclamation points needs a super close read. It could easily be biased or made up.

, Reputable news outlets will give you this kind of information. It should let you know who supports or owns the website or newspaper. If you can’t find this section, it could be a sign that the news outlet is trying to hide a sketchy source of income or information., Placement of stories tell you what the newspaper thinks matters and doesn’t matter in the world today. In a paper newspaper, the front page contains the big-deal stories, while the ones in the back are considered less important. In a digital newspaper, the articles the editors think are most important will be near the top of the front page or on a sidebar.What topics are covered in the most important and least important stories, based on placement? What does this coverage tell you about the newspaper’s priorities?

, Newspapers and news outlets need money to keep them running. Ads provide that money. Check where the majority of ads are coming from, and determine the category of the organization or company represented in the ads. This will let you know who the newspaper doesn’t want to make angry through their reporting.If one company or industry comes up in lots of ads, this could be a problem. It’ll be difficult for a newspaper to provide unbiased coverage if they’re trying to keep someone happy and out of the news.

, The more you read, the more you’ll discover about individual newspapers and the types of articles they write. Keep a journal of the articles you read, the newspapers they come from, and any biases you find. Be sure to note what the bias was in favor of or against.

"
"
Read more than one article about the same topic.,
Consider what or who the reporter didn’t talk about.,
Look for articles written by people from different groups.,
Go online or look on social media to see if the article got feedback.",How to Recognize Bias in a Newspaper Article3," Find articles from different newspapers or media outlets covering the same topic. Read critically to look for the different newspapers’ biases and compare them to one another. Use these comparisons to find facts that appear in both pieces. You can then make your own judgment about a debate, person, or event., This is especially important if the reporter is covering a hot-button debate. Both sides should be represented in unbiased articles. If the article is about a particular group of people, and the reporter didn’t quote any of those people, this could be a warning sign for bias.For example, if you’re reading a story about an environmental issue, and the article only cites politicians, think about why they didn’t quote any scientists. Is it because the topic was only related to politicians, or is the reporter ignoring one side of a debate?

, Most articles could be written entirely differently by a person with a different perspective. Look for articles written by people from different age groups, genders, regions of the country, political parties, and racial backgrounds. Think about how multiple perspectives add to your understanding of one, single topic.This may mean that you read one newspaper article and one blog post. It’s okay to read different kinds of sources to check on the bias of newspaper articles. Just be sure to read critically and carefully no matter where you find your information.
As you read more articles or sources, you’ll find that people, events, and debates are always super complicated. This means that there won’t be one simple explanation for any issue. Don’t get stressed out by this. Just try to learn as much as you can by reading widely. The more you know, the more prepared you’ll be to deal with complex problems.

, Sometimes, newspapers articles make people angry, frustrated, or (less often) excited. You can run a Google search to check if your article generated this kind of response. You might also want to check out Twitter if your article was published recently. Controversies over biased coverage can quickly go viral.Looking for this feedback can tell you a lot about who supports the content in the article and who doesn’t. While this won’t necessarily tell you if the article itself is biased, it’s a great way to discover who appreciates the reporting. This will help you figure out who the article helps and who it hurts.

Take a few deep breaths.,
Set a goal for your reading.,
Notice any emotions that come up as you read.,
Pay attention to your breathing.,
Take a break if you feel overwhelmed.",How to Read News Stories Mindfully1," Take 3-5 deep, slow breaths to help relax your body before reading the news. As you breathe out, let go of any distracted thoughts about work or school. If possible, try to find a time when you feel you can give the article your full attention. , Set an amount of time or number of pages you want to read during a given sitting. Then, think of the reason you are reading the article. Keep the thing you’re hoping to get out of the article in mind as you begin to read.You might say to yourself, “I want to read 5 pages of this article right now, and I’m reading it because I want to learn more about the new healthcare bill.”
Set a minute or page reading goal you know you can achieve. It’s best not to feel rushed.

, Pay attention to how you feel as you read, but don’t allow it to distract you from your goals. Acknowledge the feeling, and then continue reading. If the article raises questions, write them down to investigate later. This way you stay focused on your reading goal., Try your best to relax and breathe normally as you read. If the article causes feelings of anger or anxiety that are making you hold your breath, take a moment to exhale. Then, remind yourself of what you want to learn and continue reading., If the article upsets you so much that you can’t continue to process the information, take a break. Get a snack or play with your pet for a couple of minutes to decompress. When you feel ready, revisit the article. It can help to remind yourself of the reason you wanted to read it in the first place.Taking a break can help you feel refreshed and ready to tackle tough information.

Read the news regularly.,
Use articles to challenge the way you think.,
Work on accepting your feelings.,
Act on news that you care about.,
Meditate after reading the news.",How to Read News Stories Mindfully2," Develop a news reading routine that you feel you can stick to. This will help you keep informed about current events and allow you to practice awareness regularly. Maybe the first 20 minutes of your workday can be devoted to news reading, or you decide to read one article that interests you every day after dinner. It doesn’t matter what your routine is so much as that you stick to it.

, Seek out articles that challenge your normal thinking. It can help to question why you believe something or if the belief always holds true for you. Sometimes your natural tendency may be to only read articles that confirm your feelings on a certain issue. Try to use reading the news as a chance to push yourself outside your comfort zone.For example, you might decide to read a story about the daily life of death-row prisoner to challenge your thoughts about the criminal-justice system.
Exposing yourself to different points of view can give you a deeper understanding of the world. Even if you find your views on an issue do not change, a willingness to consider other perspectives can help you grow.

, Reading the news can sometimes feel uplifting and sometimes feel troubling. No matter how the day’s news makes you feel, make some time to process and accept those emotions when you are finished reading., Reading about difficult events on the news can be distressing. To cope, try turning your emotions into actions. You can donate money, volunteer your time or collect resources. This is a great way to help out your local community or even people in another country many miles away.

For example, if a news story about the future of the Arctic depresses you, consider making a donation to an organization that works to preserve polar bear habitat. This would be a healthy way of processing your negative emotions.
If you feel sad after reading about a lack of resources at your local school, you might volunteer there once a week to help fix the problem.

, Sit somewhere quiet and close your eyes for 5 minutes immediately after reading the news. Reading the news can give you a lot to think about, and clearing your head can help you carry on with your day. Focus on breathing in and out. Let your thoughts come and go without delving deeper until you feel calm."

Seek out reputable major publications and stations.,
Read the “About Us” section of your news source.,
Pay attention to the source’s web address.,
Read op-editorials in major newspapers for different points of view.,
Don’t check Facebook for your daily dose of news.",How to Read News Stories Mindfully3," Established major media outlets have fact-checkers on staff and reporters witnessing events as they unfold. Because of this higher journalistic standard, they are the most reliable sources of news. Avoid outlets that comment on or debate news topics rather than actually report. Seek out factual reporting will allow you to form your own opinion of current events.


Examples of wires and newspapers that are good sources of reliable news include the Associated Press, Reuters, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, and the Guardian.Magazines to seek out for accurate reporting include the New Yorker, Forbes, and the Economist.TV stations to seek out for reliable reports include the BBC, ABC news, and NBC news.National Public Radio is a good source of high-quality radio news.

, Be skeptical of any websites that use very dramatic or political language to describe their mission. These sources are likely providing commentary or opinion rather than factual news reporting. A good news organization will usually provide information about its leadership and a statement of ethics., Look for a professional website where the address ends in .com or .org rather than .com.co. These URLs are not used by major news organizations. Some fake news outlets try to create URLs similar to those of a major news sources ending in .com.co to deceive readers. Looking at the end of the address will always provide one clue as to the quality of the source., Op-editorials or “op-eds” are opinion articles of high quality published by the newspaper. They do not reflect the newspaper’s own point of view, but often they are written by professors and other professionals with expertise on a news matter. If you want to get different perspectives on a news topic, seek out op-eds on both sides of the issue in a major newspaper, such as the Washington Post or New York Times.Op-eds are not news. They are opinions, but stepping into other perspectives can help you understand points of view that are different from your own.

, Avoid forming opinions about current events based on what’s in your social media feed. Not everyone who posts information checks to see if the source of their post is trustworthy before they share. Sometimes they post because a sensational headline excites them or makes them angry. Continue getting your news from sources that fact-check and do actual reporting.If you see a friend or loved one posting something from a website that’s untrustworthy, you might text them to let them know. You could say, “Did you know that Purple News doesn’t have a fact-checking department or reporters? It’s actually an opinion site.”

Do a news detox.,
Filter your inbox.,
Focus on the causes you care about.,
Seek out positive news sources.",How to Read News Stories Mindfully4," Disable automatic news alerts on your phone or tablet if you find you’re feeling overwhelmed by the news. It may also help to take a break from reading articles online for a few days or hide news pop-ups in your social-media feed. Instead, use your time to perform an activity you enjoy. Something low-tech, such as walking or gardening, may help you regain some peace., Many email clients, such as Gmail, enable you to direct news alerts to a separate mailbox. If you receive newsletters or alerts digitally, filter them to another part of your inbox temporarily. Doing this will keep you from feeling ambushed by news in your main inbox when you’re trying to do work or chat with friends.You can even create a special inbox called “news” so that you can read these alerts when you feel ready.

, Choose news outlets that specialize their content in your area of interest, if you’re feeling overwhelmed. This will keep you from feeling swamped with other news you want to avoid for a few days. You can also choose to read only one section of the newspaper that most appeals to your interests for a period of time.

If you like foreign policy, for example, spend a week reading just Foreign Affairs or Foreign Policy magazine.
If you want to tune out national politics, you might choose to read only the local section of the newspaper for a few days.

, Replace your normal news routine with one that helps you look on the bright side. Certain websites and magazines, such as Positive News, specialize in quality reporting that is factual but also uplifting. If you find yourself feeling tired or overwhelmed by major news outlets, take a mental break with one of these sites. You’ll still have plenty to talk about with friends and may even lift their moods too."

Create a theme or focus.,
Decide how you will assemble your magazine.,
Establish a deadline.,
Write articles, columns and stories.,
Gather images.,
Design a cover.,
Choose a final aesthetic for your magazine.,
Decide how to order your content.,
Produce the layout of your magazine.,
Publish your magazine.",How to Make a Magazine," What is the primary topic of your magazine? Keep in mind that most magazines are niche publications that target a highly-specific audience (for instance, people who are interested in quilting or brides looking for wedding ideas).


Ask yourself: Will this be a standalone publication or one in a series? If it’s part of a series, what’s your larger theme?
Try to draw the title of your magazine out of this overarching theme. Note that most magazines have one- or two-word titles (such as TIME, National Geographic, Seventeen, Rolling Stone, and Forbes). Not only can a short title sum up your theme nicely, it's also easier to deal with from a design standpoint.
What’s the focus of this one publication? How can you use it to tie all your content together? (It’s not for nothing that a single publication of a magazine is called an “issue.”)

A good example of themed issues are the prom editions of teen magazines, or the Swimsuit Issue of Sports Illustrated. All of the content inside that issue ties back to the primary focus.


What’s the title of this issue? If necessary, what’s the title of the entire series?

Annual examples of titling an issue include the Swimsuit Issue of Sports Illustrated, the Hollywood Issue of Vanity Fair, and the September Issue of Vogue.

;
, The method you choose for putting your magazine together can determine how you gather and incorporate content. Here are some points to consider:


Though the glossy, software-enhanced look is a magazine standard, making one without the use of computers can give your magazine an art-house feel. However, this will require lots of extra time and talent and is best suited for people who have already done similar projects.
InDesign is the standard (though expensive) designer tool for digitally-designed magazines. The type is often written out and edited in InCopy, which meshes with InDesign. Alternately, some publications use Quark.

If these options aren’t in your price range, Office Publisher might be an effective alternative.



, When do you plan to have the magazine finished? Ask yourself if you're setting reasonable expectations, and if you can feasibly have the magazine finished and in the hands of your readers by the deadline.


A deadline is more important if you're dealing with topical issues (such as news or humor), or if you're building the issue around an annual event (such as fall fashion).

, What do you want to say to your readers? Whether your magazine is built around humorous anecdotes, arty fiction, news reports, high-brow interviews, or any combination or genres, you'll need textual content. Here are some possibilities to consider:



Write articles about topics you or your collaborators care about. Do they tackle humanitarian issues? Are they related to current events? Do they offer advice or interview interesting people?

Write short stories to give your magazine a more personal touch. These can be fiction or nonfiction depending on how they relate to your topic.
Dig up old poems, or ask friends if you can publish their work in your magazine. These would give a magazine an artistic flair.
Collaborating with friends to get different perspectives would be a great way to approach this aspect of the magazine.

, Even if your focus will be written content, magazines are a visual medium. Great images will keep your readers interested and add another dimension to your articles.



Take photographs that relate to your content. Be sure to include photos with empty, neutral spaces; these make great backgrounds over which to place written content.
Make a photojournalism project. This means exploring one topic in-depth and guiding the reader along with a series of photos. This is a good option for people with strong photography skills.
Search for images licensed with the Creative Commons license online. While all of these photos will be free, be sure to read up on whether or not you need to attribute the photo, have permission to alter the photo, or can only use the photo for noncommercial purposes.
Purchase stock images from a stock photography database. While this is a slightly more expensive route, stock photos are taken with exactly this kind of project in mind, making it easy for you to find images that correspond with your content.
Draw your own pictures, or join forces with someone who does. This is recommended for an art-house-style magazine.

, The cover of your magazine should give readers a tantalizing taste of everything that's inside, without giving away too much. Here are some ways to accomplish that:


Make sure your magazine's title is prominent. Though many magazines will change the color of their title from issue to issue, the font is almost always the same. Settle on one that's easy to read, recognizable, and has an aesthetic that matches your content.

Most magazines put this at the top of the cover, in order to make the brand prominent. For some interesting examples of how you can play with the interplay between the title and what's on your cover, look up cover images for Harper's Bazaar.


Decide what's going to be on the cover for this issue. Fashion magazines often use cover models, while gossip magazines use paparazzi or staged photos, and news magazines might use portraits. Whatever image you use, it should look compelling and be connected to your magazine's main story.
Write blurbs (optional). Some magazines will only write a blurb or a title for the main story (such as TIME or Newsweek), while others will tease several stories on the cover (such as Cosmopolitan or People.) If you choose the second option, try to make sure your cover doesn't start to look cluttered.

, How your magazine looks will define its brand almost as much as the content itself. Consider:


The font: Are you using fonts inside the magazine that are easy to read and fit with your theme? Do they call back to the font you used for your magazine's title, on the cover?
The paper: Are you going to print your magazine on glossy or matte paper?
The color: Some magazines, such as People, used to be half color, half black and white to save on ink costs. Many literary magazines are printed in black and white, though most mainstream titles have moved to color. Consider what you can afford to spend on ink per issue, and how you can incorporate that into your magazine's look and feel.

, How you organize your content inside the magazine dictates how the reader will flip through it. Here are some basic guidelines:


Usually the table of contents goes first. If your magazine has many ads, there can be several pages of them before the table of contents.
A colophon follows the table of contents. The colophon should list the title, the volume and issue of the magazine (both will be 1 if this is the first), the place of publication, and the personnel who worked on it (such as editors, writers and photographers).
Order your articles so that the main piece is somewhere in the middle, or even toward the back.
Consider doing a whimsical ""back page"". Many magazines, such as TIME or Vanity Fair use the last page of the magazine for fun, skimmable content, such as an engaging infographic or a silly interview.

, Once you know where you're going to put your content, it's time to lay it out. Exactly how you choose to do this will depend on what software you decide to use (or not), but there are certain elements to remember:


Keep your formatting consistent. Use the same borders, styles, numbering, and font or fonts throughout; the last thing you want is to create a Frankenzine that looks patched together by twelve different people.
Number your pages, especially if you've provided a table of contents.
Make sure your final product is even-numbered (counting the cover). If you try to make an odd-numbered magazine, you'll have at least one blank page.
If you're making your magazine by hand, now is the time to figure out how you'll transfer your content to the page. Will you print it out? Write it directly onto the pages? Paste on photos?

, You can do this the old-fashioned way by having it printed, or you can publish it online. Research your options to see what makes the most sense for your budget.


Bind your magazine (handmade only). When your pages are finished, you can bind the magazine so it will stay together. Consider some of the steps in Make a Homemade Book.

Gauge the overall response to your ad.",How to Create an Advertisement," Your business or product may appeal to a broad range of consumers, but for the purposes of advertising, it is usually helpful to think only about a specific subset of this potential audience. A single ad cannot appeal to or target every single person - accept this and then consider which consumers are most important for this project.;
, Imagine your target customer in your mind's eye. What approximate age or gender are they? Do they live in a major city or a more rural setting? What is their income range? What other products do they use or enjoy?


The more rich description your team can create here, the more targeted (and likely the more effective) your ad will be.

, Once you've described your target consumer's basic lifestyle and demographic information, now consider how that person interacts with your specific product. When will they use it and how often? Will they immediately recognize its benefits/functions or will you have to teach them?

, Do other products exist besides yours that perform similar functions? You have hopefully already designed your product with the competition in mind - now consider how your ad might specifically challenge (or complement) your competition's advertising efforts and how they might react to your advertising actions.

, Consider how your product is currently positioned - is it new or old? How can you distinguish your product from other, more established products? Do customers recognize/trust your brand already?


Also consider the competitive landscape and the customers who are currently in play. Are you hoping to convert people currently using the competition's product or will you target those without a current solution? Each approach has its own challenges.

, Based on the information you've now compiled about the audience you're trying to reach and how they might view your product, you're now ready to think about an ad strategy. Your strategy should take into account what are commonly known as the 3 C's: Company (you), Customer (them, your target), and Competition.


Strategy is a complex topic, but by focusing on the desires, strengths, and possible future actions of the 3 players on the field (yourself, your customer, and your competition), anyone can build a complex strategy over time.

, Keep it short and sweet; the average product needs no more than six or seven words. If you say it out loud and it sounds like a mouthful, edit it down. Whatever it is, it should grab the consumer's attention and convince him or her that your product is different from everyone else’s. Consider using:


Rhyme – “Do you Yahoo?”
Humor – “Dirty mouth? Clean it with Orbit chewing gum!”
A play on words – “Every kiss begins with ‘Kay’”
Creative imagery – Yellow Pages: “Let your fingers do the walking”
Metaphor – “Red Bull gives you wings”
Alliteration – “Intel Inside”
A personal pledge – Motel 6: “We leave the light on for you”
Dry understatement – Carlsberg beer has a big sign in downtown Copenhagen that reads, “Probably the best beer in town”.

, Your message needs to be top of mind at the consumer's point of purchase. The second your ad borrows a familiar advertising phrase (for example, “new and improved,” “guaranteed,” or “free gift” — is there any other kind?), it becomes interchangeable with thousands of others. What’s more, listeners are so used to ad clichés that they don’t even hear them anymore. (Just listen to Tom Waits’s Step Right Up to hear how meaningless clichés sound when strung together.)


What matters most is how the consumer feels, not what they think. If they feel good about your brand, you've done your job.
Startling the reader into paying attention is especially useful if you have a lot to say. For example, this long, environmentally-oriented announcement wouldn’t turn many heads if it weren’t for the unusual, confrontational tagline; if the reader wants to get the joke, she or he has to read more.
Know how to walk the line between controversial and entertaining. Pushing the limits of good taste to help your ad grab attention is common practice, but don't go too far — you want your product to be recognized on its own merits, not because it was tied to a tasteless advertisement.

, Note that persuasion doesn't really mean ""convincing."" The point is to make the consumers feel better about your product than anyone else's. For most people, how they feel determines what they buy. Here are some tried and true methods that advertisers rely on to make their ads stick. These include:



Repetition: Getting your product to stick by repeating key elements. People often have to hear your name many times before they even know that they heard it (Jingles are one way to do this, but can also be annoying). If you go this route, brainstorm a more creative, less obvious repetition technique such as the one that was used in the Budweiser frog commercials (“bud-weis-er-bud-weis-er-bud-weis-er”). people think they hate repetition, but they remember and that's half the battle.

Common sense: Challenging the consumer to think of a good reason why not to purchase a product or service.

Humor: Making the consumer laugh, thereby making yourself more likeable and memorable. This pairs especially well with refreshing honesty. Not the most successful business in your class? Advertise that your lines are shorter.

Exigency: Convincing the customer that time is of the essence. Limited-time only offers, fire sales, and the like are the commonest ways to do this, but again, avoid meaningless phrases that will slip under your customers’ radar.

, Even the cleverest ad won’t work if it doesn't appeal to the target audience. Are you looking for a certain age group? Do you want people with a set income level? Or maybe you're looking for a population with a special interest? Continually check back in with the targeted customer you previously outlined - would they respond to this ad or not?


Keep your target customer in mind when you're developing the tone and look of your ad. Remember: it needs to appeal to your audience as much as possible and avoid offending or talking down to them. Kids tend to be over-stimulated, meaning you will need to grab their attention on multiple levels (color, sound, imagery). Young adults appreciate humor and tend to respond to trendiness and peer influence. Adults will be more discerning and respond to quality, sophisticated humor, and value.

, Check back in with your strategy here. Make sure you are focusing on the most appealing aspect of your product. Why should it entice people? What sets it apart from other similar products? What do you like best about it? These can all be good starting points for an advertisement.


Ask yourself if your product or event is aspirational. Are you selling something that people would buy in order to feel better about their social or economic status? For instance, you might be selling tickets to a benefit gala that is designed to feel elegant and luxurious, even if the ticket price is well below what most wealthy people would be able to pay. If you are selling an inspirational product, try to make your advertisement exude an air of indulgence.
Determine whether or not your product is for practical means. If you're selling something like a vacuum cleaner, designed to perform common tasks or make life easier for the consumer, spin it in a different direction. Instead of emphasizing luxury, focus on how the product or event will provide relaxation and peace of mind to your consumer.
Is there an unmet desire or need, any frustration in the mind of your consumer, that will create a market for your particular product? Assess the need gap that exists for the product or service

, If your consumer needs to know your location, phone number, or website (or all three) in order to have access to your product, provide this information somewhere in the ad. If you're advertising an event, include the location, date, time and ticket price.


The most important element is what's called a ""call to action"". What should the consumer do immediately after viewing the ad? Be sure to let them know!

, If you're advertising for an event, start promoting it at least 6 to 8 weeks beforehand if it's going to accommodate more than 100 people; if it's less than that, start advertising 3 to 4 weeks ahead. If you're advertising a product, think about the time of year when people are more apt to buy what you're selling. For instance, if you're promoting a vacuum cleaner, it might sell better in the spring, when people are undertaking spring cleaning.

, Simple but unexpected is often the best route to take. For example, these stark, colorful silhouette ads that barely even show the iPods they’re peddling couldn’t get much more straightforward, but because they don’t look like any other ads, they are instantly recognizable.

, A burger is a burger is a burger, but if you let yourself think like that, you’ll never make your sale. Use your ad to highlight your product’s advantages over that of your competitors. To avoid lawsuits, keep to statements about your product, not theirs. For example, this Burger King ad mocks the size of the Big Mac while speaking the literal truth: that is a Big Mac box, after all, leaving McDonald's no legal ground from which to retaliate.

, A picture says a thousand words, and if a logo is effective enough, it can render text unnecessary (the backwards Nike checkmark, the Apple bitten apple, the McDonald's arches, the Chevron shell). If you're running a print or television advertisement, try to develop a simple, appealing image that will stick in the minds of viewers. Consider these points:


Do you already have a logo? If you can, think of fresh and creative ways of re-imagining it.
Do you have a commonly-used color scheme to work with? If your brand is instantly recognizable by the colors in the ad or the logo, use this to your advantage. McDonald's, Google, and Coca-Cola are good examples.

, How you create your ad will depend on which medium you're using to advertise. Note that if starting from zero, it takes a long time to acquire skill with a design app, or with design itself. In these cases it may be more helpful (and less frustrating) to browse freelance sites like craigslist and 99designs for design help. If you're looking to try it on your own, here are tech suggestions to get you started:


If you're making a small-scale print ad (such as a flyer or magazine advertisement), try using a program such as Adobe InDesign or Photoshop. Or, if you're looking for a free option, you can use GIMP or Pixlr.
If you're making a video ad, try working with iMovie, Picasa, or Windows Media Player.
For an audio ad, you can work with Audacity or iTunes.
For a large-scale print ad (such as a banner or billboard), you'll probably have to contact a print shop to get the work done. Ask which software they recommend using.

, If customers have the option of calling your establishment in response to an ad, for example, direct them to “ask for Mike.” On another ad, direct them to “ask for Laura.” It doesn’t matter if Mike or Laura even exist; what does matter is that the person taking these calls records how many people ask for whom. This is a free way to track which ads are bringing people in and which aren’t.

, If your ad is clickable online, or directs customer to an web address, you'll have immediate insight into how the ad is performing. Many data-tracking tools exist to help you get started.

, This is a great way to directly compare the performance of two separate ads that may be running simultaneously. Set up your website to have a different landing page for each ad you’re testing, then track how many people go to which. Now you have a simple, unobtrusive way to see which strategies draw the most people.

, If coupon-ing is part of your ad strategy, make sure each ad has a different color coupon so that you can tally them separately.

, Did sales seem to spike after your ad, or did they drop? Did your ad contribute to the new numbers, or were they due to forces out of your control? Evaluate how well your first effort went and take a lesson for next time.

Read all paperwork related to the agreement.,
Ask to meet or speak with the institution that is requiring your guarantee of payment.,
Negotiate the terms of the guarantor letter.,
Open a document in a word processing program.,

Supply any other information as requested by the company.,
Spell check the letter.,
Print the letter on personal or company letterhead.,
Employ a notary public to witness your signature and sign and stamp the letter.,
Make personal copies of the letter for yourself before turning it in.",How to Write a Guarantor Letter," Make sure you are comfortable with the transaction before you even agree to write the letter. Ask for a copy of the contract paperwork so you can assess the risks of guaranteeing the financial transaction. The responsibility of guaranteeing someone else's debt should not be taken lightly. Analyze whether or not you could actually cover the debt if the person you are guaranteeing defaulted on their payments.


You may want to have a lawyer look at the contract to make sure there aren't any loopholes.
If you are asked to write a guarantor letter for someone's travel visa, make sure that the person actually has the financial means to do the traveling they are planning on.;
, This could be a rental company, bank, consulate, or other institution. This is a good time to ask any questions you may have about the terms of the contract. It is always best to make sure you are not getting into a financially risky situation on another's behalf.


It is also a good idea to ask whether the institution has a a standard guarantor form that they require to be signed. This form may stand in for a guarantor letter you write yourself or, in rare cases, it may be in addition to your letter. Having a set form to fill out will simplify the process for you. Some examples of guarantor forms you may encounter are: A promisory note and A parental guarantee


, This may not be possible in every case but it is important that you feel comfortable with all of the stipulations of the agreement. In other words, if you don't want to assume financial responsibility for the contract as is, it doesn't hurt to try to change conditions you can't agree to. For instance, you may be able to only cover the debt or transaction up to a certain amount or avoid covering additional fees accrued after the initial transaction.

, You should type the letter rather than hand writing it because this is an important legal document.


Many word processing programs even have templates you can use for formatting letters. This will make formatting your guarantor letter much easier, especially if you have limited experience with word processing.
If a guarantor form has been supplied to you, simply fill in all the required information and return it to the institution from which it came.

, Also include your name, address, email address, and phone number at the top.


Some word-processing programs include this information automatically in your letterhead, so make sure you are not repeating this information in the header and the body of the letter.

, Be sure that the tone of your letter is official and straight forward.


For example, ""Dear Pine Street Property Management,"" is a simple, but appropriate, way to start your letter.

, Ultimately, this section explains to the reader why you are willing to take on this responsibility on someone else's behalf.

, Whether you are guaranteeing a rental agreement, a house loan, a visa application, or a business deal, for instance, you should state plainly in your own words what you are agreeing to do. This will serve to lay out the terms you are comfortable with and will make it clear to the reader what you have generally agreed to do.

, While this is probably not necessary in all circumstances, but this is a chance to clarify for the reader any special circumstances that need to be addressed. There is no need to be vague about why you need to guarantee the transaction, as the entity you are writing to should have all pertinent financial information already. Just simply and quickly state why you are needed.


If possible, immediately follow this information with why you believe the person you are signing for will make their own payments without you. In fact, to enter into this agreement tin the first place you should have a sense that this will be the case. State it to reassure your reader (and yourself).
In cases where you know you are actually going to make all the payments, for instance if you are guaranteeing the lease for your child's apartment while they are attending college, just make your responsibility clear.

, State your name, the name of the person you are signing for, and the exact transaction that you will guarantee. This is also where you can be explicit about any financial or date limits you have placed on the transaction. Be as specific as possible.


For example: ""I Richard Pearson hereby agree to guarantee and be liable for the payment of rent at 745 Sperry Street, Springfield, MO for the terms of the lease, as signed by Amy Pearson. This guarantee will remain in effect until December 22, 2012 or upon termination of the lease.""
If you are guaranteeing someone for visa purposes, you should state the applicant's name, application number, address and possibly their date of birth. It is a good idea to check with the applicant and the issuing consulate about what is expected in the letter.

, This may include a bank account number, annual income, social security number, home address or date of birth.


Be absolutely sure that this information is needed before including it in your letter. Providing this type of sensitive financial information should only be done with caution and with certainty about the security of the institution you are submitting it to.

, Its also a good idea to ask someone to proofread it. Two sets of eyes are always better than one.

, If you are writing a bank guarantee letter this is necessary, but a letterhead always looks more official for any type of transaction.


You may also be asked to have your supervisor sign and date the letter, for example if your company is guaranteeing a transaction, as opposed to you personally.

, This may or may not be required by the entity asking for the guarantor letter. If it is, remember to wait to sign and date your letter by hand in front of the notary and to leave space for a notary signature and stamp in your formatting.

, It is important that you have your own copy of what you have actually agreed to. Don't assume that the company you are submitting your letter to will provide you a copy later on.

Write an outline to start, which makes is easier in the end.,
Follow these steps:

Decide on a format.,
Put in that fancy paper, print a few demos and you’re done!

",How to Write a Holiday Letter," We all know we’ll have too much to do in December, so take the load off, plunk down at your keyboard, grab yourself a cup of your favorite bevy, and I’ll show you how to make it really easy.;
, I like the “year in review recap” format because it’s short and sweet and really transports you back to those special memories, making the task more enjoyable instead of a drudgery.






On your computer page, or tablet, write down all the months of the year.






Grab your calendar. Flip through the months to find out those things that jump out at you. This is not the time to document every appointment or every ball game. Pick out the memorable ones, where you can share a one liner about what you did that made that event so special. “Met Steve Nash pre-Suns game at the season opener”, is a good start. Do a highlight of every month. It’s okay if you have lots of things for one month and not too many for another month -- you’ll whittle it down. People love knowing highlights, not every… single… move. (What is that saying? I asked you for the time, not how to make the clock!)






Flip through some photos that you took during the year, using this as another way to remember those special highlights. The pictures don’t have to correspond with the calendar – sometimes we write things down, sometimes we take pictures.






Now is the fun part! Look at our outline, and create a few sentences or a blurb to highlight each item. Like the Steve Nash sample above, it doesn’t have to be a full sentence: “Celebrated Angela and Tom’s wedding on the east coast, reuniting with my sister for a sightseeing tour of Arlington and DC” – that says a lot – it says we went to a wedding, where they were wed, who we met up with and where we traveled. Avoid: We landed at the airport, picked up by Tom, spent four days with the family, and coordinated the flowers, oh and did we mention the car trouble that started when we….” It’s especially nice if you can highlight in terms that most of your “audience” (i.e., those friends and family who will receive your letter.) For instance if no one knows who Angela and Tom are, you might not want to include highlights of your time with them.






Do that for all your events, under the categories of each month or the quarter or just bullet point certain parts of the year.






Be sure to put a clever heading and a way for people to know your contact info. At the top maybe ‘Happy Holidays from the Millers” – and then at the bottom I write, Happy Holidays from (signatures go here). You can reach us at: address, emails and phone.






Next is to figure out if you are going to do your letter on a full 8-1/2 x 11 page, or a half page, or a different page orientation. Remember this is the space you have to work with. Is it on decorative paper, make sure you look a the margins for where text will be placed on that page. Figure that you will use 11 or 12 point type. If it’s too small (just to get more on the page) you’ll lose your reader in the first line. The point is to make them want to read on, not to bore them or hurt their eyes!

Recognize exaggeration.,
Understand symbolism.,
Understand labeling.,
Understand analogy.,
Recognize irony.",How to Analyze Political Cartoons1," Artists will often exaggerate or distort certain elements of the drawing to make a point. Some commonly exaggerated pictures might include a character’s facial features or other parts of the body., An artist may use symbols as placeholders for ideas or themes.


For example, a whirlpool may be used to denote the problems of getting involved with the messy political situation in Syria.

, The cartoonist may label certain elements in the cartoon. This will help identify the different pictures and ideas in the cartoon. Labels are often paired with symbols.


For example, the whirlpool that symbolizes Syria may be labeled as such.

, The cartoonist may compare two things that are not alike. This technique may be used if there is a complex topic or idea that is difficult to understand. By comparing it to something else, it can be easier for the reader to understand.


For example, if a political figure in the cartoon is pouring money into a toilet, this may mean that this politician’s policies on government spending are wasteful.

, An artist may use irony by using words or pictures to describe the opposite of what is, such as what should be. This is usually done with humorous effect.

Think about why you want to write the letter.,
You're not completely over the break-up yet, but you want the letter to be friendly?,
Say what you have to say.,
Do not talk about his/her flaws or the bad moments in your relationship, or if you do, make sure you keep it friendly and light.",How to Write a Friendly Letter to an Ex," Do you want to say something you didn't say back then? Or do you want to apologize for something? Whatever your reason is, don't make it sound like you're willing to get back together (unless if that's what you want).;
, You can try writing the ""bad things"" about it on a separate piece of paper and then burn it (try not to set anything else on fire). Show him/her that you're not bitter or childish, and at least try to write a mature letter about how you feel

, Don't think too much, just write what comes to your mind. Then you can sleep overnight and read it the next day, you may see it differently. If it doesn't sound like what you'd want it to, just write it again. Just remember not to keep on doing this for too long, the letter doesn't have to be grammatically correct or anything. The main thing is that you just finish the letter and send it to him/her.

, Saying bad things about them will change the way he or she sees the letter and you. Remain your pride and act mature.

Identify the visual elements.,
Identify the main focus of the cartoon.,
Look for widely recognized symbols.,
Take note of distortion or exaggeration.,
Look for stereotypes.,
Look for allusions to contemporary events or trends.,
Look at minor details.,
Pay attention to how the visual elements interact with each other.",How to Analyze Political Cartoons2," Take a look at the cartoon as a whole and make a note of the drawings you see. Make a list of the visual elements, including people, animals, other objects, and the setting or background.

, Find the portion of the cartoon that most stands out. Most often, this will be a caricature, which is an exaggeration or distortion of a person or object with the goal of providing a comic effect.

, Some metaphors are commonly used by political cartoonists.For example:


Uncle Sam or an eagle for the United States
John Bull, Britannia or a lion for the United Kingdom
A beaver for Canada
A bear for Russia
A dragon for China
A sun for Japan
A kangaroo for Australia
A donkey for the Democratic Party in the U.S.
An elephant for the Republican Party in the U.S.

, Look at the visual elements and pay attention to how they are drawn. People or animals may be exaggerated or distorted in some way., Some of the visual elements may be stereotypes. This might help the reader identify the visual elements more clearly. These can also call attention to the stereotypes as offensive and outdated.


For example, a cartoon about immigration along the southwestern U.S. border may present Mexicans dressed in ponchos. This calls attention to the view that some people have about who immigrates to the U.S.

, Some cartoons will link their subject matter to a current event or trend that is widely recognized.For example, a cartoon about voting might include a voting ballot with political candidates and celebrities, indicating that more people may be interested in voting for celebrities than government officials.
The effect of these allusions often diminish over time as people forget about those trends or events.

, Often the cartoon will have minor details that contribute to the humor or the point of the cartoon. Pictorial symbols convey minor themes or ideas. These are usually found in the background or on the sides of the cartoon.

, Think about how different symbols are drawn in relation to each other. If there is a person, where is he standing? What is he doing? Is he talking to another person? Is he interacting with an object?

"
"
Look at labels.,
Look at text bubbles.,
Read the caption.,
Take note of minor details.,
Brainstorm how the words enhance the pictures.",How to Analyze Political Cartoons3," Some people or objects might be labeled to identify them. Often these labels are placed so that the viewer will know what a particular object represents. For instance, a person in a suit might be labeled “Congress,” or a briefcase might be labeled with a certain company’s name.

, People in a cartoon will often speak to each other in the cartoon. Alternately, they will “think” something. Read what people are saying in the cartoon.


Text bubbles are usually represented by solid circles or boxes around the text. Thought bubbles usually look like small clouds.

, Some political cartoons have captions. These are words or phrases that are placed at the bottom of the cartoon. They give more information or interpretation to what is happening in the cartoon itself.

, The cartoon might also have one or more words in smaller print. These are intended to convey minor themes. They might be found in the background or on the edges of the cartoon.

, Once you’ve identified the symbols and other visual elements in the cartoon, think about how the words help describe them. What do the words add? How do the words enhance your understanding of the pictures and symbols?"
"
Identify the issue that the cartoon is referencing.,
Identify the people involved in the issue.,
Identify the perspectives of this issue.,
Do additional research on the issue.,
Determine the audience.",How to Analyze Political Cartoons4," Political cartoons typically comment on a certain event or issue. If you’re not sure about the issue, check recent news stories to identify the story.

, To give you more reference points, find out the names and roles of the people involved with the issue or event.

, The issue at hand will have different perspectives. If the issue is a war, there might be the pro-war position and the anti-war position. If the issue is a scandal in the news, competing perspectives might support different sides of the scandal.


Keep in mind that there may be more than two perspectives. Most news issues are complex and can have multiple perspectives.

, Find out the background of the issue, how it came about, who is impacted, and so on.


If the political cartoon is historical, find out what some of the main news stories and common beliefs were at the time. This will help deepen your understanding of the cartoon.

, A political cartoon is created with consideration to the experiences and assumptions of the intended audience. What section of the population is the publication geared towards? What country and locality do they live in? What are their political leanings?


For example, a political cartoon in a publication distributed in a strictly conservative tone will convey its message in a different way than it would if the audience was a particularly liberal group.

Identify adjectives that describe the emotions in the cartoon.,
Determine the artist’s perspective.,
Consider the rhetorical triangle.,
Think about how readers might respond to the cartoon.,
Determine the overall message.,
Evaluate the effectiveness of the cartoon.",How to Analyze Political Cartoons5," The words and pictures together will produce certain meanings. Many political cartoons are intended to portray some emotions. What emotions are present in your cartoon?, The artist will have a particular viewpoint about the issue in the cartoon. Once you’ve pinpointed the issue and the possible perspectives on this issue, you can figure out what the artist is arguing for.


Try to boil it down to one sentence. What is the artist trying to say with this cartoon?

, The rhetorical triangle is made of three elements: ethos, pathos and logos. These elements make up a forceful, effective rhetorical argument. Think about how the artist uses these elements in the cartoon:, Ethos: An ethical appeal that demonstrates the author’s legitimacy as someone who can comment on this issue.
Pathos: An emotional appeal that tries to engage with the reader on an emotional level. The artist might also use common ground to connect with the reader.
Logos: A rational appeal that uses logical and well-researched evidence to support an argument.

, The audience for the cartoon may agree completely with the message of the cartoon. Or, the audience might be shocked by the content. What is controversial about the cartoon?, Think about how the different elements about the cartoon shape what the overall message is. Boil it down to one sentence. How would you describe the cartoon’s message to someone else?, Once you’ve put together all the elements, determine if you think the cartoon is effective. Does it make a sound argument? Does it use appropriate and meaningful symbols and words to convey a viewpoint? Do the people and objects in the cartoon adequately represent the issue?"

, Famous people get a ton of fan letters. They are more likely to read a short letter. Try to keep your letter to one page or less.

, Take your time when writing the letter. You want the person to be able to actually read what you wrote. If your handwriting is not that good, you can type the letter instead.

Do not send anything that you would be sad about not getting back.If you only have one of something, make a copy and send the copy instead of the original. This way, you will not be upset if you do not get it back.
You do not have to send something for the person to autograph. You can just say, “I would love an autographed picture of you” or “Could you please send me an autographed picture?”
Always be polite when you ask and never demand that they send you an autograph. Do not say, ""Send me an autograph after you read this letter,"" or ""You better respond or you won't be my favorite anymore.""
Do not be upset if you do not get an autograph back. It has nothing to do with you. They are very busy people and cannot respond to every request.

Find their contact information.,
Address the envelope.,
Have enough postage.,
Do not expect a response.",How to Write a Fan Letter (Preteen)2," The best to place to find contact information is on a personal website. Read the information carefully. Some celebrities have a special address for fan mail. If you cannot find an address for the person, you may be able to find the address of their manager.


Some celebrities have an official website and an official fan club website. Use the address from the official website only., Write your name, address, city, state, zip code, and country name in the top left corner of the envelope. Write the celebrities address in the bottom right corner of the envelope. Be sure to include the name of the country if you are sending international mail. Double check that you have the right address.


Always write your address on the envelope. If there is an issue with the letter, the post office can return it to you. The format of the address will depend on the country you are sending it to.
If you were writing to a person in the United States, Joe Celeb, 100 Famous Dr., New York, NY 12345, USA.
If you were writing to a person in France, Joe Celeb, 100 avenue Famous , 75008 Paris, France.
If you were writing to a person in South Africa, Joe Celeb 100 Famous Dr., Pretoria, 0001, South Africa.
If you asked for an autograph, include a self-addressed envelope with your letter. This will make it easier for them to reply back to you.

, Place your letter in the addressed envelope to send it. Make sure you have enough stamps on the letter. If you do not have enough stamps, the post office will not deliver your letter.Check with a parent to see if you have enough postage.
If your letter is thick and/or heavy or being mailed overseas, you will probably need more than one stamp.

, Send the letter because you want to express how you feel about the celebrity. They cannot respond to every single letter that they get. Do not be sad or take it personally if they do not respond.If you do get a response, it probably will take weeks for it to arrive.

"
"
Use social media.,
Send an email.,
Do not be annoying.",How to Write a Fan Letter (Preteen)3," Most celebrities use social media platforms like Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook. You are much more likely to get a response using one of these methods. Reply to a post, send a direct message, or comment on a picture.Check their social media pages to see if they interact with their fans. Try to use the same methods as fans that have gotten a response. If you notice that the person replies more on Twitter than on Facebook, then Twitter is the best route to go.

, Some people may prefer emails instead of receiving letters in the mail. Check their website to see if they have an email address listed for fan mail. Your email should include the same information as a handwritten letter, but it should be shorter.Limit your emails to 4 or 5 sentences.

, There are many ways that you can contact people these days. It is tempting to use all of the methods to increase your chances of getting a response. However, this will actually make you look like a weirdo.


If you send an email, do not send a handwritten letter as well.
Do not send a direct message on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook at the same time.
If you contact a person too much, you decrease your chances of getting a reply.

,How to Write a Friendly Letter1,
"
Date the letter.,
Write a salutation.",How to Write a Friendly Letter2," If you're taking the trouble to write a letter by hand, it's nice to add a date on the top left corner of the paper. Many people save letters for years to come, and they like to be able to see what day and year it was written to reminisce about earlier times. Write out the date - for example, ""May 7, 2013"" - or abbreviate it using only numbers indicating the month, day and year.

, The beginning of a letter, whether it's handwritten or in the form of an email, is called a salutation. That's where you address the person to whom you're writing by name - for example, ""Dear Emily"" or ""Hello, Skylar."" Think about the nature of your relationship with the letter recipient, as well as your own preferences and style, and choose your greeting accordingly.


If you tend to like to write in a slightly formal style, using ""Dear"" in your salutation is a nice choice. It sounds typical, but think about it: calling someone ""dear"" is actually very sweet, and indicates that you care about him or her. However, you don't have to read into it; ""dear"" is as appropriate for a letter to your best friend as it is for a letter to an acquaintance you just met.
For a letter that is more casual in tone, consider beginning it with ""Hi, "" or ""Hello, ."" This greeting is appropriate for a friend or relative, but don't begin a business letter this way; it's a bit too casual.
Write a more personal greeting for someone with whom you are intimate, or want to be. For example, ""Dearest ,"" ""My "" or ""Sweet .""
Be sure to end your greeting with a comma. It is also formally correct to begin the body of the letter on the next line.

"
"
Begin with some pleasantries.,
Share news and personal details.,
Reference topics that are relevant to your friend.",How to Write a Friendly Letter3," The first paragraph of a friendly letter is usually warm and lighthearted. It's a way to set the tone of the letter, letting the recipient know that what's to follow will be more friendly than businesslike or serious. Use the first few lines to say an extended hello, tell a joke, or reference the season.


""How are you doing?"" or ""How have you been?"" are common ways to start a letter. Asking a question helps make the letter feel like part of a longer conversation. If you'd like a reply to your letter, feel free to pepper it with questions throughout.
You can use the first paragraph to inquire more deeply about the recipient's life. For example, ""I hope little Julie has been enjoying kindergarten. I can't believe she's gotten so big!""
Referencing the time of year is another common letter opening. Think of it as the equivalent to making small talk before you launch into a deeper conversation. For example, ""I hope you've been having a wonderful fall. The trees in my neighborhood are more brilliant than they've ever been before. I think we're in for a cold winter, though.""

, Now it's time to get to the meat of the letter, your purpose for writing it. Why are you opening this correspondence? Do you want to get back in touch with a long lost friend, express to someone that you are missing them, or thank them for helping you out in some way? Be forthright, open, and articulate to communicate your message effectively.


Write about what's happening in your life. No matter what it says, your letter will probably be appreciated, but the recipient will feel much closer to you (and therefore the letter will be more effective) if it's revealing. Tell what events have occurred, what emotions you've felt, and what plans you have for the future.
Don't create an airbrushed picture of your life; that defeats the purpose of a friendly letter. Avoid a holiday newsletter-style update; your friend will start skimming to the bottom if you just list everything you've accomplished since your last letter. You don't have to go too deep into your troubles, but try to portray your life realistically.

, What was your friend up to last time you talked? Was she on the verge of breaking up with her boyfriend? Was he in the middle of a difficult season on the soccer team? Follow up by making references and asking questions to show you're interested in your friend's life.


You can also discuss topics of mutual interest. Write your thoughts on art, politics, current events, or any other subject that you'd discuss with your friend in person.
Consider suggesting movies you've seen that you think your friend would like, or books you've read that you want to recommend. Sharing good information is always welcome in letters.

"
"
Wrap it up.,
Write a closing.,
Consider including a postscript.",How to Write a Friendly Letter4," Write a final paragraph sending your friend or loved one best wishes. The last paragraph is usually lighter in tone than the body, but it should match the general feel of the entire letter. Try to end the letter on a note that will leave your friend with positive feelings.


Reiterate the purpose of the letter. For example, if you invited your friend to come to a party, write, ""I hope you can come!"" If you simply wanted to wish your friend a happy season, write, ""Have a wonderful Thanksgiving!"" or something to that effect.
Encourage your friend to write back. If you'd like a response, write, ""Hope to hear from you soon,"" or, ""Please write back!""

, The closing you choose should be in keeping with the feel of your letter, whether it is traditional or more casual in tone. Like the salutation, it should be determined by your relationship with the recipient. Follow the closing by signing your name.


If you want to write a formal closing, consider ""Sincerely,"" ""Warmly,"" or ""Best wishes.""
If your letter is more casual in tone, try ""Yours,"" ""Take care,"" or ""Cheers.""
For a more intimate closing, choose ""Love,"" ""Much love,"" or ""Thinking of you.""

, A postscript, or PS, is often included at the end of friendly letters as a way to add information that isn't important enough to merit its own paragraph in the body of the letter. You could also write a playful joke, or leave it out altogether. In any case, make sure it matches your letter's tone and leaves your recipient with the feeling you want him or her to have.

Start off your letter by giving a little 2-3 sentence introduction about yourself.,
Say how it is you got to know about them.,
Write about how you feel about them.,
Be sure to include a description of anything that this celebrity has done that personally made an impact on your life in some way.,
Compliment them.,
Mention that you'll be hoping for a response.,
Wish them luck.,
Add 'Yours sincerely' or 'From your biggest fan' at the bottom with your name to be polite.,
Be sure to include a self-addressed, stamped envelope if you want them to respond back to you.,
Find their address and put on a few stamps.",How to Write a Fan Letter," Don't lie to make it sound better. Consider including some basic details such as your first name, what country/town you're from and your age.


Don't be afraid to tell a personal anecdote or story about how you were first inspired by their work or what their work means to you. Keep it short.
At the same time, avoid sharing too many personal details. Even though you might be familiar with this celebrity's work, this is still a stranger you are writing to.
You may want to start with writing a draft on the computer first and then using the finished draft to write a real letter.

, Was it through a friend? Radio? Maybe it was through a TV show or a movie that you happened to see at the cinema. Whichever it is, include a few sentences about that so that the celebrity will understand the connection.

, Are they good musicians? Actors/actresses? Do you have a huge crush on them? Tell them, although you might want to hold off on that last one! Express what it is you enjoyed about their work.


Be specific, honest and sincere with your praise.
If you're really stuck for ideas on how to approach this, you might find that it helps to check out some online examples of the types of things other celebrity fans have written - just to get an idea.
Alternately, if it's at all possible, ask somebody you know who's written a fan mail to a celebrity before for inspiration.

, For example, if it's an actor, maybe they played a character in a story that happened to go through something that you personally experienced in your life and could relate to.


Or maybe you're writing to a singer, and she went through a similar childhood as you, offering you hope.

, Tell them you liked their outfit at the Grammy's, or appreciated how they dealt with criticism or pressure from the media. Everyone likes getting compliments...including celebrities!

, If you want the celebrity's autograph by all means go ahead and ask. But be sure to keep the tone of your letter polite and respectful without coming across as pushy. The celebrity you are writing to is very likely to appreciate it and be more likely to respond.


You could consider saying something along the lines of ""If you could find some time to respond I'd appreciate that, but I'll understand if you don't.""
Don't make up a lie saying you'll die in a month and the only way to cheer you up is to hear from them. That's the wrong kind of attention. Be honest about what you're writing.

, Make sure to wish the celebrity luck with their future career when ending the letter. Again, this is something that they are highly likely to appreciate.


You could also consider adding a line about how much you are looking forward to seeing their future work, if you feel that way about them.

, Do not use Lots of Love or Love from, etc. as it might scare the celebrities away from writing back.

, This will help save the celebrity time if it happens that they get to read your letter and consider replying to you. You might also want to consider including an index card - or maybe a published photo of the celebrity you might have around - for the celebrity to write his/her autograph on.

, Use the internet to locate the address of their agent, publisher, management company, or record label. Label the envelope and send away!


Some celebrities have their own website. Exploring this will give you a better idea of where to mail your letter.

Find the handwriting.,
Choose some colors.,
Start off rambunctiously.,
Write the letter.,
Put emphasis on certain things.,
Don't refrain from being inspiring.,
Have a strong closing.",How to Write a Cute Note to a Friend," Find a fun type of penmanship (check out dafont.com) and use it! Practice it, writing the whole alphabet in capitals and lowercase. You can also write the sentence, ""the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"", which uses every letter in the English alphabet.


If you want to write a sentimental or sincere note, use your normal handwriting or a more sophisticated or plain penmanship.
Practice in your preferred writing utensil. Whether you'll use pencil, marker, pen, Sharpie, etc. you should work on the handwriting with that utensil. Otherwise, it may not appear as you originally thought it would.

There's more differences in writing with marker than with Sharpie than you'd think!

;
, From whatever type of writing utensil you've chosen, pick some nice colors that go together. Being colorful is part of writing a fun note to your friend, especially if your note doesn't want to come across as too serious. Being colorful (and maybe even obnoxious with them) is part of the excitement!


For bright colors, you can use purple, pink, sky blue, lime green, and baby blue.
For dark colors, you can use maroon, blue, purple, brown, green, silver, and gold.

, Put ""Hey!"" ""Hello!"" ""Heyyy!"" ""What's up?"" ""Hi-hi!"", etc. If you're close with the person, you can even give her pet names, with introductions such as ""Hey there, Angel!"" ""How are you, gorgeous?"" ""Hey babe!"" ""Hello xoxo"" ""Hey there, love <3"" etc. Have a great greeting that matches your letter.

, Mention her best features and recognize funny moments. If you have a topic, stay on track. Show your meaning on certain words with cursive, capitals, etc. Let her know you care and enjoy her company. Have fun writing, most importantly!


Don't put down anything you'll regret. Even if they don't notice or care, it'll hurt you.

, Write some words big, in all capitals, in cursive, italics, bold, and other things. Put a funny remark on the page, but thinly put a line through it. Add lots of exclamation points or question marks when necessary.

, Use quotes or important notes. Be her role model through a letter, in case you ever have to be apart. Remind her that she's special, and somebody important to you who shouldn't blend with the crowd.


If she's not overly-sensitive and you're very close, you might be able to nudge at a small flaw of hers (always recover with a compliment or quote afterward).

, End with a quote, an inspiration piece, a saying, a casual remark, a funny joke, or an inside joke. Something that you come up with. Sign the letter, with a final closing such as ""love"" ""sincerely"" ""yours"" ""forever"" ""always"" ""anytime"" etc.


Have a signature. Whether it's your name in cursive or a heart, xoxo, a note in the P.S., etc. End every single note from there on with this signature.

With pen and paper, compose your letter as you normally would.,

Address the customer by name.,
Express the reason for appreciation.,
Make reference to future interactions.,
End the letter with a personal sign off.",How to Write a Customer Appreciation Letter1," Begin your letter with a greeting that includes the customer's name. Make sure the customer's name is spelled correctly. The letter will lose some sincerity if the customer's name is spelled wrong.


Start the letter by saying ""Dear"" followed by the customer's first name.If you are trying to be informal you can start the letter by saying ""Hi"" or ""Hey"" followed by the customer's first name.;
, Use the specifics of your experience with them and how that experience was positive for the business.Are you thanking the customer for his or her first purchase? Did the customer leave a positive review of your business online? Did the customer refer a friend to your business? Did you have nice interaction with the customer in your store? Whatever the customer did, make sure you include it in your letter.


Being specific about the reason you appreciate the customer lets the customer know that you are really paying attention and focusing on him or her.
Always thank the customer genuinely for their business and support as well.
If you are writing to a loyal customer, you may say, ""Thank you for being a loyal customer and supporting my business for many years.""
If you are thanking a new customer, you may say, ""Thanks you for trying out our _____. We love when new customers give us a shot.""

, Let the customer know that you are looking forward to seeing them again or serving any of their future needs.Your letter is a genuine show of your appreciation, but it is also a marketing tool to get repeat business. If you plan to contact the customer at a specific time, include that in the letter as well.


Mention future interactions in the closing sentence or paragraph.
As an incentive to have a future interaction with a customer you can include some type of incentive in your appreciation letter like a coupon or gift card.

, If you were writing a business letter, you may end the letter by saying ""Sincerely"" or ""Best Regards."" Remember that an appreciation letter is more personal.

Always write your name after the sign off.

Send the letter unexpectedly.,
Hand-write the letter.,
Be sincere.,
Use a friendly tone.,
Use personal pronouns.",How to Write a Customer Appreciation Letter2," A letter out of the blue can be a nice surprise for a customer. Your can send a letter marking the customer's anniversary with your company, after a certain number of purchases, or just for no reason at all. Random appreciation letters build your brand and are a way to keep your business on the mind of customers.Unusual holidays such as ""National Napping Day"" or ""National Pi Day"" are opportunities to have fun with your customers and send a letter.Unexpected letters can be short and simply say something like ""We just wanted you to know how much we appreciate you/your business.""

, A handwritten letter shows a greater appreciation than an email or typed letter. Most individuals, let alone companies, do not hand write letters anymore. A hand written letter will set you apart from other businesses.If you are unable to write the entire letter, take the time to sign your name at the bottom of the note for a personalized touch.If you are writing the letter on behalf of a position holding member of your company, like the President or CEO, have them sign the letter in place of yourself.

, Make sure you're writing in a style that is truthful, professional and warm. Overdoing praise can seem insincere. You want the letter to express honest gratitude in a professional manner. Your customer will be able to tell if you are being genuine. If you overdo it, you may actually rub your customer the wrong way.You never want your customer to feel as if they are receiving a generic letter that was sent to all of the other customers.Your letter may differ based on your relationship with the customer. The letter to a loyal customer of 5 years may differ from the letter to a new customer.

, Write the letter in the same voice that you speak. If the letter sounds too formal, it can sound cold and business-like. Use contractions instead of writing out words. For example, say ""I'd"" instead of ""I would"" or ""don't"" instead of ""do not.""Even though you are writing how you would speak, use proper grammar and punctuation.
Read your letter out loud once you are done writing. If it sounds like you are talking to a friend, you are on the right track.

, Use pronouns such as ""I,"" ""we,"" and ""you"" in your letter and write in an active voice.In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action. You would say, ""We will send you more information about our customer rewards program,"" instead of ""Information about the customer rewards program will be sent to you.""


The combination of personal pronouns and active voice helps the letter sound friendlier.
Your letter will also be easier for customers to read if you use active voice. Writing in passive voice requires you to use more words to get your point across."

Send a small gift.,
Have a customer appreciation event.",How to Write a Customer Appreciation Letter3," You may interact with your customers on different social media platforms. Show your appreciation by thanking a customer on Twitter or Facebook.If your customer interacts with you regularly on social media, you can be sure that they will see what you have said.Social media gives you an opportunity to publicly show appreciation for your customers.

, A small gift can have a positive impact on your customers.The item can be a product associated with your brand, unique to where the company is located, a free gift with a purchase, or even access to special content on your website. Cookies are also a great way to thank your customers.For example, if your city is known for its barbecue, you could send a small jar of barbecue sauce from a local restaurant.
You could also send a gift for your customer's birthday or anniversary with your business.

, A customer appreciation event shows your customers that you are willing to go the extra mile to acknowledge them. Your event could include giveaways, discounted merchandise, free shipping on online orders, or a free event at your store.

Pick your therapist.,
Know what needs work.,
Make your appointment.,
Do your preliminaries.,
Get ready.,
Enjoy your massage.,
Drink water.,
Have a snack.Even though you were just lying on a table doing nothing, your digestive system was still at work during your massage, and chances are that you'll be hungry.,
Give yourself time to relax after the massage.,
Be prepared for some soreness.",How to Prepare for a Massage," If you don't already know who you want to go to, it's important to do your research to find a massage therapist. Ask your friends, look online, and simply glance around at some nearby places to know what you're working with.;
, Based on your job, you're more likely to have knots in certain places. Massage therapists are trained to know where knots are, so don't be afraid to let your therapist know that you do something that often causes your knots.

, Once you have a basic idea of who you want and what you'll need, contact the therapist's office and make an appointment. If you have a certain date in mind, try calling about a week in advance - it's hard to get an appointment one or two days before.


If you have preferences, let the office know in advance. Want someone of a certain gender? Are you or the person you're calling for under eighteen? Sprained your ankle a few weeks ago, and it's still a bit tender? They will want to know this as soon as possible, so let them know.
You'll want to relax after your massage. If at all possible, try to book at a time when you know you'll have a period afterwards to chill out.

, Depending on the office and whether you've been there before, you may need to fill out a form or simply speak with your therapist for a few minutes. This is to decide what spots on you need work, if you have any medical conditions, e.t.c.

, Most likely, your massage therapist will request that you strip down to your preferred undergarments (if any) and will leave the room. You do not have to get entirely naked, although the more you have on, the more boundaries the therapist will have.

, Finally, you can relax. If you've never had a massage before, a good place to start is at a simple half hour massage, although you're welcome to go for any amount of time.

, The oils used by massage therapists has a ""detox"" effect, but this can dehydrate you. Drinking a bottle of water after your massage will very much help to prevent this.

, Eat something after your massage to keep your blood sugar even.

, If you don't have anything to do for a while afterwards, simply leave on the oils, drink lots of water, and chill out. However, if you need to do something, it's a good idea to wash off the oils - you may feel like a freshly-greased chicken with them on, plus there's a slight possibility they can get on your clothes. Many spas that offer massage also have showers you can use. Another alternative to this is to use your own oil, you can choose a ""dry oil"" which leaves little to no residue.

, Whether it's directly after your massage, a few hours later, or the next day, chances are that you'll be sore soon, especially if you had a deep tissue massage.This is perfectly normal, and it's caused by lactic acid flooding your system during the massage and can be cured by drinking a lot of water to flush it out of your body.

Remove your clothes and wear whatever makes you comfortable.,
Before the massage, a hot sauna or shower, if possible is nice.,
Lie on the table, and be aware of your breathing.,
Try not to talk for most of the massage.,
As the therapist moves the sheet to work on a part of your body, don't move for them or hold limbs up as they secure the sheet.,
Think of your massage not just as one artist doing his or her job but two artists - you and the therapist - working together.",How to Receive a Massage," There will be a sheet covering your body. The therapist only pulls away the part of the sheet of the part of the body they are massaging. Be suspicious if they want to force you to strip.;
, Hot water, especially steam, tends to loosen up the muscles and prepares the skin.

, Do two or three deep breaths and exhalations when you lie down. These should be slow in and a little faster on the exhale.

, Silence is another gift which can have an immeasurable impact on your peacefulness. When the therapist is pushing down on muscle, let the air out of your lungs in time with the pressure. Breathe in as the therapist pulls back his or her pressure.

, A properly trained therapist will not need your help and the tension inhibits your relaxation.

, A dance. Be involved and aware of the touch and pressure. Do your part to breathe into and out of the massage. Once you know your therapist, the two of you can develop an intuitive and autonomic partnership of your muscles almost rising to meet the pressure and your therapist's hands and arms knowing exactly when to push, press, rub or tap.

Use sunscreen.,
Use concealer.,
Use a green tinted concealer.,
Watch what you eat.,
Quit smoking.,
Wear natural fibers.",How to Remove Redness from Skin1," Sometimes your skin can be red due to overexposure to the sun. Make sure you wear sunscreen whenever you are going to be outside for long periods of time to avoid the risk of sunburn.;
, Sometimes people get splotchy red patches which can be embarrassing, especially in highly visible places like the face. If you suffer from red patches of skin that have proven untreatable in other ways (and you are sure they are not caused by an infection of some sort), try covering the red spot with some foundation or concealer. Make sure you match your natural skin tone to blend the color as smoothly as possible.


Even men should be able to use concealer without worry if they match their natural skin tone carefully and use it sparingly.

, If regular concealer doesn’t work, try using a concealer with a mint tint to cover the unsightly red color. As weird as it sounds, the green color will help counterbalance the redness underneath for a more natural skin tone., Certain foods are naturally high in antioxidants that help hydrate the skin and protect it. Foods like sweet potatoes, broccoli, and carrots have high levels of these kinds of antioxidants. Avoid foods that are spicy; these can trigger symptoms of redness in the skin., Smoking tobacco can cause many problems for the human body and the skin is no different. It is common knowledge that smoking can leave skin with a yellowish tint and can accelerate the visible signs of aging, but smoking can also prevent the skin from receiving the necessary nutrients and oxygen., Sometimes redness on the body can be triggered by the clothing you wear – often due to eczema,textile contact dermatitis,or simply from a sensitivity to various types of clothing material. If you are seeing signs of redness that seems to be caused by your clothing, switch to natural fibers like cotton, silk, or linen and see if that helps.

Use products for sensitive skin.,
Avoid sun exposure.,
Get some antibiotics.,
Avoid alcohol.",How to Remove Redness from Skin2," People who have rosacea are more sensitive to harsh chemicals in skin products than those without it. If you suffer from rosacea, you should be exceedingly mindful about what kinds of products you use on your skin. Look for brands that are designed for sensitive skin or that advertise fewer chemicals that can be harmful to the skin.

, Protecting your skin from the sun is important for everyone, but it is especially crucial for those with rosacea because their skin is particularly sensitive. Use quality sunblock that is free from harmful chemicals., Ask your doctor to prescribe you some antibiotics to treat your rosacea. This will help eliminate the infection and reduce redness. Topical antibiotics are best, but oral antibiotics can also be effective., Drinking alcohol dehydrates the body and deprives the skin of its natural moisture. This can be a significant trigger for people with rosacea."
"
Moisturize your skin.,
Use steroid cream.,
Use products intended for sensitive skin.,
Avoid hot showers.",How to Remove Redness from Skin3," Eczema usually occurs in people with generally dry skin. It’s not definitively known what causes eczema, but experts usually recommend that the first step in treating eczema is to keep your skin moisturized.


Use an emollient (moisturizer) like lotion, cream, or ointment that uses oil to keep your skin hydrated and supple., Addressing the inflammation of the skin is the next step in treating eczema. Your doctor can prescribe you a steroid cream that is meant to be used only during eczema flare ups. The steroid cream will help reduce inflammation in the skin and help clear up the current case of eczema, thereby reducing the redness of the skin.

, If you have eczema, you should avoid using harsh soaps that are scented or include deodorant. These products can strip your skin of the natural oils that help protect the skin and keep it hydrated., Hot/steamy water can strip your skin of natural oils, so it is best to take lukewarm showers and baths if you suffer from eczema or other dry skin issues. This will help your skin maintain some of its natural oils."

Ask the patient to lie on their back.,
Place an electrocardiograph (ECG) on the patient.,
Monitor the patient’s blood pressure.,
Find the carotid sinus massage point.,
Massage the right carotid sinus for 5–10 seconds.,
Massage the patient’s left carotid sinus.,
Direct the patient to lay still for 10 minutes.,
Stop performing a CSM if the ECG shows asystole.,
Stop the CSM if the patient faints.,
Do not administer CSM to patients with carotid sinus hypersensitivity.",How to Perform a Carotid Massage," For safety purposes, a CSM should only be performed on a reclining patient.If you’re in a medical office, you can ask the patient to lie on an examination bed. If you’re performing the CSM at someone’s home, ask the patient to lie on a couch or bed.

It’s important that the patient be lying down, in case they experience any lightheadedness or loss of consciousness (unlikely but possible) from the CSM.;
, This medical tool will monitor the electrical activity of the patient’s heart while the CSM is administered. Since the CSM is primarily a diagnostic measure, the ECG is valuable in determining the cause of the patient’s dizziness, falls, faints, or other unusual mishaps related to abnormal heart activity.Even if you’re performing a CSM to reduce a patient’s excessively rapid heartbeat (super ventricular tachycardia, or SVT), you should still monitor the heart’s electrical activity via ECG., A correctly performed CSM will yield information about a patient’s heart rate and blood pressure, and may also correct an ongoing accelerated heart rate. Record the patient’s systolic and diastolic blood pressure after each massage.If you find that the patient’s heart rate or blood pressure are increasing, stop performing the CSM.

Once the patient has lain down, and you have applied the ECG and began monitoring blood pressure, wait about five minutes before beginning the procedure. This will allow the patient’s heart to slow to a resting rate.

, There are two carotid sinuses, and you’ll need to perform a CSM on each. The carotid sinus is located in the patient’s neck. Find the front mid-point of the patient’s neck (near their Adam’s apple), and identify the angle of the patient’s jaw. Then trace your finger around the side of the patient’s neck, until it’s directly below the angle of their jaw. Your finger should be resting on the patient’s carotid sinus.The angle of the jaw should be the location at which their jawbone bends, about 4 inches (10 centimeters) back from the tip of their chin.
The second carotid sinus will be located in the identical position on the other side of the patient’s neck.

, A CSM is usually first performed on the right side of a patient’s neck. Press firmly on the patient’s carotid sinus massage point. Using a circular motion, rub and massage the carotid sinus for a period of 5–10 seconds.Avoid pressing too hard, or you may risk reducing the flow of oxygen to the patient’s brain. As a rule of thumb, use the amount of pressure that you would need to indent the surface of a tennis ball.

, After performing the carotid massage on the right side of a patient’s neck, repeat the massage on the patient’s left carotid sinus. Massage in a circular motion for 5–10 seconds.After each portion of the CSM has been administered, you or a medical assistant should record the patient’s heart rate and baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

, Following the completion of the CSM, the patient may experience some light headedness, or may feel mildly dizzy. Ask them to continue lying supine for another 10 minutes. This will allow their heart rate to return to regular (if it was abnormally high to begin with) and will allow a healthy level of oxygen to return to their brain., Asystole is a serious form of cardiac arrest (heart attack) which may be caused by the CSM. If the ECG monitor shows asystole for over 3 seconds, stop performing the maneuver immediately.If the patient’s cardiac arrest continues once you’ve stopped administering the CSM, you may need to begin performing live-saving measures.

, If the patient loses consciousness in any way while you’re performing a CSM—even if it’s only for a brief period—stop administering the massage. You or a medical assistant should record that the patient experienced syncope (loss of consciousness) or pre-syncope (dizziness or lightheadedness immediately preceding unconsciousness).If you’re performing the CSM for diagnostic purposes, ask the patient if the lightheadedness or fainting that they just experienced is similar to other symptoms they commonly experience.

, Patients with carotid sinus hypersensitivity, or CSH, are acutely sensitive to pressure on their carotid sinus. This condition most commonly afflicts men older than 50, although women over 50 can experience CSH as well. Administering a CSM to a patient with CSH can lead to cardiac arrest or other serious heart and blood-pressure conditions.Ask your patient if a physician has diagnosed them with CSH, or if they have ever had a negative reaction to—or lost consciousness during—a carotid sinus massage.

Use a light touch.,
Stretch the skin instead of moving along it.,
Massage with the normal lymph flow.,
Use the correct rhythm.",How to Perform Lymphatic Drainage Massage1," When you are doing lymphatic massage, you want to make sure that you don’t press too hard. The lymphatic vessels are located right under the skin, so if you press too hard, you are going to go deeper than the vessels. Press down enough so that your fingers are not sliding over your skin, but make sure that you can’t feel anything beneath the skin.You may feel like this is too light, especially if you are used to deeper tissue massages.;
, You may be used to giving or receiving massages where you glide along the skin. A lymphatic massage needs to stimulate the lymphatic vessels, which are elastic and attached to the skin. You need to lightly stretch your skin to massage them., The direction of your stretch of the skin is important. You should stretch the skin in the direction that the lymph flows naturally. You want to help stimulate the natural flow. If you stretch the skin the wrong way, you are doing nothing. The lymph flow goes towards your trunk and heart.Make sure to take your fingers off the skin after each stretch. If you move your fingers back and forth, you are just moving the lymph and not helping to drain it.

, As you massage the lymph vessels, you should go slow. The normal rhythm of their flow is slow, so try to take around three seconds to perform each stretch of the skin. Release and wait for a few seconds before beginning again."

Get in a comfortable position.,
Begin with deep breathing.,
Start with your collarbone.,
Massage the side of the neck.,
Stretch the back of the neck.",How to Perform Lymphatic Drainage Massage2," Lymphatic massage works best if you are relaxed. Start in a room that is quiet and free from distraction. Get into a position that is comfortable for you. Many people lie on their backs. Some people sit up and others stand. Choose what works for you since this is supposed to help you feel better.You may want to experiment with different positions to see what works for you.

, Before you start your massage, spend a few moments relaxing. You want to get your mind and body relaxed to help the massage be as effective as possible. Take around five deep breaths. Inhale slowly, hold for a moment, then exhale slowly. Try to keep up this slow, steady breathing through the massage. Remember, focus on getting to a calm state., You want to start at the top of your body and go down. Start by massaging both sides of your neck. You can do one side at the time, or you can cross your arms and massage both sides at the same time. Place the pads of the second and third fingers on the outer edge of your neck, just above the collarbone. Shrug your shoulders. Your fingers should be in the dip.Stretch the skin gently with light pressure towards the sternum. The stretch should last for three seconds. Keep the fingers above the collarbone.
Repeat 5 to 15 times.

, Next, you should massage the side and back of your neck. Once again, you can do one side at a time or together. Position your palms flat against the side of your neck, right under your ears. Stretch the skin back and down, towards the back of your body. Repeat 10 times., Gently rest your fingers on the back of your neck. They should be underneath your hairline and on each side of the neck. Using gently pressure, stretch the skin downwards towards your shoulders. Release. Repeat 10 times.You can do the same stretch on the front of your neck.

Massage your underarm.,
Move on to the hip.,
Address your abdomen.,
Massage the leg.,
Massage the knee.",How to Perform Lymphatic Drainage Massage3," Hold your arm in a comfortable position. Move it away from your body so your underarm is exposed. Position your fingers under your arm. Stretch the skin up and in, towards your chin. Do this between 5 to 10 times.Make sure to repeat on the other side of your body.

, Keep your arm lifted. Start low on the outside of your hip. Use your fingers to stretch the skin upwards towards the armpit. After stretching the skin at the hipbone, move your hand higher and repeat. Do this three times along the side of your body.Repeat around 10 times.

, Make sure your abdomen muscles are relaxed before performing this massage. Hold the tips of your fingers in the middle of your belly, between the ribcage and navel. Your hand should not touch your skin. Massage in towards the middle and up towards the heart. Use a slightly harder touch here, but the same rhythm.Next, place both hands on the V of your hips. Press in towards the middle and upwards towards your heart.
Repeat each massage 5 to 10 times.

, Start at the top of the leg and move all the way down with the stretches. Use both hands, one on the back of the leg and the other on the inside of the leg. Move the hands towards each other and up as you stretch the skin. Release. Move your hands lower on your leg and repeat the stretch.Move all the down to your calves, but skip the knee when you get to it.

, Position your fingers behind your knee. Stretch the skin upward, towards your thigh. Release. Repeat this 10 times."

, While you're drinking your drink, watch some TV, a film, or listen to some relaxing music in your bed. You could also read a book if you'd prefer. A good thing is to watch a movie; the best ones for right now are chick flicks, romantic comedies, or just comedies. One my favorite movies is About a Boy and it's perfect for this occasion. Don't watch horrors, dramas, mysteries, or thrillers, as these aren't relaxing.

, when you are done with your drink, close your eyes and take a deep breath, before you go in to clean up your dishes.

, When the film/music/TV show has finished, turn off the TV/stereo. Get ready for bed. Brush your teeth, hair, etc. While you're doing this, think happy thoughts and relax yourself.

Read the content carefully.,
Do not use words from the original text.,
Put the content in your own words.,
Cite the source when you're done.,
Figure out your main points.,
Rephrase any confusing or incoherent sentences.,
Provide all the necessary details.,
Change the structure in addition to the words.,
Add some of your own style.,
Use quotes when necessary.,
Run your words through an online tool.",How to Rephrase," To ensure you rephrase content in your own words, careful reading is key. Read the content you're rephrasing over and over again until you feel you completely understand it.Take notes while reading the content. This way, you'll already be rephrasing it slightly.
After reading each paragraph, pause and restate what was said. Imagine you're explaining the content to someone else.;
, Unless you're quoting directly, make sure most of the the original diction is cut from your writing. Some words may be unavoidable. For example, if you're talking about a particular science term, you'll have to use that word. For the most part, however, avoid the original words as much as you can.For example, if you're writing about sex determination in chromosomes, you will have to use the term ""chromosome.""
Some people think they can save time by simply replacing original words with synonyms. Not only is this likely to sound clunky, it can still be read as plagiarism if you don't change basic sentence structure.

, Imagine you were describing the information to someone unfamiliar with the topic. Describe the content to this imaginary person using your own original words.For example, the original text says, ""Out of the 46 chromosomes found in human DNA, sex is determined by the 'X' and 'Y' chromosome."" How can you put this in your words? Try something like, ""In humans, DNA is made up of 46 unique chromosomes. The determination of biological sex relies on the 'X' and 'Y' chromosomes.""

, Even if you've put the content into your own words, you need to source it. Follow the guidelines of the writing style you use (i.e., AP citation, MLA citation, etc.) and cite the source according to that style. Sources are sometimes cited in parentheses within the text or in footnotes/endnotes., After paraphrasing a sentence or paragraph, read the original text. Try to restate the main point in one or two sentences. Then, reread your paraphrased words to make sure the original point is reflected there.For example, suppose the original sentence reads, ""In East of Eden, Steinbeck's characters are caught in a morally ambiguous divide between good and evil."" The main point here is that characters in East of Eden live in a gray area.

Reread your sentence. Suppose it says, ""Steinbeck tries to illustrate how characters choose between good and evil."" This sentence misses the point, as it glosses over the gray area.
Tweak your sentence to reflect the main point. For example, ""Steinbeck tries to illustrate how his characters exist between good and evil.""



, Often, in an effort to paraphrase without plagiarizing, sentences often become poorly constructed and confusing. Read through your paraphrased words and watch out for sentences that are difficult to understand.For example, say you wrote, ""Characters in Mrs. Dalloway all suffer trauma due to World War I, which is illustrated through Clarissa being frightened by a car malfunctioning and more dramatically through the shellshocked Septimus Smith.""

This sentence is too long. It should be broken into smaller sentences. For example, ""Characters in Mrs. Dalloway all suffer from trauma due to World War I. This is illustrated when Clarissa is frightened by a car malfunctioning. It is later shown more dramatically through the shellshocked Septimus Smith.""



, When striving to rewrite content, it can be easy to inadvertently leave out necessary details. Good paraphrasing should never be vague. Reread your words to make sure you conveyed all the necessary information.For example, say a sentence says, ""The murders occurred in 1991, in a small suburb just outside of Chicago at roughly nine o'clock in the morning."" You wrote, ""The family was killed near Chicago.""
Rewrite the above sentence to add the missing details. For example, ""The family was killed in a suburb outside Chicago in 1991. The murders were estimated to have taken place around nine o'clock in the morning.""

, When you're rephrasing content in your own terms, sentence structure often changes naturally. However, if you find any of your sentences or paragraphs too closely mirror the original work, tweak the structure to avoid plagiarism.Changing structure is a matter of starting with a different idea, fact, sentence, or passage.
For example, say a paragraph of literary analysis began by overviewing character relationships before stating a theory on the work's theme. When paragraphing, state the theme first and then talk about character relationships.

, Think about your natural writing voice, tone, and style. Try to write content using your unique voice. This will help you naturally stray from the original content while providing a more engaging piece.For example, take a paragraph that says, ""Even after 40 years, the elephant remembered its training from when it was used in war.""

Be a little creative when paraphrasing. For example, ""Proving the old adage about elephants never forgetting, the war elephant recalled its training from 40 years prior.""



, Sometimes, it's okay to use the original source if your own words aren't enough to convey necessary information. If you decide to quote directly, use block quotes and quotation marks. Then, cite the source according to the guidelines you're using for your paper.Make sure you don't quote too much, however. When writing, it's important to put some content in your own words rather than merely restating the work of other writers.

, There are many online tools that help you check for plagiarism. Just to be sure, copy and paste your words into an online tool like DupliChecker or Copyleaks. These tools will screen your words to make sure they do not too closely mimic existing content."

Take a warm bath or shower.,
Dry yourself with a warm towel.,
Consider keeping your clothing off.,
Apply massage oil to your body.",How to Massage Yourself1," This will loosen up your muscles and will make them ready for a massage. Soaking in some Epsom salt alone will help to alleviate soreness., Place a towel in a dryer while you're taking your bath to warm it up. When you get out of the shower, feel the relief from drying yourself with a nice warm towel.








, Skin-to-skin contact is more effective than massaging through clothing. However, if you're using a foam roller to massage yourself, or lack privacy at home, you can put on some light clothes.








, Massage oil will help heat up your body and will help make your massage be more effective. Any massage oil, lotion, or sports balm will help break down knots and loosen your muscles. To apply massage oil, just place a drop of the oil in the palm of one hand and rub your hands together for at least fifteen seconds, until you've heated up the oil.

Massage your neck and shoulders.,
Massage your abdomen.,
Massage your back with a ball.,
Massage your lower back with a foam roller.",How to Massage Yourself2," Massaging your neck and shoulders can help relieve headaches. Use your left hand to stroke your left shoulder and the left side of your neck, and vice versa. Gently but firmly work your fingers in small circles, starting at the base of your skull and working down towards the shoulders. When you feel a knot, work it out in small circles with your fingers, massaging clockwise and then counter-clockwise. Here are a few more self-massaging techniques to try:









Place your hands into fists and gently rub your spine in a circular motion.
Place your fingertips at your ears and gently move them down your jaw until both hands meet up at your chin.
After you have worked out all the knots, stretch out your shoulder blades by hugging yourself.

, This massage is perfect for menstrual pain and can help improve your digestion as well. Place the surface of one hand on your abdomen and gently stroke it in a circular motion. Then, use the fingers and thumbs of both hands to knead your abdomen. Gently use your fingers to stroke your lower abdomen in circular motions. If you'd like to stroke the sides of your abdomen, just roll over to one side and then the other to have better access to the opposing side.








While standing, bend your knees to the left while massaging the right side of your abdomen.
Apply pressure on different parts of your abdomen with your fingers, and release after a few seconds.

, Take a ball of any size, from a tennis ball to a basketball, and press it up against a wall with your back. Move your body back and forth and in circular motions to relieve the pressure from your back. Place the ball on different parts of your back, from your lower to your upper back, to relieve the tension from different parts of your body.









For added variety, you can alternate between using a larger and smaller ball during the same self-massage session.

, You can wear clothes for this. A foam roller will work best, but you can also roll up a large blanket, towel, or yoga mat in a pinch. Place the roller on the floor and lay face up on the roller. Position your lower back over the roller so that your shoulders and butt are touching the floor and you're perpendicular to the roller.









Use your feet to help you move up and down the roller slowly, feeling the roller move up and down each of your vertebrae.
Gently roll up or down the roller until you find a trigger point or a painful area. Then, stay rolled over the area for at least 30 seconds. This will hurt a bit, but it will relieve the tension from the area afterwards.
To target smaller areas of your back, use a rolling pin instead of a blanket.

Massage your arms.,
Massage your hands.,
Massage your legs.,
Massage your feet.",How to Massage Yourself3," To massage your arms, start by making long flowing strokes with the opposite hand all the way up your arm, from your wrists to your shoulder. Continue to make these long strokes until you feel your arms heating up. Then, transition to making smaller little circles all over your forearms and upper-arms.









Switch back and forth between the long-flowing strokes and the smaller circles until your arms feel heated and relaxed.

, Gently squeeze one hand by pressing it between the palm and fingers of your other hand. Then, squeeze each finger and run the thumb from your other hand along the joints of the fingers in a circular motion. Hold the finger at its base and gently pull it up so that you're stretching the fingers upwards. Use your thumb to stroke the tendons on the back of the hands.








Use your thumb to put pressure on your palms and wrists, moving it in a circular motion.
To complete the massage, stroke your palm gently from your fingers to your wrist. If you're using oil, rub your hands together to massage the oil further into your hands. You can also complete this motion even if you're not using oil.

, Glide your fingers over your legs, starting at your feet and working all the way up to your waist. Glide your fingers over your calves, shins, quads, and hamstrings. Start with light motions and then dig in with your palm, moving in firmer circles. You can start squeezing your muscles with one of your hands, massaging them with your fists, or even pressing into them with your elbow.








Try the drumming technique. Use the side of your hand to make a gentle chop all the way up your leg. This can help ease cramped muscles and relieve soreness.

, To massage your feet, dig your thumbs in a circular motion into the soles of your feet and the bottoms of your toes. You can also start at your ankle and rub your thumbs outwards across the top of your feet and down the toes. You can support your foot with one hand while working on each toe with the other hand. Squeeze each toe and gently pull it upward. Place your thumb on each of the joints on your toes and move it in a circular motion.









Massage the soles of your feet either by creating circular motions with both of your thumbs, or putting your hand into a fist and running it up and down the soles of your feet.
Use your fingertips to stroke your ankle up and down.
Squeeze your Achilles tendon several times.
Finish the massage by gently stroking your foot.

Create “active” lessons and assignments.,
Stand instead of sit.,
Give kids options.,
Offer incentives and rewards.,
Join the larger battle against obesity.,
Recognize the stakes.,
Integrate programs regarding SB throughout the curriculum.,
Get families and the community involved.",How to Reduce Sedentary Time in Schools," Most children are by nature active beings, but being required to sit for long stretches (such as at a school desk) can help to ingrain more sedentary behavior (SB) patterns. There has to be some amount of sedentary time in order for learning to take place, but interspersing sit-down time with even brief activities is an important step toward altering SB patterns.Brief activities — or “energizers” — interspersed throughout the day not only help reduce the overall amount of sedentary time per day, they also can benefit health, focus, and academic achievement. For instance, students who take a ten-minute walk before a test have been shown to display better focus, increased relaxation, and thus better scores.;
, For teachers, reducing sedentary time in school often boils down to basic alterations like designing class activities that require students to stand instead of sit, or move around instead of remaining still. “Active” lessons and homework require students to do more than watch a video, work on a computer, or read a textbook; they require them to get up and get moving.Consider, for instance, the difference between learning how paper is made by watching a video as opposed to getting your hands into some mushy wood pulp. The first option reinforces SB patterns like staring at a TV or other screen device, while the second promotes active, hands-on engagement. Beyond the possible health benefits, many children will gain more from more active forms of learning anyway.

, Some workplaces have begun to transition from traditional desks to taller, chair-free standing desks — or even the so-called “treadmill desk.” Should this concept take off widely in schools, it would no doubt significantly reduce daily sitting time. It may seem like a small difference, but the simple act of standing instead of sitting can offer several health benefits.The cost involved in switching to standing desks is not inconsequential, of course, but teachers can work to increase standing time in other ways as well. Recurring or random times when the students must stand at their desks instead of sitting can be incorporated into the daily routine, for instance.

, Kids, like adults, tend to respond better to changes when they feel like they have some measure of choice or control over the process. Rather than simply dictating a set list of changes to reduce sedentary time, it is preferable to offer a range of alternate activity options from which the kids can choose. If they feel like active agents of change at school, they may be more likely to carry such positive changes home as well.For instance, teachers can offer a set of “daily physical activity” (DPA) bins from which students can choose from a variety of games and activities. Or, a greater emphasis can be placed upon offering a range of intramural activities, including sports but also activities like dancing, yoga, etc., that emphasize “fundamental movement skills.”

, It is important to let kids know that decreasing sedentary behavior can help improve overall health, reduce obesity, and enhance academic performance. However, such concepts can be a bit abstract, especially in comparison to some old-fashioned, age-appropriate rewards. For smaller kids, simple incentives like stickers or bracelets can spur enthusiasm for making changes. For older kids, providing pedometers or accelerometers can act as a combined reward and self-monitoring device.One of the numerous programs established in schools to reduce SB emphasizes replacing sedentary “screen time” with physical activities that focus on mastering six core skills: running, throwing, dodging, striking, jumping, and kicking. In this case, the reward itself (achieving “mastery”) reinforces the desired behavioral change., School-focused programs to improve healthy eating, increase daily exercise, and reduce sedentary behavior (especially “screen time”) often exist separately, even though they are by and large working toward the same goal — reducing childhood obesity rates. Combining these efforts into a coordinated, integrated program can add consistency and focus to the overall effort, and thereby increase the likelihood of support from kids and families.Combining efforts does not mean minimizing the importance of addressing sedentary behavior (SB), however. While eating healthier and exercising more can seem more important on the surface, reducing the amount of sedentary time is important on its own and serves as a gateway to making those changes as well. Less sedentary time naturally leads to more exercise and usually decreases unhealthy eating activities like mindless snacking on junk foods.

, Fortunately for school administrators and other interested parties seeking to change SB among students, ample evidence exists regarding the negative impacts of excessive sedentary time and the benefits of decreasing it. Kids and — perhaps more importantly — parents may be more likely to respond positively when presented with clear evidence of the value of reducing sedentary time.Repeated scientific studies have shown that increased sedentary time decreases fitness, metabolic rate, self-esteem, and academic performance, and increases hunger stimulus, obesity rates, and aggressive behavior. In turn, decreased sedentary time (which, for instance in Canada, is estimated to entail 62% of the waking hours for an average child) has the opposite effects.

, While programs to reduce sedentary time seem like natural fits for physical education classes and recess periods, for instance, they are more effective when they are incorporated into the entire school day. From standing up during math lessons, to doing hands-on activities during history class, to scheduling activity breaks before tests, changing SB needs to be seen as a “total team effort.”One of the early efforts at reducing SB in schools, known as the “Planet Health” program, was integrated throughout the curriculum in its test sites, and subsequent programs (such as “Switch-Play” and “Active for Life”) have tended to follow suit. Researchers have understood that changing behaviors as ingrained as sitting in on a bus, at a desk, or in front of a TV or computer screen cannot be effectively changed piecemeal, but only as part of a holistic approach that addresses core behavioral patterns.

, Like most school-based programs (and education in general), parental involvement is critical to the success of programs intended to address SB. To truly succeed, programs must involve “intense behavioral interventions” to address the core behaviors that tend to increase sedentary time. Behavioral changes made in school can carry over into the home and community, but only with the support of those outside the school walls.Parents need to be informed and involved in every step of the process when SB programs are initiated. Explain why students are standing up more, taking activity breaks, and being advised to reduce “screen time.” Provide activities and alternatives for the home setting, and opportunities for parents to get actively involved in the program both in and out of school. Make it clear that changing SB is beneficial for everyone, kids and adults alike.

Get a tutor.",How to Schedule Your Study Hours in Distance Learning," Before scheduling study time, it is important that you are aware of all the requirements of your various classes. Use your course calendars (usually provided in some form with the syllabus) to figure out what assignments are due each week. Don't forget to include tests and exams!


It may help to write everything down and group it by day or week. This way you won't have to flip between multiple class syllabi in order to see what is due on any given day.
If you do not have a syllabus or class schedule, ask your course instructor to give you as much information as possible about the general rhythm and organization of the course. Most instructors have their courses planned out before they even begin, so your teacher likely already has this information available.;
, Once you have figured out what you need to get done each day or week, you can begin to make your study schedule. To do this, you will need to account for all your personal obligations, such as work, picking your kids up from school, medical appointments, etc. Make a schedule that first incorporates those things you can't easily adjust.


Don't forget to factor in things that are important to you but might not necessarily be obligations. This could include a workout class, movie night with your family, or time devoted to a hobby or craft. You will maximize your productivity if you balance your studies with fun activities!
Keep in mind that you can always make adjustments if you find that your plan isn't working. You can even scrap it altogether if necessary -- you are not bound by your first attempt.

, In developing a study schedule, you should identify those tasks or assignments that are most important, especially if you have a hard time fitting in all your studying in the amount of time you have available. For example, if you have weekly assignments due for one class that are worth almost as much as the class exams, carve out time specifically for these each week to ensure you get them done.


It may not always be easy to identify the ""important"" requirements for your classes. After all, everything is important if you want to do well! Try to prioritize those tasks that will have the greatest impact on your grade.
Don't forget that some things that are required but not ""due"" may also be important. This might include assigned readings, which you are not graded on but will be important for you to learn the material and do well on the exams.

, It is not good enough to simply set aside 2 hours for studying. Carve out specific time frames for each task you need to accomplish on a given day. Being specific with your schedule will make you less likely to skip important tasks or accidentally take up all your study time with one assignment.


Make sure you account for minor distractions, bathroom breaks, and the like when creating your schedule, otherwise you could be thrown off by unplanned interruptions.
It is okay to break up your study sessions into multiple sessions per day if this works best for you. For example, you can devote an hour to studying before dinner and two hours afterwards. Just make sure the start and stop times are clearly defined in your schedule.

, Don't give yourself too much to handle right out of the gate. If you aren't able to follow through with your study plan in the very first week of school, you're likely to get frustrated. This is a recipe for failure. Make sure you can handle things before cranking up the intensity.


Begin with assigning yourself a 2 hour study block every other night. If this isn't enough time to get done what you need to do, you will probably realize this while making your schedule. Adjust this time allotment so that you think it will be doable and go from there.
Don't wait too long to make changes to your schedule if you find it isn't working. If your study blocks are too short or infrequent to get everything done, you will need to devote more time to your studies. The longer you wait to make these adjustments, the further behind you may get in the material, and this can be hard to recover from.

, Once you've created and settled into a routine that works for you, follow through with it. This doesn't mean you can't make adjustments if circumstances change -- a certain amount of flexibility is actually recommended. However, it does mean you shouldn't become lazy or neglect your studies. Holding yourself accountable and not letting things slip through the cracks is essential to doing well in school, especially as a distance learner.A good way to make sure you don't skip out on studying is to set a watch or phone alarm to remind you to get started each evening. This eliminates the possibility that you will forget because you are busy with other things.
If you know you will miss part of a study block because of a one-time obligation (such as an appointment that cannot be moved), plan to make up for that lost time. This might require skipping one of your leisurely activities or moving your studying to an earlier or later time that day.
Because you don't have to be physically present in class as a distance learner (the courses being conducted online), you might find it more difficult to get into a regular study habit. However, if you work hard during the first few weeks of class, you will likely adjust to your new schedule and find it easier to accept.

, It is easy to forget to schedule time in your study blocks for studying for exams because this is not something that is ""due"" for your classes. In order to do well on exams, plan to devote time to reviewing previous material (not just completing assignments), especially as exam dates draw nearer.


It is best to make study reviews a part of your schedule from the start of the term. This will help you pace yourself so you aren't left cramming all your exam studying into a single night.
This might be a tempting obligation to skip out on when you're feeling tired or unmotivated, but do your best not to slack off on this. Exams usually make up a large portion of your grade, so this is actually one of your more important tasks!

, You will be more efficient and learn better if you schedule your studying for times when you feel alert. You will have trouble remembering the material if you wait until you are already tired to begin studying. This will also help you avoid associating studying with feeling exhausted.


Schedule study time to follow exercise. A physical workout is a great way to energize your mind (even though your body may feel tired afterward). You might even find that you retain information better after working out.In general, the earlier in your day you can fit in your study time, the less likely you are to feel tired. If you always feel sleepy after eating dinner, for example, schedule your studying for before dinner.

, After a long day of work, you may find it especially difficult to sit down and study for four hours. It will be beneficial for you to schedule short study breaks (five to ten minutes every hour or so) in order to stay focused. You might be surprised how much good even a five minute rest can do.Use your break to stretch, take a short walk, or have a snack. Anything that briefly relaxes your mind or takes your focus off schoolwork will be helpful.
Avoid spending your break time on the computer or reading. Since you are probably already staring at a computer or reading while studying, it is best to break up those activities with things that are restful or physically stimulating.

, If you have multiple things to do for one class, there is probably a logical sequence to what needs to be done. For example, if you have to complete an exercise that requires you have read the corresponding chapter and watched an online lecture video on the topic, then obviously you don't want to tackle the exercise first. You will learn most efficiently if you take a moment before you begin your study block to figure out which tasks should come first.


Many instructors design their lectures with the assumption that students have already read the assigned book chapter for that topic. You should read the assigned materials before ""attending"" lectures. Your course syllabus probably specifies your teacher's expectations, but you can always ask her if you aren't sure what to do.
Don't be afraid to read a book section or watch a lecture video twice! If you have time to do the reading before the lecture and then re-read it afterward, your comprehension will almost certainly improve.

, To get the most out of your study time, pick a spot in your house or elsewhere that is quiet and not distracting. Many people find that studying at home is difficult because they are tempted to talk to their partner, watch TV, play with their kids or pets, etc. If you have trouble focusing at home, go to a public or school library or coffee shop so you can pay attention to your schoolwork.If you have trouble reading with noise, make sure you go somewhere quiet to do your reading. This will most likely eliminate any public place except libraries.
Pick a location that is easy to get to and that has hours of operation that will accommodate your schedule. The last thing you want to do is create a hassle for yourself while studying.
Feel free to switch up your study locations if need be. Some nights, studying at home might work fine, but on others, perhaps there is too much going on. It can also be nice to get a change of scenery now and then.

, This means taking notes on lecture videos, thinking of questions about the material when reading, and asking your instructor whenever you have questions about the course content. If you just ""go through the motions"" when studying, you probably won't get much out of it, and this will be reflected in your grades.


If your class involves online lecture videos, make use of this and pause the video to take notes on important topics. You can also re-watch sections that you didn't comprehend on first viewing. This is actually a be an advantage for distance learning, since you can't re-watch or pause an in-person lecture.
Even though you cannot visit your instructor in person, she likely has office hours set aside to help students. These might take place through an online chat or via email. Take advantage of these opportunities to ask for help or clarification with topics you find particularly complex or challenging. Your instructor is a great resource, and she will appreciate your initiative!

, If you are having a hard time learning the material by studying on your own, consider professional tutoring services. You may find that you learn more spending an hour a week with a tutor than if you spent that hour struggling through the material alone. You can find tutors online, through services at your school, or by asking your instructor for recommendations.


Keep in mind that a tutor can only assist you with the material; it is still your responsibility to do the necessary work in order to learn and improve. You will only benefit if you treat this as a supplement the rest of your school efforts.
Get individual assistance. Some tutors prefer to tutor groups of students all at once, but you are more likely to get the attention you need by meeting with a tutor one-on-one. This also ensures that you get the most for your time and money (if you are using paid services).
If you intend to use your school's free tutoring services, request someone with expertise in your particular area of need. Some college tutoring services, for example, might pair you with a general science tutor when you actually need help with microbiology, which requires specialized knowledge.

However, individuals with a healthy attitude tend to know when to disengage and stop criticizing themselves. If you criticize yourself constantly or are unusually harsh with yourself, you may need to work on silencing your inner critic.


Ask yourself whether you would criticize a friend or relative the way you criticize yourself.Assess how often you criticize yourself and how long it usually persists. Do you find yourself obsessing about your performance, appearance, or abilities?
Do you replay conversations or actions trying to find things to criticize?;
, An important component of transforming self-criticism is recognizing how you feel throughout the day. You may have reached a point where you criticize yourself without consciously thinking about it. If you have, taking an inventory of your thoughts and feelings can help you become more aware of your self-criticism.Try to recognize when you feel angry, impatient, or frustrated with yourself. This is often a sign that you have been criticizing yourself or are about to criticize yourself.
Keep a written record of your emotions whenever you catch yourself engaging in self-criticism. Over time, this may help you identify negative thought patterns and triggering situations/circumstances.

, For some people, a harsh inner critic stems from a drive for perfection and can be easily transformed. Others, though, may experience inner criticism as a symptom of anxiety or depression. If you're having a hard time stopping your inner critic, or if you experience other symptoms of mental illness like prolonged feelings of hopelessness or avoidance of things you used to enjoy, find a therapist as soon as possible.Ask your doctor to recommend a therapist to you. You can also find a therapist in your region by searching online.
If your doctor determines that you have a mental illness like anxiety or depression, you can also ask your doctor about whether medication might be right for you.

, It is important to recognize that your thoughts are just thoughts and also to identify whether your thoughts are truth or not truth. Keep in mind that sometimes thoughts can be random, untrue, and even purposeless. However, you can decide how you will respond to your thoughts. One good way to handle untrue or unhelpful thoughts is to label them as such and then allow them to pass by, like watching a cloud float away.

For example, imagine you have the thought, ""I did something wrong! I never get it right!"" This is an extreme statement because making one mistake does not mean that you will never figure out how to do something correctly. Therefore, you could label the thought as ""untrue and unhelpful in this moment,"" then let it pass you by like a cloud without allowing it to make you feel anxious or self-conscious.
Try saying something to yourself like, “I’m having the thought that I will never get this right. However, this is just a thought and this thought is untrue and unhelpful.”, Your inner critic may be constantly nagging you and saying things to pull you down. To silence this voice, you may need to start talking to your inner critic.Address your inner critic with compassion and kindness because it is part of you. Don’t get upset with your inner critic, such as by chastising, yelling, or name calling. Show only compassion and empathy as you address your inner critic.

For example, you might say something like, ""Inner critic, I know you are worried about always getting it right, but sometimes there is no exact right way. I know you're anxious and it's going to be ok. I've handled things well in the past and I can do it again now. It's time to be quiet because I can take it from here.""
You can even name your inner critic if that helps you. For example, you might call your inner critic “Critical Charlie” or “Nagging Nancy.”

, Instead of blindly criticizing your efforts and outcomes for how they turn out, focus on figuring out what it is you really want. For example, instead of thinking, ""I'm never going to get a promotion at work because I'm the worst employee,"" try to identify an attainable goal (in this case, a promotion) and work out a strategy to reach that goal.Focus on creating attainable goals and celebrating your victories, no matter how small they may seem.

, Journaling is an excellent way to track your thoughts and feelings over time. You may already write when you catch yourself engaging in self-criticism, but by making journaling a daily habit, you can develop a stronger sense of what you think or feel and why.Make journaling a daily practice by devoting time to the practice. You can also set an alarm on your phone or a reminder on your calendar to spend some time journaling every day.
Look for patterns and trends in the ways you react to your circumstances.
Take note of both the times you engage in self-criticism and the times you're able to silence your inner critic.

, Any time you find yourself engaging in self-criticism, try to take a step back and examine the actual thoughts you're having. For example, if you find yourself thinking, ""I'm such a loser at basketball and I'd be better off quitting the team,"" consider factors like how long you've been playing, how often you practice, and how skilled your competitors are.Recognize that sometimes others may be better than you at certain activities. This doesn't reflect poorly on you, it just means they might have more experience than you.

, It's natural to have critical thoughts from time to time, but your criticism should never be destructive. Instead of using harsh criticisms that tear down your self-esteem, try softened statements that reframe the issue.Instead of thinking, ""I'm a failure and I'm no good at my job,"" try thinking something softened, such as ""I know there are things I could do differently at work. I'm not where I want to be, but I'm working on it.""
Reframing your criticism this way doesn't shirk your own responsibility for bettering yourself. It simply takes the harsh sting out of your criticism, making it more constructive and productive.

, Sometimes there are actual faults you may need to improve in yourself. Rather than criticizing your whole self, acknowledge that you may need to work on specific, changeable things like your behavior or your attitude towards someone or something. For example, instead of thinking, ""I'm a failure and a loser,"" you might instead say something like, ""I'm not doing well right now, but I can improve things by working on my typing skills.""Find ways to track your progress by setting smaller daily or weekly goals. These smaller goals should help you work towards achieving your larger, ""big picture"" goals.
You should also work on changing undesirable situations outside yourself. This can help set you up for success by removing external obstacles that would otherwise hinder you.
As an example, if you're having a hard time studying at home, try changing where you study or removing distractions like television, music, text messages, and internet access.

, While you may have some shortcomings in certain areas of your life, you undoubtedly have other things that you excel at. Instead of focusing on the negative, acknowledge the things that you are good at. For example, even if you're bad at sports, you might be very creative, a good problem solver, or a loyal and trustworthy friend.If you're having a hard time identifying your own good qualities, try looking at the best qualities of your friends. Then take it a step further and consider that you must also have those qualities if your friends spend time with you.
You can also ask your friends to help you identify your best qualities. Work on figuring out what you're good at and what makes you a good, likable person in other people's eyes.

, Everyone needs to take a time out from their problems once in a while. There's nothing wrong with needing to step back and calm yourself before tackling an important task. Ultimately, taking the time to step back will help you approach your problem with a clearer head and improve your chances of success.Whenever you're feeling overwhelmed or you catch yourself starting to think critically, take a step back from your problems.
Try going for a walk, listening to music, or meditating to clear your mind.
If possible, give yourself some time before returning to the situation with a clearer head. Some people may need up to 24 hours to reframe their perspective and totally silence their inner critic, but even 5 to 10 minutes can help.

, When your body feels good, your mind often feels better as well. That's why many doctors advise patients with anxiety and depression to focus on self-care. When all of your needs are being met and you're practicing physical activities that relieve stress, you'll notice yourself feeling better and criticizing yourself less.Eat a balanced, healthy diet. Get three meals each day and intermittent snacks as needed, but choose low-fat, low-sugar foods like fresh fruits and vegetables.
Exercise regularly. Aim to get at least 30 minutes of exercise each day, five days every week.
Get enough sleep each night. Everyone's sleep needs will vary, but most people generally need between 7 and 10 hours of sleep each night.

, If you're constantly criticizing yourself harshly, you may need to consider what your expectations are on a day-to-day basis. No one can achieve perfection, so it's important to allow yourself to celebrate your efforts, no matter what the outcome may be.Take stock in the fact that you're trying your best. Let yourself acknowledge the work that you do and take stock of the time and dedication it takes.

, Silencing your inner critic doesn't mean you'll see yourself as perfect from now on. Everyone has flaws and undesirable behaviors they engage in from time to time. The goal is learning to criticize yourself constructively, without being mean or harsh to yourself. For example, instead of thinking to yourself, ""I'm incompetent and unskilled at my job,"" you might think something like, ""I'm trying my best, but I have room to improve. I really need to work on reducing my turnaround time on assignments, so that's the first thing I'll focus on going forward.""

Consider filing an institutional grievance.,
Visit the Department of Education (DOE) website.,
Complete the DOE complaint form.,
Submit your complaint.,
Provide additional information as requested.,
Receive a letter of notification.,
Submit any documentary evidence.,
Talk to investigators.,
Review the findings of the investigation.,

Speak out publicly.,
File reports with nonprofit organizations.,
Write letters to state and local elected officials.",How to Report a School for Discriminatory Discipline," Your local school board or state department of education may have its own process for investigating and dealing with issues of discrimination and discriminatory discipline in public schools.Typically you can visit the website of your state department of education or your local school board to find out more about what the process is for filing a grievance.
Keep in mind that the state or local grievance procedure may have its own deadlines for filing complaints, as well as evidentiary requirements, that differ from those for filing a federal complaint.
If you do opt to file an institutional grievance, the deadline to file a federal complaint is extended. However, if you do decide to file a federal complaint you only have 60 days after the conclusion of the state or institutional grievance process to file it.
If you file an institutional grievance, you do not have the option of filing a federal complaint while it is still pending.;
, The DOE website has an online complaint form you can use to report a school for discriminatory discipline, as well as information regarding the types of discrimination they investigate and the eligibility requirements for filing a complaint.On the website, you can read more about the laws the DOE's Office of Civil Rights (OCR) enforces, as well as the types of discrimination which are examples of discrimination in violation of those laws.
However, don't worry about correctly analyzing the activity you believe is discriminatory. The specific legal analysis of the facts is up to OCR staff who investigate your complaint.
In addition to a link to a fillable PDF that you can submit online, you also can find instructions if you want to mail or fax a paper complaint.

, The complaint form requires you to provide information about yourself, the name and location of the school about which you're complaining, and the incidents that you believe constitute discriminatory discipline.You don't need to be the victim of discrimination yourself to file a complaint. Anyone who believes a school is engaging in discriminatory discipline may file a complaint.
However, if you're filing the complaint on behalf of someone else, such as your child, you must get consent from your child to file the complaint on their behalf. The DOE has a consent form that must be filled out and signed by the person on whose behalf you're filing your complaint.
Make sure you include your full name and contact information in case staff reviewing your complaint need to contact you for additional information. You cannot submit an anonymous complaint.
If you have documents that demonstrate discriminatory discipline, such as statements in the school's handbook or a letter or email from a teacher, you can attach these to your complaint.

, Once you're satisfied that all the information you've provided is complete and accurate to the best of your knowledge, make a copy of it for your records and then send it to the DOE for review.Generally, you must file your complaint within 180 days of the date of the incident you allege to be discriminatory discipline.
If you want to submit your complaint online, you must send it to the email address provided by the OCR and listed on the website page where the fillable PDF is available for download.
You also have the option of mailing your complaint to the OCR enforcement office nearest you. The DOE has a list of OCR enforcement offices throughout the country on its website.

, DOE staff in the OCR will review your complaint and may contact you if they need additional information to determine whether the incidents you describe merit an investigation.If you receive a request for more information, you have 20 calendar days to respond and provide the requested information or your complaint will be dismissed.
Staff may request additional information if there is not enough in your complaint to determine whether OCR has the legal authority to investigate the complaint.

, If the OCR decides to investigate your complaint, both you and the school will receive a letter stating that the complaint has been opened for investigation. The OCR will proceed as a neutral fact-finder, collecting and analyzing evidence.Keep in mind that opening an investigation does not imply that OCR believes discriminatory discipline is taking place at the school.
The letter will explain the investigation process and what you can expect at each stage. It also will provide information about the OCR's role in investigating the complaint and what the outcome may be if the OCR determines violations of federal anti-discrimination laws have occurred.
The school will receive a copy of your complaint and have the opportunity to respond to it, as well as produce any documents in its defense.

, If you have any documents related to your complaint or that support your claim that the school is engaging in discriminatory discipline, the OCR investigators will review them.You may have already attached documents to your complaint. However, other documents may have come to light since you filed your complaint, or you may have had further correspondence with teachers or school administrators.
If you filed a state or institutional grievance, the OCR may request copies of the documents related to that grievance, including any forms you filled out.

, OCR staff typically investigate the person who filed the complaint, as well as anyone else you name as a witness who may have evidence or information about the allegations in your complaint.Answer the investigators' questions as honestly and completely as you can. If you don't know the answer to something, feel free to say so – don't just make something up.
Likewise, if an investigator asks you a question that you don't understand, feel free to ask the investigator to clarify.
Keep in mind that OCR investigators are acting as neutral fact-finders, trying to get to the bottom of the situation. They are not on your side, nor are they on the school's side. Rather, they are looking for objective evidence as to whether discrimination has taken place.
Even if the disciplinary rules themselves are not discriminatory on their face, the OCR still may find the school is not in compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws if the rules are applied in a discriminatory manner, or if the application of the rule has a discriminatory impact.
As part of the investigation, OCR staff also may visit the school and observe teachers and school administrators as they carry out their duties.

, When the investigation is complete, the OCR will make a determination of whether the evidence it found was sufficient to constitute a violation of federal anti-discrimination law.Both you and the school will send you a letter of findings that explains the OCR's determination. The letter breaks down your complaint into allegations that each cover a single fact.
For each listed allegation, the letter will state whether the investigation has uncovered insufficient evidence to show a failure to comply with federal law, or that a preponderance of the evidence shows a failure to comply with federal law.
Keep in mind that the letter of finding you receive is only available to the parties in the investigation, and is not a general policy statement. It only applies to the facts alleged in your complaint.

, When the OCR determines that the school violated federal anti-discrimination laws, it will request that you and the school participate in voluntary negotiations to resolve your complaint.Through voluntary resolution, you meet with the school and OCR officials in an attempt to negotiate a settlement to the complaint. Resolutions may include changes in school policies and procedures.
If the school refuses to participate in negotiations, the OCR may begin administrative enforcement proceedings to suspend or terminate the federal funds the school receives.
The OCR also may refer the case to the Department of Justice, which will determine whether a lawsuit against the school is appropriate.
If the school does agree to negotiate a voluntary resolution agreement, you will meet with school officials and OCR staff to resolve your complaint.
Once an agreement is reached, it is legally binding – however, the OCR does not monitor or enforce the school's compliance with the agreement. Rather, if the school fails to follow the agreement it reached, you must file another complaint with the DOE.

, Regardless of the outcome of your complaint, you may be able to force a change in the school's policies or administration by raising awareness of the school's discriminatory discipline in your community and among parents.You can always start by talking to friends about the discriminatory discipline you've witnessed. If you're a parent, speak to other parents with children similar to yours to find out if they've noticed the same things.
You also might consider bringing up the issue of discriminatory discipline at the meeting of a parent-teacher association or organization meeting.
Talk to teachers as well and find out if any of them have noticed the same things you have and would be willing to speak out against discrimination in the application of discipline.

, There are many nonprofit organizations that take action against discriminatory behavior and violations of civil rights in the educational setting. Find a local or regional office where you can report the discrimination taking place at the school.Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union have chapters in each state and are dedicated to fighting discrimination and advocating for equal opportunity to education.
While you can take action on your own, nonprofit organizations already have substantial networks and resources that they can use to fight for you and help you change discriminatory procedures in your school.

, Bringing discriminatory discipline to the attention of state and local lawmakers can motivate them to pass new laws or regulations to address the issue.You typically can find contact information for your elected representatives, including school board members, by visiting your state or county government's website.
Try to keep your letter brief, and focus on the facts of the situation and any efforts you've made so far to remedy the discrimination you've observed.
End your letter with a call to action. If there is currently a law or rule pending, you might mention that. If not, focus on the need for strong rules to combat discrimination in the application of disciplinary penalties against students and protect all students' equal opportunity to an education.

Do not reject null hypothesis if p-value is greater than 0.05.,
Reject the null hypothesis if p-value is lesser than 0.05.",How to Perform a Normality Test on Minitab," A good way to perform any statistical analysis is to begin by writing the hypothesis. For normality test, the null hypothesis is “Data follows a normal distribution” and alternate hypothesis is “Data does not follow a normal distribution”.;
, Select and copy the data from spreadsheet on which you want to perform the normality test.

, Open Minitab and paste the data in Minitab worksheet.

, In the menu bar of Minitab, click on Stat.

,,, A small window named “Normality Test” will pop-up on the screen. Click on the available option inside the white box and then Click “Select”.


Be aware that the “Variable” tab will have the name of selected data.






Also be aware that “Anderson-Darling” is already selected under “Tests for Normality”. Anderson-Darling is the most widely used Normality test. Hence, in Minitab, the default selection of Tests for Normality is “Anderson-Darling”.







,, A normal probability plot will appear on the screen.


Please observe if the p-value displayed in the normal probability plot is greater than 0.05 or is it lesser than 0.05.







, As described in the step of writing the hypothesis, if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, the inference will be “Data follows a normal distribution”. If we reject the null hypothesis, the inference will be “Data does not follow a normal distribution”. Let’s link the p-value to the written hypothesis.

, If the p-value observed in normal probability plot is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Thus the inference is “Data follows a normal distribution”.

, If the p-value observed in normal probability plot is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. Thus the inference is “Data does not follow a normal distribution”.

This form of practice will offer a different and refreshing form of practice from the standard pencil and paper tests. Use different books and websites to ensure your child is prepared for a variety of different question layouts and styles. Think about investing in 10 minutes test books, as there can be quite tight times in the exam. Entering a mock exam is a good idea as your child will need to get used to the question format and style.;
, Ensure you have lots of rough paper, a few pencils and a watch. Get used to practicing with all these essentials so you’re used to using them when it comes to your real eleven plus exam. Parents should check with the relevant body to ensure that these tools are permitted in the actual eleven plus exam. Prepare for the ""separate answer sheet, multiple choice""type of questions.

, Start well before sitting your real exam or selection test. The more questions they practice the more confident they will be and the more types of questions they will have seen.

, Parents should ask the school or LEA for information on what type of 11+ exam their child will be sitting. You have the right to ask what sort of questions will be asked, where the child will be expected to sit the 11+ exam and how long the test will be. Will the test be in the school or at another venue?

, This is important when they practice any form of question whether it is pencil and paper or online eleven plus practice.

They'll need to practice various questions to be comfortable their skills are up to the required standard to sit the 11+ exam.

, The quickest way to do any calculations is often on a piece of paper. Have them use a big A4 sheet so they'll have enough room to do their work. Tell them to leave plenty of space so they're not cramming their work into the corner.

, Make sure you make a note of how much time you have and roughly how long you should be spending on each question.

, If you get stuck, don’t let the clock run down, move on, you might find the next question easier and you’ll pick up more marks by moving on.

, Some questions can be really time consuming and you may be better off coming back to it. Once you leave a question forget about it until you return to it later in the exam.

, Your eleven plus exam test score will be made up of a combination of speed and accuracy. It’s important not to haphazardly guess to try to finish all the questions. Work carefully and as quickly as you can. The more types of questions you practice the quicker you will get at each type.

In any case, giving away the fact that you are to ""die"" will ruin the effects on your fellow classmates.
, Your school may wish for you to not know much about the program to keep things a surprise, but unless it's forbidden, look up the program. Plenty of schools videotape and post the videos of their mock crashes online, so you can watch to know what to expect. There are also online news articles and websites that describe the program at lengths., Your parents will most likely need to fill out some paperwork before you participate, and be sure you give them proper notice beforehand., Because of the retreat at the end of the day, you'll need to have extra clothes, toiletries, e.t.c. Be sure to have everything you think you'll need - you will be cut off from the outside world. It's also a good idea to pack tissues, even if you don't consider yourself an emotional person - you may be caught off-guard by the events of the day., Whether you are in the mock crash or will be pulled out, your face will probably be painted. If necessary, make it easier for the makeup artists by getting your hair away from your forehead and cheeks. Unless you have intentional facial hair, a shave can't hurt, either., Your luggage will stick out in the before-school crowds, and lots of people will notice if you don't arrive early. You'll also have a little time for last-minute questions and makeup if needed., Since you are a participant, many of the outside students may be watching you to know how to react to the events of the day. If you react to the crash and withdrawals seriously, others are more likely to as well. It's all fake, but it will seem realer with realistic reactions., At the end of the day, you will receive a letter written by your parents and other relevant people in your life saying the things they wished they had told you before you ""died."" You will be asked to write letters back. You are not required to write anything, but if you wish to, be thinking about what you'd like to say., During the second day, you will be reunited with your parents and friends again, making for some possibly emotional moments., The longer facepaint is left on, the more 'stuck' it gets., The school will most likely have an assembly, during which a video of the crash will be played and a memorial service for the dead students will be held. Again, the student body will watch participants to know how to react, so be a leader and stay solemn., Lots of students will ask you questions - what it was like, what happened after school at the retreat, e.t.c. Know how to answer in advance; it will come in handy between classes when you only have thirty seconds to explain., The point is to reduce distracted and drunk driving, so don't choose to forget the whole thing and text and drive the next week. It will mean the whole program was useless., What affected you most? Your worth to others? How choices affect you? Whatever it was, have it in mind and think of it so it changes who you are not just for a few days, but for a lifetime., Only a few students are chosen to participate in the program. Others are influenced, but don't receive the same effects that participants do. If you share your experience, feelings, and discoveries, chances are that the program will be more effective., You may have times when you forget what you learned, but use these souvenirs of sorts to bring you back and help you remember."

Get your child a lock for her locker before school starts.,
Ask your child’s teachers for a list of school supplies.,

Talk about how to be a good listener and getting along with others.,
Ask your child if she is anxious about transitioning to middle school and encourage her to share her feelings.,

Go on a tour of the new middle school together.,
Join the school’s parent organization.,
Discuss transportation options to and from school.",How to Prepare Your Child for Middle School," It can be stressful for children to transition from cubbies in elementary school to lockers in middle school. Prepare your child for daily locker use by buying your child a lock with a combination she can remember. Encourage your child to practice opening and closing the locker so she can get into her locker at school when she needs to.Most middle schools will provide locks for student lockers and/or provide combinations for the locks that your child will need to memorize. Getting her used to using a lock before school starts will give her more confidence when it comes time to use her new locker.;
, Many teachers will provide a list of supplies before the beginning of the school year or on the first day of classes. Your child will need to take several subjects in middle school and will likely be required to buy supplies for each subject, such as protractors, scientific calculators, and reading materials.Leading up to the first day of school, you and your child should go shopping for basic school supplies like spiral notebooks, college rule paper, index cards, pens and pencils, and binders.

, Your child’s middle school will have a clear policy on dress code and your child should try to adhere to them.However, it’s important that your child feels like she can fit with her peers when she gets dressed for school. Take note of what middle school children are wearing and what middle school fashions are advertised in stores. Try to come to a compromise with your child if she wants clothing you may not approve of, as long as it fits within the school dress code.

, Boost your child’s organizational skills by helping her to write down a weekly school schedule, including all her classes and time set aside every night for homework. This will encourage her to stay organized during the school year and recognize her priorities as a middle school student.

If your child has hobbies or outside activities she likes to do, she should add in time in her schedule for them. It’s important that your child has a balance of school work and outside activities during the school year.

, As a new middle schooler, your child may be anxious about making friends and interacting with new people. Have a discussion with them about the importance of being a good listener and learning to get along with others in a group setting. Remind her that one of the traits of a good friend is being a good listener and expressing your feelings in a friendly and open way.Demonstrate active listening to your child, which is when you intentionally focus on the person who is speaking, in a group or one-on-one. As an active listener, you should be able to repeat back what the person said in your own words. Keep in mind this does not mean you necessarily agree with the person's thoughts, but it will show that you understood what they said clearly. You should advise your child to think about how it would feel to walk in the other person's shoes and to listen with her ears as well as with her eyes and her body language. She should avoid interrupting the person speaking and let them complete their train of thought before she speaks. Once the person finishes speaking, she can respond with questions and thoughts of her own.You can lead by example and act as a good active listener to your child. Ask her about her thoughts and emotions and encourage her to express her ideas. Treating her like an adult, with a mind of her own, will also help her socialize with her peers and her teachers in the middle school setting.
You should also encourage your child to join in conversations and teach her how to interrupt politely. Stress the importance of making eye contact with the person you are talking to and addressing people by name.

, Many children are nervous or anxious about making the transition to middle school and it can be helpful for your child to share any feelings she may be having leading up to her first day. Show interest in her feelings and be an active listener as she discusses any anxiety or fear.


You and your child can then have a discussion about ways she can calm her nerves and be more confident when she heads into her first day of middle school. This could be getting all the necessary supplies and clothing before her first day, joining a club or a sports group, or encouraging your child to spend time with other middle school kids so she is socially prepared for her first day.

, Another way to help your child socialize at school is to encourage her to get interested in clubs, sports, and recreational activities. This will give her a way to interact with her peers and children her own age. It can also smooth her transition to middle school, as she will have a group she can belong to and participate in on a daily or weekly basis.You can do this by asking your child what she is interested in and if she might want to get involved in a group at school. Often, children are very vocal about their interest and only need to be encouraged by a parent to join a club, a group, or do a sport.

, A good way to bond with your child in her soon to be new environment is to take a tour of the new school together. Most middle schools will also hold a new student orientation where parents and incoming students can meet teachers and other faculty, as well as each other. Attend these events to show your child how important it is to participate in school events, and to support her adjustment to middle school.It may also be useful to do a tour of the school with your child on your own to get a better sense of your child’s classrooms. Carry a copy of your child’s schedule and walk around together exploring the school. This will help your child better prepare for her first day.

, Most middle schools will have a Parent Teacher Association (PTA) or a Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) and will encourage new parents to get involved. Being a member of the parent organization at your child’s middle school will help you remain connected to any new developments or ongoing discussions, and get to know the other parents and the teachers.Your child will likely take your participation in the parent association as a sign of support and involvement from you. It will help you show your child that you care about what happens at the middle school and are willing to get to know new people as well.

, As part of your child’s growing independence, you and your child may talk about the possibility of taking the bus alone to school or walking to school if you live within walking distance. It’s important that you stress the need for independence and responsibility to your child through offering different transportation options to and from middle school.

The safety of your child comes first, so if you feel uncomfortable with your child taking the bus alone or walking alone to school, discuss a carpooling option with neighborhood kids who go to the same school.

These options include a Switch Control system.  However, the iPad does not contain jacks that permit a switch to be connected directly to it. Instead one must connect a switch control device, such as the Tecla Shield, to the iPad via a wireless Bluetooth connection, and then plug a pillow switch, or some other switch such as a puff sip switch, into the switch control device.;
, This will allow you to control the iPad.

, iBooks seems to be the best iPad reader for single switch use, much easier to use than Read2Go or the Kindle app. It allows you to turn a page by clicking and then waiting for the scanner to move only two times, before clicking twice again. If you want to turn several pages or more at a time (in effect, skimming ahead or back), you can do that with any number of rapid clicks (not waiting between clicks). It allows a smooth adjustment of font sizes so that you can pick the one that is perfect for you. It never causes a reading page to extend beyond the page boundaries, so that you never have to scroll up or down, except when you are looking through an index. As an Apple proprietary app, its performance seems pretty solid.

, Bookshare.org is a wonderful resource, providing access to many excellent books, magazines and newspapers that you can download without charge (after paying $25 to join and a $50 annual fee). You must have a disability and be able to get a professional to certify to that fact in order to join Bookshare. Unfortunately, Bookshare’s DAISY files will not work with iBooks, which uses the EPUB format. Therefore, you will need to convert the DAISY files you get from Bookshare to the EPUB format – see the instructions below.

,, If you're using a Tecla Shield, you should see a fairly rapid (1 blink per second) flashing white light coming from the circuit board inside. This means that the device is in “Switch Control” mode and also that it is ready to pair. 


If you want to pair the Tecla to a new device, you must first unpair it from the old one. 
If the light is flashing some other color, use the tip of a pen and push on either the “-“ or the “+” button until the light begins to flash rapidly.  The light will eventually begin to flash a different color.  Repeat this step until the light is flashing white, about one blink per second, indicating that the Tecla is ready for pairing.

,  This will reduce the amount of time required to press and hold the pillow switch in order to return to the iPad’s Home screen.

, This is primarily useful for reading incoming emails in the iPad's Mail app. Go to Settings, Display and Brightness, Text Size, and adjust the slider to change the text size. Check the results by looking at an incoming message in the Mail app.

If you need to use even larger text, go to Settings, General, Accessibility, Larger Text, and then turn Larger Accessibility Sizes on. You can now move another slider to adjust text size. Again, check the results in the Mail app. If the text size is set too large, the lines of text may overlap and become unreadable.

, Turn Bluetooth on, and pair the iPad with the switch control device.  To do this, click the name of the device (e.g. TeclaShieldDOS) listed under Devices. The status should change from Not Paired to Connected.  


If the pairing doesn’t work, try removing the device from My Devices by pushing the small “i” button to the right of it and clicking Forget This Device.  Then try pairing again.
After the switch control device is paired, the white light will flash much more slowly.

,  Remove any previous settings.  Set Accessibility Shortcut to Switch Control.  This will allow you to turn switch control off and on by triple-tapping rapidly on the iPad’s home button.

,  Activate the pillow switch by pressing it. Click Save.  Choose Select Item from the switch action menu that will pop up.

, Go to Settings, General > Accessibility > Switch Control. The following settings are recommended:


Set Auto Scanning to on.  You may adjust the Auto Scanning Time. Two seconds or less may work for somewhat experienced users, but beginners may need a longer time. This sets the speed in Item Scanning (as opposed to Point Scanning).
Turn Pause on First Item on.  Set the pause duration to 1 second, initially.  This setting allows the user to think for a moment when a new menu line pops up, before deciding what to do next.
Set the Loops to 2, initially. This is the number of times that the scanner will circle the available options before it stops. Having more loops gives you more time to choose from the different options while the scanner lines are moving, but it slows things down.
Turn Auto Tap off.
Turn Move Repeat off.
Turn Hold Duration off.
Turn Ignore Repeat off.
Set Gliding Cursor speed to 15. You may need to set this speed to a lower number at first. This sets the speed in Point Scanning (as opposed to Item Scanning).
Set Sound Effects off.
Set Speech off.
Set Included Menu items to all.
Set Group Items to on.
Set Large Cursor to on (All).
Set Cursor Color to Blue (or whatever color you like).
Set Saved Gestures to None.

, Go to the iPad’s Settings > General > Accessibility, Switch Control. Turn Switch Control on.  Note that you may also turn switch control off and on by triple-tapping rapidly on the iPad’s Home button (the large button on the front).  This is the Accessibility Shortcut mentioned above.  Turning switch control off will allow someone to use the iPad in the normal way.  Turning switch control on will cause scanning to start.

, Switch control on the iPad relies on two very different scanning methods:  item scanning and point scanning. 


Item scanning, in which the scanner jumps from one item or group of items to another, is much easier to use, since it requires fewer clicks once you have settled into an activity like reading. 
However, it’s important to learn how to use point scanning as well, since it gives you more control and flexibility.  Point scanning employs lines that move smoothly across the screen, horizontally and then vertically, requiring the user to click at precise locations to form X’s (or crosses).  You cannot switch between item scanning and point scanning by using the iPad’s Options settings.  Instead, you must use the submenus that pop up after you have selected a point on the screen with either scanning method – see the instructions below.

, Item scanning highlights an item or a group of items for a short time and then jumps to another item or group of items. To change to item scanning, select something on the screen, click on the tiny Oval icon that pops up, click on the second row of the first submenu that pops up, and click on Item mode.

, Point scanning uses lines that move smoothly across the screen.  To change to point scanning, select something on the screen, click on the tiny Oval icon that pops up, click on the second row of the submenu that pops up, and click on Point mode.

, Note that anyone can practice operating an iPad with a single switch, even if he or she doesn’t have a Tecla Shield and a pillow switch.  To do this, set up your switch type by going to Settings > General > Accessibility > Switch Control > Switches, Add New Switch - all as described above - but this time choose Screen rather than External as the switch type.  Then choose Full Screen, Select Item.  After these steps have been taken, a caretaker with an iPad can simulate using a pillow switch by simply touching anywhere on the iPad’s screen and thus gain valuable experience in controlling the iPad with a single switch.

,
Make sure that Item Scanning is on.
Make sure that Groups are set to On.
Make sure that Passcode in the iPad is turned Off. Go to Settings, Passcode.

,


If the iPad is asleep, wake it up by clicking once on the pillow switch.
If the iPad is locked, click the pillow switch. Scanning will start.  When the highlight reaches the Slide to Unlock area, click it again.  Note that, when you click the switch, a small black Popup menu will often be displayed.  The Popup menu contains choices.  The first choice is Tap.  If you click on Tap, that will select “Slide to Unlock” in the initial screen - but you must click right away, before the other choices come up.  If you don’t click Tap in time, or if you click at the wrong time, just wait for the highlight to come around to Tap again.  You should only have to wait for the highlight to go around two times, if you have set the Loops to 2 (see above).  Then, when it stops moving, you can click again to start scanning and wait for the right moment to click a second time in order to choose the option you want.

, Suppose you are in the Home screen or some other app screen and you want to open an app.  Stop and wait until a grouping containing that app is highlighted, click that grouping, stop and wait until the app is highlighted, click that app, and then click Tap.

, Suppose you are in the Home screen and you want to move to another screen.  Select any app as described above, but this time don’t click Tap.  Instead, wait a moment until the Scroll Right choice is highlighted, and then click that choice to move to the second screen.

, Suppose you want to go back to the Home screen.  Click on any app, as described above, but do not click Tap.  Instead wait until the little Oval Icon at the bottom of the popup menu is highlighted and click on that.  Then wait until the top row of choices is highlighted and click on that row.  Then wait until Home is highlighted and click on Home.

, Another way to return to the Home screen is to simply press and hold the pillow switch for about five seconds.

, See settings directions above.

,  Click on the book you want to read.  When you want to turn a page, click and wait for the scanner to highlight the Progress Bar (the long thin line) at the bottom of the page.  Then click.  This will bring up a menu with three choices:  Decrement, Increment and the Oval icon.  Click on Decrement to turn the page to the left.  Click on Increment to turn the page back to the right.  Click on the Oval icon, to see the first submenu.

,  You get to the first submenu by clicking on the Oval icon, which appears after you have selected something on the screen.  Then you will see Home, Gestures and Escape in the first row.  When the highlight gets to the second row, if you are in Item mode, you will see Point Mode, Device and Settings.  (If you are in Point Mode, you will see Item Mode, Device and Settings.)  Wait until the highlight reaches the row you want, click once, and then wait until the item you want is highlighted before clicking again.

,  If you select Settings in the second row of the first submenu, you go to the second submenu.  Here you will see Back, Speed Up, Slow Down, and Move Menu.  In the second row, you will see Scan Order, Speech Off, Sound Off and Groups On.  To change the Scan Order, click on Scan Order in the second row.

, If necessary, you can use the Move Menu choice to move the popup menu so that it is out of the way.  The Bottom or Bottom Right positions are probably best, so that the popup menu will be out of the way when you start reading a page and usually disappear by the time you get to the bottom of the screen.

, When reading a book in the iBooks app, it's better to reverse the scan direction, so that the highlight will arrive at the Progress Bar at the bottom of the page more quickly, allowing you to turn a page by clicking and waiting for the scanner highlight to move two times (as opposed to five or six times with forward scanning, depending on whether the iPad is in Landscape or Portrait mode), before clicking twice again to finish turning the page., When scanning in Item Mode, it's faster to group choices together into groups. If you see Groups Off, click on this icon to turn Groups On., Note:  these instructions are based on experience with a Windows 7 desktop PC, but they could be adapted for use with other PC's.

, As mentioned above, Bookshare’s DAISY files will not work with iBooks, which uses the EPUB format.  To convert DAISY files to the EPUB format, a range of options area available; DAISYtoEPUB is recommended ($99).  You should install this program on the same computer where you have installed the iTunes program that you use to control your iPad.  The seller does not allow multiple installations.

, When you install the DAISYtoEPUB program on a desktop computer, you may experience problems with Java, which is required for the program to work.  For example, you may see the error message:  “Could not create the Java virtual machine.”  To fix this problem, you may have to increase the amount of RAM allocated to Java to 1024 MB, rather than the 512 MB suggested in this footnote., To download books from Bookshare, use the computer where you have installed DAISYtoEPUB.  Make sure that you are not logged in to Bookshare on any other devices.  Then go to bookshare.org and log in.  Type the name of the author or book that you would like to download in the search box at the top of the page and push Enter.  When you see a book that you like, click on the Download button to the far right of that title.  After the file finishes downloading, you should find it in the Downloads folder on your computer.

, To convert books to the EPUB format, open the DAISYtoEPUB program.  When this program opens, you will see 3 boxes to complete.  The second box is already completed for you, and you don’t need to change it, if you don’t mind storing EPUB books in the My Documents folder.  To complete the first box, click the Browse button to the right of the box and find the book that you want to convert, located in the Downloads folder.  If you double-click on this title, both the first and third boxes will get filled in automatically.  Then click on Convert and wait for the file to be converted to EPUB and stored in the My Documents folder.

, To do this, start iTunes by clicking on the icon on your laptop’s desktop.  In iTunes, click on File, Add File to Library.  (If you do not see ""File"" in iTunes, click on the tiny black and white box in the extreme upper left corner of the screen, and then click on Add File to Library. Alternatively, you may use Control-B to to make ""File"" visible in the Windows version of iTunes.) Locate the book you want to transfer inside the My Documents folder and double-click on it.  It will be transferred to iTunes.

, To transfer your EPUB books to the iPad, start iTunes and then connect the iPad to your computer.  After awhile, a small icon representing your iPad will appear on the main screen of iTunes, in the upper left hand corner of the screen.  Click on this icon.  In the next screen, click on Books in the list on the left.  On the right side of the screen, make sure you have selected Sync Books, All Books (or at least Selected Books, with your new book checked).  If you make any changes to these settings, sync the iPad again.  After the iPad sync is complete, click on the icon in the upper left corner, next to your iPad’s name, which ejects the iPad.  Then disconnect the iPad and open the iBooks app on the iPad.  You should see your new book listed in iBooks.

, If you find that the horizontal Progress Bar (long thin line) at the bottom of the screen in iBooks has been replaced by a vertical line on the right side of the screen, that means that someone must have accidentally turned on Scrolling View in iBooks. Scrolling View will cause the Progress Bar to appear on the right side of the screen, and this will make it much more difficult for you to turn pages. To correct this problem, click on the AA icon at the top of the screen in iBooks, and then turn off Scrolling View. If you are using only the pillow switch to perform this action, you will now find yourself ""stuck in a box,"" unable to exit the menu that pops up when you click on the AA icon. To get out of this box, see the instructions below.

, If you ever find that clicking on the pillow switch doesn’t do anything at all, make sure that the Tecla Shield has power and is turned on. If that isn't the problem, reboot the iPad by pressing the large Home button on the face of the iPad and the Power button on the side of the iPad together for at least 10 seconds.  After the screen becomes dark, wait another 10-20 seconds or so. If the machine doesn't come back on again by itself, push the iPad’s side Power button briefly to turn it back on.

, When you are in item scanning mode and using iBooks, sometimes you may find yourself stuck inside a box and unable to get out.  You will know that you are stuck inside a box if the highlight only flashes on a single box of text, or if it flashes on one box of text and then on another, but it doesn’t flash on other options on the page, so that you are unable to turn pages.

, To reproduce this condition of being stuck inside a box, so that you may practice how to deal with it, first turn the pillow switch OFF (or turn the screen switch OFF, if you are using a screen switch in Caretaker Practice Mode). You may do this either by triple-clicking on the Start button or by going to the iPad’s Settings > General > Accessibility, Switch Control, Switch Control Off.  Next open iBooks and open a book in iBooks.  Notice that when you touch the screen, the Progress Bar (long thin line) at the bottom of the screen will appear and disappear.  When the line is no longer present, turn the pillow switch or the screen switch back ON, either by triple-clicking on the Start button or by going to Settings > General > Accessibility, Switch Control, Switch Control On.  You should now find yourself stuck inside a box.

, If you are stuck inside a box, change from item scanning to point scanning.  Carefully select a point near the bottom of the screen, where you know that the Progress Bar (the long thin line) should be, and click on Tap.  The Progress Bar will reappear.

, Next click on an Oval icon and go to the first submenu, where you can change from point scanning back to item scanning.

, Click on Groups Off, if that is being displayed, or on Groups On, if that is being displayed.  That should fix the problem of being stuck inside a box. However, if you now find yourself with Groups Off, that will slow scanning down, and you will probably want to turn Groups On again."

This is a good idea if you plan to practice hot stone massage professionally.

, Clean the stones in hot water with plenty of disinfecting dish soap. Use warm water if you have marble stones. Rinse the stones well in hot or warm water, then dry them well on a clean towel. Disinfect them with rubbing alcohol or an environmentally-safe disinfectant., Put the saucepan on the stove and turn the burner on to medium low.

Obtain a loofah.,
Wet the loofah in the shower or bath.,
Apply soap to the loofah.,
Scrub your body with the loofah.,
Rinse your body with cool water.,
Rinse your loofah after each use.,
Dry the loofah completely between uses.,
Sanitize the loofah once a week.,
Replace your loofah every three weeks.",How to Use a Loofah," Loofahs are usually the color of pale straw, with a slightly herbaceous scent. They come in many shapes and sizes, and are often sold as either cylinders or sliced discs. The texture of a loofah is rough when dry, but once you add hot water it becomes soft and supple.


Loofahs are available at most stores that sell body care accessories, including drugstores.
Loofahs are different from plastic bath poufs; the two items are used for the same purpose, but loofahs are made from a plant-based material and are said to be better for the skin.;
, Warmer water will cause the loofah to get softer more quickly. If you want the loofah to retain some texture and scrubbing ability, just wet it slightly before proceeding.

, Many people use body wash, which easily seeps into the surface of the loofah, but rubbing bar soap over its surface works as well. A little soap goes a long way; you only need a dime-sized amount or so.

, Starting at your decolletage (the expanse of skin between your neck and chest), gently but firmly rub the loofah against your skin in circular motions. Work your way down to your ankles and then repeat along the back of the body. Don't forget to scrub your arms and hands as well.


Care should be used around delicate areas such as underarms.
If your skin is dry, rinse the soap out of the loofah before using it on your arms and legs.
Additionally, you can use the loofah on the heels and soles of your feet. Be careful if standing in a slippery shower.
The circular motion will help remove dead skin cells and is gentler on your skin than scrubbing up and down.

, This will close your pores and make you feel awake and refreshed. If trying to lull yourself to sleep with a shower or bath, use warm water instead.

, Use hot, clean water, making sure all the soap is gone. Soap left in the loofah could begin to smell.

, Put it in a place with good circulation so it can dry completely. Drying it out will prevent bacteria from forming inside the loofah.Store your loofah on a hook outside of the shower.

Placing it near a vent or fan can also help it dry out quickly.
Since many bathrooms stay humid, you might want to dry the loofah in a different room.

, You can run it through a hot wash cycle with your towels, run it through the dishwasher, microwave it for 30 seconds, or boil it in hot water for several minutes to kill any bacteria that might be growing. No matter what method you use, do it at least once a week to make sure the loofah stays healthy for use.


Dermatologists have recently found that loofahs tend to harbor more bacteria than previously thought. That's why it's important to sanitize your loofah often.The same holds true for plastic bath poufs. Even though they aren't made from natural materials, they can still harbor bacteria.

, After this much time the loofah will be starting to fall apart from use and runs through the washer or boiling water. If you haven't been sanitizing your loofah, it's no longer safe for use after three weeks. Either way, time to get a new loofah.Many people have recently switched to using washcloths, since they're easier to run through the washer and they last much longer than loofahs.
If you decide to stick with loofahs, make sure you dry them properly after each use and replace them frequently to keep your body healthy.

Wait until your second trimester to have a prenatal massage.,
Lay on your side for a prenatal massage.,
Work with a massage therapist who is experienced in prenatal massage.,
Avoid the pressure points in ankles and wrists.,
Adjust to lighter strokes during your massage.,
Watch the amount of pressure applied to your legs.,
Keep the abdomen off limits.",How to Use Prenatal Massage Techniques," The highest risk of miscarriage is during weeks 1 to 12 of a pregnancy, so most massage therapists avoid massaging women in their first trimester.;
, There are specialty tables available with a uterus-sized cutout to allow a woman to lay on her stomach, but those tables can still apply dangerous pressure to the abdomen and pull on uterine ligaments.


Use pillows to prop yourself on your side. Specialty pillows for prenatal massages are called bolsters.
Have a massage sitting in a chair if it is more comfortable for you to sit. You do not need to be laying down to enjoy prenatal massage techniques.

, There are practitioners who are certified in this type of massage. Special training is offered on techniques that are safe and beneficial to pregnant women.


Ask your massage therapist about certification or training in prenatal techniques. Each state has different standards and there is no national certification or program.

, Prenatal massage should never include pressure on the areas that stimulate the uterus and the pelvis. Massaging the ankles and wrists is a technique often used to induce labor naturally.

, Prenatal techniques will involve less pressure than a Swedish massage or a deep tissue massage or any type of massage you might get when you are not pregnant.

, The amount of blood a pregnant body produces is much higher, and the level of anticoagulants in the blood is also increased while the body prepares for labor and delivery.


Avoid the calves and inner thighs. When you are pregnant, your risk of blood clots increases and strong massaging of your lower legs and inner thighs could dislodge a clot.
Make sure all leg strokes move towards the heart. This prenatal technique will keep your circulation healthy and your risks low.

, Most massage therapists will not touch the belly at all. If you do want your massage to include your stomach, the technique should be nothing more than light fingertips on the skin with no pressure.

Choose a scrubbing pad or cloth.,
Add some abrasive compound to your pad / cloth.,
Make an appointment for microdermabrasion.,
Use gentle exfoliating acids.,
Use a product that contains enzymes.,
Consider a stronger chemical peel.,
Shave your skin.,
Wax your skin.,
Apply a facial mask.",How to Use Exfoliators," Mechanical exfoliation involves scrubbing your skin with some sort of abrasive pad or cloth, with or without any gritty compounds added. The simplest way to remove dead skin cells is scrubbing it with a moist or wet cotton facecloth. Cotton is soft and not especially abrasive, so you're removing dead skin mainly by friction. Rinse your skin with warm water prior to exfoliating to open up your pores a little better.


Other choices include sponges, such as loofahs (a rough fibrous sponge made from the dried fruit of a tropical plant) and cellulose sponges, as well as special skincare brushes, pieces of pumice and microfiber cloths.If you have sensitive skin, choose a microfiber pad or cloth that's not too abrasive. Normal and oily skin can handle loofahs and rougher exfoliators.
Pumice stone is more appropriate for thicker skin on the heels of your feet and calluses of your hands.
Always moisten a scrubbing pad or cloth first, then rub your skin in circular motions. Don't spend too much time in one place or else you might irritate your skin.;
, Once you've selected an exfoliating pad or device appropriate for your skin type and body area you want to exfoliate, then you might want to add a gritty compound for better results and a deeper clean. There are many cream-based products that contain abrasive materials, such as salt crystals, raw sugar granules, pumice particles, micro-beads and finely crushed almond shells or apricot kernels.


Ask your dermatologist for a recommendation based on your skin type and budget. Effective exfoliating creams don't have to be expensive.
According to dermatologist Elizabeth Tanzi, people with sensitive skin should avoid using scrubs with abrasive compounds because it can lead to excessive irritation.Stick with some warm soapy water and a soft facecloth or sponge.
A simple and inexpensive home remedy involves making a paste with baking soda by adding some water. Add the paste to your pad, cloth or sponge and gently exfoliate your skin in circular motions.
Focus on exfoliating rough, dry patches on your skin where your complexion is dull, flaky or uneven., Microdermabrasion essentially involves gently sanding your skin (typically your face) to remove the top layer of skin cells, so it's considered a type of exfoliation also.Microdermabrasion devices are typically coated with fine crystals or crushed diamonds on the tips to remove skin and buff it to improve your complexion. The therapy is also used to remove pimples, warts, moles and other non-cancerous growths.


Make an appointment with your dermatologist for a microdermabrasion treatment for your face or feet. The sanding is not painful and typically takes between 30-40 minutes to treat your entire face.
Microdermabrasion is also performed by many estheticians, as well as some massage therapists. Microdermabrasion devices and machines are widely available for home use.
Like all other forms of exfoliation, a skin moisturizer should be applied after the microdermabrasion treatment.

, In addition to mechanical or physical exfoliation with pads, sponges and gritty products, chemical exfoliation is also effective for removing dead skin cells. Commonly used chemical exfoliators include alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs), beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs), glycolic acid, citric acid and salicylic acids.These acids essentially dissolve dead skin cells and also clean the pores of debris and oils.


Prescription products have higher concentrations of acids and are applied by dermatologists, whereas over-the-counter products have lower concentrations and can be used at home.
Daily application of exfoliating acids with cotton cleaning pads is okay for most skin types, unless your skin is especially sensitive. Don't leave acids on your face for much more than a few minutes to avoid irritation.
For oily and acne-prone skin, daily use of a glycolic acid cleanser with an exfoliating pad is recommended.You can also get pads that are pre-soaked with AHAs and BHAs.
Use of glycolic acids can increase your skin's sensitivity to the sun, so always apply a good sunscreen after treatments if you're heading outside.

, Applying enzymes to your skin can also remove dead skin and the surface layer of living skin by dissolving the glue-like compound that holds skin cells together.These fruit-based enzyme products are gentle and non-abrasive to your skin. Like exfoliating acids, digestive enzymes are applied with cotton cleaning pads or something similarly soft.


Enzyme-based products should be left on for more than just a few minutes to allow the protein to be dissolved. Aim for at least 15 minutes or so and then rinse off with water. No scrubbing is needed.
Fruit enzymes are often found in cleansing facial masks, which are meant to unclog pores and remove dead skin.
Fruits that contain protein enzymes include pineapple, papaya, kiwifruit and figs.

, A chemical peel is an acidic solution applied to the skin (typically the face) that dissolves the outermost layer of cells, which peel off over the course of a few days.Chemical peels involve strong acids and remove both dead and living skin cells, which make them effective for not just exfoliation, but also for treating age spots, acne, sun damage and mild scarring.


Chemical skin peels can be considered as topical, moderate or deep. Deep peels may require you to miss work for a week or more while your skin sheds and recovers.
Estheticians can perform mild-to-moderate peels, whereas dermatologists are needed to perform or supervise deeper peels.
The acids used are typically concentrated glycolic acids, trichloroacetic acid (like bleach), salicylic acid, lactic acid, or a combination of acids called Jessner's peel.
Chemical peels cause an intense tingling or burning sensation and leave the skin looking bright pink afterwards.

, Shaving your skin is another form of exfoliation because it removes the surface layer of dead cells. As such, men incidentally exfoliate their face when they shave it, and women do the same when they shave their legs. Double-edged safety razors and straight razors are more effective at removing dead skin cells than electric razors.


Always apply a moisturizing shave cream as a lubricant before shaving your skin in order to avoid abrasions and small cuts.
Apply a warm towel to your skin to open the pores and get the hair to stand up more.
Shave in the direction the hairs grow, not ""against the grain,"" in order to avoid ingrown hairs and skin irritation.
Women should be warned that shaving their face might make their skin feel more coarse because of the hair stubble as it grows back., Another form of hair removal that also exfoliates dead skin cells is waxing. Hot wax can be applied to virtually any body part to remove hair, but it should not be thought of as a viable replacement for other exfoliating techniques.Properly exfoliating your skin with one of the above-mentioned methods before waxing will help prevent ingrown hairs and bumps on your skin.


Thoroughly remove all wax with a cleaner, otherwise it can clog and trap wax and other debris within skin pores.
Waxing causes skin pores to open, which can leave them vulnerable. As such, after cleaning your skin, rinse in cold water to close your pores.
Waxing is usually done every 2-8 weeks to remove hair, which is not frequent enough to rely upon for exfoliation.

, Another potential way of exfoliating your facial skin is applying a facial mask primarily meant for cleansing. The masks can be made of clay or gels that dry hard and then peel off. Although facial mask can contain acids, they typically exfoliate by simply pulling dead skin off by sticking to it. Clay masks draw dirt, oil and dead cells out of the pores and then the clay is rinsed off.


Clays used for facial masks include bentonite (volcanic origin and rich in magnesium), French pink clay (great for sensitive skin), red clay (rich in iron), green clay (rich in copper and other minerals) and white clay (also called Kaolin).Facial masks often combine herbal compounds, such as cucumber, mint, green tea or citrus for deeper cleansing power, but it doesn't affect the degree of exfoliation.

, Are the nail implements washed thoroughly after each use? This includes changing towels after each session. Metal implements can be sterilized in a surgical autoclave, but files and wood sticks must be disposed of after every single client.

, Upon each nail implement being washed, are they placed in a disinfectant solution? Barbicide and similar chemicals are effective for sterilizing tools and pedicure rubs.


Pay attention to your nail tech's sanitation habits. Does she wash her hands with antibacterial soap, or use a hand sanitizer such as Purell? Sanitizing both her hands and yours before a manicure can reduce the number of bacteria on your skin that can later cause infection.
After cleaning implements with disinfectant solution, does she dry them with a clean towel?
What other kinds of sterilizers do the nail technicians use? Do they use UV light, steam autoclaves, soaking solutions, etc?
Are the manicuring tables or foot baths sanitized after each and every use? In between each client, pedicure tubs should undergo a 15 minute sterilizing cycle in which they are filled with sanitizer or other chemicals and the jets are turned on. If you are seated in a pedicure chair immediately after another client, without the tub being sanitized, you should leave immediately. This nail salon does not care about the health and safety of its clients.

Look at shapes, like circles, in another way.",How to Make Learning Science Fun for Your Child," The kitchen is usually where a child first learn about chemistry and physical changes in materials. Encourage your child to make cookies, creating their own recipe and writing it down like in a cookbook. Let them decide what ingredients should be included and in what quantities. After all, science is about experimentation! Once you have tasted the cookies, you can talk together about how to make changes on the recipe next time - and then, in the true spirit of science, try again!;
, A hand trowel, rigid plastic shovel, or even a metal spoon – all these can be used to dig. Aside from being fun and dirty, digging can tell your child about the types of soil and rocks in a certain area. Digging can also help your child to find things that live underneath. This digging exploration let goes of the detective inside your kid.

, A few sheets of paper plus a small amount of space in a room or outside can be enough for some experimentation into how things travel through air. You may try out different airplane designs found on the web. Do they all work equally well?, Observing and asking questions about the human body give young children the opportunities to explore such science concepts as diversity, variation and how certain parts have certain functions. Have your child look directly into your eyes under different light conditions to see the changing sizes. He should be able to distinguish that pupil gets smaller with more light, and with less light it gets larger. Encourage your child to wonder about the functions of other parts of the body too.

, A local play area can turn into a science playground through this simple yet fun-filled activity. Different places on the playground feel warmer or cooler depending on the weather. Children seem to know which surfaces to avoid on a very hot day, such as the metal slides. Together with your child, you can check the surfaces in a more systematic way and learn about which materials conduct heat better than others. You can use your hands or an outdoor thermometer to make your findings more precise. Then on a cold but sunny day, you can return to the playground to push for more complete findings. Are there differences?

, Long drives in the countryside provide some of the best opportunities to talk about weather patterns. As you gaze into various kinds of cloud formations, make note of them and wonder aloud if some may display a weather change. For instance, the sun might be shining in a clear blue sky but from afar are puffy grayish clouds. Point this out to your child and ask him what he thinks the weather will be like later.

, Looking carefully can unearth a variety of insects, birds and plants in almost every yard or garden. With the use of a hula hoop placed on the ground to create a circle, challenge your child to look carefully at the ground to see what living things he can find. Encourage him to look carefully at the plants and imagine what the world looks like if he were an ant. This activity can help your child appreciate the diversity of living things in even a small space.

Do not seek mud bath treatment if you have high blood pressure.",How to Try Mud Bath Therapy," Locations that have therapeutic mud in large quantities are, not surprisingly, sparse. To research locations, first check online. Spas located near salty lakes or in areas with historical volcanic area are likely to feature mud baths. Consider the Ojo Caliente Mineral Springs Resort and Spa in New Mexico, or Dr. Wilkinson’s Hot Springs Resort in Calistoga, California.If you live in the United States, you have access to three broad locations:


Napa Valley in California, where mineral-rich volcanic ash infuses the mudNorthern New Mexico,and
The Great Salt Lake in Utah.;
, If you live abroad or would like to travel internationally, there are many more mud-bath opportunities: the Dead Sea in Jordan; Lake Techirghiol, Romania; and Hell’s Gate Geothermal Park In New Zealand.Depending on the type of mud you prefer, you may inclined to travel to Europe (where moor muds prevail) or to volcanic regions such as Santorini, Greece.
Mineral-rich mud is often also packaged and sold commercially, at beauty and cosmetic shops. While at-home mud application to a specific body part is not the same as a full-body mud bath, it may be much cheaper and easier to access.

, Due to varying compositions of water type, soil types, and decayed organic matter, the mud in different geographic areas allegedly possesses different therapeutic properties. While all mud baths will relax muscles and joints and exfoliate skin, specific mud types may offer additional benefits.Salt-heavy mud, such as from the Dead Sea or Great Salt Lake, has been shown to help skin disorders. Mud from the Dead Sea is often exported internationally, and can be purchased online.
Lake mud, also known as “moor mud,” comes from ancient lakes in peaty areas of Europe. This mud can replenish nutrients in the body and improve skin condition.
Hot springs mud is rich in minerals, and so can replenish minerals naturally found in the skin.

, Before you start planning your travel, decide if you want a professional mud-bath treatment at a spa or a resort, or if you want to apply the mud yourself at a lake- or sea-side location. If you want the mud bath to have therapeutic outcomes (reducing muscle and joint pain, drawing toxins from the skin), you’ll be better off undergoing a professional treatment.


However, if you’re more interested in the experience of taking a mud bath at a lake, or want to use the mud from a specific location—for example, the Dead Sea—you’ll need to skip the spa and perform the mud bath yourself.

, The spa or resort staff will be able to provide useful information about the composition of the mud which you’ll be bathing in. Ask them which specific minerals the mud contains, and the skin and body benefits provided by each. Common minerals include sulfur, zinc, bromide, and magnesium. The mud may also include peat, volcanic ash, or specific salts, depending on the region.Of course, if you are planning to mud bathe on a beach by a lake or sea, there will not be staff on hand. However, you can always ask locals (or check online) too see what alleged healing properties the mud has—but keep in mind that these answers will lack medical authenticity.

, If you’re performing your own mud bath and not receiving a professional treatment at a spa or resort, you’ll need to find a location with plenty of loose mud to rub on your body. If you’re planning to leave the mud on and would like to lay down while you do so, scout a location with some nearby grass or exposed rock to recline on.


Watch locals and other tourists; observe where and how they apply the mud. Find a similar location although, depending on the size of the beach and availability of mud, your options may be limited.

, Depending on the location, you may be asked to remove all of your clothing and enter the mud naked, or simply to enter the mud in your swimsuit. Since the mud will remove toxins that have built up in your body by drawing them out through your skin, it’s important to have as much skin exposed to the mud as possible.If you’re not immersing yourself fully in the mud, but only “bathing” one body part (such as your feet), you’ll only need to remove the clothing on that body part.

, Resorts and spas which offer mud bath therapy will run boiling water through the mud between users, in order to kill bacteria and flush out skin and other foreign particles from the mud. Confirm with staff or management that the mud will be cleaned before you immerse yourself.Rather than flushing out the mud, some spas may choose to swap out the mud entirely and bring in a new batch of mud for each bather.
If you’re bathing in mud by a lake or sea, you can skip this step. There should be enough mud that you can find your own patch to lay in or smear on your body.

, If you’re at a spa, you’ll be given guidance concerning how to enter the mud bath, and staff members may even be on hand to help you climb in. Take advantage of the attendants’ knowledge; confirm that you’re following all procedures correctly. As you submerge yourself, the mud should cover your entire body, and come up to about your chin.The mud will likely be kept between 100 and 104°F, about the temperature of a hot tub.

, If you are by a sea or lake and the mud is not deep enough to immerse yourself in, pick up generous handfuls of mud and smear it across your exposed skin. Observe how other people rub mud on themselves, and follow suit. As this mud will certainly not be sanitary, avoid putting it too near your mouth or eyes.


Laying out in the sun after mud application will allow the mud to dry on your skin and allow for easier removal.

, Half an hour will give the mud time to exfoliate and moisturize your skin, and to sooth aching joints and muscles. Staying in for more time may raise your body temperature to an uncomfortable or unhealthy degree.If you are not immersed, but have chosen to coat your body with mud instead, you should still limit your time to about 30 minutes.


If you’re receiving a mud-bath treatment at a spa or official facility, there should be staff members to monitor you and advise you when to exit the mud. If you’re by a lake or in a remote location, you’ll need to keep track of the time yourself.

, After your mud bath, clean yourself off with water. A spa or facility should have nearby showers; use these to rinse yourself clean. If you’re by a lake or sea, take a brief swim to clean the mud from your skin.Don’t stress if you don’t have access to soap; a thorough rinse should remove all mud from your body . Do resume a normal shower schedule following the mud bath, though.

, There are a number of medical conditions—including high blood pressure—that the constant heat of an immersive mud bath may exacerbate. If you have a skin infection or broken skin (including rashes such as eczema or psoriasis), the mud bath could worsen this condition.Mud baths are also not recommended for pregnant women.

Be a friend to the needy child.,
Be a good example.,
Relate with the child, if it is possible.,
Be honest with the child.,
Listen to the child.,
Make a plan for the future.,
Have fun with the child.",How to Mentor a Troubled Child," Remember that you are not there to be a surrogate parent or an authority figure, but, instead, a friendly face for the child to communicate with.;
, ""Monkey-see monkey-do"" is a very true statement. If you are going to tell the child how to be a good citizen, then you need to be one. If the child hears or sees you do something, there is a good chance the child will repeat it. Always be the person that you would want your mentor to be.


Being a good example doesn't mean that you have to be perfect, or that you can't show your weaknesses. One thing children can - and should - learn is how to work with or around shortcomings and problems.
If you can apologize when you're wrong to the child as well as in front of the child, you will make a far greater impact than if you never admit mistakes. That's one of the biggest life lessons a mentor can give any child, that it's okay to be wrong and apologize.

, Doing so will allow the child to feel as if you understand them, especially if you share a similar story that happened in your own life. The child will then be more open with you.

, Troubled children are often very good at detecting dishonesty, because, more than likely, they have been lied to in the past. If you cannot relate to the child, do not pretend that you can because the child will know that you are lying. Being dishonest will make it harder for the child to trust and open up to you.

, The most significant thing a child might need is someone who gives them the time of day, and listens to what they have to say. Most troubled children do not have anyone in their life who cares enough to listen to them. Mentoring a child is not always sharing your knowledge or thoughts, but allowing the child to share their life with you, and just lending a sympathetic ear.

, Part of mentoring is making simple long- or short-term goals for the child to accomplish. The sense of accomplishment is something every child needs; therefore, you need to help pave the way for the child's success.


Making plans with the child and letting the child set his or her own goals is even more powerful. Listen to the child's goals and help them refine their goal setting. Discuss them and set it up so the child's making the decision after looking at all the alternatives. That teaches independence and sensible goal setting, the achievement also becomes a lot more important to their confidence in life when they are responsible for the decision of making the goal.
Even goals that sound unreasonable at first glance can be broken down into many smaller ones. A child that wants a horse someday can work toward becoming knowledgeable about horses and horse care, save money, plan a life that will allow living in the country where having a horse is more practical. Listen for how often an ""impossible"" goal is repeated among other fantasies. If it's a deeply felt calling to a particular profession, the child would probably be happiest later in life following it - whether that's training horses, going into medicine, driving a truck, owning a restaurant, becoming an artist. People are happiest in life if they love their work.

, Remember that the child you are mentoring is still a kid, and wants to have fun. Allowing the child to forget their past or present problems, and act their age is something they will thrive on. This will also relax the child, and make them feel like they can trust you and open up to you - because they consider you to be a friend.

Start creating a character profile.,
Focus on your character’s unique attributes and/or personal quirks.,
Use creative descriptors instead of simple adjectives.,
Expand on your character profile to include personality traits.,
Connect clothing and personal objects to the character’s personality.,
Make him or her an active participant.,
Include stream of consciousness and/or dialogue.,
Don’t limit active verbs to a character’s movement.,
Offer a visual sketch of the character’s immediate surroundings.,
Appeal to your reader’s senses.,
Consider placing them in an uncomfortable environment.",How to Give a Description of a Character," This profile will be a useful organizing tool to reference throughout your writing process. At the beginning, it will help you determine which visual aspects of the character are important to share with readers. If you are an artist, draw a picture of your character. Provide as much detail as possible. The more details you know, the better you can pick out the unusual ones to share with readers.Don’t dress them in a generic plain t-shirt without you detailing what makes it different from every other shirt like it. Does it have any tears or old stains, indicating perhaps this is a favorite shirt? Maybe a logo or designer brand that shows their personal style or places they frequent.;
, Your goal is to create a visual snapshot of an interesting person your readers want to get to know better.


Do not exhaustively detail every facet of your character’s appearance.Ask yourself, as an observer, what is the first thing you notice about this person?
Does s/he have scars, tattoos, or unusual physical features (like wide, clear blue eyes) that stand out? Can you see their facial features or does a hat or pair of oversized sunglasses hide their face?

, A description that does not encourage readers’ imaginations may be accurate, but will not be interesting. Use metaphors to compare two things that are unrelated, yet share a common feature.Examples of metaphors include “blind as a bat,” “a blanket of snow,” and “a heart of gold.”


Instead of simply stating your character has green eyes, for example, describe the exact shade of green by referencing an object readers will recognize. Are they pea green, forest green, or the color of Crayola finger paint?Avoid clichés and aim for original comparisons. Clichés like “she is lovely as a rose” are so common that readers instantly recognize them without having to think about what they mean. This statement fails to say anything important about the woman since beauty is a subjective judgment. Be specific and use your imagination., List their talents, strengths and weaknesses, moral beliefs, likes and dislikes, and any other personal information you have considered. Readers don't need all of this information, but you need to know your character in and out to make decisions about what to present.


Think about how they see themselves and how others would perceive them. Do these images match or clash? Do their dreams for the future match their talents and strengths?
You want your reader to leave with an impression of who your character is as a person, not just what they look like.,


Are their clothes neatly pressed and tailored, indicating attention to their appearance, or do they look like they rolled out of bed and threw on whatever was nearest on the floor.Note anything that is absent that one would normally expect. Are they walking in the snow without a coat or shoes, or fully dressed head-to-toe in 100 degree weather?, Describing how your character interacts with his or her environment gives you a chance to offer insight into their intellect and conscious indirectly, so that your writing becomes a story and not just a biographical sketch.Be specific and concrete. If surfing the web, what type of sites are they looking at? If walking, are they taking large, confident strides or shuffling their feet?Even if s/he is doing ""nothing,"" this fact provides insight into their personality and thoughts., When little direct action is taking place, recording the character's thoughts or conversations keeps the reader engaged.When using dialogue, note the speaker’s tone or inflection, any pauses or tics, or unusual words choices.
Do they gesture while they speak or use meaningful body language? Are they saying what they really think or hiding their true nature?, Make their physical attributes active, as well. A long skirt might graze the floor, their hair may fly around wildly. Maybe their coffee cup sits motionless and loses its warmth because they are too preoccupied to drink., Their surroundings should suggest something significant about their personality or state of mind. Your description should also set-up the scene for what is about to happen.


If at their home, details concerning the location, size and condition of structure, how it is decorated, and your character’s housekeeping skills can offer clues as to their personality or habits.
If your setting is a public space, like a coffee shop, tell readers whether the shop is a well-known chain, or a dive that few people even know about. Reveal if they sit in the back rather than in view of other patrons.

, Tell your audience what the character sees. feels, smells, or hears to make it more realistic and engaging.Don’t just tell your audience that your character is drinking coffee, give details about the type of coffee: straight espresso, a syrupy latte, or plain black Columbian coffee.
Describe the scents in the shop, the noise from the drink machines, and the people chatting at tables nearby. Can they hear a dog barking outside? Is the sun permeating the window, forcing them to wear sunglasses?

, This is a great way to develop your character's personality.


Explain how they got there: were they trying out a new place on their own, meeting someone for the first time, or are they really bad at reading directions?
Describe what exactly about the scene makes them uncomfortable."

There is no penalty adjustment to the score for giving incorrect answers, so your score can only improve by filling something in. You may get lucky and guess correctly., While you should pace yourself to allow time to answer every single question, there will be some questions that just pose too much trouble. If you find yourself struggling over a particular question, and you cannot seem to find the answer, be prepared to move on.Sometimes, questions are presented in “clusters,” with several questions that are based on a single fact scenario. If you find that you have difficulty understanding the scenario, and the first question poses some problems, it would make sense to skip the entire cluster and move on.
There is no adjustment to your score for incorrect answers, so mark an answer for every question. Make your best guess quickly. Then, if you have time after going through the entire test, come back to the ones you have skipped and spend some extra time on them.

Study released copies of past exams.,
Simulate the testing environment.,
Time your testing session.,
”Grade” your results.,
Study and learn from all your answers.,
Make note of the types of questions you get right and wrong.",How to Pass your Actuarial Exams2," Many of the actuarial societies release copies of past exams. They do this so you can understand the subject material and use the past tests as a study guide. If you visit the website of the actuarial society in question, you should find a link to certain past exams that have been released. The test administrators are careful to keep some material confidential, but they do understand the value of studying from the actual tests., When you are ready to take a practice test, do it under conditions, as much as possible, that simulate the actual testing environment. When you take the actual test, there will not be a television in the background or children running around the house. Find a quiet place to test, with no distractions., The actual tests will be timed. Determine what the time limit is on the test that you are practicing, and give yourself that amount of time for your practice test. In the beginning, you may not be able to complete the practice test in that time. If this is the case, then try to work faster. If you find that you finish with too much time left over, then slow down and read the questions more carefully.Learn to pace yourself to use the full amount of time to your best advantage.


If you happen to get interrupted during a practice test session, make a note of your stopping point and the amount of time left. Then try to pick up where you left off later.

, After you complete the practice test session, check your results against the answers that are given. Determine the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and the number of questions that you were unable to complete.Do not be put off or worried by low scores in the beginning. This is a long process, and if you continue to study, your scores will improve.
Keep track of your scores from one test to the next. Chart your improvement.

, The released tests generally provide not only the correct answers but also explanations for each answer. Read those materials very carefully, for ALL your responses. For the questions you answered incorrectly, you need to learn why you missed them and how you can improve for next time. For the questions your answered correctly, check to make sure that your reasoning was the same as the explanation.On the final test, the only thing that matters is getting the right answers, and getting lucky is fine. But during your practice tests, you need to know that you are getting the right answers for the right reasons, so you can duplicate your success.

, Use the practice test as a way to measure your strengths and weaknesses. Look for patterns in the questions that you seem to get right and wrong. Then, after you have completed a few practice tests, focus your studying efforts on the topics that seem to be your weaknesses. This will maximize the impact of your study time."

Obtain good study materials.,
Plan adequate time to study for each exam.,
Make productive use of study time.,
Study “actively.” As you read, make notes.,
Master each concept before moving on.",How to Pass your Actuarial Exams3," If you are enrolled in an organized program of study for the actuarial exams, you will have textbooks that are required. In addition, you should find supplemental study materials for each course. These may range from study guides, to practice tests, to outlines. You can search online for study materials for each test, or contact a bookstore recommended by the actuarial society. The SOA recommends the following sources:


The Actuarial Bookstore. At this online site, you can find textbooks, flash cards, and access to online seminars and workshops to supplement your studying.Mad River Books. This site organizes its available study materials by exam, including references to actuarial societies outside of the U.S., Cramming at the last minute is not a good substitute for allowing yourself adequate time to study, practice, restudy, and completely learn the material. The SOA recommends allowing yourself at least eight weeks for the first exam., Try to plan study periods of at least an hour. Longer study times of two to three hours would be better, if you can manage that. The following good study habits can help you get the most out of your study time:Set a goal or objective for each study session. This may be to finish a particular chapter, or take a practice test. Allow yourself to go beyond the goal, but don’t cut yourself short.
Limit interruptions.
Have all the materials you need at hand -- textbooks, flash cards, study guides. You don’t want to be getting up and down to go get materials once you get started.
Take occasional short breaks, especially if you find yourself getting tired.

, Highlight key topics. If you have questions or do not fully understand something, underline or mark it in some way so you can return to it. Do not just accept what you read. Study fully and understand each concept., Depending on the topic you are learning, you will want to learn and practice the early concepts before moving ahead. If you try to advance too quickly, you will not have the base of knowledge that you will need later on. Study each topic, practice it with sample problems and practice tests, and then move on to the next topic."
"
Learn the tests that will be required.,
Find out if the tests must be taken in a particular order.,
Find out if you can modify the course of study.",How to Pass your Actuarial Exams4," Each actuarial society will have its own set of tests that you must pass to attain membership. You will need to review the society’s website and study the material about testing and admission.


For example, the Casualty Actuarial Society in the United States requires a set of nine exams, ranging from Probability in Exam 1 to Financial Risk and Rate of Return in Exam 9.In India, the exams are administered by the Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI). Their exams are arranged in four “stages.” Each stage consists of exams that cover from three to nine distinct subject areas.The stages and their contained subjects are outlined on the IAI website.

, In many cases, the tests will build in increasing difficulty and content matter. In some cases, you must attain a particular level of work experience before you move from one exam to the next. It makes sense to learn the order of the tests, and find out from the actuarial society whether you can substitute work experience for testing.


The CAS in the United States provides a very handy “map” that illustrates the order of the tests, with a timeline for coursework and work experience that you should accumulate along the way.The Society of Actuaries (SOA) in the United States strongly recommends studying for and taking the tests in the prescribed order. They recommend that you attain a passing score on one exam, or are nearly certain of attaining a good score, before moving on to study for the next exam., The study outline that is presented on an actuarial society’s website is often a general outline that will apply to most people. However, if your background includes some work experience or college coursework in finance, accounting, or mathematics, you may be able to demonstrate proficiency in certain subjects and save yourself some time and money by avoiding certain tests.


The Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA), as an example, accepts credentials from the CAS or SOA in the United States. However, the CIA website identifies certain exams that may be exempted by demonstrating adequate proficiency or work experience.The CAS in the United States notes that it will honor credits from candidates who have passed certain exams in other countries. They specifically cite the Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA), the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFA) from the U.K., the Actuaries Institute from Australia, the Actuarial Society of South Africa, and the Institute of Actuaries of India. If you have passed exams from any of those organizations, and are attempting to gain membership into the CAS, you may want to consider this alternative."

Make final corrections, submit or publish the document, and take pride in a job well done.

",How to Handle a Writing Assignment at Work," Ask questions until you are sure you understand what is expected of you. Ask your boss, your colleagues, or whoever sent you the assignment.;
, Will it inform, record, or persuade? Is it to size up a problem and chart a course, or is it a review of work already done?

, How formal should it be? Can it be a quick email? Is it a large report or manual? Is it somewhere in between?


Don't worry about length. They really did stop counting words and pages back in school. Focus on communicating what you need to say.







, Are you writing for colleagues? Managers? Customers? Suppliers?


Don't forget, especially with email, that your distribution may quickly expand beyond the original recipients.







,


Talk to coworkers, managers, and anybody else that you need to consult, whether in a formal meeting or not. If it's appropriate to involve writers on the team, such as a technical publications group, inform them.






Include your own expertise. If you were asked to write about it, it is probably because you know more about it than others.






Do research if the topic requires it.







, These can be in any form that you want. Don't worry if what you write now isn't neat. Just get it written down and recorded.


Put the notes in order, if it will help you to write, but write the notes before you organize them.







, At this stage, focus on writing something, whether it is organized or not. If you find yourself missing information, mark it clearly and move on.

,


For a smaller project, this may mean just spell-checking and a quick rereading before hitting send.






Fill in missing information.






Organize your document. Add clear headings to divide a longer document into smaller sections.






Ask others to review your work, as appropriate.







, Unlike mystery novels, you do not want your audience in suspense. Like an abstract in an academic paper, the executive summary should include the major points, recommendations, and conclusions.


Keep your audience in mind as you write the summary. Some busy readers may read only the summary. Others may use the summary to decide whether to read more.






Scale the summary to the document. For an email, a clear, specific subject line will suffice. For a lengthy report or manual, a few introductory paragraphs might serve as the summary.






Make sure your document and summary agree and that the document supports your conclusions.







, Ask colleagues to review your work.


If this was a small assignment for a small audience, send it in and get feedback for next time.

Keep a character journal.,
Do writing exercises on setting.,
Do a freewrite with music on.,
Write about a specific emotion.",How to Improve Fiction Writing Skills1," Write in the voice of a character in your story or novel. Keep the journal for a few days or weeks. This can help you get into the voice of your character and really see the world from their perspective. You can then use phrases and lines from the journal in your story or novel about the character.


For example, you may write in the voice of a female main character from a short story you are working on. Or you may write in the voice of a minor male character in a novel you are struggling to complete.;
, Write about a setting using sensory details. Take a setting in your story and describe it as much as you can, from the layout of the setting to the objects in the setting. Write about a particular setting from a character's perspective. You can also do writing prompts that focus on setting by looking at a list of prompts online at Writer’s Digest.com.

, A freewrite is when you sit down for 10-15 minutes and write about an idea or prompt without stopping. Freewrites are a great way to let your ideas flow without judgement or second guessing yourself. Put music on in the background while you do the freewrite to help you get inspired.Make it habit to do a freewrite once a day in the morning or at night before bed. Choose a writing prompt or make up your own prompt by choosing a line from your own writing.
You may find that the content you create during the freewrite can be used in your own writing or to help you start a new piece of fiction.

, Another good writing exercise is to use a specific emotion or location as a writing prompt. Write about a strong emotion like rage, fear, excitement, or desire. You may decide to write your own feelings about the emotion, or write about the emotion from the point of view of a character in your fiction.


For example, you may do a writing exercise where you take a character that is passive in your story and write about anger or rage from their perspective. This can help to add dimension to the character.

Provide short, frequent writing assignments.,
Do Writing-to-Learn.,
Teach the full writing process.,
Use pre-writing activities.,
Try inquiry learning.,
Allow collaboration.",How to Improve Students' Writing1," Students' writing will improve as they're offered more opportunity to write. Providing short free-writes in the content area - science, English, math, social studies - will help students learn. Short free-writes can be 3 minutes or less.These short writing assignments are ungraded.
The assignments can be used to provide time for students' reflections on the topic.
Assignments can be motivational.
Use these quick assignments as a warm-up activity to start the class, or as a short response following a discussion.;
, Writing-to-Learn activities are different from typical writing assignments, which intend writing to be communicative. These writing activities help students learn course content material by thinking through important content ideas, and writing about them. The function of this kind of activity is to have the student practice applying his own words to the course material to further his understanding.Examples of Writing-to-Learn activities include:



Entry Slip: Before discussing a topic, have students write for 2 minutes about what they already know about the topic.

Crystal Ball: Following a class discussion, ask students to write for 2-3 minutes about what might happen next.

Found Poems: Have the students rearrange something they've already written, using the same words.

Write a Letter: Have students write short letters to a real or imaginary person regarding course material. For example, in a science class, students might write asking questions of Marie Curie, asking her what her life was like as she worked on the process of discovering radium.
Writing-to-Learn activities shouldn't be graded, but can be discussed or voluntarily shared following the writing assignment.
Incorporate these activities regularly throughout the students' day.

, Students may need to learn that writing is a process, incorporating planning, writing the first draft, and revising the final product. Teach each step independently, focusing especially on the first stages for struggling writers.Provide plenty of activities that help students know how to plan for their writing. Brainstorming, mind-mapping, outlining and other strategies can be done either as a group or individually.
The first draft is expected to be an unfinished product, not perfect writing. Always have students write a first draft that is ungraded.
Show students the first drafts of other writers. Internet searches show the first drafts of many famous pages, and can be a great way to demonstrate the imperfections of early writing.

, Anything that helps students explore, plan, and organize their ideas is considered a pre-writing activity. These include any classroom activities that precede the first draft of writing, and develop the students' thoughts on a topic. Pre-writing activities are a necessary step in the writing process.Emphasize to students that the more developed their ideas become in the pre-writing activity, the more polished their final writing will be.
Make the connection between clear thinking and skilled writing. For many students, being able to speak their ideas aloud may lead to increased ability to write their ideas on the page.
Pre-writing is a good way to make sure students have vocabulary words regarding the topic.
Incorporate lists as a pre-writing activity. For example, ask the students to write a list of pros and cons regarding the discussion topic prior to beginning to write.

, Inquiry learning encourages the student to pursue her own area of interest through a focused investigation. It includes research into the topic, but also may include student experience.One example of inquiry learning is to have students interview others, and document this interview in writing.
Inquiry writing can be persuasive or informational.

, Writing in pairs or small groups often results in students' improved writing skills. Have students learn from each other through partnering for writing projects. Collaboration can be done at any stage of the writing process, or for the entirety of the writing assignment.Some writing programs allow for collaborative writing and editing online.
Collaborative writing provides opportunities for students to learn to offer constructive feedback to each other, which improves their individual writing skills.

Show, don’t tell.,
Avoid cliche characters.,
Use dialogue to move the story forward.,
Read and study fiction writers that are good at craft.",How to Improve Fiction Writing Skills2," Showing, rather than telling, means you immerse the reader in the world of the story through scene, dialogue, setting, and character. Simply telling or explaining an emotion or scene to a reader is usually not very effective. Showing the scene or emotion will ensure the reader is engaged in the story.For example, rather than tell the reader that a character felt sad, describe how the character looks and sounds using sensory details. You may write, “Tears dotted her cheeks,” to convey the character is sad.

, A cliche is a phrase that has become so familiar it no longer has meaning. Avoiding cliche characters in your writing will only make it stronger and more engaging. Focus on creating characters that feel particular and unique to you. Express your unique perspective through your fiction so it stands out on the page.For example, rather than have a cliche male character who is the star quarterback with the perfect smile as your main character in a high school setting, have a male character who is bad at sports and has bad teeth. Or, model the character on someone you know who is unique and particular so the character is as well.

, Another key craft element in fiction writing is dialogue. Do not have dialogue simply for the sake of having something for your characters to say. Dialogue should always build character and move the story forward.For example, dialogue like “Hi” or “How are you?” do not really move the story along or provide character. Instead, dialogue like “You’re late, friend,” or “What have you done?” is more engaging and action driven.

, To improve your craft, read the masters of craft. Seek out fiction writers who are known for well crafted storytelling. Read and study the ways in which they tell a story. Borrow from them and make their approach your own.For example, you may read The Best American Short Stories anthology to improve your approach to writing short fiction.
Other master storytellers worth reading include Joyce Carol Oates, Toni Morrison, Virginia Woolf, Margaret Atwood, and Don DeLillo.
You can also read books by writers on the craft of writing, such as Stephen King’s On Writing or Somebody With a Little Hammer by Mary Gaitskill.

Revise your first drafts.,
Remove flowery prose.,
Proofread your writing.",How to Improve Fiction Writing Skills3," Revision is maybe the most important part of writing, as this is where you assess your work and make it better. Do not be afraid to revise and edit your first drafts. Be merciless and trim away any excess or unnecessary moments. Be willing to rip the draft apart and rewrite parts of it until it is at its best.A popular approach is to “kill your darlings,” where you remove sentences or sections that you like a little too much. Look for sections where the prose seems awkward or does not flow well. Revise them until they feel seamless and easy to follow.

, Flowery prose often contains too many adjectives and adverbs. It can also be confusing for a reader to follow and have one too many metaphors or similes. Read over your writing and identify any sentences with more than one adjective or adverb. Ask yourself if you can simplify the sentence and remove descriptions that are unnecessary or confusing.For example, rather than have a sentence like, “She leapt quickly and wildly over the wide, thick, dark river,” you may revise it to read, “She leapt wildly over the wide, dark river.”

, Make sure all of the words in your writing are spelled correctly. Having correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in your writing will ensure the reader does not get lost or confused. It will also show the reader that you put care and effort into your writing.To check for misspelled words, try reading the story backwards. This will allow you to look at each word to confirm it is correct.

Sign up for a writing class at your local university or writing center.,
Do an online writing class.,
Start a writing workshop with friends or peers.",How to Improve Fiction Writing Skills4," It can be difficult to improve your writing on your own. Taking a writing class can allow you to meet other writers and read each other’s work. It can also allow you to improve your writing by workshopping it with other writers. Workshop can be a good way to get feedback on your stories so you can revise them to make them stronger.


You may also search for a writing class or workshop run by a writer you admire. Often, working under the guidance of a writer you like can improve your writing skills.

, If you’d prefer not to leave the comfort of your home, sign up for a writing class online. Online writing classes can be cheaper than in person classes and can make it easier for you to attend if you have to work or have other commitments.


Most universities and colleges offer online writing classes.

, Talk to friends or peers who are also interested in improving their writing. Set up a writing workshop out of your home or a communal work space. Arrange to meet once a month to share work, to workshop each other’s drafts, and to chat about writing.


You can also learn how to conduct a writing workshop so it goes smoothly.

Teach explicit guidelines.,
Consider voice and word choice.,
Focus your topic.,
Stress clarity and specificity.,
Practice sentence fluency.,
Incorporate peer-review.,
Analyze good writing.,
Know grammatical conventions.",How to Improve Students' Writing2," Be specific and concrete about what you expect your students to consider good writing. For example, have them write paragraphs of 7-10 sentences each. Show them examples of structured papers. For example, a sample paper might include an introductory paragraph, followed by the body of the paper, closing or summary paragraph.Vary the guidelines for different papers, to teach different methods of writing.
Teach transition words, such as ""for example,"" or ""in conclusion.""

, In standard writing, informal word choices are less effective than formal word choices. To improve your students' writing, circle words like ""kids, mom, dad,"" and suggest replacements, i.e., children, mother, father. Encourage use of the active voice over the passive.Circle less effective words and ask students to replace with stronger words. If the student doesn't know what stronger words are, offer suggestions.
Most formal writing avoids the first-person. If the paper relies on the use of pronouns such as I, we, our, or my, suggest that the student revise in favor of a more objective voice. The objective voice is typically written in third person and uses pronouns such as his, her, or their.

, Focus is established by the student in response to the assigned material. During the course of writing about a topic, each student's focus may vary. The focus of each paper should be clear to the writer, however. If the focus is clear to the writer, it will become clear to the reader.If the reader doesn't understand the writer's conclusions, the writer hasn't established a clear focus.
If the reader is interested and understands the material, the topic's focus is clear.

, The more difficult the subject is, the more concrete and clear the student's writing should be. Encourage students to provide examples that can be easily understood by others.Avoid using overly academic jargon or unnecessarily formal language.
Use a software program to help rid students' writing of unnecessary language.

, Sentence fluency refers to the auditory quality of words at the level of individuals words, phrases, and sentences. Sentence fluency means that the readers' attention flows from word to word, and phrase to phrase, without interruption.Avoid using too many short, choppy sentences. Overly-long, run-on sentences can also distract the reader's attention.
Sentence fluency encourages variety in the length of each sentence. Too much of any one length sentence will become dull. Too much variety becomes overwhelming.

, Ask students to review each others papers during class. You may want to have students review one another's papers in small group activities.Peer review will help students better understand that the purpose of the writing is to share knowledge of a topic.
Having students read each others' writing helps them to become better editors of their own writing.
Teach students to highlight areas that they would change, and state why they would make these changes. Encourage their critiques to be positive, practical and purposeful.
Have students identify components of their peers' papers, such as topic (or thesis) sentence, transitional phrases, conclusion, etc.

, Provide many examples of good writing during your classes, and encourage students to find other examples on their own. Show them why writing is effective: how does the author use language well to convey her point? What methods does she employ to focus her topic? How does she introduce her topic, or develop it? How does she vary her sentence lengths?Offer a written list of discipline-specific standards to help address writing challenges that may be unique to the subject matter. For example, someone who can write informational papers well may need further instruction in order to write persuasive papers.
Share examples of both positive and negative papers to further students' learning. Showing what not to do can be informative.

, Provide resources for students to learn the use of conventional grammar required for the discipline in which they're writing. If you have a writing center or tutoring center, see if you can get a one-page list of resources from them. There are several good online writing sites as well. Understanding the conventional uses of grammar will help your students' improve their writing.Grammatical conventions vary based on subject matter. Be specific and explicit in your expectations regarding the format in which your students are writing.
Point out the use of grammatical conventions used in examples of writing you share with your students.

Start with assessment.,
Consider who your students are.,
Differentiate between students' understanding and writing skills.,
Try writing interactively, narrating your choices as you model writing.",How to Improve Students' Writing3," Each class of students will be different, and within each class you'll likely have a variety of skill levels. Effective teaching must be done by establishing expectations that the student is able to achieve. Start by assigning several writing assignments that you'll use simply for the purpose of assessing current writing ability.Writing assessments are not graded. They can be brief free-writes, or they can be short formal assignments.
Consider the individual nature of each student, as well as the educational environment they may have come from, to better understand their pedagogical needs.

, Are there a large number of non-native English speakers in your class? Are your students likely to have had a strong writing education? Do they have access to a examples of strong writing? Understanding your students' experiences will help you understand how to teach better writing skills.Some students may come from educational systems that value rote learning over critical thinking.
Be prepared to accommodate different modalities of thinking and learning.

, If writing is difficult for your student, consider whether it may be an issue specific to literacy rather than comprehension of subject material. Learning standard writing styles can be done apart from testing the students' comprehension of material.Check for understanding verbally or through an activity. Students have varied learning styles.
Provide a visual context for writing by having your students draw a picture of what they'll write about. Then, the student can refer to the picture as they write.
When the student is allowed to share his knowledge of a topic verbally, he may be less anxious about the writing process.

, For example, while writing for a class, ask: ""I could use either a comma here, or a semicolon. Or I might make this sentence two sentences, by inserting a period. What would be the effect of each?""


Including student discussion regarding writing choices allows you to learn more about your students.
Student discussions also encourage students to learn more about each others' experiences in writing.
For students who are social learners, creating social activities based on writing can help improve the students' writing.

Create a website to showcase your stories.,
Update your writing blog regularly.,
Join a writing group.,
Share your work at local readings.",How to Get Your Stories Noticed1," If you don’t already have an author website, consider creating a free website to promote your writing. Rather than hire a web designer, use a site like WordPress to build a basic, professional website. You can then update your website with any publication notes, and start a blog on the site to attract more readers.Ensure your website appears clean and is not cluttered with images and text. The text should be in a font that is easy to read and free of any spelling or grammatical errors. Avoid placing a light font on a dark background or a font color that is too close to the background color. Choose a color scheme of one main color and one complimenting color for the text. The text should be the focal point of the website.
Avoid using programs like Flash, animated backgrounds, or music. Users will be turned off if your site takes a long time to load or doesn’t load on a mobile device.
Build an easy to use navigation bar with titles that are clear and to the point. You should have a bio page, a page for publications, a page for your blog (if you want to have one), and a page for general news.;
, If you decide to link a blog to your author website, you will need to commit to updating it weekly with short or long posts. The more you post on your blog, the most traffic you can attract to your site.You may decide to write a blog post about the writing process behind a recent story you completed, or you may review books you are currently readings. If you have had a story published in a journal or magazine, you should write a post about this to promote it to visitors to your site.

, This is a good way to show your stories to other writers who are just starting their writing career, or who are mid career and can provide feedback as well as publishing contacts. Look for writing groups at your local community college or university writing program, or ask other friends or peers interested in writing fiction to start a writing workshop group.


Establish a weekly or bi-monthly meeting time for the writing group. Often, writing groups will ask one to two people to submit their stories for review and they are then workshopped by the group. This will allow you to show your stories to others and improve them for publication.

, Another useful way to get more exposure as a writer is to attend local fiction and poetry readings at venues in your city or town. Look for advertisements for readings at your local coffee shop or the community center board. Most university writing programs put on readings of students’ work once a month at a local venue in an effort to promote new writers.


Try to share your work at these readings so you can showcase your writing and stick around after the readings to introduce yourself to other writers. This could then lead to invitations to other readings, existing writing groups, or invitations to publish your work.

Submit your stories to literary magazines.,
Enter short story competitions.,
Consider self publishing your stories in a collection.",How to Get Your Stories Noticed2," If you’re looking to get your stories noticed by editors and readers, consider submitting work to literary magazines. There are hundreds of literary publications with calls for work on a rolling basis. A list of literary journals and magazines can be found here.


Each literary magazine has a unique perspective and a unique readership, so its important to read the literary publication before you submit work to the publication. This will help you get a sense of the voice, style, and genre(s) of writing the magazine publishes. You can then determine if your stories might be a good fit with the mandate of the magazine.Always follow the submission guidelines of the publication’s submission page, as most publications will not read submissions that do not follow their guidelines. You will also need to send a short cover letter with your submission that includes your bio and any previous publications.

, Many literary publications will hold writing competitions for the best short story in a certain genre or around a certain theme. These competitions can lead to monetary rewards, as well as publication in the magazine. Most competitions are judged by esteemed writers who will read and choose from a shortlist of finalists. So this means your current living literary hero could potentially read and choose your writing from the pile.


Keep in mind there is often a fee for submitting work to writing competitions to cover a reading fee and to help support the publication. Before you submit to a competition, read back issues of the magazine and the work of previous year’s winners to get a feel for what type of writing the magazine tends to publish.

, Self publishing, or DIY direct, means the author does all the work on their own and hires any outside help like a book designer or an editor. Self publishers will also need to provide retailers (book sellers) with finished, ready to go files or books.If you are feeling frustrated by traditional publishing avenues and want to get your stories noticed on your own terms, self publishing may be an option.


Keep in mind the retailer will take a cut of the sales, but the author is not exclusive to a publisher. This means the author can deal with each retailer on an individual basis.
Self publishing allows the author to maximize their earnings from the sale of the books. This also allows the author to get the highest percentage of sales. The author also retains complete freedom over the work so they can adjust or edit it on the fly, and can control the pricing of the book.
But, self publishing can become a full time job if the author is aiming for high profit and high quality. You will need to also market and promote your book on your own to find an audience for your work.

Understand the scope and structure of what you're writing.,
Know your audience.",How to Improve Your Work Related Writing1," Usually, unless an immediate reply to an e-mail is required, you have time to think about what you're writing and how best to say it. Take that time to determine what you have to say and the right order to say it in.;
, If you're replying to a written request, you can glean the requirements of what to write from the questions in that request; if not, you can ask the requester to clarify what he or she is asking for before you reply. For longer pieces, such as a policy manual or business report, you can look at examples of prior documents to figure out what should and shouldn't be included and how to phrase it.


If your department has a style guide for the types of work-related writing it does, consult it as frequently as necessary during the planning and writing process.

, Writing for corporate executives is different from writing for customers, and both are different from writing for your immediate boss or your co-workers. While you need to establish a professional tone at all times, each audience is looking for different information and each audience brings a different range of knowledge and expectations to what they're reading.


Try to steer a middle course between being overly stiff and too casual in how you write. You can be more casual with customers and co-workers if the content of your message permits it, but you should be more formal when writing for corporate executives and shareholders.

Be straightforward.,
Be succinct.,
Use the active voice.,
Don't turn verbs and adjectives into nouns.,
Use words you know the meaning of and use them correctly.",How to Improve Your Work Related Writing2," The goal in writing for a business audience, inside or outside the company, is to clearly communicate your message. While you need to adopt a business-like tone, your style should not get in the way of your actual message.

, While trying to figure out what you want to say, you may put down more words than you need to in getting to your point. Too many of these words may frustrate your reader, leading him or her to skim over your message or to simply ignore it. While you're trying to get a handle on what you want to tell your readers, go ahead and put the words down as they occur to you, then go back and edit out what you don't need. Here are a few things to look for when editing:


Cliches. Overused phrases get ignored after a while, leading to coining new phrases that, in turn, get overused themselves. Avoid cliches like the plague; choose clear, precise descriptions over trying to be clever.
Overusing qualifiers. There's nothing wrong with using words like ""many,"" ""most,"" ""generally"" or ""very"" when called for, but using them too often weakens the impact of your writing. Some words don't need qualifiers; outside of marketing copy, there's no call for ""very unique,"" and even marketers can do without saying it.
Stock phrases. As with qualifiers, phrases such as ""the fact that,"" ""the reason for,"" ""in light of"" and ""on the grounds that"" weaken your work-related writing when you use them too often. You can replace many stock phrases with simpler words, such as saying ""can"" in place of ""has the ability to"" and use the longer phrase only when you want to call attention to a sentence.
Redundant words. Sometimes 2 words that mean roughly the same thing, such as ""hopes and dreams"" are paired to give the meaning greater impact. This works when used sparingly; however, most of the time you should keep the word that fits the meaning of your sentence better and take out the other.

, Active voice, in which the subject of the sentence comes before a strong action verb and is followed by the object, is more powerful than passive voice, where the subject comes last and is preceded by a form of ""to be"" (""am,"" ""are,"" ""is,"" ""was,"" ""were""). Compare ""Stocks rose 42 points after the Packers' Super Bowl victory"" (active voice) with ""The Packers' Super Bowl victory was responsible for stocks rising 42 points"" (passive voice).


Some passive voice phrases such as ""This is,"" ""That is,"" ""There is"" and ""It is"" are necessary to refer to a previous sentence.
It's also possible to overuse forms of ""to be"" and ""to have"" without phrasing something in the passive voice. Contrast ""The Packers' Super Bowl victory had a positive impact on stock prices"" with ""Stock prices rose after the Packers won the Super Bowl.""

, Using the noun forms of words commonly used as verbs or adjectives make what you're saying sound more abstract and less concrete. This form of writing may be called for in some academic and government settings or when addressing corporate executives, but not when addressing your co-workers in a clear, unambiguous manner.

, Your goal is to communicate clearly, not to impress people with words that may take focus away from what you're trying to communicate. This is particularly important when reporting to company shareholders or giving instructions to company employees.

Make writing a habit.,
Get back to basics.,
Cross-check your write-ups.,
Eliminate the fillers.",How to Improve Content Writing Skills," Practice makes perfect, and it is understood that a professional writer must have good writing habits. Write on diverse topics to gain knowledge. More and more writing not only helps you improve your style and efficiency but also helps in improving vocabulary, sentence formation, and other writing skills.;
, Even if English is your native language, it is important for a writer to understand the basics of English – called grammar! Every content writer needs to follow grammatical rules to make the write-up error-free. Easy, simple and grammatically correct language helps the reader to understand the content better. Small mistakes, like a missing comma, a spelling error or wrong use of word, can spoil the meaning of the sentence.

, No one is perfect, and thus, don’t expect your work to be perfect the first time you draft it. Make a habit of proofreading your articles, blogs, newsletters or press releases very thoroughly. It is better to correct the minor mistakes before the content is published to avoid errors you can't correct.

, Readers want to get the best and most complete information possible in a short time. Take efforts to explain and write precisely, without making your content too long. If you can write something in a hundred words rather than five hundred, do so. Meaningful, concise and simple content is always appreciated.

Understand the four most common types of calligraphy pens.,
Try one to two different pens at a time.,
Buy the ink for a dip pen or a brush pen.,
Get ink cartridges for a fountain pen.,
Choose a nib for your pen.,
Load the fountain pen with the ink cartridge.,
Use an eyedropper to put ink in the reservoir of the dip pen or the brush pen.,
Write on fountain pen paper, not regular office paper.,
Use a sloped writing surface for dip pens or brush pens.,
Fasten the paper to your writing surface.,
Do a basic downward stroke.,
Make upward strokes.,
Do a sawtooth pattern.,
Use practice sheets for different writing styles.",How to Write With a Calligraphy Pen," Each pen has a different type of ink, and ink is one of the most important elements of writing calligraphy well. Choosing a calligraphy pen is a highly personal decision, as the ink must be suitable for calligraphy, the pen must fit your hand well, and you must be comfortable writing with it. There are four types of pens that are considered ideal for calligraphy, including:Felt tip pens: These are good for beginners, as they are cheap, easy to use, and do not require you to prepare the ink before use. However, felt tip pens tend to run out of ink fast and the ink can soak through the paper or your writing surface. These pens are good for practice, but should not be used for important documents or works of art.
Fountain pens: These are commonly used by intermediate and advanced calligraphers. These pens contain changeable nibs and ink cartridges. The ink feeds into a nib and is fed on to the page via the slit in the nib.
Dip pens: These pens are used by advanced calligraphers, but they can be used by beginners with patience and practice. Dip pens consist of three components: the handle, nib-holder, or shaft, which is what the calligrapher grips when she writes, the nib, which is usually made of metal and has a slit which releases the ink, and the reservoir, which is the small cup or depression that feeds the slit. Some reservoirs sit on the top of the nib and some sit underneath the nib. The reservoir holds a small supply of ink for the nib so you can write several lines or letters before replenishing the ink.
Brush pens: These pens consist of a thin brush, between 6mm to 20mm wide, with a head made of nylon or sable. The brush head should be made of short and stiff bristles to give you more control over the lines, as you will need to dip the brush into the ink to write. Writing calligraphy with a square brush is different than using a pen with a nib, as the brush will respond to pressure by producing a thicker line and the brush will make a scratchy or lined look when it starts to run out of ink. These pens are also messy to use for beginners and may be more challenging than using felt pen or a fountain pen.;
, Choosing the right calligraphy pen may be a process of trial and error. Pick two different pens, for example, a felt pen and a fountain pen, to get a sense of how each pen writes.You may also want to narrow down your choices by thinking about how messy you want the writing process to be, and how simplified you would like your calligraphy set up to be. A brush pen, for example, will require preparing the ink and constant dipping in the ink as you write. But it may write smoother lines than a felt tip pen, which requires no preparation but may not write as smoothly.
If you are deciding between a fountain pen and a dip pen, keep in mind dip pens give you more freedom to choose nibs, inks, and different holders or handles. However, they can be messier and more temperamental than a fountain pen. A fountain pen, or another cartridge filled pen, will be less messy and more convenient, as you do not need to prepare ink before you write. But you are limited to only certain kinds of inks and nibs when you use a fountain pen and fountain pens will be less flexible to write with than a dip pen or a brush pen., If you are using a dip pen, or a brush pen, you will need to purchase the ink for the pen. Use calligraphy ink, rather than fountain pen ink. Calligraphy ink is more viscous and will cling to the nib better, which will give you more control over the ink as you write.Look for thicker inks like India ink or Chinese stick ink. Avoid India inks that contain shellac, as this substance dries quickly and can damage the nib in your dip pen or brush pen. Many brush pens and dip pens will come in sets that contain the ink and the nib.

, Many fountain pens will come with ink cartridges and nibs recommended by the manufacturer. Start with the manufacturer's recommendations when you first start writing calligraphy.Some pens may also have converters so you can use different inks in the pen once you get comfortable with basic fountain pen ink. Fountain pen ink is thin so it will not clog the pen as you write, but the nib unit in more fountain pens are rigid. So it will not be as flexible as a dip pen or a brush pen.

, Fountain pens, dip pens, and brush pens use nibs to hold the ink in the pen and provide a supply of ink as you write. Contrary to popular belief, it is not a good idea to literally dip your calligraphy pen into a pot of ink. This will lead to blots and uncontrolled ink flow. Instead, invest in a nib. There are two types of nibs:Italic nibs: These nibs are usually used to write styles like Gothic and Italic in calligraphy. Italic nibs have a blunt edge and are rigid, so they are not very flexible and don’t allow you to vary your lines or strokes when you write.
Flex nibs: Most calligraphers use flex nibs. These nibs are rounded with two tines that end at a point. The more the tines’ split on the nib, the wider the line width available on the pen. You must apply pressure as you write to separate the tines and create wider or thinner lines.

, Your fountain pen will consist of three components: the cap, the nib, and the barrel. You will need to load the ink cartridge into the nib to get ink flowing in your fountain pen. To do this:Remove the cap and then remove the barrel from the nib by turning it clockwise.
Insert the cartridge into the nib by pushing it firmly on the non pointed side of the nib. Once the cartridge is attached to the nib, you will hear a small click.
You can switch between bottled ink and ink cartridges with a fountain pen as you get more advanced in your calligraphy writing.

, Due to the nature of dip pens and brush pens, you will need to reload the reservoir on the pen with ink after several letters or words. To put ink in the reservoir:Hold the pen horizontally in your writing hand.
Use your other hand to dip the eye dropper into the pen ink so there is several drops in the dropper.
Apply ink from the dropper into the reservoir on the pen. Continue to hold the pen horizontally so you do not get any ink spots on your paper or your hands.
Put the dropper on a saucer next to the ink. You will need to reload the pen again after a few minutes of writing.
Test the ink-flow of the pen on a piece of scrap paper before you practice calligraphy on your main piece of paper.

, Low quality paper that is thin, like office paper, will cause your ink to bleed all over the paper and will likely ruin your calligraphy. Look for paper that is fountain pen friendly at your local craft store.Most fountain pen friendly paper will be thicker and of higher quality to prevent ink bleeding or feathering.
When you are first learning how to write calligraphy, you may want to use practice sheets with lines and margins. You can access a practice sheet here and print it out on thick paper. This will help you get used to writing within certain guidelines so that as you continue practice, you can write on calligraphy paper with no lines.

, These pens work well if they are writing on a sloped surface, like an angled writing desk, an easel, or a board on your lap that is sloped against the edge of a table.Always use a stable writing surface that cannot slide or shift. You should also adjust your seat so you are at a comfortable working height over the writing surface.
Keep the calligraphy ink within reach of your non-writing hand, as well as the eye dropper, so you can re fill the nib of the pen easily. You should also have a small saucer for resting the brush in case you need to leave your work area. This will ensure there are no splotches on your paper or your hands.

, Use masking tape or paper clips to keep the paper flat against the writing surface. A shifting paper can lead to blotches and broken lines when you are practicing your calligraphy.If you are using a practice sheet of paper with lines, you may want to place another thicker piece of paper under it so the ink does not soak through your writing surface.
You may also want to place a guard sheet under your writing hand so the oils from your hand do not absorb into the paper or get onto your calligraphy.

, Hold the pen so it is horizontal to the top writing line. This is a zero degree nib angle. Keep the nib flat to the paper as you make a vertical downward stroke on the paper. Maintain equal pressure as you make the downward stroke. You should have a downward stroke that shows the thickest downstroke possible with your pen.To get the thinnest stroke, pull the pen horizontally across the paper from left to right. Make thick downward strokes and thin horizontal strokes to form the boxes. This will help you get a sense of how much pressure is needed to make thick strokes and thin strokes with your pen.
Use your arm, rather than your wrist, to write with the pen. This will help your arm stay steady and give your writing flow.

, Adjust your pen so you are holding it at a forty-five degree angle. Use the boxes you drew as a marker. Forty-five degrees is halfway between o and 90, so cut one side of the box in half and place your nib parallel to that diagonal line. Practice making upward strokes with your pen at a forty-five degree angle, starting at the bottom line on the paper.Apply various amounts of pressure for each stroke. The more pressure you apply on the pen, the thicker your strokes will be. Thinner strokes are created with less pressure on the pen as you make the upward stokes.

, Use the lines on the paper to create a jagged pattern that will help you practice angling the pen. Keep your pen at a forty-five degree angle.Make diagonal upstrokes that are thin and vertical downstrokes that are thick. You should form a sawtooth like pattern. Lift your pen every third stroke and do one downward stroke and then one upward stroke.
Continue to make sawtooth patterns for an entire practice sheet.

, Practice creating boxes and strokes with your pen until you feel comfortable with these basic lines. You can then move into writing script, such as letters and words, in calligraphy.There are several different writing styles, from Gothic to Italic to cursive writing. Each type has rules and guidelines for writing letters and words with a calligraphy pen. Print off practice sheets of each of these writing styles and practice each letter until you get comfortable enough to create short words and phrases.

Choose a broad main topic you are particularly interested in and would like to write about.,
Determine an audience.,
Make a chart of possible subtopics.,
Ponder the possibilities.,
Choose the mini-topic you are interested in the most.,
Look to make sure there isn't another mini-topic that could fit with your original mini-topic that you could add to the original.,
There is your topic!

",How to Find a Topic for Nonfiction," For example, history or science. Don't make it very specific, though, like Medieval times or biology. Sometimes, you can combine two subjects, like the history of science. Other groups include animals, social studies, humanities, sports, cooking and baking.;
, Age group is one important factor. For example, you might not want to write a short little 20 page book about honeybees if you would like to gain attention from adults, just as you would not write a novel-length book about physics if you wanted to keep the attention of little kids. Know who you're writing for before you dive in.


Make a more specific audience. For example, would you like to attract the smarter end of the IQ test takers? You might want to consider making it more in-depth and you would have to do more research. Or, maybe you would like to attract people who have not a lot of time? Make your book short, simple and to the point.

, Put interests on one side and disinterests on the other. Keep your audience in mind. Write down everything you could possibly write about, and give it a category based on whether you are interested in it or not. These things should be broad, like birds or cooking, rather than mockingbirds and appetizers.

, For topics that really interest you, take a smaller topic that particularly stands out to you. Say you are interested in the Big Bang Theory. You're topic should be the Big Bang Theory, not something like when black holes appeared after the Big Bang. If you are considering writing this down, maybe you should write about black holes. Repeat with every interest. Keep your audience in mind. If every topic you come up with doesn't work with your audience, it might be time to change your audience.

, Make sure you are really interested. Otherwise, your ideas can burn out during research because of lack of interest.

, If there is, and you really want to, you can combine the topics - say, fancy dinners and fancy desserts.

What would you like to learn more about? In addition to listing, there are several other brainstorming techniques you can try. Consider the following strategies:


Examine a topic from 3 different perspectives. 1. Describe the topic: What is it? What are its constituent parts? What makes its different from other similar topics? 2. Trace the topic: What is the history of your topic? How has it developed over time? What are the most significant events in its history? 3. Map the topic. What other topics is your topic related to? How is it influenced by those topics? How, in turn, does it influence those topics?Use similes. Complete this sentence: “My topic is like _________.” Try to list as many similes as you can.Visualize your topic. Create a map, a web, or cluster. First write your topic at the center of a large sheet of paper. Then, write down as many related topics as you can around that central term. Which topics are similar? Which topics are very different? Finally, circle the most interesting terms on the paper and draw lines connecting related terms.
Use the classic journalist’s questions. Who? What? Where? When? Why? and How?Author Neil Gaiman recommends that you ask yourself “What if?” and that you complete sentences that begin “If only…” and “I wonder,” “What if I woke up one day only to find out that I was a giant cockroach?” or “If only there was a simple way for busy parents to organize their lives.”As you brainstorm, resist the temptation to censor yourself or to edit as you write. Instead, write everything down. Some ideas will be terrible, but you’ve got to weed out the bad ideas in order to arrive at the good ones.
Do this for a set amount of time, say, 15 minutes. Don’t stop until that time is over.It may take several brainstorming sessions before you feel like you’re getting anywhere. This is normal. Don’t give up!;
, Examine the lists you’ve made during your brainstorming sessions. Identify the most interesting ideas. Working with one idea at a time, write—without stopping—about that idea. In freewriting, the only rule is that you write without stopping. If you don’t know what to write, then you should write, “I don’t know what to write!” At this stage, the goal is to generate material as much material as possible. Think quantity over quality.As with brainstorming, the point here is to write and keep writing. Give yourself a set amount of time and don’t stop until the time is up.Experiment with your approach. Try writing a story, a poem, or an autobiography.Trying on different techniques at this stage can help you see your ideas from different angles.
Limit yourself to one idea per freewriting session.

, Writing in a journal everyday is a great way not only to keep track of your experiences but also to reflect on those experiences. Reflecting on your experiences can help you understand them. Try asking yourself questions like, “Why did my co-worker get so angry when I complimented him on his haircut?” or “What did that strange dream I had last night mean?”


Since a journal is private, you can confidently experiment with different styles, voices, and ideas, without worrying about too much about mistakes.
Give yourself a set amount to write—say one page—everyday.
See How to Keep a Journal for more information and advice.

, Consider joining a writing group or taking a creative writing class. Share your ideas with your friends and family. Keep track of the responses you receive in your journal.

, Food writer Michael Ruhlman attended the Culinary Institute of America so that he could write The Making of a Chef. If you’re trying to learn something new or write a how-to manual, this might seem like a no-brainer. However, even fiction writers and poets will need to learn the facts about a topic before they begin. James Joyce’s descriptions of turn-of-the-century Dublin in Ulysses are so detailed that there a walking tours that follow the main characters’ travels throughout the town.

, As you find information about a topic, you’ll begin to get a sense of what others have written.Try to notice what’s not being said. Ask yourself, “Do books currently on the market have the most up-to-date information?” “Is there a perspective that hasn’t been covered yet?” Brian A. Klems, author of Oh Boy, You’re Having a Girl: A Dad’s Survival Guide to Raising Daughters, researched parenting guides for fathers and noticed that there were none dealing with raising young daughters., Then try to solve it. The entire field of self-help literature does just this. See, for instance, Dale Carnegie’s best-seller How to Win Friends and Influence People, which adapted to principles of psychology to help readers master social situations.


You can discover problems in your own life (“Why am I always late for work?”) or in your research.

, What books have been best-sellers? What do these books have in common? Why have these books been so popular?


Even novelists and—perhaps to a lesser extent—poets need to know what the book market is like.Besides, you don’t want to write the same thing that someone else has already written, do you?
Capitalizing on a trend can be risky. You might be viewed as a copycat.

, Research can provide a great deal of inspiration, not just in terms of content, but in terms of form as well. As you research, you’ll familiarize yourself, not just with what’s being said about a topic, but also with how it’s being said. For instance, you might discover several novels dealing with your topic. Rather than abandoning the topic altogether, you might ask yourself, “Has anyone written a book of poems about this?”

, By this point, you should have not one but several good ideas to choose from. Now you’ve got to choose one of them to pursue further. Be honest with yourself about which idea has the most potential and will keep you interested.


Ask yourself, “Can this idea be sustained for the length of a book?” Books vary in length, yes, but an idea for a book needs to be a “big” idea.

, Are you interested in writing fiction or nonfiction? In the former category, you could write a novel or a collection of short stories. In the latter category, you could write a biography, an analysis, a history, a how-to manual, or a reference work. Sometimes authors find great success in adapting topics for an unusual genre. For instance, W.G. Sebald’s work combines elements of fiction, history, biography and photography. Other authors like Stephen King and Don DeLillo, in 11/22/63 and Libra, respectively, have experimented with what’s known as historical fiction, fictional accounts of actual historical events., Great book ideas could come from taking a well-worn book type and adapting it for a new audience. Best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell has made a career out of writing about science for general audiences. Ask yourself, “Who might benefit from learning about this topic?” “What might they like to know?” “What kind of background information will they need?”

, Writing a book is a serious undertaking and can be overwhelming. This is why it’s important to break up the process into smaller, more manageable tasks. Even if you feel like you have all the time in the world, setting goals is an important first step in getting things done. Give yourself daily, weekly, and monthly goals.Specific goals are much more easy to achieve than abstract ones. Rather than telling yourself, “I’m going to finish a chapter this week,” you should tell yourself, “I’m going to write 3 pages this week.”
Reward yourself for meeting those small goals. Write 500 words, then go for a walk or play with your dog. Be realistic about the amount you can accomplish. Planning too much in single day will only discourage you.

, Establish a regular writing routine and stick to it. Set aside a block of time each day during which you can write uninterrupted. Plan to write for a certain amount of time (say, 1 hour) or up to a certain number of words (1000).


Write at the same time everyday.Write regardless of whether or not you feel inspired to do so.Consider signing up for a writing reminder service like the one at 750words.com

Do some background reading.,
Start narrowing down your area.,
Make a bubble map to help with the idea-generating process.,
Keep adding ideas to the bubble map.,
Begin researching the main ideas on your bubble map.,
Get an idea of the research in the field.,
Use keywords to find articles related to your topic.,
Take notes and use them to choose your topic.,
Try to look at your chosen topic in an original way.,
Choose a topic that you enjoy.",How to Generate the Best Research Topics," To generate a topic for a research paper, you have to do a little reading first. If your class is reading an introductory book, you can get an idea of what you like. If not, you can read one on your own. Browse it until you find something that catches your attention.


Read as much as you can. At this stage, it’s okay to use search engines and sites like Wikipedia. They will give you enough information to figure out if you like a topic.;
, Once you have completed your reading, it's time to start narrowing down your areas of interest. You can do this by picking a topic that you like, then delving deeper and deeper into that topic until you find something worth writing about.For example, if your class is ""Introduction to Psychology"", you could narrow down your area to behavioral psychology, based on your reading.
Once you've established a general area of interest, you can start narrowing your area even further. For example, within the field of behavioral psychology, you may decide to focus only on the work of B. F. Skinner.
Make a list of all the things that interest you within your narrowed topic. Maybe you find classical conditioning interesting, or perhaps you find a particular experiment fascinating.

, Take out a blank sheet of paper. Draw your main idea in a bubble in the middle of the paper. Draw a line going off the main idea, then make another bubble. In that bubble, put something related to the main idea that you find interesting.


Keep drawing bubbles and adding additional ideas. Sometimes, you will add your ideas on to secondary bubbles instead of the main one. You can keep expanding an idea out. In fact, it’s a good idea to focus on an idea that continues to branch off the main one if you find it interesting.
For example, in your main bubble you might put “B. F. Skinner and Behavioral Psychology.” Then in one secondary bubble, you might put ""the principle of reinforcement"", while in another you put ""radical behaviorism"".

, Keep working on the bubble map, even when you think you’re done. If you push yourself to keep thinking and writing, then you’ll continue to come up with interesting ideas. The more ideas you come up with, the greater the chance that you will come up with an excellent research idea.


Once you’re at a point where you don’t want to add anything else, look at the thought-bubble map as a whole. What areas are especially developed? What areas do you find the most interesting? Can any of the areas be combined to make an interesting topic?
Circle the ideas that seem to work the best for you. Just be careful not to choose a topic that is too broad, as you might be overwhelmed with information and find it hard to find a focus for your paper., Unlike the reading stage, you should start reading some more serious works. Look at books in the library., Check databases for more specific articles. Don’t just Google the topic, or search for it in Wikipedia.


Most major libraries have databases you can use. You will need a library card to access them; some even require that you be in the library to use them.
However, databases like EBSCOhost have many smaller databases that you can search; which ones are included depends on what your library pays for.

, Research libraries will often include databases on every topic, from business to humanities to psychology. In the advanced search, you can choose which ones you search, so pick one relevant to your topic. You will get academic articles in return for your search. Be sure to try different sets of keywords; you never know which set will bring up the results you want.

, When you take notes, you can begin to see where different authors reference each other and where different ideas come together. Pick one of those intersections as your topic. Continue to research it until you can develop it into a paper.

, If you’re in high school or an undergraduate, your topic doesn't necessarily need to be original, as your professors will mainly be wanting to see if you can develop a theme throughout the paper. However, in graduate school, your topic should be more original.


It should be something that hasn't been covered a hundred times by someone else, so be careful when picking out your research topic. You should get an idea of what has already been covered as you research to help you choose something original.
For instance, there’s likely been a good number of articles written on B.F. Skinner’s behavioral psychology, but your idea can be different in how you apply it. Maybe you want to apply it to a piece of literature or maybe you want to look at it in relation to current pop culture. The application of it can be original.

, Also, make sure your topic is something you enjoy, as you’re going to be spending some time working on it. You don’t want to be researching a topic you hate, as that dislike and disinterest will show up in your essay.For more information on writing a good research paper, see this article.

Writing is hard work, often poorly paid, often lonely and sometimes it also wins you a set of disgruntled critics you never knew existed. It isn't an existence for everyone but if you truly believe that you want this more than anything else in life, this desire will be one very important part of what can make it happen for you. The following lists some traits that you'll likely need to become a full-time writer:


Tenacity. Hour upon hour of working on your manuscript, living with your characters, your stories, your research, your analysis, etc. can do your head in at times. You need to be very determined to keep going and slogging through even the parts you least enjoy (and there will be plenty of those).
Self-discipline. Writing requires a constancy from you that you might not expect. It can be easy to wander off, lose the thread, find other things to do. To get up a little later than usual, to make this into a new bad habit, then find the day's already half gone. You must be self-disciplined enough to stick to the hours you've chosen for writing, and to not see this as a time of meandering off. Moreover, this discipline has to be applied to every book you write, for as long as you choose to be a writer.
Willing to use initiative. You become the sole arbiter of research, finding things out, fact-checking, analyzing, etc. While friends and family may be willing to help out occasionally, you won't be able to ask for the help all of the time and you will need to learn to stand on your own and work things out for yourself. Good interviewing skills can be very handy though!
Creativity. Regardless of what you're writing about, you will need to have the ability to generate lots of ideas. Not all ideas will reach fruition but they are all important to the process of firming up your written work.
Having a good grasp of your language. Having good grammar, a large vocabulary and being comfortable working with words are all important elements of being a good writer. Having a knowledge of at least one other language can be useful too; while not essential, it can help diversify your own language and lets you understand different cultural slants.;
, A large part of finding the courage to change something you're doing in life is trusting that you can do it. If you're unsure of your skills, work on them. If you know you're already good a writing, stay open to continuous learning, because no matter how skilled and experienced you are, a good writer never stops learning. By being flexible, willing to learn and trusting of your own abilities, you will have a good foundation for launching your writing career.

, Set up an area that is just for your writing. This will help you to keep everything in one place and encourage you to sit (or stand/treadmill) at this one space on a regular basis.


A standing or treadmill desk is a nice option for writers. Some writers find that standing or walking at a suitable pace encourages writing and keeps you fit at the same time.

, Although most people have gravitated toward typing on a word processing machine of one type or another, it's not the only way to write. The simple and standard book and pen or pencil remains a time-old way of writing; in fact, carrying a notebook with you everywhere is important for jotting down ideas as they occur to you.

, If you are not able to toss in everything to ""just write"", the best solution is to take it slowly and find chunks of time that are devoted purely to writing. This will allow you to continue your usual daily efforts, such as work, making dinner, cleaning the house, spending time with the kids, and other things that are important. To do this, sort out what isn't essential in your day, such as watching TV, playing games, chatting all night, etc. With the spare time gained, devote this to writing.

, When developing your novel, book, non-fiction work, poetry anthology, or whatever it is that you're writing, it is useful to have goals. These goals can include what you expect to have written by when, which parts of your research must be done by what time, how many chapters are completed, and so forth.

, Start a blog or a review website. Practice regular writing updates to hone your craft and learn what people like and don't much like. If you need extra income, you might even consider monetizing the blog and getting a small amount of revenue. Also consider freelance writing opportunities, with websites, magazines, newspapers, travel publications, etc. There are lots of ways to get your writing published, some of which will also come with earnings.


Use the feedback from those assessing your work to guide improvements in your writing.
Use the experience to find out what styles of writing you prefer over other styles. For example, you may think you have a passion for fiction, only to discover that you prefer non-fiction, auto-biographical analysis of daily life or social commentary. Give a few styles a try.

, It's a good time to learn whether writing is for you, to see if you can produce writing readers enjoy, even to see if you can make money from the writing. If you find the gradual writing, or ""on-the-side"" writing is fulfilling enough for you, then that's great. If not, ensure that it has an end date.

, This might be a 5-hour day, an 8-hour day, a 12-hour day or a weekly or monthly total of hours. Full-time is whatever it takes to get the amount written that you think is appropriate within a chosen time span; it is not necessarily the same as what full-time is for a job––it may be much less or it may be more. It could be all that you do as work, or you you might switch into part-time work, with full-time writing. Or, you might ask work for a day or two a week off to write, working the remaining time as usual. What does ""full-time"" mean to you?


Most importantly, the time you take off must be used meaningfully. It is no good setting aside time and then not writing.
If you cling to a job, writing may sometimes only remain your ""on the side"" habit. This may work initially as a way to wean yourself off, pay off the mortgage, etc., but eventually you may feel constrained. Some people can juggle both a job and a writing career but many find they can't, and you may reach a point of having to decide between the job and your writing.
If you have decided being a writer is a good way of getting away from a job you hate, be aware that this is not a reason to write. Writing must be something you feel a need to do that is so deep inside, so innate and such a part of you, that you can't imagine not doing it. If you want an escape from a less-than-ideal job, there are writing possibilities but you'd be better off blogging or doing reviews while looking for a change of career. If you discover a passion for writing, that's great; if not, at least you'll have a monetized source of income and can branch out into business or a new job.

, Whether you're going to work part-time and write full-time, live off an inheritance, have an arrangement with a spouse or partner, etc., you must be able to cope with this lifestyle, including financially. If you are not able to pay the bills and meet the rent, this may not be the time be going writing full-time. That said, this is a good time to review your expenses and budget for living on less. If you're serious about writing, a sound budget that cuts out all unnecessary expenses may be enough to get you the freedom of time you need to be a writer. If you are determined to write, the sacrifices will be worth it.


Be aware that ultimately, a successful writer needs to let go of crutches that hold them back. Often, this is the certainty of a job. While the job is there, the writing is a hobby. As soon as the job is gone, writing is your job. Are you able to make that leap?
If you live where health benefits are not publicly funded, you must consider your own health issues and those of your family as part of what you consider in your security.

, You might want to write novels or big non-fiction tomes. However, when you start out writing full-time, it might be a good idea to keep up the smaller paid-writing stints you developed during your transition (if you took one), or start with this, so that you have a regular reason for writing, income if you need it, and feedback on a regular basis. As your confidence develops and you have a settled routine in place, it will likely become easier to discipline your writing to achieve your larger project.


On the other hand, if you prefer to just get stuck into the big writing, go for it! However, even with such a determination, it can be good to have something else to work on, to remain balanced, be it another piece of writing or a hobby. Chores and raising a family do not count for this equation, as you must do these anyway.

, As well as learning everything you can about the skills to be a good writer, also learn about what happens post-writing. You must be across how publishing works and how marketing works. Also, decide whether you plan on sending your work to others to sell or you'll try to do that on your own, realizing that although the internet has made self-publishing easier, the marketing will likely involve a big part of your time and efforts.


Consider talking to publishers about your ideas to see what they would expect from you if you did send them a manuscript for their consideration.
Find an editor you can rely on and who is able to help your writing reach its full potential. All good writers have a good editor behind their work. Use this person to refine and improve your books and written pieces.

As well, it should advance the story or narrative by clarifying the speaker’s intentions, wants or beliefs, or altering the speaker’s relationship with the other characters.A dramatic monologue usually occurs when a character is facing an extreme crisis, a dramatic moment in the plot, or a “do-or-die” situation where simple actions can no longer suitably convey the immense feeling or desire the character is dealing with.
An effective dramatic monologue should express the goal or agenda of the speaker. It can also try to enlist the support of other characters or the audience, or attempt to change the hearts and minds of the audience or the listener.
A dramatic monologue can be used in theater, poetry and film.

, A dramatic monologue in theater is an uninterrupted speech made by a character and is an expression of the character’s inner thoughts and feelings.A monologue differs from a soliloquyin that a soliloquy is literally a character talking to him/herself. A dramatic monologue has an implied audience, as the character will usually be speaking to another character in the monologue.
You are likely familiar with the famous soliloquy in Shakespeare’s Hamlet, (“To be or not to be…”) but the play also has a number of dramatic monologues, including one by the ghost of Hamlet’s father.Addressing Hamlet in the dramatic monologue, the ghost begins by identifying himself (“I am thy father's spirit”) before revealing to Hamlet that he was murdered by his brother, Hamlet’s uncle, and the crown was stolen from him:The serpent that did sting thy father's life
Now wears his crown. Thy uncle,
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterous beast,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts--
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
So to seduce! -- won to his shameful lust
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.


Shakespeare uses a dramatic monologue to not only further a plot point in the play (the murder of Hamlet’s father) but to also give Hamlet’s father an emotional presence in the play through a direct address to Hamlet and by extension, to the audience.

, A dramatic monologue in poetry, also known as a personal poem, shares many characteristics with a theatrical monologue. There is an implied audience, there is no dialogue, and the poet speaks through an assumed voice, like a character.The monologue is dramatic in that is is meant to be read to an audience. In poetry, a dramatic monologue allows the poet to express a point of view through a certain character.Robert Hayden’s Night, Death, Mississippi is a good example of a dramatic monologue in poetry, as the poem adopts the voice of an aging KKK member, listening to the sound of a lynching outside but too old to join the other KKK members.With a stanza such as:
Christ, it was better
than hunting bear
which don't know why
you want him dead.


Using the device of the dramatic monologue in the poem, Hayden is able to create powerful emotion through taking on the disturbing and violent voice of a character.

, There's a wealth of great monologues in poetry, plays, novels, and film that can serve as models for your own dramatic monologue. It may be useful to look specifically at:


Robert Browning's poem “My Last Duchess”.Madame Ranevsky’s monologue in Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard.The Indianapolis monologue in Spielberg’s Jaws.Jules’ shepherd monologue in Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction., Try to do more than read it over and instead, consider how it is working from a craft perspective. You may ask questions such as:To whom is the speaker addressing in the monologue?
What does the speaker want from the addressee or receiver of the monologue?
Why is the speaker performing the monologue at this point in the story?
How does this monologue affect the overall plot and/or development of the speaker, as well as the other characters in the scene or in the story?
What kind of language or description is the speaker using? What gives the speaker a unique or distinct voice?
If we look at Jules’ shepherd monologue in Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction” as an example, the monologue occurs at the very end of the film, in the climax of a scene: the robbery of a diner.
Jules: Well there's this passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.""


The speaker is the character Jules Winnfield, a hit man played by Samuel L. Jackson.
In previous scenes in the film, we are shown Jules and his partner, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) carrying out a hit on a group of college kids who stole money from their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). During the hit, one of the kids shoots at Jules and Vincent, but, by some miracle, none of the bullets end up killing either men. Jules takes it as a sign from a higher power and during this dramatic monologue, explains that he is reconsidering his stance on killing others, or being “the tyranny of evil.”
The dramatic monologue occurs at a key character moment for Jules, and the receiver of the monologue, a robber named “Honey Bunny”, becomes a stand in for all of the other people Jules has killed in the past. The monologue ends with Jules putting down his gun and allowing the robbers to leave unharmed, a major moment of character development.
In terms of language use, Jules quotes a passage from the Bible, Ezekiel 25:17, which is a throwback to the earlier scene where he kills the college kids. Using Biblical language and then analyzing the more formal, poetic language of the Bible with curse words and casual slang like “my righteous ass” and “tryin’” instead of “trying”, Jules’ character expresses himself with a distinct tone and style in the monologue that is consistent with his speech and voice in previous scenes in the film.

, Think about which character or characters’ development could be furthered in your story by a dramatic monologue. Though your main character or one of your principal characters will likely go through the most character development, or be changed or altered by a conflict or event in the story, they do not necessarily need to be the speaker in the dramatic monologue.


For example, the ghost monologue in Hamlet is serving the overall story in two ways: it relays key information to the play’s protagonist (Hamlet), thereby setting him up to fulfill a revenge plot to get back at his murderous uncleand also adds to the feeling of unnatural occurrences or not quite reality in the play.So, though the ghost is not a major character, having the ghost as the speaker of the monologue still serves the overall story and furthers the action of the main character in the play.
Comparatively, Jules’ monologue in “Pulp Fiction” serves to further character development in the story by allowing one of the main characters to express their emotions and explain their actions. The monologue illustrates the character’s progression from the beginning of the story to the end of the story and lets the viewer know a change or shift has occurred for that character.

, Once you have identified the purpose of the dramatic monologue in your story (to relay information to the audience? to create dramatic tension? to signal a character shift or change?), you will need to figure out how it will fit into a scene.


If it is a monologue that will show character development, you may want to place it towards the mid point or climax of the story or towards the end of the story.
If it is a monologue that is going to spoken by a minor character to relay information to a main character or add to the theme or mood of the story, you may want to place it earlier in the action of the story.
For example, the ghost monologue in Hamlet occurs early in the play, Act I, Scene 5. By the time the ghost appears, Shakespeare has already established Hamlet as a the main character as well as his unease or melancholy nature, and the “foul” or troubled state of the kingdom of Denmark. The monologue then moves the story forward as it causes Hamlet to take action, thereby furthering the overall plot.
Comparably, Jules’ monologue takes place in the last scene of the film, and functions to show that Jules has changed or shifted. The previous scenes all served to illustrate Jules’ journey as a main character and prepares the audience for his moment of realization. The monologue resolves the conflict he struggled with throughout the rest of the film, so it is placed at the end of the film as a moment of resolution.

, Remember that with a first draft, you are trying to get a feel for the character’s voice and the way they might express their desires or concerns. Don’t put pressure on yourself to create a perfect first attempt, as you will be rewriting, editing, and redrafting it. Remember to:Use your character's voice. Keep in mind the language, description, and tone of that character. Focus on sensory details like taste, touch, sound, etc. to engage the audience’s empathy or emotion for the character by engaging their senses.Use the present tense. This is happening now and should have a sense of urgency.

, While it is ideal to have a hook beginning, a catchy line or phrase that will engage the viewer’s attention, make sure the monologue fits within the current scene or has enough build up to justify its presence in the scene.


You could begin the scene with a short introduction to the speaker, such as in the ghost monologue: “I am thy father’s spirit.”
You could then have the speaker and the other character(s) have a conversation or dialogue to build up the monologue, such as in the diner scene with Jules’ monologue, where Jules asks if the robber (Tim Roth) reads the Bible before launching into the monologue with a Biblical passage.

, Create a build up to a reveal or explore the speaker’s motive or desire. It should be clear what the speaker is trying to communicate to the listener.


In the ghost monologue, the ghost (speaker) starts a dialogue with Hamlet and over the course of the dialogue, the ghost says lines like ""Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder"".Gradually, the ghost's motive for speaking to Hamlet becomes clearer.
In Jules’ monologue, he recites a passage from the Bible that will frame his larger point about the “tyranny of evil”. The passage also has a double meaning as it was used by Jules in an earlier scene right before he killed the college kids. This is a callback to the previous scene but it places the same passage within a different moment in the character’s journey. The context for the passage has changed for Jules and as a result, it has also changed for the audience.

, Just as in the story as a whole, the climax of the monologue should change the scope of the story and be a pivotal point for the speaker’s development or for the character listening to the speaker.


In the ghost monologue, the climax occurs once the ghost has detailed how he was poisoned by his own brother, Hamlet’s uncle, and his crown and queen was stolen from him. This is a game changer for Hamlet (and by extension, the audience), as it then moves Hamlet to avenge his father’s death and also allows the audience to have sympathy for the wrongful death of Hamlet's father.
In Jules’ monologue, the climax occurs when Jules notes that the listener (the robber) is “weak” and he is the “tyranny of evil” but, despite this evil, he is “tryin’ real hard to be the shepherd”. This climax indicates the robbers will likely live instead of die, and also illustrate the reason why Jules decides to give up his life as a hitman and be a “shepherd” rather than be an active part of the “tyranny of evil.”

, End the monologue with a moment of realization from the speaker and/or the listener and then let the larger story continue or end.


The ghost monologue ends with a call to action for Hamlet to avenge his murder. In the rest of the scene, Hamlet acknowledges this new information about his murderous uncle and responds to the ghost’s call to vengeance by vowing to get even.
At the end of Jules’ monologue, he punctuates his desire to be a “shepherd” rather than part of the “tyranny of evil” by cocking his gun and placing it on the table, thereby allowing the robbers to leave the scene unharmed.

, Now that you feel you have a solid draft of the monologue, consider how it functions within the rest of the story.


Ensure the monologue flows well within the larger story. There should be enough build up or dramatic tension in the moments before the monologue occurs to justify the need for a dramatic monologue.The audience should be prepared, rather than surprised or confused, by the monologue.

, Does the monologue sound natural? Does it sound like something the character would say?


Check the timing of the monologue. Does it take too long to get started? Should it end sooner? What can be cut from the draft? Look for places where the monologue sounds redundant or the same point is stated in different ways.

, Feedback from a live audience can help you identify issues or edits you may have overlooked.


Ask your listeners if they understood the overall message or purpose of the monologue.
If you are writing a dramatic monologue for a play or film, it may be useful to have two people act out the scene with the monologue.
Have someone read the monologue back to you. Listening to someone else interpret your words is a great way to see if your message is clear, the character voice is believable, and there is enough detail in the monologue.

, Many of the most celebrated monologues are the result of many, many drafts and revisions. Don’t be afraid to kill your darlings, which is a phrase in literature that means don’t be precious about removing words or terms that seem out of place or there for the sake of style, rather than substance."

Use single quotation marks to indicate the speaker is quoting someone.Quotations within quotations should use a single quotation mark.,
End a direct quotation with just one form of punctuation.For instance, don’t write “‘That was quite a day!,’ Michaels said.” In that example, the quotation ends with both an exclamation mark and a comma.,
Follow your editorial policy.,
Use brackets to fill in missing information in a quote.",How to Use Quotation Marks in News Articles1," This helps the reader understand that it is not the speaker’s words they are reporting, but rather those of another person.


For example, don’t write: “The attorney asked me “Do you want to take the deal?”” Jenson said.

, Some magazines or newspapers choose not to conform to standard use of quotation marks in their news articles. Your editorial policy might, for example, require you to use italics instead of quotes around titles of books, movies, and TV shows. You might need to include different punctuation in place of quotation marks. Ensure that you understand and conform to your editorial policy when using quotation mark in your news article.

, Sometimes, quotes utilize pronouns that have no meaning unless you know who or what the pronoun refers to. If you wish to use such a quote, you can replace the pronoun or fill in the missing information with brackets.


For instance, you might want to quote Bono as saying, “I think he is someone who really cares about the production value.” Bono said this in conversation about his bandmate, The Edge. When you publish the quote, you could adjust it to read, “I think is someone who really cares about the production value.” In this way, you can use quotes that would otherwise not make sense if quoted directly word-for-word.
Alternately, you could leave the original pronoun in the quote, and write “I think he is someone who really cares about the production value.”Do not substitute parentheses for brackets, as this indicates that the information in the parentheses was said by the speaker of the quote, rather than added by you.

If you are unsure, double check with them as to what they said or consult your recording of the interview.


Never alter quotes.

, This is because a quote rarely has the power to sum up the story on its own.


Provide at least a full paragraph of explanatory text before introducing quotes from the main actors involved in the story.
If you intend to use quotes at all in your story, introduce them in the third or fourth paragraph.
One exception is when writing longer feature articles in a news magazine or, less commonly, in a newspaper.

, Don’t overuse quotes or string them together in long, multi-paragraph passages.


One quote per paragraph is often enough. However, if you choose to include a longer paragraph consisting of mostly or entirely quoted material, you only need to reference the source once. For instance, you could write:

“Our forces are spread thin,” Commander Jones said. “Though the enemy is concentrated in the north, they are massing additional forces in the east, and their allies are gathering strength in the west.”



, For instance, do not write: The party was “surprised” by the speed voters abandoned it. “Surprised” is a fairly typical word and not very memorable, and can therefore be referenced as indirect speech without quotes. Instead, write the same sentence without the quotation marks.


In the case of unusual phrases or language, partial quotes are acceptable. For instance: Senator Michaels was “bowled over” by the response to his legislation. This vocabulary choice is unusual and may indicate something about Senator Michaels’ personality.

, Some people believe that enclosing inflammatory speech within quotation marks will eliminate the possibility that they can be sued for defamatory speech. However, this is not so.


For instance, suppose you write the following sentence: Candidate X is a “dirty communist” and is unfit to hold office. Assuming Candidate X is not a communist, you could be sued for utilizing defamatory speech, even though you enclosed “dirty communist” in quotation marks.

"
"
Explain the quoted material as needed.Explanatory writing is usually the best way to give context to quoted material.,
Clean the quote.Cleaning refers to the removal of foul language.,
Use an ellipsis to remove unnecessary words.Sometimes, you can condense a speaker’s meaning by eliminating excess information.",How to Use Quotation Marks in News Articles3," If the quote is unclear or needs to be given additional context as in the case of a strange idiom from another culture, you might choose to include the explanation in parenthesis within the quotation marks. By including an understandable translation of the idiom within the quotation marks, you can save space on long sentences that would be needed to otherwise explain the idiom.


For instance, you could write: “Unscrew yourself from yourself! (Relax and don’t worry!)”
Explanation might also be needed to clarify the referent of a given quote. For example, if a politician says, “They are way too high,” you could revise the quote for added clarity by writing, “are way too high.” The brackets indicate you’ve inserted the word “taxes” in place of the speaker’s original word choice.

, Many news articles prohibit the use of profanity. To replace the profane words within the quotation marks, use the first letter of the profane word and replace the rest of the letters with dashes. For instance, you could write: “That whole f------ campaign was based on a lie.”

, For example, a speaker might say, “We intend to continue moving in the right direction, along with our allies and partner nations, to keep the country safe and secure.” If your article is primarily about the nation’s security and not about its relationship with other countries, you can omit the extraneous words by writing: “We intend to . . . keep the country safe and secure.”


Be very careful when using an ellipsis to remove words from a quotation. Always stay true to the speaker’s original intention.

"
"
Use quotation marks around titles of creative works.Book titles should have their names in quotations.,
Use quotation marks around names of songs.For instance, you might write a news article about songs such as “We Will Rock You,” “Just Like Heaven,” or “Tonight, Tonight.” Always use quotation marks when referring to song names.,
Enclose the names of paintings in quotation marks.For instance, “Mona Lisa,” “The Persistence of Memory,” and “Nighthawks” are the correct forms for those works.",How to Use Quotation Marks in News Articles4," “Catch-22,” “Jurassic Park,” and “War and Peace,” for instance, should all be enclosed by quotation marks. Use quotation marks to indicate the titles of movies, too. “Star Wars,” “Hannibal,” “Superman,” and other films need quotation marks around them.


Other literary names and titles -- including poems, articles, chapter titles, and plays -- should likewise be surrounded by quotation marks. “Romeo and Juliet” and “Howl,” for instance, are the correct ways to refer to those works.

, Do not enclose band names in quotation marks. Treat these as you would proper names and use appropriate spelling and capitalization.

, Sculptures, however, should not be enclosed in quotation marks, though their titles are capitalized.

Do a freewrite about the topic or subject.,
Make a cluster map about the topic or subject.,
Read writing about the topic or subject.,
Make a plot outline.,
Try the three act structure.,
Create an essay outline.,
Have a thesis statement.,
Include a list of sources.,
Find a quiet, focused environment for writing.,
Start in the middle.,
Do not worry about making mistakes.,
Use the active voice.,
Refer to your outline when you get stuck.,
Read over your rough draft and revise it.",How to Write a Rough Draft," Get your creative juices flowing by doing a freewrite that focuses on the topic or subject of your paper. You may use the essay question assigned to you by your teacher as the prompt for the freewrite. Or, you may focus on describing the subject or topic in the freewrite from the perspective of your main character if you are writing a creative piece. Freewrites are a great way to get your brain warmed up and ready to write.Freewrites often work best if you give yourself a time limit, such as five minutes or ten minutes. You should then try to not take your pen off the page as you write so you are forced to keep writing about the subject or topic for the set period of time.
For example, if you were writing an essay about the death penalty, you may use the prompt: “What are the possible issues or problems with the death penalty?” and write about it freely for ten minutes.
Often, freewrites are also a good way to generate content that you can use later in your rough draft. You may surprised at what you realize as you write freely about the topic.;
, A cluster map is another good brainstorming tactic as it allows you to identity keywords and phrases that you can then use in your rough draft. It can also help you to determine where you stand on a certain subject or topic, especially if you are writing a persuasive essay or paper.To use the clustering method, you will place a word that describes your topic or subject in the center of your paper. You will then write keywords and thoughts around the center word. Circle the center word and draw lines away from the center to other keywords and ideas. Then, circle each word as you group them around the central word.
For example, if you were trying to write a short story around a theme like “anger”, you will write “anger” in the middle of the page. You may then write keywords around “anger”, like “volcano”, “heat”, “my mother”, and “rage”.

, If you are writing an academic essay, you will likely need to do some form of research by reading scholarly texts on the topic or subject. Reading these texts could also help you get inspired and prepared for your rough draft. You may also make notes as you read these texts, creating key points and themes that you may explore later in your rough draft.


If you are writing a creative piece, you may look for texts written about a certain idea or theme that you want to explore in your own writing. You could look up texts by subject matter and read through several texts to get ideas for your story.
You might have favorite writers that you return to often for inspiration or search for new writers who are doing interesting things with the topic. You could then borrow elements of the writer’s approach and use it in your own rough draft.
You can find additional resources and texts online and at your local library. Speak to the reference librarian at your local library for more information on resources and texts.

, If you are writing a creative piece, such as a novel or a short story, you should sit down and create a plot outline. This can be a basic outline and does not need to be very detailed. Having a plot outline to refer to can help you get organized for the rough draft.You may use the snowflake method to create the plot outline. In this method, you will write a one line summary of your story, followed by a one paragraph summary, and then character synopses. You will also create a spreadsheet of scenes.
Alternatively, you can use a plot diagram. In this method, you will have six sections: the set up, the inciting incident, the rising action, the climax, the falling action, and the resolution.
No matter which option you chose, you should make sure your outline contains at least the inciting incident, the climax, and the resolution. Having these three elements set in your mind will make writing your rough draft much easier.

, Another option for creative drafts is to use the three act structure. This structure is popular in screenwriting and playwriting, but it can be used for novels and longer stories as well. The three act structure can also be sketched out quickly and can work as a roadmap for your rough draft. The three act structure is:Act 1: In Act 1, your protagonist meets the other characters in the story. The central conflict of the story is also revealed. Your protagonist should also have a specific goal that will cause them to make a decision. For example, in Act 1, you may have your main character get bitten by a vampire after a one night stand. She may then go into hiding once she discovers she has become a vampire.
Act 2: In Act 2, you introduce a complication that makes the central conflict even more of an issue. The complication can also make it more difficult for your protagonist to achieve their goal. For example, in Act 2, you may have your main character realize she has a wedding to go to next week for her best friend, despite the fact she has now become a vampire. The best friend may also call to confirm she is coming, making it more difficult for your protagonist to stay in hiding.
Act 3: In Act 3, you present a resolution to the central conflict of the story. The resolution may have your protagonist achieve their goal or fail to achieve their goal. For example, in Act 3, you may have your protagonist show up to the wedding and try to pretend to not be a vampire. The best friend may then find out and accept your protagonist anyway. You may end your story by having your protagonist bite the groom, turning him into her vampire lover.

, If you are writing an academic essay or paper, you should create an essay outline, where you have three main sections: an introductory section, a body section, and a concluding section. Though traditionally essays are written in a five paragraph structure, you do not need to have use a paragraph breakdown. Having three sections will allow you to use as many paragraphs as you need to fill each section. Your outline may look like: Section 1: Introduction, including a hook opening line, a thesis statement, and three main discussion points. Most academic essays contain at least three key discussion points.
Section 2: Body paragraphs, including a discussion of your three main points. You should also have supporting evidence for each main point, from outside sources and your own perspective.
Section 3: Conclusion, including a summary of your three main points, a restatement of your thesis, and concluding statements or thoughts.

, If you are creating a rough draft for an academic essay or paper, you should have a thesis statement. Your thesis statement should let readers know what you are going to argue or discuss in your paper. It should act as the road map for your essay, and illustrate how you are going to address the essay question or prompt. Thesis statements are one line long and should contain an assertion, where you state an argument for discussion.For example, maybe you are creating a rough draft for a paper on gluten-intolerance. A weak thesis statement for this paper would be, “There are some positives and negatives to gluten, and some people develop gluten-intolerance.” This thesis statement is vague and does not assert an argument for the paper.
A stronger thesis statement for the paper would be, “Due to the use of GMO wheat in food sold in North America, a rising number of Americans are experiencing gluten-intolerance and gluten-related issues.” This thesis statement is specific and presents an argument that will be discussed in the paper.

, Your outline should also include a list of sources that you are going to use for your essay. You should have several sources that you read during your research that you can them list in a bibliography or list of references. This step is only necessary if you are writing an academic essay or paper.


Your professor or teacher may require you to create a bibliography using MLA style or APA style. You will need to organize your sources based on either style.

, Eliminate any distractions around you by finding a quiet spot at school, in the library, or at home. Turn off your cellphone or put it on mute. Switch off your wi-fi and opt for pen and paper if you tend to get distracted by games on your computer. Creating a quiet spot for writing will ensure you can focus on your rough draft.You may also make sure the room is set to an ideal temperature for sitting down and writing. You may also put on some classical or jazz music in the background to set the scene and bring a snack to your writing area so you have something to munch on as you write.

, It can be intimidating to try to come up with a great opening paragraph or a killer first line. Instead, start in the middle of the essay or story. Maybe you begin by tackling the body sections of your essay first or maybe you start with the moment of complication for your protagonist. Starting in the middle can make it easier to get words down on the page.You may also write the ending of the essay or story before you write the beginning. Many writing guides advise writing your introductory paragraph last, as you will then be able to create a great introduction based on the piece as a whole.

, A rough draft is not the time to try being perfect. Get messy during the rough draft process and be okay if you make mistakes or if the draft is not completely there yet. Write through clunky phrases and awkward sentences until you get into a flow. You can then address these issues once you have finished the rough draft.You should also try not to read over what you are writing as you get into the flow. Do not examine every word before moving on to the next word or edit as you go. Instead, focus on moving forward with the rough draft and getting your ideas down on the page.

, You should also try to get into the habit of always using the active voice in your writing, even in your rough drafts. Avoid passive voice, as passive voice can end up sounding bland and boring to your reader. Active voice allows you to be direct, clear, and concise in your writing, even at the drafting stages.For example, rather than write, “It was decided by my mother that I would learn violin when I was two,” go for the active voice by placing the subject of the sentence in front of the verb, “My mother decided I would learn violin when I turned two.”
You should also avoid using the verb “to be” in your writing, as this is often a sign of passive voice. Removing “to be” and focusing on the active voice will ensure your writing is clear and effective.

, If you find you get stuck during the rough draft process, do not be afraid to lean on your outline and your brainstorming materials. Maybe you refer back to your outline to remember which content you are including in a certain point in the plot or in the body section of your essay.


You may also review the brainstorming materials you created before you sat down to write, such as your clustering exercise or your freewrite. Reviewing these materials could help to guide you as you write and help you focus on finishing the rough draft.
You may want to take breaks if you find you are getting writer’s block. Going for a walk, taking a nap, or even doing the dishes can help you focus on something else and give your brain a rest. You can then start writing again with a fresh approach after your break.

, Once you have finished your rough draft, you may want to step away from it and take a break. Maybe you go for a short walk or do another activity where you do not have to think about the draft. You can then come back to it with fresh eyes and read through it. You will likely notice issues or problems to fix in your rough draft much easier if you take some time away from it.


You should also read the rough draft out loud to yourself. Listen for any sentences that sound unclear or confusing. Highlight or underline them so you know they need to be revised. Do not be afraid to revise whole sections or lines of the rough draft. It is a draft, after all, and will only improve with revision.
You can also read the rough draft out loud to someone else. Be willing to accept feedback and constructive criticism on the draft from the person. Getting a different perspective on your writing will often make it that much better.

Use the appropriate tone and form.,
Start with the most important teachers.,
List other helpers.,
Address financial aid you might've received.,
Put more personal thank-yous and emotional supporters last.",How to Write Acknowledgements1," The acknowledgment page is a common feature at the end of a formal thesis or dissertation, and it can be difficult to know how to include a bit of personal writing at the end of a technical project. It would be strange to follow up your epoch-shattering cancer research study with ""Shout out to D-Nuts for the sick waffles he brought me in the lab that one time."" Make your acknowledgment page professional and brief, but also specific to the people who helped you along the way.The acknowledgment page can either be a list or a more fluid paragraph. It would be fine to write, ""I would like to thank Professor Henderson, Dr. Matthews, etc."" until you've worked your way through the list.
It would also be perfectly acceptable to address each person individually and more personally: ""I would like to thank Professor Henderson for her expert advice and encouragement throughout this difficult project, as well as Dr. Matthews for his brilliance in the lab.""
Some people feel uncomfortable emphasizing certain people's help over other people's help, in which case the list form in alphabetical order is a perfectly acceptable method of writing an Acknowledgment.;
, In general, the most important person to thank in the acknowledgment is your thesis advisor or major professor overseeing your project, followed by any members of the thesis committee and other supervising academics directly involved with your project.


In general, it's helpful to think in groups, even going to far as to format all the thank-yous of a particular group in a single sentence: ""I would like to thank Dr. Stevens, Dr. Smith, and Professors Clemons for their extraordinary support in this thesis process.""

, This might include lab assistants, or anyone who helped you with coursework or contributed to the project itself in any way. Other classmates who you feel like contributed to the project directly would also be appropriate to thank in this category.

, If your project received any financial support from a foundation or research group, such as a grant, a fellowship, or a scholarship, it would be appropriate to thank the foundation or organization by name and list any personal contacts you might've had with the group.


If your scholarship at the University was supported by any fellowships or scholarships, it would also be appropriate to name them in this section: ""This project would have been impossible without the support of the Katherine G. Katherine Foundation, the Reese's Peanut Butter scholarship, and the Guggenheim Group.""

, Many people like to thank their parents personally, as well as any friends, partners, or other acquaintances who contributed to your emotional well-being throughout the completion of the project at hand. It's probably not necessary to thank your grade-school basketball team, unless the experience contributed to your degree in some specific way.


Remember that your friendships and romances may change over the years, so it might be best to keep particularly mushy romances and declarations of love out of your acknowledgment page, so you won't have to see it later if it doesn't work out.
It's generally best to avoid overtly personal anecdotes and inside jokes in an academic acknowledgements page. If you want to reference other students' constant joking around in the lab, say, it would be better to say, ""Thanks to Joe and Katherine for their friendship in the lab"" than ""Thanks to Joe and Katherine for dunking my slides in Jell-O when I was hungover.""

Keep it to no more than a minute or two at most.,
Prioritize thanking people who are present.,
Use a short anecdote to thank an important party.,
Let sincerity trump humor.",How to Write Acknowledgements2," If you're up on stage because you've won some kind of award, or otherwise have the attention of a room full of people, you'll want to make sure you thank the necessary parties involved in your success. But also try to remember that you've got a rapt audience who doesn't necessarily want to hear you read an alphabetical list of names they don't recognize. Keep it brief and be humble.

, In a thank-you speech, there might be many people who played integral roles in your success who are there, and some who aren't. If you're pressed for time, make sure you thank the people who are sitting there. Thanking them will feel more significant and emotional.

, If you want to tell a story somehow related to the success you're being recognized for, it can be a great idea. Don't come up with a long-winded story to tell for everybody you're thanking, though. Pick one judiciously and consider telling one that involves more than one person present, so it will be a meaningful and efficient use of your stage time.

, It can be tempting to want to liven things up with attempts at crude humor or by poking fun at other people present. If you're a talented comedian, it might be possible, but it's a much safer bet to use your stage time to be sincere and brief. Your humble thanks will be more entertaining than ironic jokes.


Michael Jordan's Hall of Fame induction speech was widely criticized for being tone deaf and spiteful, talking down to many former opponents and somewhat tarnishing his great legacy. Don't fall in the same trap.

Get creative with a literary acknowledgment page.,
Shout-out your friends when your album drops.,
Write personal notes to ask for permission about public acknowledgment.,
Always double-check your list, proof-read, and check your spelling and pronunciation.",How to Write Acknowledgements3," If you publish a book of poetry, short stories, or a novel, it's important to give any original periodicals or other publications credit for first breaking your work into the public. Typically, you'll find the book's individual pieces listed according to the individual magazines they first appeared in, in alphabetical order. More personal thanks are generally included after the formal addressing of other publications.


Like an academic publication, it's also important to remember to address any financial support you received during the publication of your book. If you received any artist residencies, grants, or fellowships while working on your book, you need to list them in the acknowledgments.
Use your writing skills to approach the acknowledgment creatively. Authors like Lemony Snicket, Neil Gaiman, J.D. Salinger, and others have used the form for witty and usually-self deprecating anecdotes about the friends and cohorts they choose to thank.

, Music acknowledgment pages are some of the most fun to write, if your band is still producing physical copies of your music. The stakes are low and the tone can be irreverent. Use the page to thank:


Friends and family
Other bands who helped you along the way, lending gear or instruments
Recording engineers and label folk
Musical inspirations

, It could be an awkward situation for someone to be thanked in public for something, especially in a book or other publication, so it's a good idea to write them an individual thank-you note of a more personal nature. By doing this, you can feel free to make as long as you want, before publishing or reading the more truncated public version aloud.In the letter, explain your desire to thank them and explain the publication or event at which you'd like to thank them. Express your gratitude for their assistance and encourage them to get in touch to approve your acknowledgment. More often than not, they'll be flattered.

, It would be a weird thing to misspell the name of a supposedly integral person in your success, or mispronounce the name of the foundation that offered you assistance. This is an important piece of writing, so give it just as much time for revision and proofreading as any other piece.

An extra tip to those who intend to write a visual book of, for example: tutorials: Make sure that a drawing is not only the result that you wish is drawn on the paper, but also what most people do wrong when drawing ...... (whatever the subject).,
After a short bit of theory, you first draw what most people (tend to)draw, after that how you start making it look real, and after a few of those drawings: what/how you should draw.

",How to Write a Good Book on Any Subject," You need to get the idea, or else you won't have a book at all. So when you've got the idea, look at it and think, ""Could that make the book I have been dreaming about?"". Look at it very closely so that you can get more ideas about the book. Turn it around, see what it's like at the back and the front and see the blurb and the pictures if any are in the book.

, You also need to write down your goal for it and a few things about what you want it to do. How long do you want it to be? How long is each chapter? What names for characters will you be using? Who will be reading it? Will you have chapters? What genre is it? Will it be told from a character's point of view, or from the view of the author? There are lots of things that factor into your final story.

, Get out a pen and some paper, or type on the computer. Writing the first chapter is very important. Write it carefully, as it could be the most important piece of the book; people often find a new idea around the second chapter. You should put this down in another document named 'ideas'. Try to think of ideas throughout your day. Make sure that you write.

, Keep writing but keep record of how many pages you've got in a chapter. The usual fantasy story would have about seven computerised pages a chapter and 250 pages in the book, with roughly 5/6/7 chapters. That should stretch your story out nicely.

, What do you think. Whatever you do, don't compare it to professional authors books, because those authors have a lot of experience. If you show friends or family, they'll probably tell you it's great. A good idea is to email your story to a friend and say that an author named Teddy Fitzgerald, who lives in Bulgaria, wrote it. It's just so mad it just might work...

, It's optional, but most people find that it helps. He'll give you tips, help you, and look for a publisher. And you'll both share an interest : your books.

, It has to have some significance in your book. Scary sounding names are good. (Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone? Wow. A global warming book named 'No More Coats' sounds good!

, This isn't compulsory as publishers can sort this out with a pro, but it would give an idea of how you think it should look.

For example: You want to explain how to draw paws of, say, a tiger.

Keep it short.,
Say something true about yourself.,
Make it funny, weird or otherwise intriguing.,
Consider revealing your dark side.,
Check other people's blurbs.",How to Write a Blurb1," Your forum blurb is a quick way to introduce yourself to the group. Blurbs always have an air of mystery and intrigue, since they're just a few words long and leave a lot to the imagination. Make it no more than a sentence long, two at the most. Here are a few examples:


James Franco: Writer. Actor. Director.
I'm Crystal, maker of all things sparkly.
Hi! I'm Zombie666, and I'm ready to fight!
Oshamaru is here to stay . . . get used to it.;
, You have just a few words in which to show off what makes you you. That means you only have room to share the most important things about yourself. Stick to the most interesting or relevant bit of information you can share.

, The tone of your blurb, however short, is going to make people like you or think you're weird.

, You have control over this since you're on an anonymous forum and you get to write whatever you want. Use your anonymity to your advantage and be the person you always wanted to be in real life, but can't.

, Get inspiration from others who participate in your forum to see what blurb style appeals to you.

"
Provide the most pertinent information.,
Consider mentioning your experience, honors and awards.,
Strike the right tone.,
Decide to write it in first person or third.,
Keep it short and sweet.,
Include a picture.",How to Write a Blurb2," It might be hard to choose from among your most interesting qualities, but sticking to the most intriguing information is crucial when it comes to personal blurbs. You only have room to write a few lines that will grab people's attention and make them want to know more.


The information you provide should be relevant to the venue on which you're publishing the blurb. If you're using your blurb to promote yourself as an artist or sell a service you're providing, for example, you'll need to clearly state what it is you're offering. Introduce yourself as a journalist, guitarist, freelance writer, photographer, etc.
You could also go the route of offering information about you as a person that you want the world to know. If you're creating a blurb for a blog, for example, the point is to help people get to know you better. Talk about your most creative endeavors and fascinating hobbies.

, If you're using your blurb for professional purposes, like on your professional website or networking page, include a few details that will let people know you're someone with a lot to offer. Add a line about prestigious awards you've received, high level experience you have in the field, or other ways you've been honored. Just remember that mentioning honors and awards could be perceived as bragging if you're using the blurb in a more informal setting., Your blurb is meant to tell the world everything they should know about you in about ten seconds. That doesn't give you much time to reveal the depths of your personality, but you can still choose words that reveal a little about what kind of attitude you have. Again, the tone of your blurb should match the space where it's going to be published.


Use humor wherever possible. Funny blurbs are sure to capture people's attention; if you can find a way to entertain people, they'll want to know more, and that's the point!
Professional blurbs should be more reserved in tone, but you can still show some personality. Add a dry joke at the end or include one personal fact about a hobby or pastime that doesn't fall into the professional realm.
Tell people what they'll gain from getting to know you better. This is the object of any blurb; you've got to intrigue people so they have the desire to keep reading your posts, listening to your music, following your Twitter feed, and so on.

, Personal blurbs can be written in first person, with ""I"" statements, to create an intimate feel. Alternatively, writing your blurb in the third person will make it seem more professional. Choose the approach that works best for you and the purpose of your blurb.

, If your blurb is more than a few sentences long, people will get bored and start skimming. A blurb should be no longer than two short paragraphs, and even that can be a stretch. Limiting yourself to a few hundred words will help you make sure you're including only the most important and interesting facts.


Read over your blurb after you write it, and try to take an objective point of view. What information can you eliminate to make it punchier?
Ask a friend to take a look at your blurb, and have him or her give you honest feedback. Information that seemed crucial to you may read as bland to someone else.

, If you have the option to include a picture next to your blurb, do it. Your blurb will resonate more with people if they can see a picture of the person who wrote it. Choose a picture that matches the mood of your blurb, whether it's quirky, wholesome, hilarious or polished.

Have a good understanding of the source material.,
Have an aura of expertise.,
Summarize the plot without giving it away.,
Use bright, compelling language.,
Always use third person, not first.,
Write for the correct audience.",How to Write a Blurb3," Don't try to write a blurb promoting your friend's book or film without having read or watched it a couple of times first. Not only will your blurb sound off-base, it won't actually help your friend get more readers or viewers.


Pay close attention to what you experience. Make your mind engage with you're reading or seeing.
Write down you how you felt about the book or film. Simple words or descriptions are a fine start. Note how the piece made you feel, what its unique qualities are, and other details that made it stand out to you.
It's a good idea to get familiar with the person's past work as well. That way you'll be able to compare the most recent work to the person's other books or films.
Read reviews and blurbs of the author or filmmaker's past work as well, for research purposes.

, You were probably asked to blurb a book or film because you have some standing in the field. Make good on your reputation by doing some selective background research into other work in the same genre as your friend's book or film. You should sound like you know what you're talking about.Look for trends in the author or filmmaker's work. Do they use the same actors? The same themes? Take note of patterns that you could mention in your blurb.
Consider whether you can make intelligent comparisons to other works in the genre.

, The blurb may briefly detail what the film or book is about, and be clear and subtle. Focus on the most entertaining or fascinating aspects of the work; remember, as the blurber, your job is to help sell it.


Consider mentioning the main characters. Don't get overly descriptive and include every characteristic and backstory, and likewise, don't write about every single character. Stick to the main ones that the action in the film or book is focused around.
Assume that the reader is ignorant about the facts. If the film or book involves a historical figure or a geographical location or another piece of art, include descriptor words to clarify. This will make your blurb seem more clear and informed.
Point out the themes. Use a sentence or two to address the ideas that the film or book presents, whether it's the power of friendship, the complications of family, or the damages of war.

, Since the purpose of a blurb is to promote this particular film or book, write passionately about it. The question your reader will have is ""Why should I see it or read it?"" Give them a convincing reason to do so.


Don't be too wordy. Your reader is looking for a quick few sentences that stick to the point, so don't let your writing get bogged down by complicated plot twists or lengthy descriptions. Additionally, don't get carried away with adjectives; you don't want your blurb to sound flowery and overenthusiastic.
Stay away from cliches. Statements like ""the greatest story ever told"" or ""the best movie you'll ever see"" are too tired and overused to be effective. Write a thoughtful description of your own experience of the text without resorting to other people's wording., Writing in the first person makes a blurb seem too informal. Writing in the third person maintains a professional, learned distance, which is what you want when you're writing a blurb for someone else's work.

, Recognize that writing a blurb about a children's picture book involves a different kind of communication than writing one about a steamy romance novel. Adjust your language accordingly.

,How to Write a Blurb4,
"
Tackle a hot-button civic or social issue.,
Shed light on a little-known subculture.,
Show the intimate side of a famous person.,
Document an important event as it happens.,
Expose the dirty secrets of those in power.,
Dig up new information on historical events.,
Show the world something it hasn’t seen before.",How to Write a Documentary1," Some documentaries try to persuade their audience to feel a certain way about a contemporary issue in society by presenting real information that proves the maker's point. This classic approach to writing a documentary gives you the benefit of virtually guaranteed relevance, since it's about something that people probably already have strong opinions about. In addition, the controversy that can be generated from this type of documentary can give you the bonus of added publicity.


As an example of this type of documentary, check out one of Michael Moore's early documentaries, Roger & Me. In this documentary, Moore paints a tragic picture of corporate greed and the devastating effects that the actions of giant companies can have on local communities by investigating the closure of a GM plant in Flint, Michigan that resulted in the loss of about 30,000 jobs.Regardless of your opinion of the now-controversial filmmaker, it's impossible to deny that the film takes a serious look at the state of modern American capitalism.;
, Some documentaries aim to cast light on a small or relatively unknown group of people whose community is quirky, bizarre, gripping, or otherwise fascinating. The subcultures that are the subjects of these documentaries may be made up of people with a common hobby, similar life circumstances, a common background, or some other connection. There's virtually no limit to the types of stories you can tell with these sorts of documentaries — some are funny, some are sad, some are exciting, and some are a mixture of all three.


As an example of this type of documentary, check out The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters. This movie dives into the bizarre world of professional video game players by following the story of a newcomer who hopes to unseat the current champion.This documentary is able to create a compelling story out of the actions of a small group of people who, to most, don't matter at all — quite a feat of documentary film making.

, Some documentaries are about the lives of famous or influential people who shaped the world. These documentaries often try to expose the ""behind the scenes"" trials and tribulations of someone who has a larger-than life reputation in the public consciousness. The best of these sorts of documentaries use extensive research and interviews with experts or people close to the subject of the documentary to show the audience a side of this person that they're not already familiar with.


One great example of this sort of biographical documentary is the film Tupac Resurrection. Using home movies and interviews with dozens of people who knew the rap icon (including some with the rapper himself), this documentary humanizes the figure who has since become almost legendary, showing him as a sensitive, intelligent, often conflicted individual., Some documentaries give the audience an insider's view into an important event with audacious on-the-ground footage and interviews with the people directly involved in the event. Sometimes, for this type of documentary, the filmmakers ""embed"" themselves with the people participating in an event. For instance, for a documentary about a war, the filmmakers may travel with a platoon of soldiers, filming day-to-day life on the front and documenting dangerous confrontations with the enemy as they happen.


Note, however, that these types of documentaries don’t necessarily need to be about grim, serious events. For instance, concert documentaries like Stop Making Sense simply document a band performing live on stage (in this case, The Talking Heads). If well-made, these types of documentaries can be just as captivating.

, Some documentaries aim to take on the status quo by exposing the corruption, hypocrisy, and evil actions of powerful people or organizations. These muckraking documentaries generate outrage by showing how the stated goals of those in power differ from the actual outcomes of their behavior. Often, these documentaries will use the stories of individual people negatively effected by the actions of those in power to give a face to the harm caused by the actions of the powerful person or organization. This type of documentary can be especially difficult to make because powerful people will naturally use their resources to resist being painted as greedy, stupid, or evil. However, with determination, lots of research, and daring reporting, it's possible to make a documentary that sparks righteous anger in the audience.


As an example of this type of documentary, see Hot Coffee. This documentary investigates the infamous story of the woman who sued McDonald's after spilling hot coffee on herself and several other similar stories to show how the media, wealthy corporate interests, and the politicians they bankroll work together to erode the power that ordinary citizens have in the civil justice system.

, Some documentaries tackle people, places, and events from history, rather than recent or present ones. Because the subjects of these documentaries are often already gone, these types of films rely more heavily on research and interviews with experts (like professors, authors, and so on) than other documentaries. However, it's still possible to tell a compelling story about the past that's relevant to the present by illustrating the link between the two to the audience.


One recent documentary that does this well is the 2012 film The Act of Killing. This documentary makes powerful statements about the human capability to commit evil by covering the filmmaker's attempts to get the perpetrators of an Indonesian genocide to reenact the mass-killings they participated in., Some documentaries simply try to capture something exceptionally unique. This can be an event that most people aren't aware of, a person who isn't famous but still has a fascinating life story, or an interesting piece of history that's been lost to time. The best of these types of documentaries make statements use their unique subjects to illustrate larger points about the way the world works or the way people are are.


One great example of this sort of documentary is Werner Herzog's Grizzly Man. By telling the story of Timothy Treadwell, a man who voluntarily lived in the wilderness of Alaska with grizzly bears and was eventually killed by the bears, Herzog paints a picture of one man's odd relationship with nature that resonates even with audiences that would never consider doing something similar.

"
Use research to build your documentary’s foundation.,
Make your point with a lean, logical progression of information.,
Storyboard the progression of your movie.,
Write an organized schedule.,
Scrip any narration that will be used for the movie.,
Script any re-enactments.,
Be a merciless editor.",How to Write a Documentary2," The first step to writing your documentary is to educate yourself about your subject as much as you can. Use books, online writings, and especially primary sources (which have the benefit of providing information directly from the people involved in the subject of your documentary) to become an expert on the people, places, and things your documentary is about. Knowing all about your subject makes it much easier to find a compelling ""angle"" for your documentary to take. In addition, having a good knowledge of your reference material will allow you to know what information you want to present in your documentary (and the sources you should attribute it to).


If you're unsure of where to start, try going to a local university and contacting a professor who's an expert in the subject of your documentary. Though they may not know everything you want to find out about your subject, they will usually be able to tell you where to look to find this information.

, In their own way, documentaries tell stories with characters, settings, and plots, just like narrative films. Your documentary should have a beginning, middle, and end that work together to convey some sort of logical message or ""point"" to the audience. In short, your audience should tell a ""story"" as directly and efficiently as possible. This requires deciding what order to present the information in your documentary to the audience.


For example, if you're making a documentary about the drug trade between the U.S. and Mexico, you might want to start by establishing a background for your documentary — discussing the creation of the U.S.'s War on Drugs policy, for instance, or showing the path a package of cocaine takes from South America through Central America and Mexico to the United States. You probably wouldn't want to start with an interview with a stuffy professor — just like a normal movie, a documentary should aim to hook the viewer off the bat.

, Though documentaries don't generally have scripts, they should be well-planned. Having a basic storyboard for the story you want to tell with your documentary can help you plan and schedule your shooting and give you a sense of purpose and direction. A storyboard can also help you visualize the sorts of shots you'll want to use for your documentary. Like an ordinary movie, documentaries can use visual storytelling techniques to make their point to the audience.


While a storyboard can be a great tool for a documentary filmmaker, it's worth noting that, for some documentaries, some of your footage may come from events that spontaneously occur in front of you. Be open to the possibility of shooting footage without a plan — surprise moments that are captured on camera can make a documentary.

, Like ordinary films, most documentaries need a schedule to ensure that shooting stays on-track and that all of the goals the filmmakers are aiming to achieve are met. Your schedule should incorporate any traveling you'll need to do to complete your filming as well as an outline of any important events you'll need to be present at.


Your schedule should also definitely include a timeline for any interviews you hope to conduct. You'll need to contact the people you want to interview as early as possible to have the best chance of getting their time, so plan the interviews out well in advance of when you plan to begin shooting.

, One part of a documentary that is scripted is any sort of narration in the movie. Voice-over narrators need a script that clearly and efficiently explains the information that the documentary can't convey visually. Even textual narration without a voice-over needs to scripted in advance so that your editor or animator will know what to include in the text.

, Some documentaries, especially those about historical figures or events, will include re-enactment segments featuring actors. If these re-enactments include any dialog, the actors will need scripts in advance so that they can practice their line delivery. If there isn't any dialog in your re-enactments, your actors will still need stage directions, which you'll need to write as well.

, Don't be afraid to cut anything that doesn't help your documentary prove its point as effectively as possible. If your audience is bored by your film, it will be less receptive to the message you're trying to convey and may ""tune out"". Keep your documentary as short, snappy, and to-the-point as possible. Anything you edit out can be included in your film's ""deleted scenes"" on the DVD release, so be picky about what to include and what not to include!


Note that documentaries don't necessarily have to be feature-length. With the internet, documentaries that are too short for a theatrical run can still be offered as streaming or downloadable video, ensuring your film still reaches an audience.

"
"
Tell a story with your documentary.,
Aim to persuade the audience.,
Strike an emotional chord.,
Sell your audience on the subject matter.",How to Write a Documentary3," As noted above, the best documentaries tell stories that are just as compelling as those you might find in an ordinary movie. This storytelling approach can be used to great effect regardless of the subject of your documentary.The way you write, shoot, and edit your film will affect the way your audience sees your ""characters"" and reacts to your ""plot"". Use your movie's narrative to prove your point to your audience. Try asking yourself the following questions as you write and plan your documentary to ensure your film tells the story you want to tell:


""How do I want my audience to feel about the people and events I'm portraying?""
""What sort of message am I trying to convey with each scene?""
""What's the best way to order my scenes to get my desired message across?""
""How can I use the sounds and visuals of my movie to make my point?""

, Ideally, your documentary should inspire your audience to act or feel differently than they did before they watched it. Even relatively light-hearted documentaries can benefit from taking this sort of persuasive approach, so never lose sight of the sort of reaction you're trying to create in your audience.


For some documentaries, like those that tackle controversial social issues, the sort of persuasion you're trying to go for is usually obvious. For others, it may be a little more subtle. For instance, if we're writing a documentary about a strange subculture of people who like to get together and pretend to be unicorns, we might set the goal for ourselves of convincing the audience that even though the hobby these people share is very strange, it still gives them a valuable sense of community that they may not find elsewhere.

, When you get the chance, go for the audience's heart! Proving your point with logic is, of course, highly desirable. However, not every member of the audience will be receptive to pure, unemotional logic. Even the members of your audience who do agree with your film's logic can be further persuaded if they get a serious emotional reaction from the film. Look for opportunities to show the tragedy or humor in the events you're portraying. A truly great documentary will engage the audience's heart as well as its mind.


For instance, in the example from earlier where we're making a documentary about the U.S.-Mexico drug trade, we may want to include the heartbreaking story of someone who has lost family members to drug-related violence along the border. This gives a human face to the point we're trying to make by showing how a real person's life has been affected by the subject of our documentary.

, Remember, your subject matter is important, even if, in the grand scheme of things, it's actually not! You're making a film about something that has excited, intrigued, or captivated you, so make it your goal for your film to have the same effect on the audience as the subject matter has on you.


For instance, in The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters, the central conflict between the newcomer to the world of competitive video gaming and the reigning champion is something that seriously matters only to a tiny, insignificant group of people. However, because the filmmakers portray it as a quirky underdog tale, it's actually surprisingly exciting to watch. The audience gets wrapped up in the competition even though, in the end, the only thing at stake is bragging rights in a ragtag group of video game aficionados.

Build academic and language skills.,
Build time management skills.,
Learn to cope with stress.",How to Write a Dissertation1," Before you can start writing a dissertation, you will need to have developed your skills to a point where you will be able to write a dissertation. This high level of academic work requires exquisitely honed language skills, as well as the ability to analyze and process information at a level appropriate for original research. Make sure that your skills are up to the task before beginning, otherwise you may not be able to complete the dissertation and you will certainly cause yourself a great deal of stress.


Many programs require that you are not only very capable of speaking your own language but another or several others as well. This can span from other modern spoken languages (like French, German, or Mandarin) to dead spoken languages (such as Latin or Greek) to non-spoken languages (such as programming languages).
You will need to be excellent at tracking down information, processing it, understanding where information is missing, and finding solutions to the problems that those holes present. This is often much more difficult than it sounds.
You will also need to have developed writing skills which will be conducive to producing a dissertation. These documents are often as long as books, being anywhere between 30,000-100,000 words. It is difficult to write something so long, in-depth, and descriptive.;
, Writing such a complex document while often still taking classes, working as a teacher’s or lab assistant or teaching undergraduate classes can be challenging at best. There is a reason that there are so many jokes about how grad students never get to sleep. You should relax and sleep every now and again, because the stress is not good for you or your work, but in order to fit everything in you’ll need to be very good at knowing how to balance all of these activities.


Try to set aside time when it is impossible or incredibly difficult to work in order to relax. For example, listen to audiobooks or podcasts while you drive to school. You can catch up on your favorite websites using your phone, laptop, or tablet while you eat lunch and dinner. Exercise while waiting for search or test results (you’d be surprised how much energy you’ll get from doing a few squats!).
Sleep on a regular schedule. This will be incredibly challenging at times, but sleeping on a regular schedule (even if it’s a little less sleep than you might normally get) will make you feel more energized and focused than sleeping longer hours irregularly.
Use browser add-ons like StayFocused. You’ll be thankful later.

, If you can’t cope well with stress, you will have a very difficult time with graduate school in general and an even harder time with writing a dissertation. Learn to manage your stress and release it in a healthy and effective manner before starting on a dissertation.


Good ways for grad students to ease stress are to exercise, listen to music, or watch a funny video. All of these are easily fit into complex schedules. What you’ll want to avoid as a grad student, however, are stress-reducing activities like watching TV (which will suck up large blocks of time and stress you out more) or eating (which will likely make you gain a great deal of weight).

Understand the purpose of a dissertation.,
Consider if this is right for you.,
Decide your topic.,
Get funding.,
Create a space where you can work.",How to Write a Dissertation2," When you begin your dissertation, it is important to understand the purpose it is meant to serve. In understanding the larger goal of the exercise, you can more carefully craft your paper to demonstrate that you have achieved said goal and are deserving of those coveted post or pre-name letters.


A dissertation will prove your ability to produce original research with original, impactful ideas. One of the main things you will be expected to do after getting your advanced degree is furthering your field by producing new ideas which solve the problems previously present in the discipline. You will need to prove that you are capable of making these significant contributions and your dissertation will be your first major step.
A dissertation will demonstrate your knowledge of research design. You will need to show that you can perform research in a way that is acceptable for your discipline. This means coming up with tests that properly correspond with your hypothesis, accounting for variables, and accurate methods of collecting data, among other things.

, A life of serious academic work is not for everybody. While for some people it will bring great joy, others will feel unfilled. Because of the amount of work involved and the stress that comes with it, you will want to be sure that this is really what you want for your life.


People are often goaded into pursuing higher degrees by their parents, who generally just want what they feel is best for their child. However, this may not be what’s best. If your parents have pushed you into this, you will need to seriously consider if your parent’s wishes should guide your life decisions. It is your choice, in the end. Not theirs.
There is no shame in choosing not to pursue this degree. As already discussed, not everyone is suited to the life it will bring. It also should not be considered a waste of time or money, as the additional training is often not only useful but still looks good to many employers.

, Before you begin, you will need to decide on a topic that is right for you. Remember, you will be working on this for a very long time. It needs to be something that you find interesting or you will have a very unpleasant time. Your thesis for the topic must also be a significant contribution to the scholarship, so try to avoid topics that are well researched already. It also needs to be something that you feel you have enough ability to prove and support.


For example, you will not be able to write a historical dissertation on aliens building the pyramids. Or at least, not one that you’ll get past your committee. A dissertation on guano curing cancer is going to end similarly. Try to choose something that won’t lead your university to disown you.

, Before you begin, try to find sources of funding. You will need to be able to support yourself (just in terms of living conditions), because working while writing a dissertation is at the very least extremely challenging, if not outright barred by your program. You may also need funds in order to pursue research, either for traveling to collect or view materials, for purchasing rare or expensive texts, or to pay for materials necessary to conduct experiments.


There are a number of ways to get this funding. Asking your department for advice will probably be best, since funding is often specific to discipline. Generally, seek grants rather than loans. Fellowships from your university are also extremely helpful. Many schools will have scholarships and grants specifically set aside for those beginning work on their dissertation.

, You will need to be able to focus while writing your dissertation. This means having a space where you can have quiet and will not be constantly bombarded by distractions. You will need to also have easy access to everything that you need for writing: books, a computer, internet connection, power sources, etc. Be sure that you've secured this before beginning work.

Understand your adviser.,
Prepare for your committee.,
Think about your colleagues.,
Consider general readers.",How to Write a Dissertation3," Your adviser will be your guide along this perilous journey, the Virgil to your Dante. Be sure that you get along with and understand your adviser, preferably before starting work. Being unable to communicate complex ideas with this person will make it very difficult to proceed. You should both have a thorough understanding of what you’re trying to do and what your advisor expects from you.

, Understand the people who will be on your committee. Know what their areas of expertise are, as well as areas where their knowledge is lacking. This will influence how you write your content. You will also want to know what types of research and evidence they value vs. which they hate. If there are particular methods that they do not approve of but that you intend to use, you will need to be prepared to defend yourself and your choices.

, Since this work is intended as your first foray into the academic world, you will need to think of your future colleagues as you write it. Is the topic you have chosen something which is largely disapproved of in your discipline? This will make it hard to integrate into the community once you graduate and you will need your peers to think well of you if you want to get a job.

, Dissertations, since they are legitimate research, will hopefully be used by future scholars in their own research and learning process. With this in mind, try to write your dissertation in a way that will be as accessible and understandable as possible.

"
Plan your structure.,
Get feedback.,
Minimize unnecessary depth and breadth.,
Set aside specific time for writing.,
Pay attention to voice and tense.,
Avoid certain types of language.,
Cite, cite, cite.",How to Write a Dissertation4," Plan the structure of your dissertation according to the standards of your discipline. You will definitely want to outline your paper before beginning. The more detailed it is, the easier it will be for you later on. This outline will be an invaluable road-map and should not be ignored or discounted.


Generally, it will follow the same basic form as shorter research papers, beginning with an introduction to the topic, giving some background, presenting research by previous scholars, presenting your own evidence, combating evidence which does not fit or contradicts you, and then wrapping up. There will usually be a discussion of your methods, but where that goes and to what extent it is integrated into other sections will depend heavily on your discipline.

, Before beginning too much writing, you will want to get feedback from your peers and advisers. Show them the structure you have planned and give them an overview of your research and evidence. Their feedback will allow you to see where you have neglected information or made too many logical leaps. They will help you to ensure that your evidence is presented in the best way and that your conclusions make sense.

, Before getting too deep into your dissertation, analyze your topic and thesis to see if there are any ways in which you can limit the scope of your paper. Is there information or discussions which are unnecessary to proving your thesis? Remove anything from your research that does not serve a purpose, as such extras can result in having to write pages upon pages of unnecessary text. Keep it reasonable and you’ll save yourself a lot of time and stress.


This is another area where you can make use of feedback, especially from your adviser.
To consider the problem yourself, run down a list of your evidence and every point in your outline. If it doesn't directly tie back to your thesis, or if another section or point proves the same thing, consider cutting it.

, Developing a set schedule will go a long way towards helping you get your dissertation done. Set aside time each day for writing and do not use that time for anything else. This will get you in the habit of focusing and will also deal with motivation issues.


Be sure to choose a time of day that is good for you. If you are too tired to write at night, write in the morning. If your brain takes half the day to boot up properly, write in the evening. When you write will entirely depend upon what is best for you.

, Be sure to use the correct voice and tense for papers in your discipline while working on your dissertation. It is incredibly difficult and time consuming to go back through your text and edit for tense and voice, so try to get it right the first time through. Ask your adviser what is the correct method and then make sure you pay attention to those details while writing. Also be sure not to switch voice in the text, unless there is a very good reason.

, Certain types of language do not serve you in high level academic work like this. Avoid these types of language from the start and you will save yourself some editing later on, since your adviser will undoubtedly tell you to change or remove it.


Colloquial language, slang, overly informal language and regionalized language are all extremely poor choices for inclusion in a dissertation. Do not include them under any circumstance.
The use of contractions are also frowned on in high level works. This tends to make language sound regionalized and informal, as discussed above. However, it also makes it very easy to slip in grammatical errors, so it is best to avoid them just in general.
Indecisive or overly-open language is also very bad for a dissertation. You do not want to say that your thesis is “probably” right or that this evidence is “maybe” significant. Stand by your assertions, even if they may not be as solid as you’d like. You can always discuss problems with the theory later on.

, Seriously, not citing can get you accused of plagiarism. That’s a whole headache you want to avoid, so cite absolutely all of the information you present that is not yours. Citing will also serve to make your work seem more credible, since it proves that other scholars have come to similar conclusions.


If you want to emphasize that an idea is coming from you, rather than constantly stating that A said this or B said that, you can phrase your sentence like this, “String cheese is delicious and fun because it cheese and you can play with it. Further evidence of this can be seen in the research of Dr.’s A and B, in their earlier paper on the topic.” The idea is to present your view and evidence first and follow it with the research of others. This makes it seem like they support you, rather than you supporting them.
Particularly bold claims or ideas which go against the common knowledge will especially need to be cited. These stand-out statements are usually the first for which others will look for evidence. Not citing will make you look incapable or incompetent.
If there is any doubt about whether you should cite something, just cite it. The answer is probably yes.

"
"
Do a first read-through.,
Do a second read-through.,
Practice presentation.",How to Write a Dissertation5," Once you have completed your work, do a read-though. On this first read-through you will want to look for spelling and grammar mistakes. These will be distracting and stop the flow of thought as you read through to analyze the content, so deal with these and only these first so that you can focus on the content of the text later.


Make a list of words you know you have a tendency to misspell or misuse. Most people have at least a few. When you are done writing, you can do a search through the document to find the incorrect versions and correct them.
Remember that some words may technically be spelled correctly but be incorrect for the place in which you've used them. Their, there, and they’re are the most common examples. Even if you know the spelling and grammar rules, it’s easy to make mistakes like this, especially if you’re tired. Pay attention.

, Once you've completed your first read-through, do at least one more to check the content. Be sure that the transitions between paragraphs make sense, that your arguments are logical and easy to follow, that everything ties back to your thesis, that you don’t randomly start rambling, and other content considerations.

, Around the time of completion is when you will want to begin practicing your presentation skills. A presentation before your committee is usually required, and audiences are often allowed. Most people do not have experience speaking in front of groups and it can be extremely nerve-racking, especially considering the context. Practicing how you will present your information, first in front of a mirror and then in front of friends and family, preferably well in advance of your presentation date.

If your writing idol is Stephen King, for example, you may decide to read his earlier novels, such as Carrie, The Shining, or The Dark Tower series. You may then read his non-fiction, such as On Writing, which is a good guide for aspiring writers on the craft of writing. You may then finish your reading with a selection from King’s latest works, such as 2009’s Under the Dome.;
, Your local bookstore may already do this for you, as your favorite author may sit comfortably in the thriller/horror section or the literary fiction section. Your favorite author may create works that seem to defy genres and categorizations, or she may write books that do something unique within a certain genre. Noting this may help you pinpoint why you enjoy her writing and find it worth studying.


For example, the writer Joyce Carol Oates has written over forty novels and many short story collections, as well as writing under various pen names. Though her work may fit within the genre of literary fiction, some of her short stories might fit within the horror genre or the thriller genre. Think about how your favorite author fits within her genre and the ways in which she may not always work within a genre or adhere to the rules of a specific genre.

, Often, as readers, we are drawn to a certain writer for the way they develop their characters and use language to create an engaging character voice.This can apply to non fiction writing as well as fiction writing, as the writer may be the narrator of the book or she may use the third person to tell a story in a more distant or removed way.


Choose several of your favorite passages from your favorite author’s works and focus on how she uses language and description to develop a character and create an engaging character voice. Maybe she uses an internal monologue to shape the character’s point of view, such as the young girl narrator in Joyce Carol Oates’ short story “Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?”Or maybe your favorite author uses the third person voice to develop several characters in a scene or a story, such as the third person voice in Stephen King’s novel Christine.
Note if your favorite writer uses dialogue in the scene to develop the character and long passages of description, or short passages of description. Some writers may never describe what a character is wearing or their physical appearance, but they will still be able to create an engaging character through dialogue and action.

, If your favorite author writes fiction, she is likely going to use certain elements of plot in your writing. Non-fiction can also be structured around a plot to keep the reader engaged. Analyzing the way your favorite author handles plot can help you get a better sense of how to structure your writing, especially if you are writing a longer piece of writing, like a novel or book. Take one of the writer’s longer works and break down the plot based on Freytag’s Pyramid.Using Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird as an example:Exposition: The novel opens in Maycomb, a small sleepy town in Alabama. We are introduced to the Finches, who have lived in Maycomb for generations in the close knit community. But the town is also influenced by the racism of 1930s America, and the unnamed narrator indicates that a conflict may break out between the anti-racist Atticus Finch and his friendly, but racist neighbors.
Inciting incident: The conflict is introduced with an accusation against a black man, Tom Robinson, of raping a white woman. Atticus is asked to represent Robinson and must confront the town’s racism head on.
Rising Action: Atticus’ daughter, Scout, and son, Jem, watch their father wrestle with issues of race and justice during the trial of Robinson. The children also learn about redemption and prejudice among their friends, peers, and neighbors, as the entire town becomes embroiled in the racial tensions of the trial.
Climax: Despite Atticus’ impassioned defense, Robinson is convicted for a crime he did not commit. Scout and Jem are shocked that the town would sentence an innocent man to death due to their racist beliefs.
Falling Action: One man in the town, Bob Ewell, is open about his racist views and disapproval of Atticus. He threatens Atticus and Robinson’s wife, Helen. Scout and Jem are afraid Ewell will do something to hurt their father.
Resolution: Ewell tries to attack Scout and Jem to hurt Atticus. The Finches’ reclusive neighbor Boo Radley rescues the children from Ewell, grabbing Ewell’s knife and killing him.
Denouement: The mysterious Boo Radley finally reveals himself and Scout has a coming of age moment. She sees Boo Radley not as a monster but as a shy recluse.

, Look for a passage from a scene that contains character development and character voice that seems unique to your favorite author. You may choose the climactic scene in a novel or a scene that does something interesting with language and setting that you admire.


If possible, choose a scene that has several elements of story going on, from dialogue to description to action. This will give you more to analyze and use as a model for your writing.

, Use a highlighter or a pencil to underline any unique description, dialogue or language in the passage. Make notes on how each line of dialogue develops the story or how each description pushes the story forward. A good writer will not waste any line space on unnecessary details or description, and will focus on keeping the reader engaged in the story.


You may want to put a mark next to a line you admire or consider an example of great writing. You can also analyze the passage sentence by sentence to really study the passage in greater depth. Note how each word creates a scene or image in your mind and how the writer uses these images to move the story forward.

, Think about which elements in the passage might apply to a story you are writing or a story you are going to write. What can you borrow from your favorite author to then add to your story? Use elements in the passage like dialogue, description, or plot structure in a scene in your writing.


You can also write a completely new passage that uses your chosen passage as a guide. To avoid plagiarizing, use the created passage as a brainstorming piece that may not make it into your final draft. Consider the passage part of an exercise to get a better sense of how your favorite author writes.

, Though it can be useful to study and analyze the writing of your favorite author, ultimately, you will need to develop your own writing style. The one thing you have as a writer that no one else does is your own voice and approach to writing. Often, readers can tell if you are leaning too heavily on your writing influences or your writing idol to tell a story.Use the writing of your favorite author as an example of one approach to writing. Read it, study it, analyze it, and borrow from it, but try to also allow your own writing style to come through on the page.

Novels. The novel is one of the most popular forms of creative writing, and also one of the most challenging. A novel is a large project, with most novels containing at least 50,000 words. Any topic can be the subject of a novel. Certain types of novels are so popular that they belong to their own category, or genre. Examples of genre fiction are romance, mystery, science fiction, and fantasy.
Short stories. A work of fiction under 7,500 words is usually considered a short story. A short story usually has all of the elements of a novel, including a structured plot. However, experimental forms of short stories like flash fiction do away with ordinary narrative conventions and can take almost any form the author chooses.
Blogs. The word blog is a shortened form of the term web log, which can refer to any type of writing that is published regularly on the internet. Blogs can be stories, factual pieces, or diaries.
Poetry. Poetry can take any number of forms, from traditional rhyming couplets to modern free-form verse. Poets typically develop their own unique writing style and write about any topic imaginable, from situations and emotions to current events or social commentary.
Screenplays or stage plays. These are detailed scripts written for a film or a play. This form of writing has very specific rules about structure and formatting, but the subject matter can be anything you like.;
, Inspiration can come from any number of places, and at any time. Some writers keep a small notebook handy to jot down ideas for future stories.Keep your eyes open for compelling stories in the news that could provide a starting point.
Draw on an interesting or unusual event that happened in your own life.
Search the web for “writing prompts” and you'll find lots of ideas to get you going, suggested by other writers.

, A common variety of writing is adaptation, where the author bases the idea for their piece on an existing work. Think about the plot to a book or film you enjoyed that would be interesting to see handled in a different way or with a different type of ending. Use your imagination to approach the topic in an entirely new way, so that your work is uniquely your own.


The popular 1990's teen movie Clueless is a modern adaptation of Jane Austin's classic novel Emma.
The classic Greek myth The Odyssey has been re-imagined in countless ways, including the Coen Brothers' O Brother Where Art Thou? Many authors have adapted its basic story structure of a hero's quest.
Stories about vampires are all loosely adapted from Mary Shelley's Dracula, but many different writers have put their own unique spin on the concept.

, What do you want to say? How do you want your reader to feel when they finish reading your piece? Is there an important social, philosophical, or environmental concept that you would like to convey?Salinger's Catcher in the Rye contains themes of alienation and coming of age.
Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series addresses themes of courage, and the triumph of good over evil.
Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy plays with themes about the absurdity of life, the interconnectedness of all things, and how seemingly minor incidents can have huge consequences.

, Many writers find that it helps to plan their piece before they begin writing. If you are writing a fiction piece, you might want to plan out all your major characters and plot points. If you are writing a non-fiction piece, research the subject carefully and then list the major ideas you want to address.

, Try not to overthink things, or you might have difficulty getting started. Once you know what you want to write, just begin writing.

, You don't have to start writing a piece at the beginning. You can work on any portion of the piece that appeals to you right now. You could also think of how you want to end the article or story, and then think about how to want to get there.

, If writing the complete piece seems daunting, consider writing individual scenes and then piecing them together as you go. The more you write, the more familiar you will become with the methods that work best for you., Avoid excessive introductory passages, and get to the main subject or action of your article or story right away.Kurt Vonnegut grabs the reader's attention at the start of Slaughterhouse-Five quite simply, by saying, “All this happened, more or less.”
Tolstoy summed up the main theme of his novel Anna Karenina in its very first sentence: “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”

, If your reader doesn't care what happens to your characters, they will soon lose interest in the story. Avoid stereotypes at all costs, and try to create multi-dimensional characters that have individual personalities and complex emotions.If you are writing a work of fiction, each of your main characters has something they want, which motivates them to make the choices that drive the plot forward.
If you are writing a non-fiction work about an actual person or event, include specific details about the key players to make them more interesting to your reader.

, A great story can be set anywhere you can imagine, in any time period you like. Sometimes combining unexpected elements will lead to a fresh new take on the subject.


Think of a familiar place you encounter every day, but set the story 100 years in the future – or 1,000.
Set your story in the modern day world, but change one very key element – imagine that dinosaurs never went extinct, electricity was never invented, or aliens have taken over the planet.

, Think about the type of person who will be reading this particular piece, and write just for them. Don't try to please everybody, or your writing will end up feeling watered-down and lifeless.If you are writing something for the young adult market, focus on the things that matter most to teens and don't worry about whether older adults will like it.
If you want to write a particular type of fiction, like westerns or sci-fi, read the most popular works in that genre to understand what its readers expect.
Not everyone will appreciate your sense of humor, and that's okay – be yourself, and let your work speak to those who do.

, If the idea of writing a piece seems daunting, break the work down into smaller, manageable steps. Starting in on a small task is less intimidating, and you will get a boost of confidence every time you complete a small goal., Try to find a specific day or time of day when you are usually free to write, and promise yourself you will sit down and write on a regular schedule. You might plan to write for two hours every day, or to complete a minimum number of words by Saturday afternoon., Just try to get words onto the page, and don't worry if they are good or not. Avoid writer's block by reminding yourself that you can always go back and change things later., Determine how much time you will need to write your piece, to ensure you have allotted enough time to write. Then stick to your schedule and try not to stress over the deadline. , If you feel yourself getting bogged down by details, try to reconnect with your original concept and why you chose to write that piece in the first place.

, Join a local writer's group, or seek out other writers online. For example, NaNoWriMo is an annual event that challenges writers to complete a novel in the month of November."
"
Care about what you write.,
Sleep.,
Ask your friends for advice.,
Find inspiration everywhere.,
Bounce ideas off each other when you’re supposed to be writing down your plot.,
Have music playing in the background.,
Close the door.,
Use the internet.,
Have one mad piece of paper or notebook that is incomprehensible to the outside world.,
Write a list of tips for NaNoWriMo beginners, so they may embrace the sea of knowledge that you lacked and were forced to discover the hard way.",How to Survive National Novel Writing Month," Even if you don’t hit your word count, having 40,000 words that are well written and don’t need another month to edit is much better that getting stuck with 50,000 words that don’t even make sense.


Speed is your friend. Time is your enemy, so type fast. As much as you want to slam the laptop down on the person who seems to write at the speed of light, don’t. Just laugh at the look on their face at the end of the month, when they’re realising just how much editing lies before them.
But don't take yourself too seriously, especially if you're writing for the first time. Fifty thousand words is a lot to write in one month, and it will be easier to do if you're having fun and not editing as you go.;
, Sleep is good, it’s about the only break you get, and prevents you from writing incomprehensible drivel.

, Something you may think is an awesome idea, (for example a half squirrel half leprechaun character) may not seem so awesome to normal people.

, Would your quirky, eye-contact-challenged driving instructor make a good basis for a character in your book?


Quiet writing periods of 30 minutes followed by 40 minutes of doing nothing (i.e. eating and playing solitaire) are actually a good thing. Better than 10 minutes of writing and an hour doing nothing.

, You may not end up with a plot written down, but you’ll get the whole book figured out, down to the size of your character’s shoes.


It's ok to think up the plot as you go, rather than charting the whole course ahead of time. If you take this approach to writing, you should still look ahead a little ways.
As you get more practice, you will learn what approaches work best for you in terms of balancing spontaneity and having fun.

, Although we don’t recommend catchy tunes, as you may abandon your book to have a mad dancing fest. Though this may relieve tension when you feel like punching your computer, stick to movie soundtracks, as they work for scenes a lot better.

, Having anyone else reading over your shoulder or just being curious can dampen your creative process considerably. Tell them you'll talk about it in December. Other people can also be distractions to your writing.

, No, not for Facebook, or for other inappropriate things, but use it to research the background of your story to make it more plausible. Find out the climate, what the people are like, what myths they have. You may be surprised. Not falling off your chair surprised, but at least an eyes open wide tongue hanging out surprised.

, In it, jot down all of your ideas and thoughts, however random.

, You may also want to refer to your list in future years to avoid past mistakes.

"
"
Characters: Flesh out your characters so that they will seem like real people.,
Plot: Before you write, formulate your plot.,
Start writing: All the aspects of your characters will need to be familiar to you.,
First draft: When you think your plot is pretty stable and your first draft is complete, it's time to let someone else to take a look.,
Editing: Editing will take a very long time and should be saved for later.,
Getting published: If you believe you're finally ready to present your book to a publisher, have different kinds of presentations prepared.",How to Properly Write and Format a Book," Get to know all the little details, such as their favorite color, their values, and their biggest fears. Most of these facts may never be mentioned; however, knowing them will allow you to know what each character would do in any kind of situation.

, Splitting it into three major events can make it much easier to begin. Can you picture a timeline? Instead of having a straight line, the most important or emotionally evoking events jerk up into a point, which is similar to a triangle. In-between those points, fill in the less eminent occurrences that lead up to those three major events. In order to accomplish these eminent events in your story, those somewhat mundane occurrences must take place.

, Use action words. Instead of using the word said, use words that create an image in your mind, such as whispered, yelled, voiced, or mentioned. In addition, avoid using the word thought. Instead, use words like believed, perceived, or contemplated. Your goal is to transport your readers into the reality you have created. In order to do that, you must use writing skills that evoke resplendent, verdure, intrepid images/characters. Don't forget to include adjectives, adverbs, and strong verbs that strike your audience's imagination!

, An outside opinion can be refreshing and give you access to suggestions and critique.

, It may or may not be the most frustrating, exasperating, enervating step of this whole process. Don't lose hope! This book of yours can be made to shine with some editing.

, Some agents request a query letter first. Some wish to read the first chapter. Some require a synopsis. Be able to fit your story into two or three sentences. What will grab your reader's attention? What will you reveal about your book that will pull them in? What is it that makes your story unique?

List the things and people you love and admire: Movies, TV stars, family, friends, favorite pop stars, sport players, music, food, animals, places you want to visit, your goals, happy memories, things you plan to do, your favourite outfits;anything that makes you happy!,
Find cut-outs, photos, etc.,
Get a scrapbook or a lined/blank notebook that you can paste things into.,
Design a cover for the book (optional), and start sticking all the things you've collected !",How to Make a Me Book,";
, For music and movies,if you can't find pictures of all your favourite singers and stars, listing them down on the book is also a good idea!

, It doesn't have to be huge, but if it's too small for cut-outs, they could poke out from the sides of the book. The paper has to be thick enough for all the things you plan to stick in. You'll also need a pair of scissors and a stick of glue, and maybe some bright pens/pencils. Stickers are also fun to add.

, For memories and songs you love, you can write the events or songs down on the book and border it with colour pens.

Locate an artist to discuss your needs with.,
Select an artist who does work similar to what you want.,
Have a clear idea of what you want and what you will use it for before contacting the artist.,
Look at samples of the artist's previous work, and find out what techniques they use.,
Decide on as many of the specifics listed here that you can, to simplify the discussion with the artist when you meet.,
Be prepared to provide the following for each illustration:


What elements will be included in the composition?,
Understand that you will have to provide specific information like the examples listed above to get exactly the product you are looking for.,
Discuss the cost of the artwork with the artist, and find out if they prefer a contract for the entire project, a unit price commission, an hourly fee for work, or other method of calculating price.,
Agree with the artist what your finished product should look like, when it will be ready to pick up, and what method of payment you will use.

",How to Order Illustrations from a Freelance Artist," You may find one through telephone book listings, advertisements, or through friends who have contacts with one.;
, If the need is for fliers or brochures, you wouldn't go to a classical portrait artist. You may go to a graphic design studio, or to a freelancer who specializes in artwork similar to what you require.

, Don't waste the artist's time while you flounder. You can ask for some input but you should know your purpose before you call.

, Airbrush work, screen prints, computer generated images, hand drawn or painted work are all completely different both in appearance and the amount of labor involved.

,


How many illustrations would you like to start with?
Size and weight of the stock (paper, fabric, or plastic) you will use.
Color, and if so, color quality, black and white, glossy or matte finish, etc.

,
Example of the format for instructions, for illustrations, such as:

a baby tiger sitting, looking forward, no background, black and white art
an adult lion, standing, with a tree to his left and a rock to the right, color art
a human adult hand, no background, b&w
a rose, on a stem, no background, b&w
a pig wearing a straw hat, running down a lane, towards the reader, past a small house, color
maze of hedge rows seen from above, dog walking through maze, b&w
a man’s face, Japanese features, short hair, facing front, b&w



, Giving thought to these considerations prior to engaging the artist will speed the process up greatly.

, A full time, professional freelance artist will usually have a set rate for their services, and their method of pricing their work may vary from one artist to another.

Find a job.,
Meet with the art director.,
Read drafts.,
Meet with the author.,
Sign a contract.,
Begin the process of illustration.,
Refine your drawings.,
Revise your illustrations.,
Finish your illustrations.",How to Illustrate a Book1," In order to be paid for your work as a professional illustrator you will need to go through the, often challenging, process of finding work.


While you are searching for paid work, it may be valuable to do unpaid jobs which will help you build up for portfolio.
If you wish to be paid for your work, try contacting anyone you know in the business of publishing or editing books to see if they can help point you in the right direction. You can also contact a publishing company by phone or letter; in doing this, you may get a chance to have your portfolio considered. You are likely to be rejected many times, so be persistent!;
, This may be via phone or email, or it may be in person. Regardless, this is the time to agree upon deadlines, any special requirements of the author, your timetable and availability, or any other questions you might have.You will repeat this step many times throughout the process. You will need to show the author/s and publishers samples of what you have so far in order to agree that it is moving in the right direction.

, When you finally do find someone in need of your services, they will give you either one or many options of different novels and books. You must, of course, read a draft or if the story is a reprint read the original book previous to the reprint. You may be lucky enough to have the opportunity do a cover or dust-jacket design. You must make sure you thoroughly understand the plot and its characters; remember their emotions are expressed through your art.

, If you have agreed that you enjoy the story, and that you would like to illustrate it, you should meet with the author to discuss and agree upon a number of things such as: the cover (and whether or not you will illustrate it), which pages should be illustrated, what kind of media you will use (i.e. what kind of illustrations you are going to make), etc.

, After you've met with the author and agreed on the details, you will need to sign a contract that specifies all the details of your agreement with the publishing company and/or author.Make sure the contract includes pertinent information such as when you should be finished and how much you should be paid.
Make sure to get a copy of the contract which includes the signatures of all involved parties and the date it was signed.

, How this step proceeds depends on how you, as an artist, prefer to work. Some illustrators like to begin with making some pencil sketches of the ideas they have in their head, comparing them and getting feedback from friends and family.While others just free draw. However you do it, you need to start coming up with a solid idea of what each character will look like, and what the style of the illustrations will be.


Your method for illustrating may be completely different, and that is OK. If you are successfully creating illustrations, there is no reason to try to change anything.

, Once you have come up with a sketch that fits with the guidelines of the publisher (these will be different for every publisher, and probably every job), you will need to come up with rough sketches for each required page that you will review with the author/publishers.


Sometimes it can be hard to receive feedback from others, especially if it is critical; however, you should try not to take this personally. They only want the book to be as good as it can be.

, Based on the feedback of the authors you should do your best to revise them so that all parties can be happy with the end product.Be sure that the illustrations will fit the dimensions of the book! If you draw the image too big, parts of the image will be missing from the book, and the effect may not be the same., After what is likely to be several rounds of feedback on your work, you will be able to complete a final illustration. You will then send these to the publisher, where the sketches and the story will be put together to create the final product!"
"
Find a book you want to illustrate.,
Begin sketching images.,
Decide on a style.,
Draw and redraw each image.,
Scan your images into the computer.,
Consider sharing your work.",How to Illustrate a Book2," Perhaps you’ve already got a story in mind, or maybe not. If not, read several different books and pick one that you really enjoy. If the story paints a vivid picture in your mind, it will be easier to come up with sketches.


Regardless of what book you choose, make sure you spend plenty of time reading and analyzing the story. Try to imagine what the author pictured when it was written. Try to imagine how you would draw the picture as you are reading and re-reading the story.
Another option is to write a story of your own. Many writers enjoy the process of both writing and illustrating. One advantage of this is, that if you write your own story, you know exactly what the author is trying to portray, which makes it easier to portray the story in images.

, After you’ve chosen or written the book you want to illustrate you can begin sketching pictures of the setting, the scenery, etc.


It may be helpful to take notes of what you've sketched so far, with what characters, and in what settings so that you can keep track throughout the book. Especially if the book is a long one, it may be hard to remember the details of what you sketched in an earlier part of the book.
If you’re not sure exactly what the characters and style should look like, try sketching out several different ideas so you can see them on paper (or computer).

, Once you’ve completed some rough sketches of different ideas you have, you can choose a style that you will stick with throughout the book.


Since this is for your own enjoyment, the style can be any you choose. However, it is often a good idea to choose a style that matches with the book. For example, if the book is about drama and murder, you probably won't be using a lot of bright colors. Instead, in this case, you might consider using darker, more muted shading, and less cartoonish characters.
If you're illustrating a children's book, on the other hand, you don't want to draw characters that will frighten children.

, Since you are not doing this as a paid job, you can proceed with the process of illustration as you like. Draw images for each scene you find interesting, or for each page of the book. Draw and redraw the scenes as much as you like. Add color or keep the illustrations as simple pencil sketches. These choices are completely yours.


If you are doing this in order to build up a portfolio, you should try to work towards creating a style that is unique to you.If you want to improve your illustrations, you can also ask for lots of feedback from friends and family too! They may have ideas you hadn’t previously thought of., If you have drawn all your images by hand, you can scan the images into your computer where you can add the images to the story.


Alternatively, if you have chosen a book that you are unable to edit on the computer, you can simply put the drawings into the book where you wanted to include them. This way they will be in the story next time you read it., If you think you might one day want to become a published illustrator, consider sharing your work. These days, it is very common for illustrators to post their portfolio online.


There are many websites that will let you create your own blog for free. Simply search on Google for ""free blogging websites"". Make sure the site you choose will easily allow you to share your link with friends!
You can also create a physical portfolio if you wish. There are many ways to do this, but if you plan to present it to potential clients, make sure that it looks clean and professional.

The most cliched and overused ways for a villain to die is getting shot, stabbed or falling to one's death.,
Make sure the death fits the villain.,
Do not make the death a total accident.,
Don't make the death simplistic.,
Know you audience.,
Make sure that the death fits with the genre.,
Try to level out predictability.,
Not every villain has to die.,
Make sure that if your villain does die they do at least 3 evil things to deserve that fate or 1 evil thing that is so downtrodden that it has to be so.",How to Kill a Villain in a Story," Try to avoid having your villain die by these causes at all costs although it can work on certain occasions. A good example of this is the movie Shanghai Noon where throughout the film Roy O'Bannon is continuously teased about poor marksmanship and ultimately kills the bad guy Van Cleef by shooting him.;
, How many evil deeds they have done, how evil they truly are (don't go overboard with this one) etc. should decide what should happen to them. For example if he's killed people left and right, showed no remorse whatsoever, killed a baby etc. then he deserves something gruesome like getting impaled by a steel rafter and falling into a wood-chipper. If the villain however has been forced into the conditions he's been in, hasn't killed anyone, is just defending himself then one of the aforementioned cliched deaths would be more appropriate. If this is taken in stride then they shouldn't be killed at all instead simply arrested or redeem themselves.

, For example if the villain is about to shoot the hero but slips and instead plummets off of a cliff, that would be a case of deus ex machina, a literary device to be avoided if at all possible. Dying of a urinary tract infection is something else entirely though- and may even add a bit of realism to a story: Genghis Khan survived an arrow through the neck with virtually no medical technology to save him, but years later fell off his horse and died of internal bleeding.

, Sometimes the cliched deaths can be made better if they put up a formidable fight. That's most important: make sure that the villain actually defends himself. If the hero merely shoots the villain dead whilst he's running away and that's that, is not good. Rather make the villain and hero have an intense fistfight and if possible try to make the villain survive a lot of normally fatal things that would fell anybody else but they keep on going. A good example is Boromir's last stand in Lord of the Rings (although the character isn't technically a villain) as he gets shot through the heart and again in the stomach with arrows before a third one to the lung kills him.

, If the story is directed towards an adult audience feel free to have the villain get his gut sliced open and intestines burst out in an oozing mess. If it's a child's story just have the villain fall to their demise or be blasted with magic or something.

, A romance is something simplistic like getting shot; a fantasy is something epic like falling into lava or getting impaled with a sword; a comedy is something hilarious like the villain survives so many fatal things before getting killed by something that is completely nonsensical like the Naked Gun (a villain falls out of a 10-story window, dusts himself off, begins to walk away and then suddenly gets mauled to death by a lion that jumps out of nowhere); an action has an epic final fight before the villain is killed creatively.

, If the way your villain is going to die is oh-so-obvious make sure it's not easily done or have your villain keep up one final epic fight to make sure it doesn't happen. For example in Pirates of the Caribbean it's mentioned early on that the only way to kill Davy Jones is to stab his heart. Since it's obvious that's how he's going to die he puts an epic duel with Jack Sparrow and others along with a fistfight with a member of his own crew before finally being felled.

, In fact on occasion it's better if they don't. If the film is the typical good guy vs. bad guy and the villain does many evil things they should die yes. However if the film also has a sub-plot of sorts where the main character is conflicted and has to stay on the path of righteousness then the villain should be spared. This is masterfully portrayed in the movie The Dark Knight where the Joker is the main villain, kills many people, terrorizes Gotham etc. and during the film Batman struggles with whether having to choose to break his one rule (never kill criminals). Ultimately at the climax the Joker begins to fall off of a skyscraper but Batman saves his life and lets him get arrested.

, For example in the video game The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess the villain Ganondorf is killed at the end as he tricked a Twili (the villain Zant) into believing he was a God and getting him to do the bad stuff for him (turning light world in to twilight) getting an orc (King Bulblin) to kidnap children and he killed Midna (Link's companion)

Close with a summary.",How to Write White Papers," Typically, you won’t know your audience personally. However, you should identify as many factors as possible, such as professional needs, educational backgrounds, and job title(s). These aspects will determine how to form your argument. Mold your proposal to be relatable to your audience based on these factors.For example, if your topic is community gardens, appeal to your readers as property owners and parents, as well as community decision makers. They’ll be interested in learning about the impact of gardening and local food on their property values, their children’s health, and their children’s education.;
, This will establish how simple or complex your paper should be. If your audience’s expertise matches or is close to your own, you could include technical jargon. For a general audience, however, keep the paper as jargon-free as possible. If you must include specific terminology, use it sparingly and explain it. For example:If you’re writing a white paper for an engineer, you should include lots of technical details and be lengthy in your descriptions.
If you’re writing for a government official, focus on policy-related implications.
If you’re writing for a corporate audience, focus on cost effectiveness and growth potential.

, Make it attention-grabbing but not over-the-top. Mention or allude to your problem. Some titles incorporate the words “white paper,” but this isn’t mandatory. Tailor the language to a general audience. Some good examples include:Closing the School-to-Prison Pipeline with Art
Safer Cities through Community Gardens: A White Paper

, Assume your reader has a very busy life. Explain exactly what your white paper is about without adding unnecessary padding. Make your first couple of sentences engaging enough to grab their attention., Acknowledge your audience and how you intend them to use the paper. Summarize the present order of things and why it’s a problem. Briefly discuss the arguments of your opposition and why you’re proposing something different. For example, if you were writing on student debt, you might say:Student debt has grown exponentially over the past decade. Combined with the dismal job market new graduates face, their debt threatens to become the next economy-crashing bubble. Creditors and a number of economists have argued A, B, and C. However, these arguments do not address X, Y, and Z.

, Briefly introduce the methodology you’ll use in your analysis. Detail possible solutions you have rejected and why you rejected them. Explain why your audience should accept your proposed solution. For example, you solution to the student debt bubble could be:After , I became convinced that do not adequately address the problem. This white paper will argue in favor of because it would .

, For this step, you’ll have to know your reader’s needs. Focus on the challenges that you propose to solve. This should be something you can phrase in a few words.Examples of problems include ""decreasing sales,"" ""slow network speeds,"" or ""management-employee conflicts.""

, This helps to make your argument credible in the mind of you reader. Describe the problem you identified in greater depth. Give details as to how you concluded this is a problem. Use clear, precise terms. Your analysis should last no more than a paragraph., Historical overviews help to explain how the problem in question became a problem. If possible, you could also discuss how your problem was once a solution. Use specific figures, dates, and names to explain this progression.For example, a white paper on addressing climate change might discuss how hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were once believed to be a safe replacement for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which had produced a hole in the ozone layer. However, we now know that HFCs are actually dangerous greenhouse gases.

, Include charts, graphs, or diagrams to help to back up your white paper's argument. They can also win an audience's attention. Some white papers integrate visual aids into the text. Others place them in an appendix at the end. Ask your employer which method they prefer., Analyze the data and figures you present. Detail how you arrived at your conclusions. Make sure you’ve examined all the facts so that there are no holes in your findings. You should aim to produce findings that can be reproduced through the analysis you conducted., Adopt a step-by-step approach that clarifies exactly how you intend your idea to be implemented. Divide your content into digestible parts, such as bulleted lists or individual paragraphs with their own bold headings. This will help your audience to read and understand your argument.If you’re writing your paper within a corporate context, avoid mentioning your company’s product at this point. Focus instead on what to expect in a solution.

, Use hard evidence, such as trade journals, government publications, and the data and figures in your research, to explain why your solution is the best course of action to take. Weigh your argument against other proposed solutions. Acknowledge the usefulness of opposing solutions while emphasizing why they fall short of solving the problem., Include a review of the problem at hand. Briefly recap your solution. Re-emphasize the result you hope to see. If you choose to slip in a plug for your product or company, keep it relevant and subtle. Remember you’re focusing on solving someone else’s problem, as opposed to promoting a product or service for personal gain."

Break and indent paragraphs for different speakers.,
Use quotation marks correctly.,
Punctuate your dialogue tags properly.The dialogue tag (also called the signal phrase) is the part of the narration that makes clear which character is speaking.,
Punctuate questions and exclamations properly.,
Use dashes and ellipses correctly.,
Capitalize the quoted speech.,
Break a long speech into multiple paragraphs.If one of your characters delivers an especially long speech, then, just like you would in an essay or in the non-dialogue parts of your story, you should break that speech up into multiple paragraphs.,
Avoid using quotation marks with indirect dialogue.,
Make sure the reader knows who is speaking.,
Avoid using over-fancy dialogue tags.,
Vary the placement of your dialogue tags.,
Substitute pronouns for proper nouns.,
Use dialogue beats to mix up your formatting.,
Use believable language.,
Avoid info-dumping in dialogue.",How to Format Dialogue in a Story," Because dialogue involves two or more speakers, readers need something that lets them know where one character’s speech ends and another’s begins. Indenting a new paragraph every time a new character begins speaking provides a visual cue to help readers follow the dialogue.Even if a speaker only utters half a syllable before they’re interrupted by someone else, that half-syllable still gets its own indented paragraph.
In English, dialogue is read from the left side of the page to the right, so the first thing readers notice when looking at a block of text is the white space on the left margin.;
, American writers generally use a set of double quotation marks (“ “) around all of the words that are spoken by a character, as seen in this example: Beth was walking down the street when she saw her friend Shao. ""Hey there!"" she said as she waved.A single set of quotation marks can include multiple sentences, as long as they are spoken in the same portion of dialogue. For example: Evgeny argued, ""But Laura didn’t have to finish her dinner! You always give her special treatment!""
When a character quotes someone else, use double-quotes around what your character says, then single-quotes around the speech they’re quoting. For example: Evgeny argued, “But you never yell ‘Finish your dinner’ at Laura!”
The reversal of roles for the single and double-quotation mark is common outside of American writing. Many European and Asian languages use angle brackets (<< >>) to mark dialogue instead.

, For example, in the following sentence, Evgeny argued is the dialogue tag: Evgeny argued, “But Laura didn’t have to finish her dinner!”


Use a comma to separate the dialogue tag from the dialogue.
If the dialogue tag precedes the dialogue, the comma appears before the opening quotation mark: Evgeny argued, “But Laura didn’t have to finish her dinner!”
If the dialogue tag comes after the dialogue, the comma appears before (inside) the closing quotation mark: “But Laura didn’t have to finish her dinner,” argued Evgeny.
If the dialogue tag interrupts the flow of a sentence of dialogue, use a pair of commas that follows the previous two rules: “But Laura,” Evgeny argued, “never has to finish her dinner!”

, Place question marks and exclamation points inside the quotation marks, like so: ""What is going on?"" Tareva asked. ""I am so confused right now!""


If the question or exclamation ends the dialogue, do not use commas to separate the dialogue from dialogue tags. For example: ""Why did you order mac-and-cheese pizza for dinner?"" Fatima asked in disbelief.

, Dashes (--, also known as em-dashes) are used to indicate abrupt endings and interruptions in dialogue. They are not the same as hyphens, which should generally only be used to create compound words. Ellipses (...) are used when dialogue trails off but is not abruptly interrupted.


For example, use a dash to indicate an abruptly ended speech: ""What are y--"" Joe began.
You can also use dashes to indicate when one person's dialogue is interrupted by another's: ""I just wanted to tell you--""
""Don't say it!""
""--that I prefer Rocky Road ice cream.""
Use ellipses when a character has lost her train of thought or can't figure out what to say: ""Well, I guess I mean...""

, If dialogue begins grammatically at character's sentence (as opposed to beginning mid-sentence), capitalize the first word as though it's the first word of the sentence, even though you may have narration before it.For example: Evgeny argued, ""But Laura didn’t have to finish her dinner!"" The “b” of “But” does not technically begin the sentence, but it begins a sentence in the world of the dialogue, so it is capitalized.
However, if the first quoted word isn’t the first word of a sentence, don’t capitalize it: Evgeny argued that Laura “never has to finish her dinner!”

,


Use an opening quotation mark where you normally would, but don’t place one at the end of the first paragraph of the character’s speech. The speech isn’t over yet, so you don’t punctuate it like it is!
Do, however, place another opening quotation mark at the beginning of the next paragraph of speech. This indicates that this is a continuation of the speech from the previous paragraph.
Place your closing quotation mark wherever the character’s speech ends, as you normally would.

, Direct dialogue is someone actually speaking, and quotation marks are used to indicate it. Indirect dialogue is reported speech, not the act of someone speaking directly, and quotation marks are not used. For example: Beth saw her friend Shao on the street and stopped to say hello.

, There are a couple of ways to do this, but the most obvious way is to use dialogue tags accurately. The reader can’t get confused if your sentence clearly indicates that Evgeny is speaking, not Laura.


When you have a long dialogue that’s clearly being held between only two people, you can choose to leave out the dialogue tags entirely. In this case, you would rely on your paragraph breaks and indentations to let the reader know which character is speaking.
You should leave out the dialogue tags when more than two characters are speaking only if you intend for the reader to be potentially confused about who is speaking. For example, if four characters are arguing with one another, you may want the reader to get the sense that they’re just hearing snatches of argument without being able to tell who’s speaking. The confusion of leaving out dialogue tags could help accomplish this.

, Your instinct might be to spice up your story using as many variations of ""she said"" and ""he said"" as possible, but tags such as ""she groused"" or ""he denounced"" actually distract from what your characters are saying. ""He said"" and ""she said"" are so common that they tend to become essentially invisible to readers., Instead of starting every dialogue sentence with “Evgeny said,” “Laura said,” or “Sujata said,” try placing some dialogue tags at the end of sentences.


Place dialogue tags in the middle of a sentence, interrupting the sentence, to change the pacing of your sentence. Because you have to use two commas to set the dialogue tag apart (see Step 3 in the previous section), your sentence will have two pauses in the middle of the spoken sentence: “And how exactly,” Laura muttered under her breath, “do you plan on accomplishing that?”

, Whereas proper nouns name specific places, things, and people and are always capitalized, pronouns are uncapitalized words that stand in for full nouns, including proper nouns.To avoid the repetition of your characters’ names, substitute the appropriate pronouns from time to time.


Some examples of pronouns include I, me, he, she, herself, you, it, that, they, each, few, many, who, whoever, whose, someone, everybody, and so on.
Pronouns must always agree with the number and gender of the nouns they’re referring to.For example, the only appropriate pronouns to replace “Laura” are singular, feminine ones: she, her, hers, herself.
The only appropriate pronouns to replace “Laura and Evgeny” are plural, gender neutral ones (because English loses gender when pluralized): they, their, theirs, themselves, them.

, Dialogue beats are brief moments of action that interrupt a sequence of dialogue.They can be good ways to show what a character is doing at the same time as telling what they're saying, and can provide a nice action boost to a scene. For example: ""Hand me that screwdriver,"" Sujata grinned and wiped her grease-covered hands on her jeans, ""I bet I can fix this thing.""

, The biggest problem with dialogue is often that it doesn’t sound believable. You talk perfectly normally every day of your life, so trust your own voice! Imagine how your character is feeling and what they want to say. Say it out loud in your own words. That’s your starting point. Don’t try to use big fancy words that nobody uses in normal conversation; use a voice you’d hear in everyday life. Read the dialogue back to yourself and see if it feels normal., Using dialogue to provide exposition not only creates dull dialogue, it also often results in speeches that are so long that they're likely to lose the reader's attention. If you need to communicate details about plot or backstory, try to show them through narration, not dialogue.

Revise your talking points before presenting them to your intended audience.",How to Write Talking Points," Consider why you are speaking to your audience and identify the purpose of your speech or interview. Is your main mission to convince a committee to support your policy or a change to an existing policy? Is your main message to tell an audience of students about your experiences in a foreign country? Are you trying to present a specific issue or problem at your child’s school to the PTA board? Are you giving an interview to a local newspaper about a local issue or to promote a product? Focusing on the main purpose of your talk will then help you create the rest of your talking points.You can develop your message by thinking about emotion, or what you want your audience to feel, contrast or how your message is different than the message of others, connection, or why your audience should care about what you are saying, and credibility, or why your audience should believe what you say.For example, maybe the main message of your talk is to argue for the creation of after school programs at your child’s school. You may then identify the mission of your speech as: “The mission of my speech is to convince the school board to provide after school programming at my child’s school.”
If the main message of your interview is to discuss the latest product released by your company, you may write out the mission as: “The mission of my interview is to promote the 2016 release of the lightweight hover board by my company, Hover, Inc.”;
, Once you have identified your main message, you can then create two to three main talking points to support your main message. You will then use these main points to develop supporting arguments or examples to ensure your main message is well supported. Focus on talking points that will help you prove your main message or expand further on your main message.Your talking points should be clear, short, and to the point. Think of your talking points as your elevator pitch, made up of keywords or short sentences.
For example, if the main message of your talk is to argue for after school programs at your child’s school, they may be structured as follows:

Benefits my child’s education, will supply her with educational activities in a controlled, monitored environment.
Benefits other students at Normandy who need educational guidance and activity once school hours are over.
Benefits the other parents of students at Normandy High School by providing education and guidance for their children.



, You should use examples that are personal and impactful, with the strongest examples listed first. Your examples may be personal stories of success that illustrate the importance of your talk or data that show how useful and effective the main points of your talk will be for your audience.Though it may be tempting to make a long list of examples, try to focus on one to two examples that best illustrate your main point or mission. Most speeches are the most effective when they are short and to the point, especially if you are arguing for a particular position or stance on an issue.
For example, if you are arguing for after school programs at your child’s school, you may tell a short story about how your child struggles with her math assignments and is looking for tutoring that could be provided through the after school program. You may also use data from a national study on after school programs that show how well students in after school programs do in their academics and in their community as a result of these programs.
Your talking point may look like this:

Talking point: Benefits your child's education, gives her support in a controlled, monitored environment.
Example 1: Story about her math assignments.
Example 2: National study on after school programs and academics.



, Let your audience know why they should care about your talk by providing possible solutions or ways to enact your suggestions. Your talk should not only identify a main message or problem; it should also give your audience several ways to solve or address the main message or problem. Ideally, your talk should present a solution that feels like a win for you, as the speaker, and a win for the audience, your listeners.For example, if you are creating possible options or solutions for your argument for more after school programs at your child’s school, you may give one option: introducing an after school program on a trial basis, one to two times a week, with monitoring done by the school for a period of six months. This can act as a test to see how effective the program is for the students at the school.

, Provide information on what the audience can do to support your mission. This could be in the form of giving a donation, signing a petition, buying a product or volunteering time for a cause. Ending with a call to action will give your audience the opportunity to respond to your talk in a proactive and tangible way.To end your talk on after school programs, you may ask your audience to consider signing a petition to support after school programs. You may also ask that the school consider your proposal and respond to you in writing by a set date. This will allow you to hold your audience accountable for any promises made as a result of your talk.

, Let your audience know how they can get in touch with you or your organization. This could be a toll free phone number, an email address, or a website. If you or your organization uses social media to connect with customers, you may also provide your social media contacts.Supplying your contact information will show that you are committed to your main message or mission and are willing to speak directly to individuals in the audience. This can also allow audience members to contact you directly with any questions or concerns they may have as a result of your talk.

, Organize your talking points in a bulleted list, with your main message or mission stated at the top of the list and your main talking points placed below, with the strongest point listed first. You should also include one to two supporting arguments within your main talking points. A sample bulleted list may appear as follows:


Main message/mission: The mission of my speech is to convince the school board to provide after school programming at my child’s school.
Talking Point 1: Benefits my child’s education and supply her with educational activities in a controlled, monitored environment.

Supporting argument: My daughter struggles with her math assignments and has a difficult time socializing with other students. She comes home from school defeated and unmotivated, and as a busy working mother, I do not have the means or the time to support her academically. An after school program could provide math tutoring and the opportunity to interact with other students in a more open, recreational environment.


Talking Point 2: Benefits other students at Normandy who need educational guidance and activity after school hours are over.

Supporting argument: Statistics show that students who attend after school programming score higher on standardized testing and develop stronger social skills with their peers. An after school program can help provide students with the chance to interact in a controlled and monitored environment that is positive and safe.


Talking Point 3: Benefits the other parents of students at Normandy High School by providing education and guidance for their children.

Supporting argument: I have spoken with other parents of Normandy students who are working late hours to provide for their families and who are struggling to find childcare and keep their children in a safe, supervised environment. Like me, they are looking for a way to ensure their child stays on track academically and socially.



, Another way you can format your talking points is in the style of a Q&A. This format can be useful if your talking points are going to be used in an interview setting. For example, if you are preparing for an interview about the latest product made by your company, you may lay out your talking points in a series of questions and answers:


Question 1: Who are you and why are we talking today?
Answer: I am the owner of Hover, Inc. and the purpose of our interview is to discuss the release of the newest hoverboard, Hoverboard 5.0.
Question 2: Why should consumers buy your product?
Answer: First, it is the most affordable hover board on the market and is priced for the average consumer. Second, it is incredibly lightweight and ten times faster than other models currently on the market. Third, it has updated safety features to ensure your ride is smooth and safe.
Question 3: Can you provide an example that shows how useful or enjoyable your product is for consumers?
Answer: One of our designers has a young son and he gave his son the hoverboard one day to see what he thought of it. His son used the hoverboard in their driveway and showed it off to his friends. Each friend tried the hoverboard in different environments: the driveway, the park, the sidewalk, and even in a football field. At the end of the day, the designer asked his son what he and his friends thought of the hoverboard. His son told him it was the most fun they had ever had together, and that not a single friend was hurt.

, Pretend a colleague or friend is your intended audience and present your talking points to them. Time yourself so you do not go over the allotted time constraint for your talk and use confident body language, maintaining eye contact and a straight, upright pose.


Ask your test audience for feedback on your talking points. Ask them if they felt your main message was clear and if your talking points were well supported by examples or arguments. You should also ensure your call to action is clear and your talking points end on a high note, full of energy and engagement.

, Adjust your talking points based on the feedback from your test audience and practice presenting them again.


You may want to do this in a mirror so you can look at how you are speaking and how you are carrying your body as you speak. Make sure you use confident, open body language, with eye contact, the use of your hands, and good posture. Run through your talking points several times so you are confident and prepared when you present them to your intended audience.

Know your maximum allotted time, which is generally under ten minutes, and make sure you’re well acquainted with the judging or grading rubric.


If you have any questions, ask your teacher or debate coach for clarity.;
, You can choose almost any topic for your original oratory. This flexibility can be overwhelming, but you should see it as an opportunity to share information about something that matters to you. Since you’ll have to do lots of research, you should choose a topic that you find important and exciting.Your topic should be culturally relevant and appeal to broad audiences, but shouldn’t be cliche or overdone.
If you’re passionate about do it yourself knowledge, for example, you could write an oratory about the value of widely available DIY education.

, An original oratory can inform your audience about a topic or persuade them to accept your argument. When you start planning your speech, decide if you’d rather share information with your audience or convince them of something.For example, you might decide that you want to persuade your audience that DIY education has personal, societal, and economical benefits.

, Whether your intent is to inform or persuade, you’ll need to cultivate thorough knowledge on your topic and support your oratory with evidence.Think of your original oratory as a school research paper.Choose sources such as reputable periodicals, encyclopedias, authoritative books, and scientific journals., You have lots of flexibility when it comes to formatting an original oratory, but you should structure your speech around a concise thesis. A thesis is one sentence that clearly states your argument and provides a road map for the rest of your speech.Your thesis should convey to your audience the speech's purpose and stance. Be clear and direct instead of including words like ""This speech is about"" before your thesis.
If your topic is DIY education, your thesis could be, “Making do it yourself knowledge widely available is essential to contemporary society.”

, Your three points will provide evidence that support your thesis, and you'll discuss them in detail in your speech's body. You'll state the thesis and main points in the introduction, expand and defend them in your speech’s body, and summarize them in a conclusion.For your speech about DIY education, your main points could deal with the personal, practical, and economic benefits of DIY education. You'd use one section in your body to expand on each benefit.

, Everyone writes differently, and some people prefer to write the introduction first, the body second, and the conclusion last. However, organizing the body of your speech first can help you summarize your main points more concisely in your introduction and conclusion.When you organize the body of your speech, don't spend too much or too little time on one or two points. Try to balance your time equally between your points, and make sure you’re familiar with your time limit or permitted word count.
For example, you could spend one to two paragraphs discussing the personal pride that comes with completing a DIY project on your own. You could then spend a couple of paragraphs discussing practical benefits, like being able to handle a medical emergency. Finally, you can talk about the money and resources one saves by completing a DIY project on their own.

, While you should include evidence in the body of your speech to support your points, you’ll need to strike a balance between statistics, insight, and personal connection to the topic. Keep in mind that most speech competitions have limits on the number of quoted words you use, so be selective and only include the strongest available evidence.When you choose your citations, don’t twist or misrepresent a source to fit your agenda., Don’t forget to document your source both verbally when you deliver the speech and in the written script. Your verbal citations should be thorough enough that your audience could find them on their own for further research. You can typically use any manual style, like MLA, but you should check with your teacher or debate coach to verify which is best for your assignment.For example, cite a source by saying, ""According to a 2012 study by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, community education outside of the classroom provides medical students with more robust knowledge and better patient interaction skills.""

, Including a perspective that opposes your argument is a great way to strengthen your case. Include a paragraph that summarizes an opposing statement, then include evidence to the contrary to prove that your argument is more valid.You could include, for instance, a source that calls DIY a form of dilettantism or dabbling. Then you could refute this argument as dismissive and short-sighted by citing examples of individuals who have cultivated in-depth DIY knowledge on a variety of subjects.

, The introduction should grab the audience’s attention, state the problem your thesis addresses, and lay down your solution’s roadmap. The conclusion must be a strong, concise restatement of your thesis and main points.Once you’ve organized the body of your speech, you’ll have a better idea of how to structure the introduction and conclusion. In general, follow this structure: tell your audience what you’re going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them.

, Once you’ve written and revised your oratory, have other people critique its content and format. Have an English teacher or professor read it and give you feedback on the quality of your writing. Ask your peers to read it to gauge whether your topic and presentation style appeal to broad audiences., An original oratory is typically a memorized speech.Start memorizing your speech as soon as you’ve drafted it. Don’t wait until the last minute or your grade or competition performance will reflect your procrastination.


To memorize your speech, break it up into smaller sections. Work on memorizing a few sentences at a time, then a paragraph, then nail an entire section.
Try re-writing two or three sentences and saying them out loud as you write. Writing, speaking, and reading at the same time will help your brain create more connections, helping you memorize your content.

, Generally, you’ll have less than 10 minutes to deliver your original oratory. Use a stopwatch or your phone’s clock to time yourself. Give yourself some wiggle room of at least 30 seconds to a minute, just in case you take a little longer to deliver your speech than in practiceGive yourself plenty of time to deliver your speech clearly so you don’t have to speak so quickly that your audience can’t understand you.

, Since your speech will be memorized, it’s especially vital to use facial expressions and eye contact to connect with your audience. Practice your speech in the mirror to make sure your expressions are natural and project confidence.If you’re nervous about making eye contact, look slightly above your audience to create the illusion that you’re maintaining eye contact.

, Use gestures and movements to reinforce your most important points. However, don’t use unnatural or repetitive gestures, like raising your hands in the same exact way every time. If you’re not confident in your ability to mix up your gestures naturally, just keep your hands loosely folded or by your side."
"
Realize that you don't necessarily need a topic.,
Discard the temptation to write following the ""rules"".,
Adopt the free-writing way instead.,
Using only those two things, write a beginning paragraph.,
Simply continue writing from this point, until you find a natural stopping place.",How to Free Write a Book," All you need is a solid character and a setting.;
, For example, the rules would suggest writing a plan along these lines: ""Plot: A, who lives in South Carolina, has a strong desire to be the next American Idol. If you write something using a topic so obvious and real as this one, it will be harder to write. It is easier to ""free write"" a book when you have created a made-up place and events. That way, when you're in need of a town name, you can make one up, instead of having to grab a map and pick one and do background research on it.

, Simply state the character's name (Sarah McBride) and the location (North Benadsway). That done, start writing using only those two things. This makes it easier, because developing a story is easier when you are not trying to stick to a plot.

, For example, ""I have never wanted to be who my mother was. She was a dancer, a beautiful, graceful dancer, all dressed in pink. That is not something I want to be. I just want to be able to keep my overalls on, and sleep in my underwear like I did when I was a child. Can't I just choose my own future, instead of having it chosen for me?"" There, you have your first paragraph. That is an example using first person, but other examples are available.

, At that point, go and bake cookies or walk the dog. After munching on those for a while or getting fresh air (or both) get back to work!

Know your time limit.,
Plan.,
Set up your working area.,
Make yourself comfortable.,
Have a glass of water with you, and a few light snacks.,
Don't focus too much on the snacks and try to focus most of your attention on the work you are doing.,
Take a quick break.,
Listen to some music to settle yourself.,
Bring your mobile to keep yourself alert.,
If you are using a computer, have emails ready and a few other tabs open.,
Make it fun by organizing your work and making it neat.,
Be proud of your work!",How to Get On With Work," How long do you have to finish it? It may be between an hour or a week. Depending on the time you have - you may want to consider timing yourself and aiming for a certain time to finish.;
, Plan when you start and when you finish. Also, plan a break. Halfway through, make sure you have time to relax and remove yourself from the hard-work for a few minutes. Having a quick break will also refresh your memory and keep you from getting bored.

, Find a suitable working area where you will not become distracted and nobody can interfere. Make sure you have plenty of working space and everything you need. Here is a rough guide of what you might need; depending on what you are studying, you may want to adjust the list to suit your needs.


A computer or laptop
A dictionary
A calculator
A pen
Sheet(s) of paper
A pencil
A ruler
A compass
A rubber

, Sit down in a comfortable chair and make sure the temperature and atmosphere of the room is right for you. Open a window if you need fresh air, turn up the heating if you are cold, etc. This will make it much easier for you to settle into the atmosphere of working and you will probably find it less boring.

, Place a glass of water far from your work (particularly computers) just in case you spill it, and a small plate of snacks. You may want to include the following:


Fruit (grapes, a banana, etc.)
Biscuits
Chocolate (in small portions)

, Try not to eat it all in one go - take a few bites and then leave the rest for later.

, Make sure you have enough time to refresh your brain and relax slightly, but not so much that you completely forget about the work and/or get carried away and not be bothered to start working again. About 15 - 20 minutes should be enough time. During your break, consider a mini snack and drink, and try not to over-work your brain. Just relax and watch T.V or perhaps have a little sleep. But remember to set the alarm!

, The work will be much more enjoyable if you have some music in the background to keep you going.

, If texting a few friends every now and then will keep you happy - then do it. But don't engage in a non-stop texting session. Keep it short and don't text too much. It will take your mind off studying every now and then so you don't feel so bored.

, Perhaps visit your favorite site? Every now and again, quickly check your emails or quickly read something from your favorite site - but don't spend ages and don't do it continuously.

, Complete it in different sections - not all in one go. After each section, take some time to take a look at it to check for any mistakes, and then go onto the next section. With an organised space, water and snacks, a few friendly text messages from friends, and music in the background, you'll probably handle it quite well.

, Once you have finished, check it, and go to relax. If you have any other work to complete - have a quick break before going onto the next thing. You don't want to wear yourself out!

Give a chronological account of your life.,
Try a topical approach.,
Focus on a common thread in your life.,
Concentrate on one key event that defines you.,
Keep it short.,
Begin with an introduction.,
Write 3 to 5 body paragraphs.,
End with a conclusion.,
Re-read your speech.,
Practice giving your icebreaker at home.,
Time your speech.",How to Write an Icebreaker Speech," If you’re delivering your icebreaker in a context where people will want to know who you are like, you can focus on giving a chronological account of your life. You won’t be able to talk about every single life event, but you can choose a few milestones.For example, if you’re accepting an award, you’ll want to introduce yourself to the audience. A chronological account of your life tells your audience where and when you were born, the first memory you can remember, and where you went to college.;
, You can write an icebreaker speech that focuses on the events in your life that share a theme. This is an especially good approach if you’re giving your speech in a context that focuses on a specific issue or theme..For example, if you’re giving your speech at a business meeting, you might want to focus on your most impressive business-related accomplishments.
If you’re giving your speech in an academic setting, you might want to highlight your academic accomplishments, including degrees and certifications.

, You can also structure your speech around a common thread in your life. This approach allows to focus on the things you love, rather than just a list of your accomplishments.For instance, if you are a veterinarian, you might talk about your first pet, your first job caring for animals, your decision to become a veterinarian, your current practice and your current pets.
This is also a great approach if you’re writing a wedding toast. Focus on your friendship with the couple (or just one of them) and how it has influenced your life over time.

, You can also focus on one moment or one decision that has defined or shaped your life. Then you can talk about the decision that brought you to that moment and how it’s influenced your life since.For example, if you're a surgeon, you might talk about your most difficult case and how it led you to pioneer a new technique. If you're a military veteran, you might talk about being in combat and how it changed you.

, You might have a lot that you want to say during your icebreaker speech, but it shouldn’t really be longer than 4 to 6 minutes. This really means you only get about two double-spaced pages for your speech. A good way to start is to write down everything you want to say and then work on editing it into two double-spaced pages., You should start your introduction by telling your audience your name and a sentence or two about you. You should also include an attention-getting tidbit, like a joke or a quote that you can relate to the theme of your speech.For example, if you’re giving your speech at a business gathering, you could start with a quote from the company’s founder.
If you’re giving a wedding toast, it’s generally best not to joke – what you think is funny can sometimes come across as mean or embarrassing to the couple getting married.

, Each of your body paragraphs should somehow connect to the theme of your speech. You shouldn’t use the body paragraphs to cram as much information as possible into your speech. Instead, use them to provide examples of the thing you want your audience to know about you.


For example, if you’re giving a speech that focuses on when you became a doctor as a key moment in your life, your first body paragraph might talk about how you liked helping people as a kid, the second paragraph might talk about your decision to go to medical school, and the last paragraph might talk about what it felt the first time someone called you “doctor.”

, Your conclusion, like your introduction, should last about 30 seconds. Use it to repeat the main point of your speech, and then thank the host of the event where you're speaking, or offer some parting words of wisdom.


For example, if your icebreaker speech has been about how you became a doctor, you could end by saying something like ""Little girls who help clean up their friends' 'booboos' on the playground grow up to be doctors. Thank you so much for having me. Have a great day.""
You could also say something like ""If you want to be a doctor, remember that there is nothing more important than a passion for helping people and a commitment to hard work.""

, Once you’ve drafted your speech, re-read it to make sure that you didn't leave out anything important or that you haven’t unnecessarily repeated information.

, The more you practice saying your speech out loud, the more comfortable you’ll be giving it in front of others. You can practice by reciting your speech in front of a mirror, or by asking a friend to listen to your speech and give you feedback.


You don’t have to memorize the speech, but it should be clear that you know what’s coming next while you’re speaking.

, Four to six minutes will fly by when you’re actually giving your speech, so you should time yourself before you give it for real. You can use a clock, your watch, or your phone to time yourself, or you can ask someone else to time it for you. If a friend helps you, they can also listen for filler words like ""you know,"" ""so,"" and ""um.” An icebreaker speech doesn’t have to be super formal, it should still sound prepared."

Choose the academic paper you plan on presenting.,
Find the main ideas.,
Create an outline for the body of your speech.,
Support your ideas.,
Figure out the order of the speech.,
Create introduction and conclusion.,
Practice your speech after finishing the outline, introduction, and conclusion.",How to Write an Extemporaneous Speech from an Academic Paper," An academic paper is written to either highlight a writer’s area of study or research with the purpose to educate or persuade the audience.


Choose a paper you are knowledgeable about, so you can answer any questions.;
, Pick out the main ideas that support your thesis (a sentence that includes the main argument for your paper). If your thesis is not clear, your audience will have a hard time following your speech.


Find three to five main points. Use three main points when you need a shorter presentation. Use five main points when your presentation needs to be longer. However, keep in mind it sometimes makes sense for a longer presentation to only have three main points but go into more detail with those main points.

, An outline is a general set of main points that provides essential information, but not all of the details.Think of it like newspaper headlines: it provides just enough information for you to understand what the argument is. Note: Some people prefer to do the introduction before the body of the outline. Refer to Step 6 if you wish to do this.


Write in complete sentences. The sentences should provide enough information for you to remember the point.
Use transition words such as “first,” “second,” and “finally.” These will help your audience follow your speech and argument even better.

, Make sure you include sources (credible pieces of evidence that help your argument) throughout your speech.


Build your argument using sources from your paper. This will give you credibility as a speaker.
Conduct a CRAAP test to test the credibility of the sources. Ask yourself the following questions: Is the source current? Is the source relevant? Does the source have authority? (Who is the author and are they credible?) Is the source ""accurate""? (Is the source biased? Is the source grammatically correct?) What is the purpose of the source?
Have at least two sources to back up each main point.
Keep in consideration the time limit given when choosing the amount of sources. Time is a huge factor when giving a speech. No one wants to listen to someone talk for hours. At the same time people want to learn from you, so you can’t just briefly explain everything.

, Make sure that your audience can follow your thought process. Explain each point, and make sure that your points build off one another.


Consider having the order of your main points in your speech be the same as your paper.

, The introduction is the beginning of your speech that outlines your thesis statement and main points. The conclusion is the ending of your speech that summarizes what you have talked about.



Write the introduction and conclusion.
Start your introduction with an attention-getter (something that grabs your audience's attention right away). The audience is more likely to pay attention to what you are saying after hearing the attention-getter than if there is no attention-getter.
The introduction and conclusion will be the only parts of your speech that are written word-for-word on the outline because it will be the first and last thing your audience hears.

, Give yourself enough time to feel comfortable with your presentation.

Time your speech. This will help you know if you need to take out or add information.
Practice in front of people and ask their opinions on your speech. If many people have the same comments about your speech, consider fixing your speech to take care of those concerns. A well-written speech is not enough to make up for a poorly delivered speech.
Film yourself speaking. This way you can see your gestures, eye contact and hear your vocal tone.
Each time you deliver your speech, it should not be the same speech word-for-word however your main points will be the same each time.

Make a list of reasons you’re thankful for receiving the award or honor.,
Make a list of people you want to thank in your speech.,
Read other acceptance speeches for inspiration.,
Write a brief introduction.,
Write the body of your speech, focusing on the people you want to thank.,
Conclude your speech on a positive note.,
Read your speech out loud.,
Ask a friend to help you rehearse.,
Record yourself reading your speech.,
Use a timer to monitor the length of your speech.",How to Write an Acceptance Speech," Write down a few bullet points detailing what it means to you to be receiving this recognition. The organization giving you the award and the people in the audience want to know you appreciate the honor you’ve been given, and you’ll be able to better show your gratefulness by articulating it to yourself beforehand.
, Consider the organization that’s giving you the award, any coworkers that worked on the project you’re receiving the award for, and family and friends that supported you along the way.After you make an initial list of people you want to thank, walk away and come back to the list later. There might be people you forgot to include that you’ll remember at a later time.
If you’re worried about leaving someone important out of your speech, ask a close friend or coworker to help with your list. They might think of someone you forgot to include.

, You can look for speeches online or check out a catalog of speeches from your local library. Try to find acceptance speeches that were given by people who received awards similar to the one you’ll be receiving.

For example, if you’re receiving an award for your volunteer work, try searching “volunteer award acceptance speeches” in a search engine. If you’re referencing speeches in a physical book, try to find a book that has the speeches organized by award type.

, The introduction will set the tone for the rest of your speech, so try to express gratitude and connect with the audience right away. A light-hearted joke to open your speech is fine, but avoid sarcasm or joking about the merits of the award itself.The exact length of your introduction will depend on how much time you're allotted to speak, but generally, you should try to keep it brief.

For example, you could write “I am so honored to be standing here today to receive this community leadership award. Serving my community has been a joy and a privilege that I am grateful for every single day. I wouldn't be able to do it if it weren't for all the amazing people in this city.""

, The bulk of your speech should be devoted to showing gratitude and thanking the people that helped you get the award. Reference the list you made of people you want to thank and include them in the body of your speech.

Be selective about who you plan to thank in your speech. You probably don’t want to thank all twenty members of your extended family or name off every person in the organization that is honoring you. You don’t want your audience to grow impatient as you read through a long list of names. Only thank people involved with the award you’re receiving and your immediate support system (your spouse, your children, your parents, etc).You don’t have to thank everyone by name in your speech. Instead of thanking all of your coworkers individually, you could say “I can’t express enough how grateful I am for all of my amazing colleagues.”
If you want to thank the organization giving you the award without listing off every member individually, you could say something along the lines of “Thank you so much to the team at the New York Nonprofit Conference for recognizing me with this incredible award.”

, Keep the conclusion to your speech brief and optimistic. You want the audience to feel inspired by your accomplishments. If you received an award for your work with an organization, highlight a few of the organization’s achievements and mention how you’re looking forward to further helping them fulfill their mission. If the award is for work, end your speech by saying how you can’t wait to get back to work and continue to help the company grow. Devote the last line of your speech to offering one final thank you to everyone in the room., Reading your speech out loud is important because it gives you an idea of what it will actually sound like when your audience hears it. As you read aloud, Make a note of any sections of your speech that sound awkward or confusing. Remove any words or phrases you keep stumbling over or can’t pronounce.Stand in front of a mirror while you read your speech out loud so you can work on your eye contact and facial expressions., Have them sit down while you stand up in front of them and give your speech. Ask for constructive criticism and apply it to your presentation. Keep running through your speech until you’re both confident that it's polished and you’re ready for the event.

If there’s someone mentioned in your speech that can’t attend the event, invite them to practice with you. That way they get to hear your speech and you have someone to give you pointers., Use a camcorder, computer, or your phone. Make sure you’re standing for the recording and set the camera far enough away that it captures your entire body. If you’ll be giving your speech at a podium, find something to use as a podium for the video, like a table or a desk. Watch the recording after you’ve finished and take detailed notes on how you look. Use the notes to improve your presentation.Pay attention to your body language in the recording. Are you standing up straight? Are you moving your hands around nervously? Use the recording to improve your body language so you look more confident giving your speech.
Notice how your voice sounds. Make sure you’re speaking loud enough and that what you’re saying is clear and understandable.

, Read through your speech several times, timing yourself during each run through. If the average time it takes you to get through your speech is longer than the time you've been allotted at the event, edit your speech until it's shorter."

Start with the bigger picture, brainstorming subjects that you are familiar with. For example, write down subjects you've excelled at in school, and activities you've practiced for years. The more information you start with, the easier it will be to write an informative speech.


You'll probably spend a great deal of time on this speech, and may continue to give it or hear about it for years to come. Take the time to come up with a long list, so you have more options to hone in on the speech you'll love to write and deliver.
For instance, if you really like hunting, you're likely to have a lot of interesting and not-at-all obvious things to say about it. You'll still want to do research on more than just your experience hunting. Interesting topics like hunting customs, laws, the kinds of animals you hunt, their behavior and their place in the ecosystem will come from research.;
, Add these topics to your subject areas list.


Say you're interested in becoming a movie producer, but you don't know a lot about what it's like - there's few better ways of learning about it than researching movie production and then explaining it to people.

, You should be able to figure out roughly if you're going to be able to cover your topic in the time allotted. Pick out a specific purpose for your speech to guide your presentation as well as to guide your audience's attention.


Try to make your speech interesting, not just important. Saying very general and important things that everyone already knows can make a speech boring, and can fill up your speech with background details that aren't really specifically what your speech is about. For instance, imagine an informative speech on video game development that went into extreme detail about every last line of rendering, file management and level design that all video games shared in common. Such a speech would be fairly long and probably difficult to listen to, for anyone not deeply involved in video game design.
Be specific with your speech topic. Try to drill down into some interesting details that people might not know about. For example, local Native American hunting customs instead of hunting in general, how it's different producing a zombie movie instead of movie production in general, how video game guilds and clans are organized instead of video game in general.
Your deep knowledge about the details of your topic are what makes your speech cool and interesting. For example: Would you rather listen to a speech about how food is important - or about how to make a certain type of food - say, kimchi tacos or chocolate bacon eclairs? Would you rather learn about how it's really important to drive well, or would you rather learn specific ways that you could drive better, like defensive driving tactics and little steering wheel tricks that few people know about?

, Your thesis is simply a specific statement expressing clearly in a single sentence what exactly you're going to do.


Focus on things that you can feasibly do without too much work. For instance, a speech topic like ""I will explain how to hunt, skin and dress a deer in the traditional respectful Native American style"" might run into problems if you give your informative speech using a dead deer in a classroom setting or if you simply can't find a deer.

, A vague thesis like “I’m going to talk about carburetors” could include a lot of topics - how carburetors function, two versus four barrel carburetors, etc., etc. A clear, specific and even pretty interesting thesis for this topic might instead be ""I am going to explain how to take apart a carburetor"".


Think about teaching people how to do things or how things were done - not just teaching people about things. For instance, just like with carburetors, a statement like “In this speech, you will learn about zippers” is not the best thesis - it sounds very general and obvious. Following that statement, you might reasonably expect anything from someone zipping their pants up and down to an hour-long presentation on the history of zippers - it's hard to tell! More clear, specific examples of a thesis might be ""In this speech, you will learn how the zipper was first invented."" or ""I will explain how the first zombie movies were made and how special effects technology has advanced since then"".

, If there's one rule to writing an informative speech it's this: Know your subject. Do your research with care and integrity, using reliable sources and taking notes as you go.


As you gather your research materials and begin reading, separate the material you'll specifically use in your speech - but also be open to learning more about your subject area that may not be directly related to your thesis. You may need to answer questions about your speech topic. Learning additional background material that you may not think is directly relevant can help you to answer these questions. For example, if your speech is on Native American hunting and someone asks about different Native American hunting traditions besides the local ones, you'll seem a lot more knowledgeable - and will in fact be a lot more knowledgeable - if you cast a wide net with your research.

, Once your research is completed, you may find something new that emerges that you'd rather do your speech on. Rather than ignore that, plan for something like this to happen.


For an informative speech on movie production for zombie movies, for instance, it might emerge during research that you find the actual traditional zombie myth more interesting than the movies. Don't resist the urge to change speech topics - you've done a lot of the research already and you'll give a much more interesting speech if it's a topic you've suddenly discovered is interesting.

, It's a good idea to assume they know little about your topic. (Which is why you’re informing them, right?) With this in mind, however, you might still need to give background information. Be careful about what shortcuts you take in explaining your topic.


Unless your assignment says otherwise, don’t explain anything that’s a given for your audience. Nobody wants to be told what a car steering wheel or a zipper is, after all, and if you're giving a speech on carburetors to, say, a group of auto mechanics, you won’t need to give a lot of background information because they already know the topic well.

, Write a list of the information you think should be included and put it in a logical order.


For how-to informative speeches, include the reasons for what you're doing as well as how you do it. For instance, if your speech is on making kimchi tacos, you should explain why some steps are in a certain sequence - do you add the kimchi last so that the taco doesn't get soggy? For a carburetor speech, why are the screws tightened or loosened in a certain order? This information is important for your audience in learning your topic.
For informative speeches that explain and describe something instead of explaining how to do something, make sure to put your information into a sequence that makes sense. Our local Native American hunting speech, for example, would have to include some basic information on the identity of local Native American tribes before getting into the specific details of hunting traditions.

, Make it interesting and informative by elaborating on your key points.


A common tactic for these speeches, especially when they are given on an impromptu basis, is to come up with the three most important points for a speech and organize them by chronological order, spatial order or order of importance. This process yields a smooth, informative speech in a hurry. For instance, chronological ordering of a Native American speech might start with Native American hunting traditions prior to the arrival of Europeans, the changes to Native American hunting traditions caused by American history, then conclude with the modern state of Native American hunting.

, Your introduction should grab the audience's attention and let them know what direction you’re headed - particularly if it's a long or complicated speech, be sure to lay out what points you intend to cover.


It's very common to begin a speech with an amusing anecdote or an interesting quote relevant to your topic. This can be effective in establishing rapport with the audience, but it can backfire if you choose a cheesy statement or a joke that no one gets or likes. For instance, starting any speech, anywhere, with the joke ""I just flew in from New York... and boy are my arms tired!"" is probably a very bad idea (unless the speech is on bad jokes).

, The conclusion should quickly summarize the main points of your speech.


End your speech with your thesis statement. People are likeliest to remember the first and last things they hear - so to make sure you're getting your message across, it helps to ""front-load"" and ""back-load"" your speech with your important take-home message.
Try to tie your conclusion into the introduction in some way; coming full circle will give your speech a sense of resolution. For example, returning to the first example you used, or returning to the themes or even the specific jokes or phrases you began your speech with can give a nice feeling of ""closing the circle"" to your speech. If your speech on carburetors began with a story about how your car began to malfunction at the worst time possible necessitating carburetor disassembly, for instance, you'll want to conclude your speech by telling your audience how that car repair ended up working out.

, Practice your speech out loud and time yourself. Add or cut out material as necessary. Even if you do not have an assigned time limit for your speech, your ""hard"" time limit is essentially how long you can talk for until people become bored. You will not know this while you're busy giving the speech - so get a good sense of it beforehand.


If your speech is for a forensics or speech event, make sure that it fits within the time limits you are working within. You will get cut off if your speech goes over time - so make sure that it fits. If your speech will not be strictly monitored, don't worry if the speech is a little longer than your self-imposed time limit.

, When you're presenting in front of a group of people, you'll feel like you're going at a glacial pace, even when you're talking quite quickly. To make sure the audience gets the most out of your speech, practice slowing down even more than feels natural.


If you can, videotape yourself and see for yourself how quickly you talk. It can be very eye-opening to think you're speaking slowly when in fact you're rushing through things.
Learn to insert dramatic pauses into your speech. A dramatic pause can hammer home a specific bit of information or offer the audience time for reflection. The best presenters use them sparingly but to great effect.
Be careful about lists of information. If you need to list out a set of ideas of facts, give yourself time to pause after each item in the list., You will probably be a lot more nervous when you give your speech - so get it down as pat as you can.


Practice what will happen if your props malfunction. Being nervous will make it very easy to mess up, so set yourself up for success by making working with your props as automatic and easy as possible for yourself. What happens if you give your speech on carburetors and fumble or mess up your disassembly procedure, or if you suddenly misplace a key ingredient in the middle of a delicate taco-making procedure and be unable to continue? Plan for something to go wrong and you'll be able to recover smoothly and still give a great speech.

If someone else has introduced you, take the time to thank them as well as anyone responsible for organizing the event or inviting you to speak.Keep in mind you may be nervous when you start your speech. Include this in your outline so you won't forget.
If there's anything about you that relates you to your audience, or to the group that organized the event, you want to include that in your brief greeting as well – especially if you didn't have the benefit of an introduction from someone else.
For example, you might say ""Good afternoon. I'm Sally Sunshine, and I've been a volunteer with the Springfield Animal Society for five years. I'm honored they've invited me to speak here today about the importance of spaying or neutering your pets."";
, After telling the audience who you are, the next thing you want to do is grab their attention. This could be a joke, a personal story, or an interesting observation on your topic that doesn't really fit elsewhere in your speech.When choosing your attention-getter, keep your audience in mind. Think about what would grab their attention – not necessarily what you personally find interesting or humorous.
If you're not sure whether your attention-getter will work, try practicing it in front of friends or family members who are similar in age and interests to the people who will be in the audience when you give your speech.
For example, if you're giving a speech on spaying and neutering pets to a group of suburban families, you might open with a humorous reference to the Disney movie ""101 Dalmatians.""

, In this part of your introduction, you'll transition from your attention-getting anecdote into the subject matter of the speech itself. This section should only be a sentence or two.Briefly explain the importance of the topic or issue you'll be discussing in your speech.
If your speech is an informative one, explain why the information is important or relevant to your audience.
For argumentative speeches, explain what might happen if action isn't taken on the issue.
For example, you might say ""Every year, our local animal shelter has to put down 500 unwanted cats and dogs. If all pets were spayed and neutered, it's estimated this number would decrease to under 100.""

, Your thesis statement, broadly, tells the audience the scope of your speech. The structure and content of this statement will vary based on the type of speech you're giving.If you're giving an argumentative speech, your thesis statement will be a statement of the ultimate point you hope to prove through the information and evidence you lay out in your speech.
For example, the thesis statement for a speech arguing that all pet owners should spay or neuter their pets might be ""Our entire community would benefit if all pets were spayed or neutered.""
The thesis statement for a more informative speech will simply summarize the type of information you're going to provide the audience through your speech.
For a more scientific speech, your thesis statement will reflect the hypothesis of the scientific study you're presenting in your speech.

, You've made your point, but now you need to let the audience know why they should listen to you. Credibility doesn't necessarily have to be as formal as a specific degree or years of research – it could be a personal story.If you're giving a speech for a class in school, your ""credibility"" may be as simple as the fact that you took the class and researched the topic.
However, if you have a more personalized interest in the topic of your speech, this is a good time to mention that.
For an argumentative speech, a personal connection to the subject matter can enhance your credibility. For example, maybe you're giving a speech about local urban housing policy and you became interested in the topic when you learned your family was facing eviction. A personal connection often can mean more to members of your audience than extensive professional experience in the area.

, Now that the audience knows what you're going to talk about, why you're going to talk about it, and why they should listen to you, give them a neat summary of the points you're going to make during your speech.There's no hard and fast rule, but speeches typically have three main points. You should list them in your introduction in the order you plan to present them in your speech. The order in which you discuss your points depends on the type of speech you're giving.
For example, your speech on spaying or neutering pets might address the benefits to the pet first, then the benefit to the pet's family, then the benefit to the community at large. This starts small and moves outward.
For an argumentative speech, you typically want to lead with your strongest argument and work down in order of strength.
If you're giving an informative speech based on a historical event, you may want to provide your points chronologically. Other informative speeches may be better served by starting with the broadest point and moving to more narrow points.
Ultimately, you want to order your points in a way that feels natural to you, and will enable you to easily transition from one point to another.

, The outline of the body of your speech will begin with the first point you intend to make in your speech. Write out a smooth transition from your introduction into the body of your speech.Your first point will be a top-level entry on your outline, typically noted by a Roman numeral.
Beneath that top-level, you will have a number of sub-points which are comments, statistics, or other evidence supporting that point. Depending on how your outline is formatted, these typically will be letters or bullet points.

, Beneath your first point, you'll list specific evidence or facts you want to mention in your speech that support the point. This could include dates, statistics, or quotes from sources.As with the points themselves, with your evidence you typically want to start with the strongest or most important sub-point or piece of evidence, and move down. This way, if you start running short on time, you can easily cut the last points without worrying that you're leaving out something important.
The type of evidence or sub-points you'll want to include will depend on the type of speech you're giving.
Try to avoid pounding your audience with long series of numbers or statistics – they typically won't retain the information. If you have a significant amount of numerical data or statistics, creating an infographic you can project during your presentation may be more useful.
Keep in mind that additional personal stories or anecdotes can be particularly effective to get your point across in a speech.
For example, if your first point in your speech about spaying or neutering pets is that the procedure benefits the pets themselves, you might point out that pets that are spayed or neutered live longer, are at a decreased risk for certain types of cancer, and are generally more healthy than pets who aren't spayed or neutered.

, After you've finished all the information you want to include for your first point, go back to the top level and find a smooth way to transition from that point to your second point in a sentence or two.Avoid over-thinking your transition. It really doesn't need to be incredibly sophisticated. If you can't come up with anything specific, using a simple transitional phrase will work fine.
For example, you might say ""Now that I've discussed how spaying and neutering has a positive effect on your pet's health, I want to move to the effect that spaying and neutering has on your family.""
Some of the most effective transitions turn on a particular word or phrase, such as the word ""effect"" in the example above.

, Your outline will look much the same for the remaining two (or more) points you plan to cover in your speech. Start with a top-level outline point that provides a topic sentence of the point, then follow it with three or four lettered or bulleted sub-points of facts in support.When choosing your sub-points or the facts that you want to emphasize in your speech, keep your audience in mind as well as the overall point. Think about what's important to them, or what they potentially would find most surprising or most interesting.

, Now that you've finished the body of your speech, you need an effective transitional sentence that will signal to your audience that you're reaching the end of your speech.This transition doesn't need to be fancy – it doesn't even have to be a whole sentence. You can simply say ""In conclusion,"" and then launch into your summary.

, Speech coaches often describe a speech's organization as ""tell them what you're going to say, say it, then tell them what you said."" Start your conclusion by telling your audience what you told them in your speech.You don't need to go into detail here – you're just reinforcing what you've already told your audience.
Make sure you don't introduce any new information in your closing summary.
For example, you might say ""As you've seen, spaying or neutering your pet has substantial benefits not only for you and your pet, but also for the community at large.""

, This version of your thesis statement should sound more like a conclusion or an ultimate finding than the hypothesis it may have been in your introduction.If your speech went well, you have fully proven your thesis and demonstrated its importance. This statement should relate back to the summary of your points and present a strong statement.
Particularly for brief speeches, you can even combine your summary of points with your thesis statement in a single sentence that wraps up your speech.
For example, you might say ""Given the benefits to your pet's health, to your family, and to the overall well-being of your community, it is clear that spaying or neutering pets should be a top priority for all pet owners.""

, To close out your speech, think of something on the same note as the attention-getter you used to open your speech. It could be an anecdote or a humorous restatement of the importance of the issue.You may want to think of a way to bring the entire speech back around to that story you initially told to grab your audience's attention.
If you have an argumentative or similar speech, your closing lines typically will include a call to action. Give your audience an example of how important the subject of your speech is, and implore them to act on the information you gave them in a specific way.
When making a call to action, make sure you include specific details, such as where to go, who to contact, and when to act.
For example, you might say ""For the next week, the Springfield Animal Society will be spaying and neutering pets for free at their clinic on 123 Main Street. Call 555-555-5555 to make an appointment for your furry friend today!""

, Thanking the audience for listening to you demonstrates that you respect them and value their time. If you were specifically invited to speak by a particular individual or organization, you should also mention them again.


Particularly if your speech was longer or if you went over the time allotted, be sure to tell them that you appreciate their time.
As with your initial greeting, including this in your outline ensures you won't forget it in the moment. That doesn't mean you should try to write something verbatim. Rather, you should focus on your thanks being more off-the-cuff and sincere.

, Speak with the organizers of the event beforehand and find out if you can (or should) invite any questions from the audience about your speech. If you intend to provide time for questions, note this on your outline so you won't forget to mention it at the end of your speech.If you want to establish parameters for the questions, be sure to list these in your outline so you can mention them when you announce that you're open for questions.
You also should note if you only have a specified period of time for questions, or if you're only taking a set number of questions.

Is the purpose to introduce your place and history with your company to a work seminar? Before you write a single thing down, you should have a clear idea about what this speech is meant to accomplish. Write down the purpose of your speech at the top of the page., If the speech is a general introduction of yourself, include things like where you're from, how you ended up here in this group, what your passions and interests are, and what you hope to get out of this event or group. If this is a work-related speech, it would be wise to include things like your own qualifications and important skills, things that bolster your credibility and reason for being there. Ultimately it's up to you to decide what topics and ideas should make up your speech.One method for brainstorming is to create a mind map. You can do this with a paper and pencil, starting by writing your central idea or theme in the middle of the page. Then use lines to connect ideas and points that branch off from this central idea. For a speech about yourself, you might start with a central bubble labeled ""Me"". Then you might have three or four bubbles connected to the central one that say things like ""Interests"", ""Aspirations"", etcetera. Then as you continue branching out the bubbles will get more specific.There are other methods for brainstorming you might find useful. You could try the alphabet method, where you list a few things related to the subject of your speech for each letter, starting with A and working down.Another brainstorming method is the three perspectives method. You think about the subject of the speech in three perspectives. First, describe the subject, which is yourself in this case. Then, trace it. Trace your history, where you came from and where you've come to, and how you've changed over that journey. Finally, map it. Think about who and what has influenced you and how. How do you fit into the bigger picture., First, determine who your audience is. It could be work colleagues, classmates, a hobby group, etcetera. Think about how big the audience will be, what the age range will be like, and why the audience has gathered. Then, think about what your audience is interested in. What is it about you that you think people would want to know? What kind of information are they expecting? Ask yourself these questions and then decide how the answers will inform the content of your speech.It's worth thinking about various aspects of the audience, because this will determine various aspects of your speech, such as its length, its tone, etcetera.
For example, if your audience is a wedding reception, and this is a best man speech, your audience will be most interested in your relationship with the groom and your history with him. You also don't want a speech like this to drag on because the best man isn't the focal point of the event.

, Before you write anything, you need to understand your assignment fully. Look over the guidelines and purpose of the assignment. This will likely tell you how long the speech should be, what ideas need to be included in it, etcetera. For example, a two minute speech is going to be written very differently from a ten minute speech, so knowing what guidelines you're working with will affect the rest of the writing process.The most important difference between a long and a short speech is the amount of detail. A two minute speech in which you introduce yourself to a class will have a short intro that might be just your opening statement. There might be only a paragraph or two in the body of the speech, and the conclusion will probably be only a sentence or two.
A ten to fifteen minute speech will have an introduction that in itself has a beginning, middle, and end, an opening statement, an introduction fo the main points of speech, and a summary of the main theme. The body might consist of four to six paragraphs, and each one will include both explanations of the main points, as well as examples. The conclusion will be a lengthier summary, and might include a sentence or two that ties the theme of the speech into a broader context.

, Before you start writing the main meat of the speech, you'll want to create an outline. With a word processor, or pencil and paper, write ""Introduction,"" ""Body,"" and ""Conclusion."" Then sum up the main points in each section with bullets. You don't even have to use full sentences here. Just get down quick summaries of what each section of your speech will contain.Depending on the length of your speech, you may need to break up the body section into multiple parts, like ""Paragraph 1,"" ""Paragraph 2,"" etcetera.
Speeches two minutes and shorter should have one or two main points, which can probably fit into a single body paragraph.
Speeches between two and five minutes should have two to three main points, given a paragraph each in the body.
Longer speeches, over five minutes, should have up to five main points, given a paragraph each in the body.
At this stage, you should also begin thinking about how your content will be organized. For a speech about yourself, it would make sense to either organize your content chronologically, with each main point being a different period in your history, or topically, with each main point as a different topic related to yourself., Depending on what this speech is for, and who your audience is, you can start your speech in several different ways.


If this is a simple, short speech, meant to introduce you to your class or group, you can start with a basic introduction that includes a brief greeting, your name, and the purpose of the speech. This can look something like ""Good morning everyone! My name is so-and-so and I'd like to take this chance to introduce myself to the group.""
If this speech about yourself is for a more specific purpose than just introducing yourself, you may want to make the introduction a little more entertaining and interesting. You can start with a provocative question, a shocking fact, a joke, or an evocative image. For example, if your speech is about an interesting aspect of your life, like your unusual profession, you can start with something like ""Imagine waking up every morning to sound of safari wildlife in every direction around you.""

, Your introduction should outline what your speech will be about. You should summarize what the body of your speech will include, and why you're giving this speech.


For example, if you're giving a small speech about yourself to your class you can say something like ""First I'll tell you a little bit about my past, and then I'll tell you about some of my interests and aspirations. I'll close with my plans for my career.""

, Depending on the purpose of your speech, the body might be one paragraph or several. If you're using several paragraphs, make sure each paragraph has its own intro, body, and conclusion. For each main point or idea in your speech, a paragraph should be made. And these body paragraphs should start with an introducing sentence on the purpose of the paragraph, the content, and then a summary of the paragraph and its relevance to the speech as a whole.For example, if you're writing an introductory speech for a college organization, like a photography club, you might start the body with a paragraph about how you got interested in photography. The opening sentence might go like ""Photography caught my interest very early on, especially with its ability to caption and preserve life's precious moments."" The closing sentence might look like ""Since then, I've been eagerly pursuing more knowledge on the ins and outs of what makes a photo great.""

, Don't overthink this. The conclusion is just a paragraph summing up your entire speech. Summarize the main points of your speech, and answer any questions from your introduction. But do so in a way that leaves an impression. The conclusion should tie everything together and make the speech more universal.For example, if your speech was about your interest and experience in the film industry, you can tie your own experiences with the idea of cinema on a grand scale. The conclusion should focus on the overarching importance of the topic of your speech.
If your speech is simply to introduce yourself, you can end with a less grand conclusion. The conclusion of a self-introduction speech should reiterate and summarize the most important parts of your speech, the main details about yourself that you shared.

, Some people learn best by example. It can be helpful to look at examples of other speeches when starting your own. Do a search for ""sample self introduction speeches"" to locate some examples of speeches about oneself.

, Since speeches are heard, not read, proofreading for spelling and formatting isn't as important, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be editing. Read back through your speech after you've written. Mark passages and words that you think you could improve. Don't think of the first version as a final draft, but a rough draft.Read your speech out loud as well. This will help you hear the rhythm of the speech and make adjustments to improve its flow. Fragments are okay, as long as they're used sparingly. Use active verbs in favor of passive ones.
When reading your speech out loud to yourself, note any sentences that are too long to be spoken comfortably in one breath. Split these sentences up as you edit.

, In addition to reading through the speech on your own, find someone to read through it for you. It can be helpful to have another set of eyes look over your speech, and look for places where it could use improvement. It's likely that a friend, colleague, teacher, or peer will be able to notice things that you didn't pick up.

, Signposts in speeches allow the audience to easily follow along with your ideas and the movement of your speech. They signal when you move to a new idea, where in the speech you are, whether it's the start, middle, or end, and how two ideas relate to each other.When running through a short list of ideas, numeric signposts are used like ""first,"" ""second,"" and ""third,"" or ""firstly,"" ""secondly,"" and ""thirdly.""
Signposts that show how two ideas relate to each other include, ""furthermore,"" ""in addition,"" ""nevertheless,"" ""however,"" ""subsequently,"" and ""for instance.""
Major signposts tell the listener where in the speech you are. For example, the first paragraph will often start with something like, ""I'd like to start by..."" and the final paragraph will often start with something like ""To summarize...""

, For example, don't say ""In conclusion..."" or ""thank you"" at the end of your speech, just conclude it. Don't start with something like ""Today I'll be talking to you about..."" Find a more interesting way to introduce your topic. Overused phrases like these don't add anything valuable to your speech.What do you replace cliches with? First you have to deduce the basic meaning of the cliche phrase, then you can either think of a more interesting way to say the same thing, or, in many cases, you can forgo the phrase entirely.
For example, the phrase ""in conclusion"" means that you are signaling that you going to summarize all the ideas previously stated. This can be replaced by something like, ""So what does this all mean?"" or ""I've told you a lot about myself. Here's the reason.""
Often, cliche phrases are just filler that don't add anything important to the speech. Instead of saying, ""Today I'll be talking to you about..."" just start talking about it.

",How to Write a Salutatorian Speech," Ask the person in charge of the graduation to tell you about how much time you have, and if there is anything you need to keep in mind. Does your school allow religious sentiments in the speech or does the speech require certain topics? It is a lot easier to write with this in mind than it is to rewrite later.

, Decide on a favorable topic to say to your class, teachers, and parents. Select an important and interesting subject to address to your classmates and people in the audience. This is the broad or general topic--diversity, or ambition, or the importance of Latin and Ancient Greek in everyday life. The topic should be something you have a genuine interest in, not what you feel you are supposed to show interest about.

, Your family and friends want to hear you, at the same time, keep them interested, as well as the strangers who are there to see people you do not know get their diplomas. The opening is where you catch people. You want to make sure it gets their attention. You are the first of the main events at graduation. A whispered, ""I want to talk to you today about the importance of feeding the hungry"" is not going to do. Avoid openings, such as ""I want to talk about..."", unless you are going to make a joke about it. A joke is not a bad way to start, as long as it is in good taste and related to what you mean to say. The most common strong opening is an anecdote, preferably a slightly humorous, or at least light, one. Even if you want to talk about something heavy as you go, open with something that people can relate to, and will make them smile. For example, if you want to talk about the importance of intervention in tragic events in the world, open with a personal story. If your friends are in these stories, ask them first if they are okay with it. Pick something that you will be able to notice again at the end, to tie the speech together. You may want to write the opening and closing both before you write the middle.

, ""When I think about that story, I realize..."" or ""I know, it's funny... but it's not funny when...""

, Avoid first-person references, as in, ""When I was reading about this, I found out that..."" Just say what it is you found out. ""XX% of high school graduates can't read a job application""; ""For hundreds of years, Latin was the single most important study in academia""; ""Even now, while we're celebrating, in , people need help.""

, Give the facts and your suggestions. You did not get to be salutatorian without knowing how to do this part.

, Take the focus back to the graduation once you have finished the meaty part. Relate what you have said to the audience. Name a couple of the people used in your speech.

, If you started with an anecdote, finish with a comment of some sort on it. (Eg, ""You know, after my brother helped me get the cat free..."") The tone should be light, but keep it connected to what you said in between. Finish with a flourish--either something humorous or something profound (but not cliched).

Then, start to whittle down your list to about three to five key points of emphasis — adding healthy food options at lunch, expanding a tutoring program, or working to reduce bullying, perhaps — and think about how they connect to your overall plan as a candidate.;
, From “Tippecanoe and Tyler Too” to “We Like Ike” to “Hope and Change,” Presidential candidates have used (and won with) slogans that can seem simplistic or just plain strange, and yet succeed because they reflect the image the candidate is trying to project.Slogans don’t just fit nicely on campaign signs, they provide a quick glimpse of your personality and your plans.
They can be lighthearted (“The Right Manuel for the Job”) or serious (“Your Voice for Change”), focused on one issue (“Save the Spring Formal”) or aimed more broadly (“Let’s Fly Higher Together”). The slogan should suit you, make people think of you when they hear or see it, and give them an idea of how you’ll serve their interests.
When writing a slogan, avoid negative language. The best slogans are positive and forward-thinking.

, With your grand plans narrowed down to a few solid ideas and your slogan chosen, you can begin to craft the overall message of your speech.


First things first, find out how much time you have to give your speech. School election speeches are often limited to only 1-2 minutes, which is only about 150-250 words.If so, you need to be laser-focused on what you want to say and how you want to say it. You may have to further cut down your campaign ideas to two or three, or maybe even just one for the speech.
Even if you don’t have a short time limit, people rarely complain that speeches are too short. Don’t waste time on unreasonable promises, unnecessary details, or anything else that detracts from the directness of your message.
Establish the need you see, what you believe can be done to address it, and why you are the person to do it., If you are the class clown, make your speech fun. If you are naturally quiet and reserved, talk about how you “speak softly but carry a lot of big ideas.” Be the candidate you are, not the candidate you think others think you should be.You might just assume that the popular kids win all the school elections, but often it is the person who seems most genuinely interested in doing the job who earns the most votes. It is easier to express that enthusiasm when being true to who you are.

, With all the focus here on writing a speech, it can be easy to forget that your speech is meant to be heard, not read. As you begin pulling together your ideas and writing the speech, remember that how it looks on the page is far less important than how it presents on the stage as a statement on you-as-candidate.


Your English teacher won’t be grading your speech text, so utilize a more conversational tone and worry less about grammar rules. Use short sentences and even sentence fragments to keep your message fresh and clear throughout the speech.You need to build a rapport, a sense of connection, with the audience very quickly and hold it throughout the speech. Slogans and simply-stated goals suit this need, and so too does a speech that doesn’t lose the audience along the way with long or complicated sentences, jargon, or unnecessary asides.

, Within the first handful of seconds of your candidate speech, you want everyone listening to know who you are, what you are running for, and why. You can win over or lose the interest of an audience very quickly based upon how you begin your speech. Give a few details about why you're the right person for the position. This doesn't have to be your whole resume, but a solid detail or two about your past responsibilities or personal traits will help you ""sell"" yourself as the right candidate.Plant your slogan in this introduction. Make them associate that phrase with you and the plans you are about to lay out in the body of the speech.
Something as simple as “Hi. I’m Jane Thomas, and I want to be your class president because I am dedicated to ‘Making Butler High Better Together’” can work.
Or, if better suited to your personality: “Some people say that Leon Lawson is too wild and not serious enough to be vice-president. Well, I am Leon Lawson, and I say that I’m ‘Seriously Wild’ about shaking things up in our student government.”

, While there are likely dozens of causes you’d like to champion and things you’d like to change, remember that time is short and you need to establish a quick, clear, relatable connection with your voting audience. By targeting in on one or at most a couple of main issues, you can explain why the issue is of importance to everyone.This is one of your chances to build a rapport with your audience. You want them to feel like all of you are on the same page, facing the same issues, and seeking solutions together.
For instance: “Bullying is an epidemic at Adams High School. Odds are that you have been bullied, seen someone being bullied, or even been a bully yourself. We can all do better.”
When stating the issue, avoid mudslinging or negative comments aimed at a particular person or group. Even when you're talking about something you want to change, keep your comments framed positively. This will reflect well on your candidacy and encourage others to see you as someone dedicated to fixing issues, not blaming others for them.

, Politicians always seem to promise more than they can ever possibly deliver, and you probably won’t be able to accomplish everything you think or say you can either. But, by sticking to a short list of items that seem realistic and relate to your major point(s) of emphasis, you can build confidence in your ability to deliver on your promises.If you’re running for re-election or have held a different office, talk about a few things you have done and a few you will do. Make it clear how they all link together. For example, ""As my time as President of Spanish Club shows, I can manage a team of people to achieve common goals. I will use this experience in pursuing change at our school.""
Make your actions sound active. Use active verbs to describe what you have done/will do. Some examples include: “pursue,” “follow,” “take up,” “initiate,” “present,” “represent,” “create,” “build,” and “lead.”, In two minutes, or whatever short time you have to make your speech, you only really have time to identify (yourself and your cause), briefly explain (your plans), and reiterate (both).Go back to your slogan somewhere in the brief conclusion. Such repetition can help tie everything together.
For example: “We all know that there are too many cliques and factions that divide us as students here at West Branch High. This Friday, please consider voting for me, Ben Davis, for student council. I’ll make it my number one job to bring all West Branch Eagles together so we can ‘Fly High as One.’”

, This is partly a function of delivering a short speech that cannot possibly cover all your ideas and goals. But it also means that you’ve inspired the audience members to think about their own ideas for addressing your shared concerns, and to feel an interest in speaking with you about it.


Consider, perhaps, a simple sentence near the end along the lines of: “I have several additional ideas for ways to bring back more Tiger pride to our school, and I would love to hear your ideas as well.”

, Once you’ve written your speech, you need to make sure that you know it inside and out. Without a strong delivery, even the best-written speech will be a dud.Practice in front of a mirror, in front of your cat, and in front of anyone who will listen. Record yourself and play it back to get a better sense of your tone and pace.
If permitted, practice giving the speech in the location where you will present the real one. Get a feel for the room and the podium so you’ll be that much more comfortable come speech day., Audience members want to feel as though you are speaking directly to them, not reading from a sheet of paper. Without general eye contact, it is hard to establish any sort of connection with the audience.Practice your speech often enough that you only need to have some notes for reference. Look down only occasionally, as needed, and practice looking around the room. You don’t necessarily have to make direct eye contact with anyone, just make it seem as though you are.
You also, however, don’t want to sound as though you have simply memorized every word of your speech and are now regurgitating it. You want to know the speech, not just the words, so that you can seamlessly adjust to a misstated phrase or an unexpected opportunity during the speech.

, Yes, you probably want to comb your hair and put on some nice clothes, but this also means displaying an air of confidence. Think about and practice how you will walk on stage, stand at the podium, provide the right facial expression, etc.


You want to be “real,” to look and act like the fellow student the audience knows — maybe just an extra-polished, comfortable, and confident version of your “real” self.

, Accept that you are going to be nervous, no matter how great the speech you’ve written and how prepared you are to present it. Accept also that it will all be over before you know it and that a few imperfections here or there won’t necessarily sink your election chances.


Rely on whatever relaxation techniques work for you to get ready for your performance. If that means employing the old trick of imagining the audience naked, go for it — maybe just watch who you tell about having used it!

Ask for the speaker’s approval.",How to Write a Speech for Someone Else," If this is a close friend, you should already have a good feel for their personality, values, and beliefs. If not, interview the person to learn more about them and to research and detect their speech patterns. You don’t have to become close with the client, but knowing the basics about them will help you write a quality speech. , This information will probably not end up in the speech, but it helps you understand what stirs the speaker's heart and what made them who they are today. Ask about where they grew up, what led them to the position they are in today, and what they are passionate about. You will probably not use most of this information in the speech, but it will help make the voice stronger., Note specific phrases or words they use, as well as where they place the emphasis in sentences. You will want to mimic these things when you ghostwrite the speech. Ask for their permission to make a recording of their voice so that you can use it during the writing process.


Note words and phrases that are repeated as they speak.

, Decide what you will do on your own, versus working with your friend or client. Some ghostwriters start with drafts written by the speaker. Other ghostwriters write the entire speech.Make sure the speaker is aware of how much work they are responsible for.

, See if the speaker has a personal relationship with the group they will be addressing, or if this is a group of strangers. Identify their backgrounds, values, family situations, and anything else that will help you tailor the speech to this particular group. Presenting a speech to a small group of colleagues is different than giving a speech to a large auditorium full of people. It affects how fast the speaker can talk, the volume at which he must talk, if he needs to hold a microphone or not, and how much lighting will be available.

, This provides the basic material for the speech. It’s important that you know their viewpoint and beliefs about the situation. During the conversation, identify the goal of the speech. Know what the speaker hopes to accomplish.Big ideas and main points provide the basic structure of the speech. Understand exactly what the speaker wants to communicate so you can make these points clear.

, Find out how long it needs to be, where it will be given, who the speaker will be addressing, and any other relevant details. As you ghostwrite, keep these details in mind. Straying from the necessary components of the speech can make the client unhappy with the turnout of your work., Examples or stories will help flesh out the main points. Ask for personal stories or examples the speaker would be willing to share with an audience. Also try to identify examples with which the audience would connect.For example, if it is a commencement speech, ask the speaker about their experience in school and getting out into the “real” world for the first time.
Make sure the stories connect well with the subject and main point of the speech.

, For some speeches, you will need to learn more about the topic. Take the time to research it, to learn the language associated with it, and understand the facts. Not everything you read will make it into the speech, but it creates a solid foundation for you to build on. You don’t have to become an expert on the subject, but having a basic understanding will help you write a more convincing speech., Practice basic speech presentation skills as you ghostwrite. The speech should be memorable and easy to follow along. Most importantly, it needs to be a reflection of the speaker, not you. Some points to remember while writing the speech are:Get the audience's attention quickly. This can be done by stating a surprising fact or starting out with a humorous or interesting story.
Keep the speech organized. Use transitions and guiding words like ""first,"" ""second,"" and ""finally.""
Use rhetorical devices, like examples, alliteration, imagery, and questions. Balance facts with examples.
Reflect the person's speaking style. Never fall into your voice during the writing process. Mimic their language, phrasing, and emphasis.

, It is good to use stories and facts in the speech, but make sure they support the main idea. The speech should not stray so far from the main idea that the audience forgets what the speech is about. Use repetition to instill the main points you want your audience to remember into their minds., Stay well within the time limit that the speaker gave you. The speech should not be much longer or shorter than it is supposed to be. Consider how fast the speaker will be talking, and practice the speech aloud to test the time.


Limit the amount of information you include. The audience will only remember so much information.

, The person giving the speech needs to be on board with what you wrote. If there is anything they do not agree with or that does not seem natural for them, work with them to make it right. Don’t be discouraged if it does not get approved the first or second time. It is normal for the speech to go through a few drafts before it is finalized., Ghostwriting involves hiring a writer to write material for another person. The ghostwriter gets no or partial credit, and the person who performs the ghostwritten speech gets the main credit. The point of using a ghostwriter is to help someone communicate clearly and effectively who otherwise doesn't have the time to write his own speech. Another reason for ghostwriting is a person may not be as skilled or talented at writing a speech as the writer they contract to help them is.You can learn more about ghostwriting by looking up books on ghostwriting in your local library, researching articles about ghostwriting online, and by looking for famous examples of ghostwriting.
A few examples of famously ghostwritten speeches are John F. Kennedy’s inauguration speech, Reagan’s “Boys of Pointe du Hoc” speech, and drafts of Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous speech “I Have a Dream.”

, People who write a speech for someone else must determine where the boundaries are. Some people feel that ghostwriting is entirely unethical and should not be done. Decide what ghostwriting you will or will not do for a friend or client. Also identify situations where you believe people should write their own speech, or when you believe it's a viable reason to have someone else write it. Knowing where you stand on the ethics of speech writing will make it easier to accept or decline requests for your writing services.Ghostwriting in the academic arena is often viewed as plagiarism. Others feel that it is okay under certain circumstances, like when politicians, business leaders, or celebrities must present multiple speeches a day, on top of their other responsibilities.

, There should be a partnership between the writer and speaker. When you write a speech for someone else, there is usually a strong partnership with the speaker. The speaker often provides the topic and main points for the speech, then the two must work together to create a strong speech.Writing a speech for someone you find difficult to get along with is most likely not a good idea. You can write a speech for a person that has different ideas than you, as long as you find it possible to keep your ideas to yourself.

, The speaker must approve the speech. The speaker approves the speech before presenting it. Several rewrites may be necessary before an agreement is made for a completed speech. The speaker works with the speech writer to make sure it is written in a way that is natural for them.The ghostwriter must learn to adopt a range of voices outside of their own.

,How to Write a Rehearsal Dinner Speech1,
"
Use a letterhead.,
Begin with the appropriate salutation.,
Confirm details of the arrangement made in the first paragraph.,
Address other details.,
Ask for a follow up if needed.,
Close the letter with a thank you to the recipient.,
Proofread the confirmation letter.,
Use appropriate paper on a quality printer.,
Use a standard font and margins.,
Be brief and to the point.,
Keep the tone business-like.,
Know when to send a confirmation letter.",How to Write a Confirmation Letter," Confirmation letters should be written on letterhead if the confirmation letter deals with business matters. This makes the letter a formal and official company document. Right above the salutation, include the full name and address of the recipient of the letter. This includes the name of the person you are writing the letter to, their proper title, the department they are in or the company they work for (if applicable), and the address for the company.


If it is a personal matter, or you are personally responding to a company, then set the paper up with the proper business format. Place your return address and the date in the left hand margin, or you can align it along the right hand margin. Skip a line, then include the address of the letter's recipient along the left hand margin. , When sending a confirmation letter, you should use the proper salutation and the person's name and title. The generally accepted format is Dear Mr./Mrs./Ms./Dr. followed by the person's last name.


Don't refer to someone as Mrs. unless you know she is married.
If you are writing a more informal, personal confirmation letter, you can use the person's first name.

, Get straight to the point in a confirmation letter. There is no need for any introductory information or pleasantries. Instead, use the first paragraph to outline specifically the details of what you are confirming. This might include dates, times, and location. Be specific.


Some common ways to start these paragraphs are: I am writing to confirm…., I would like to confirm…., or This letter is to confirm...,If you are sending a confirmation of items received, state that in the first paragraph. Be specific by stating exactly what the item is, the number of items, and the order number. Start the paragraph with the following: I am happy to confirm or I was pleased to receive.


, Either in the same paragraph or a brief second paragraph, mention any other details that might be relevant. This can include monetary agreements, terms and conditions, or anything else that might need to be confirmed. These details can also be responsibilities for specific tasks or remaining tasks to be completed.


You should always restate the agreed terms and conditions to make sure there are no misunderstandings with what has been agreed upon. Repeating the agreed upon terms also helps you clarify what is expected of you.
If you are requesting someone take responsibility for a task, suggest that they confirm with you whether that arrangement is agreeable. You could indicate that you require this in writing, through a phone call, or email.
Confirmation letters are not only to confirm an appointment, agreement, or receipt of items for both sides, but they also serve as a paper trail. Confirmation letters are documents for both parties that serve as proof of the correspondence. This helps cover both sides in case a problem or misunderstanding arises., The last paragraph should include a line that encourages the recipient to contact you if they need to. Tell them to let you know if there are any issues, like clarification, misunderstandings, or problems.


These sentences can read as follows: Please inform me if you need additional information... or Please respond if you need to add..., Make sure to close the letter properly. Use a term such as Sincerely, Thank you, Regards, or Respectfully. Include your name typed and place your signature above that. Use your full name for business letters.

, Before sending any formal document, even about a personal matter, you should proofread the letter. This is especially important if the letter is related to a business arrangement. Look for spelling errors, missing words, incorrect grammar, punctuation errors, or other surface problems.


Sending a polished letter makes you look responsible and professional with an eye for detail.

, When printing out a letter from a business, use company stationary that includes the letterhead. If you are not affiliated with a business and have no stationary, print out the letter on high quality paper. Make sure to print the letter from a good printer that isn't running out of ink or toner.


Always print out confirmation letters if you are not e-mailing them. You should never hand write a business letter.

, When writing any formal letter, use a standard font like Times New Roman or Arial. The font should be size 12 and not bold, italicized, or underlined. The margins should be 1 inch on each side.


For formal letters like a confirmation letter, you should use block formatting. This means the letter is single-spaced, you skip a line between paragraphs, and do not indent.

, Confirmation letters are short letters. You want to keep them short and eliminate any unneeded words, phrases, and information.Keep the content of the letter strictly about the details you are confirming.

, Because most confirmation letters are brief in nature, their tone is very formal and impersonal. This helps keep the focus on the details being confirmed and lessens unnecessary pleasantries.If you are writing a personal confirmation letter, a letter to an acquaintance, or someone who you have a slightly more informal relationship with, you can be a bit more personable. However, if you are unsure, keep it formal.
Although you want to keep it formal, it is okay to show your gratitude or enthusiasm. For example, if you have been scheduled for a job interview, you can reply back and say, I appreciate this opportunity to interview for the position... or I am really looking forward to interviewing for the position...


, There are multiple reasons why you would send a confirmation letter. Confirming the dates of appointments, meetings, interviews, conferences, or other events are common reasons people send confirmation meetings. Other common situations where you might send a confirmation letter include:


Offer of employment
Job acceptance
Receipt of an order
Employment status
Travel arrangements
Authorization of another person
Attendance"
"
Prepare your speech well in advance.,
Include a sentence to introduce yourself.,
Express appreciation.,
Be sensitive to your audience.,
Create a catchy opening.,
Choose final words that will leave an impression.",How to Write a Rehearsal Dinner Speech2," Few people can prepare elegant remarks when they've scribbled a speech onto a dinner napkin. Bring an index card or a piece of paper containing an outline of what you'd like to say. Alternatively, you can prepare an outline on your tablet or smartphone.

, While most present at the dinner may know you, not everyone will. Also, explain your relationship to the bride and groom in your introduction.

, Let the audience know that you are pleased to have been asked to make a speech.

, For example, do not provide inappropriate details from the bachelor party while the bride is present. Make sure that your remarks are appropriate for all wedding guests to hear.

, Provide a funny story about how the bride and groom met or a quote from the bride and groom's favorite song.

, A memorable quote about the beauty of marriage is always a good choice for an ending to your speech. You can use a variety of resources both online and in the bookstore to find an appropriate quote.

"
"
Practice your speech before delivering it publicly.,
Choose the right moment to present your speech.,
Speak slowly and clearly.,
Allow yourself to become emotional if you feel overwhelmed during the course of your speech.",How to Write a Rehearsal Dinner Speech3," Track your time to make sure that your speech isn't too long-winded.

, One appropriate choice would be to deliver your speech between dinner courses.

, Also, speak loudly so that everyone in the audience can understand the words that you've worked so hard to prepare.

, A speech that sounds flat and robotic isn't enjoyable and doesn't sound heartfelt.

"
Acknowledge the loss.,
Offer a heartfelt condolence.,
Say nice things about the deceased.,
Suggest ways that the deceased can be memorialized.,
Volunteer your assistance.,
Avoid saying the wrong things.,
End the letter with something thoughtful.",How to Write a Consolation Letter1," Acknowledging that the deceased has passed away is an important component of any condolence letter. Be sure to mention the deceased by name, and express what a loss their passing is.Mention how you heard about the deceased's passing, even if it was from the person you're writing to.
You can use this part of the letter to express any shock or grief you felt at learning of the deceased's passing.
For example, you might say something like, ""I was shocked when I heard from Michael that Bob had passed away. He was so young, and it really took me by surprise."";
, Offering condolence is an essential part of any consolation letter for someone grieving a loss. Make sure you express your condolences sincerely and succinctly. Don't linger on expressing your sorrow, since it's not about how you feel, but don't rush through it either - about one or two sentences should suffice.Aim to spend one to two sentences expressing condolences.
Be genuine in expressing your condolences. You should also be honest, which may include acknowledging the cause of death of the deceased.
Try to relate to the bereaved's sorrow if it's someone you know. Letting them know that you're also saddened by the loss may be comforting to hear.
For someone you know well, say something like, ""I'm so shaken up by Bob's battle with cancer. He's the same age as me, and I find myself thinking it's just not fair that he died so young.""
For someone you don't know well, keep your condolences brief. Try something like, ""I'm thinking of you and your family during this difficult time, and I'd like to offer my sincerest sympathy for what you're going through.""

, It can be comforting for a grieving individual to hear nice things about the person who has passed away. Not only does it help that person to remember the good times, it also lets them know that other people saw the deceased the same way they did.You may want to share specific memories that you feel illustrate the deceased at their best, whether they're funny anecdotes or stories that show them being compassionate and kind.
You should also talk about the unique and lovable characteristics of the deceased. Mention how the deceased was kind, funny, smart, etc.

, Depending on how well you know the bereaved and the deceased, you may want to offer suggestions on how to memorialize the departed individual. There are many ways to memorialize someone, so it might be best to offer a few suggestions instead of insisting that any one way would be more appropriate.Planting trees, building a memorial (including a plaque or a bench), or having a ""remembrance gathering"" are all great ways to memorialize someone who has passed away.
Writing about the deceased can also be extremely helpful. Let the bereaved know that you'd love to read more about the person who passed, and encourage that individual to write about the deceased.

, Someone who is grieving a loss will probably be going through a lot of emotional pain, and may not be taking good care of himself or herself during that time. It's somewhat expected that if you offer consolation to a grieving person, you will offer some type of assistance or support as well (even if it's just offering an ear to listen or a shoulder to cry on).Many grieving individuals who need help may be reluctant to ask for help with anything, even if you encourage that person to let you know if there's anything you can do.Offer specific assistance to the bereaved. For example, you might offer to take care of grocery shopping, running errands, picking up the kids from school, or sending out letters to family members.
Make specific plans. Let the bereaved know you'll be over on a given day at a given time to help out.

, Though you might mean the things you say in a warm and consoling way, certain phrases and terms may be misread by someone who is grieving. When you write a consolation letter, try to avoid saying anything that could inadvertently diminish the way the grieving person feels.


Never say that everything happens for a reason. This can sound cruel and hurtful to someone who is mourning.
Similarly, avoid platitudes like ""God never gives you more than you can handle."" The grieving person will be feeling overwhelmed and may not respond well to a message like that.
Resist the urge to compare the grieving person's pain to a situation you've been in. Saying ""I know just how you feel,"" for example, assumes that you know exactly how that person feels.

, It's considered good form to end a condolence letter with some type of thoughtful phrase. This should reflect the tone and feel of the entire letter, and it should also wrap things up with some type of compassionate well-wishing.Some common thoughtful phrases that are appropriate for ending a condolence letter include:


""My respects, today and always""
""Keeping you and yours in my thoughts""
""You have my deepest sympathies, as well as my friendship""

"
Find an appropriate card.,
Consider writing on a blank card.,
Write your letter on nice paper.,
Write with a pen.,
Start with your message of sympathy.,
Share a memory.,
Acknowledge importance.,
Avoid platitudes.,
Offer your support.,
Close with warm thoughts.,
Mail the letter promptly.,
Find out the address on your own.,
Make a donation.,
Deliver your letter in person.",How to Write a Condolence Letter," Every store that sells greeting cards (grocery stores, drug stores, or gift shops) will likely have a section for sympathy cards. Look in this section first.


Pick out a card you think the recipient would appreciate the most. Cards are often organized by how the recipient is related to the deceased. For example, if the recipient’s mother has died, look for cards labeled “Sympathy-Mother.” You do not have to pick out a card that specifically mentions a mother on it; however, you should make sure it doesn’t mention another relative.
Read the message on the front and inside of the card to determine if it is appropriate. Is it a card that you are comfortable sending and that you think the recipient would appreciate? For example, if one or both of you is not religious, you may want to avoid the cards with religious overtones.
When in doubt, a simple sympathy card that expresses your condolences and wishes for peace and comfort is just fine.;
, You might not find a sympathy card that you like or you feel is appropriate for the recipient. You may find the language on the card to be too flowery or religious or not appropriate to the situation.


For example, if the recipient had a bad relationship with her deceased father, it might be hard to find a card that acknowledges the complicated feelings around her loss. In that case, it may be better to write your letter on a blank card.
Most stores sell a wide variety of blank cards with different pictures on the front. Make sure you select a card with an appropriate picture for a condolence letter, like a nature scene or flowers.
Avoid cards with lighthearted pictures, like those with animals or babies.

, If you don’t have time to buy a card or don’t want to, you can write a letter. You can use stationery (letter-writing paper, often with designs on it) or some higher-quality printer or resume paper.


Do not rip something out of a notebook or use the scratch paper you write reminders to yourself on. You want to show the recipient that you took some time into writing the letter, and the paper you use helps convey that thoughtfulness.
You can use blank notecards you may keep for thank you notes (as long as they don’t say “thank you” on them).

, Get a pen you like to write with and that makes your handwriting look good. Be careful that the ink doesn’t smear.


Be careful if using markers. Some fine-point markers are okay, but thicker markers may bleed, making the letter harder to read.
Do not write in pencil, as pencil has a tendency to fade and rub away.
Make sure you write neatly. Print if that makes your writing more legible. You want the recipient to be able to read your thoughts.
You can type out your letter if you prefer (or if your handwriting is illegible), but this is less personal. If you go this route, make sure you at least sign your name, and maybe add a brief, handwritten sentence or two at the bottom of the letter.

, This is not a time to write “How are you?” or “I was at the grocery store today and figured I’d pick up a card.” Begin with your condolences. Acknowledge how the recipient was related or connected to the person.


For example, you could write, “Dear Lucy, I was so sorry to hear about the loss of your grandpa” or “Carlos, I am sending you my deepest condolences on the passing of your best friend.”
It is not usually appropriate to indicate the manner of the deceased’s passing. You do not want to say, “I am so sorry to hear that your aunt died of cancer.” The recipient knows how the person died. This is especially true in cases of murder, suicide, or accidents. In this case, you could acknowledge the magnitude of the loss as “tragic” or “sudden.”
If you are struggling to start the letter, you might look at some sample sympathy messages online to help.

, If you knew the person who died, make sure you share a memory with the recipient. These stories will be precious to them.If you do not have a memory to share, it is okay to skip this step.


Do not feel like you need to recount a big story, or that if you only knew the person casually you have nothing to share. A simple story, or a recollection of how the person made you feel, will suffice.
You can say, “I remember seeing your dad every morning on his way to work, always carrying the same leather briefcase.” It matters to the survivors of the deceased to know that their loved one made an impact on others, even in a small way.Make sure the story you share is a pleasant memory. Do not write about the time you got into a fight, or how you always thought he was a jerk. As the saying goes, if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say it.

, If you don’t have any stories to share of the deceased, you can acknowledge the impact the deceased had on the recipient’s life. This doesn’t have to be long, a sentence or two is fine.


For example, you could say, “I remember the picture of your grandma you kept on your desk. I know she meant a lot to you.”
You could also say, “You always laughed when you told stories about your brother. He must have been quite the character!”
You can also state how much the deceased loved the recipient. You can say, ""I know your mother was always so proud of you over the years.""

, People want to try to make the grieving person feel better, and often say things meant to cheer the person up. These statements rarely do anything but annoy the bereaved. Avoid writing:


“He is in a better place now.”No, the better place is here, still alive, with his loved ones.
“Heaven gained another angel” or “God needed her there more than we needed her here.” This can make the bereaved person feel like God is pretty unfair, taking an important person in their life away.
“I know how you feel.”Even if you have experienced an awful loss yourself, you still do not know how this individual feels about this particular person’s passing. Everyone’s grief is different. Avoid giving advice or sharing your own experience unless asked.

, Let the person know how you will be there for them. Maybe you can be an emotional support and be a shoulder for them to cry on, or maybe you would be willing to help them out in a practical way.Never say “Let me know how I can help.” While it is well-intentioned, most people are not comfortable with reaching out for help. Take some of the burden off the bereaved and reach out to them instead.You could write, “I will call you next week to check in on you.” Remember that the recipient may not want to talk much while they are grieving, but you should still keep reaching out periodically so that they know you are there for them.
If you live nearby, consider offering to bring a meal, or do a chore around the house if possible. If you are very close, you can offer to sleep over to help them at night. Try writing, “I would love to help you out around the house with anything you need done. I’ll call next week to see if you need anything.”
If you don't live nearby, you can offer to hire a service to clean their house for them or a gardener to do yard work while they are grieving.
It’s okay to skip this step if you are not particularly close to the recipient (for example, if this person is a work colleague or a friend’s parent).

, Let the recipient know that they, along with the rest of their family, will be in your thoughts (and prayers, if you are spiritual) during this difficult time. Sign the card with any closing you are comfortable with, like “Love,” “Sincerely,” or “Thinking of you.”


You can end the letter with a note of optimism or positivity, such as ""While this is a difficult time, it will get better with time, and we are always here for you when you need it."" Do not begin the letter this way, or it may seem as though you are minimizing their feelings.
Make sure you sign or print your name legibly, so the recipient knows who sent it.

, Let the recipient know you are thinking of them during a stressful time. It will mean a lot to them to know you are supporting them, particularly if you cannot attend the funeral.


Mailing a letter late is better than not mailing it at all, however, and it is still thoughtful to send your condolences a month or two after the death.

, Do not bother the recipient during this busy time with questions about their address or funeral arrangements. Get it from a mutual friend or through social media.


If you cannot find the address, use the deceased’s obituary to find the funeral home making arrangements. You can send your letter there, and the funeral home will get it to the deceased’s family.
If all else fails, you can always send an email or note through social media. Make this your last resort, however, as it is meaningful to the bereaved to get a handwritten note.

, Consider donating to the family’s charity of choice, or sending a gift or flowers, to the recipient along with your letter. There is no obligation to do this, but it can be a nice touch.


You will likely find the famly's preferred charity listed in the obituary.
Gifts of food are generally appreciated for funerals, where lots of people will likely be gathering together. But check to see what is needed first.Supplies such as paper plates, towels, plastic eating utensils, tissues, and trash bags may be appreciated if they are hosting guests for the funeral.

, If you can, make arrangements to attend the funeral service, or wake/viewing. Funerals are for the survivors, not the deceased, and it will matter tremendously to the person you care about that you made the effort to show up. There is usually a basket for cards at a wake or service.


Do not feel like you need to talk to all of the family members. Just say hello to the person or people you know, say how sorry you are for your loss, and stay for a few minutes or as long as you like.
It is okay if you can’t think of anything to say. Remember that a simple “I’m so sorry” is always best. Give the person a hug if you are comfortable.

Determine if the action is against company policy.,
Consider how serious the problem is.,
Determine if the incident was isolated or repeating.,
Understand the reputation of your company's HR department.",How to Write a Complaint Letter to Human Resources," All companies have different policies, so it's best to look at your manual to determine who you need to send the letter to and what format it needs to be in.


Some companies have special forms that you need to fill out in order to submit a complaint.;
, In order to write an effective letter, you must be concise and stick to the facts. Be sure to fully explain the reason for your complaint in as much detail as you can.Avoid using vague or subjective terms like ""jerk"" or ""unfair."" Instead, explain the specific actions that make you think this way. For example, instead of saying, ""Jane is nicer to other employees than she is to me,"" consider saying something like, ""Jane has rejected all of my requests for vacation this year, but has approved requests made by everyone else in the department.""
If you believe you are being subjected to a specific type of discrimination or harassment, use this language and describe exactly how you are being discriminated against or harassed.
Do not get off topic and begin complaining about unrelated issues. If you start bringing up petty grievances, it may diminish the effect of your entire letter.

, In addition to explaining the nature of your complaint in detail, you should also back up your claim with as much evidence as possible. If you have proof of the conduct that you are complaining about, include it. If you do not have proof, include as many specific examples of the conduct as you can.When detailing specific examples of the behavior you are complaining about, include the dates on which the incidents occurred. For example, if you are complaining about a coworker threatening, you may say something like, ""On Friday, April 8, John told me, 'If you don't get this done in the next five minutes, I'll smash your face in.'""
If you have physical evidence of the behavior, such as an email, include it with you letter. If you have evidence that cannot be included with a letter, such as a voicemail, let the HR representative know that it exists.

, Once you have finished explaining the reason for your complaint, you should let the HR representative know what you expect them to do about the incident. If there are specific consequences listed in the employee handbook, you may use these a reference.The outcome you request should be reasonable and related to your complaint. For example, if you are complaining because there is a leaky ceiling in the office, you might say something like, ""I would like you to send someone to repair the ceiling as soon as possible.""
Depending on the specific incident you are reporting, you may or may not have a specific outcome in mind. If you don't, it's fine to simply state that you would like HR to look into the incident and address it accordingly. You may also choose to request a meeting with the HR representative and/or the person you are complaining about to discuss the incident.

, It's best to avoid confrontational language when writing your complaint letter, even if you are very upset. Being cordial will increase your chances of getting an appropriate response from the HR department.Be polite by using words like ""please"" and ""thank you.""
Don't use profanity or insults of any kind.
Even if you feel like venting in your letter, control yourself and find a nicer way of expressing yourself. For example, if you want to say, ""Bob is a terrible boss and the company is stupid for hiring him,"" consider saying something like, ""While I have great respect for Bob, I feel that management should review his efficacy as a leader.""

, Whenever you write a letter, it's a good idea to stick to a professional format. This not only makes your letter look more serious, but it also ensures that the reader will have your contact information.Your name and contact information, as well as the date, should appear in the upper right-hand corner of the letter.
The recipient's name and address should appear on the left side of the page, above the main body of the letter, but below the date.
Address the letter by name if you know exactly who you are sending it to. If you are not sure who will be reading the letter, address it to a generic title like ""HR Representative.""
Sign your letter at the bottom and include a salutation such as ""Sincerely"" or ""Best.""
If you HR department does not know who you are, include information about your job title, department, and office location in the beginning of your letter. You may need to include information about the person you are complaining about as well.
A typed letter is much more presentable than a hand-written one.

, Depending on the nature of your complaint, it may be a good idea to consult with a lawyer who specializes in employment issues before you send your letter. If you do, be sure to mention in your letter that you have legal representation. This will let the HR representative know that you are serious about pursuing the issue.Your lawyer can also advise you about what you should and should not include in your letter, so be sure to show it to him before you send it.

, When you send your letter by email, you will automatically have proof that you sent it. If the HR representatives fail to respond to your letter and you need to take your complaint to a higher level, this can be very useful.If you send it from a work email address, it's a good idea to send a copy to your personal email address, just in case you are terminated and need evidence of the complaint.
If you can't email your letter, consider either sending it by Certified Mail or emailing the HR representative to confirm that your letter was received.

, Complaining about your boss is probably one of the most delicate issues you can encounter at the workplace. Be absolutely sure that you have a sound reason for complaining about your boss and that you are willing to deal with the potential consequences of filing a complaint before you do so.When writing your letter, try to make sure that it doesn't sound like you are complaining about your boss because he makes you do your job or holds you to high standards. For example, if you boss threatens employees to meet deadlines, consider saying, ""Jill has been using inappropriate language and making her employees feel unsafe,"" instead of ""Jill always yells at us when we don't get our work done.""
Think carefully about what outcome you expect from this kind of letter. If the offense is not likely to get your boss fired, you might consider asking HR to move you to another team, for example.

, While you should not write a complaint letter to HR to resolve a petty dispute with a coworker, there are certain circumstances under which you may have to formally complain about someone. If a fellow employee is behaving in a way that is unsafe, inappropriate, or destructive to the work environment, you should not hesitate to file a complaint.Consider reporting the problem to the employee's boss before writing a complaint letter to HR.
Provide as much proof as you can about the employee's conduct. If you don't have any evidence, be sure to keep a log of incidents and include this with your letter.
If you are complaining about a subordinate, be sure to include documentation of the various disciplinary measures you have already taken to try to resolve the issue.

, If you notice any kind of hazard in your workplace that has the potential to cause harm to you or your coworkers, you should report the condition. Depending on the structure of your company, it may be best to go straight to HR, or it may be more appropriate to report the condition to another employee first.If it is possible that the company is unaware of the safety hazard, it is important that you notify them in writing as soon as possible.
If you previously reported the incident, include relevant information about this in your letter, including when you reported it, who you reported it to, and what their response was. For example, you might write, ""I first became aware of the faulty handrail on Wednesday, January 3, at which point I reported it to John Doe. John told me the problem would be fixed right away, but two months later, nothing has been done about it.""
Include pictures of the condition if possible. If you were not able to take pictures, describe the condition in as much detail as possible.
Let HR know that you believe the condition poses a hazard to employees. If it violates a specific law or code, consider citing it.
If an individual does something that puts others at risk, be sure to document who was involved and when it happened. For example, if a supervisor has been encouraging employees to work without the proper safety equipment, consider writing something like, ""On March 2, 2016, I heard Max tell a group of workers to keep working on the second floor of a building, even though the scaffolding was unsafe.""
You have the right to refuse to work in unsafe conditions. If the company does nothing to fix the problem, report it to OSHA.

, If you believe some of the company's procedures are unfair, unlawful, or discriminatory in nature, you may want to write a letter to HR outlining your complaints. If you think it may be possible to remedy the situation with your boss, consider talking to him about the policy before you write your letter.


Be sure to clearly outline the procedure that you have a problem with. If it is a written procedure, refer to your employee manual for complete details. If it is not a written procedure, explain who uses this procedure and under what circumstances. For example, if the supervisors at your company tend not to approve vacation time until the day before the proposed vacation, you may write, ""I realize there are no formal guidelines for how soon vacation time must be approved, but I believe the way that Bill and Mary are currently handling the issue violates employees' rights to paid time off, as waiting until the last minute makes it impossible to book travel plans.""
Provide evidence if possible. If, for example, you believe that you are owed overtime pay, include a copy of your time sheet to demonstrate that you worked over 40 hours in a given week.
If you are dealing with a discrimination issue, it is probably a good idea to hire an attorney. It can be extremely difficult to prove discrimination without one., When deciding whether or not you should submit a complaint to the HR department of your company, the first thing that you need to think about is whether the conduct you are reporting violates any laws. If you determine that the action is illegal, it is very important that you file a formal complaint. Examples of illegal behavior that should be reported immediately include the following:Sexual harassment
Discrimination
Violence
Theft
Failure to pay an employee's wages

, Even if the action you want to report is not illegal, it may be expressly against the company's policy, in which case HR may want to know about it. Review your employee handbook to determine if the behavior that's bothering you is actually against company policy. If it's not, a letter to human resources will probably not be your best course of action..


Avoid being a tattletale. You should not report coworkers to HR every time you notice that they are late or that they are violating the dress code.
Be sure to report anything that threatens the safety or well-being of employees right away.

, Formal complaints to HR should be reserved for serious issues only. HR departments typically do not appreciate being asked to settle minor grievances, so don't turn to them for every last thing. If you don't think there is any other way to address your problem, go ahead and write a letter.Less serious problems can often be addressed without involving HR. Think about whether you can talk to the person you want to complain about and work things out yourselves. If that doesn't work, you might also consider talking to your boss about the problem before you file a formal complaint.
Be sure to consider whether it may be possible to resolve the issue by simply having a conversation with HR, rather than writing a formal letter. For example, if your paycheck was incorrect, you should make sure HR is aware of the problem and has an opportunity to fix it before writing a formal complaint letter.
While it shouldn't matter who you are complaining about, the reality is that senior management is often treated differently. If you want to complain about a high-ranking employee, it is especially important that your complaint be serious, not frivolous., In some circumstances, it may be important to understand whether the incident you are reporting happened only once or if it is a common occurrence. The HR department may not take an isolated incident as seriously as they would if it were a pattern of behavior.This does not apply to harassment, violence, or any actions that create a hostile or dangerous workplace, which should be reported immediately, even if they are isolated incidents.

, Some HR departments are very helpful and strive to help their employees, while others are notorious for labeling complainers as trouble makers. Before you submit your complaint, be sure to think about the possible repercussions.Think about how the HR representatives have treated you in the past. If you have had bad experiences with them in the past, do not expect them to be especially helpful.
Also consider how other complaints have been handled. If you know someone was recently fired after submitting a complaint about his boss, you may want to rethink your decision to write that letter.

Acknowledge that things didn't go as planned.,
Recognize the implications of not having a job.,
Make yourself available to spend time together.,
Pay a compliment in your letter.",How to Write a Consolation Letter2," Don't avoid the topic when you write a consolation letter to someone who lost a job. That individual may have had their heart set on staying with that employer, which can be very upsetting. Not acknowledging the situation and its impact on that individual in a consolation letter would be pointless.Don't avoid the subject, but don't dwell on it either in the letter.
Acknowledge that it happened and that it's unfortunate, then move on to consoling your friend.
Offer a simple but genuine ""I'm so sorry"" or ""I'm very sorry to hear.""
Resist the urge to try and console your friend by saying that things happen for a reason. Many people find this insulting, and at the very least it won't be very comforting to hear.

, While not getting what you want is frustrating, not getting what you need can be devastating. The job may have been necessary to make rent, pay for an expensive procedure or repair, or rebuild a dwindled savings account. If you know the person you're writing the letter to, you may want to consider if there are any ways you could help and support that person during this time.If you're close with the recipient, you may want to consider offering to let that person stay with you if necessary. However, this is only really necessary if that person is facing eviction.
You may want to offer some type of financial assistance if you're close with the individual. You'll need to offer this tactfully, though, as some people may be insulted by an offer of monetary assistance.
You can offer assistance tactfully by planning how you phrase your offer. For example, ""I know how hard it can be to be unemployed - let me take you to the store and pay for your groceries"" sounds a lot kinder than ""Do you need any money?""

, The person you're writing to may be feeling very sad if they believed they would get the job. If you know the individual, you should offer to spend time together in your letter.You can offer to get together socially for coffee, drinks (if you're both old enough to drink), or a meal. You should offer to pay since the person you're consoling may be on a tight budget.
Offer to help revise the individual's resume or practice interviewing skills if you're good at those things.

, Someone who got rejected from a coveted job may be feeling tremendously insecure, either professionally or personally. Giving a compliment to this individual would go a long way towards making them feel better about their situation.If you only know the individual professionally, focus your comment on that person's professional skills. For example, you might say that they're the best editor you know.
If you know the individually personally (as a friend or relative), you might want to compliment that person's personal skills, talents, or even appearance (if you're close friends and you're comfortable doing so).

Address the issue you're being supportive of.,
Encourage the recipient to maintain normalcy.,
Try to urge the recipient to practice good self-care.,
Remind the recipient that you're available.",How to Write a Consolation Letter3," As with most other letters of consolation, a letter of general support should acknowledge the reason you're lending someone support. You don't have to necessarily address the issue by name if it's a painful or sensitive topic, but you should at least acknowledge in your letter that the individual is going through a difficult time.


Use your discretion when deciding whether to address the specifics of the issue or to name the issue. For example, a violent death or other types of assault would be painful and inappropriate for the recipient to have to read.

, If someone you're being supportive of has gone through a difficult or traumatic event, their life may feel like it's been turned upside down. During such a period, having some sense of normalcy can make things easier to cope with.Don't be preachy, and don't try to give advice.
Offer the encouragement for normalcy as a suggestion.
For example, you might say, ""I know things are very difficult right now, but I've heard that trying to maintain a normal schedule/routine can make it easier to get through this.""

, Practicing good self-care during difficult periods can make a world of difference. It helps people who have been hurt to heal and it allows people who are stressed to unwind. This can require some delicate phrasing, though, as you don't want to come across as being preachy or prescriptive (much like with telling someone to maintain normalcy).Gently encourage the recipient to do something relaxing or enjoyable, even if they don't feel capable of feeling good.
Yoga, meditation, and tai chi are all great ways of relieving stress.
Arts and crafts, playing games with friends, going to see a movie with friends, or going to a food or music festival are all great ways to have fun and disengage from stressful life events.

, Letting the recipient know that you're available to get together and generally lend support will be tremendously meaningful. You can offer your support in a number of ways, depending on how comfortable you feel with that individual.


Make yourself available to get together for coffee, a meal, or a drink (if you're both of legal drinking age).
Offer to join the individual in doing something they normally like to do, like attending a class or going on an outing.
Don't make a vague and easily-forgotten offer; give concrete details and make plans.
For example, you might tell the recipient, ""I'm free next week and I know you love going to yoga every morning. I'd really like to join you, and maybe we can get coffee afterward.""

Include background on yourself and your relationship to the person you’re writing for.,
Use an appropriate format when writing the character reference.Character references should follow a three-part format consisting of an opening introductory paragraph in which you describe who you are and your relationship to the person on whose behalf you’re writing; a second paragraph in which you lay out your analysis of the person’s character; and a closing paragraph in which you beseech the reader to look favorably upon the individual who you’re writing about.,
Keep the character reference letter positive.A character reference letter is not a venue for carefully comparing the good and bad parts of a person's personality, background or lifestyle.,
Do a final edit.,
Adopt an appropriate tone.Character references should always be respectful and formal in tone.,
Find out why the person you’re writing for needs the letter.,
Identify who will be reading the letter.",How to Write a Character Reference," Introduce basic information up front. Who are you and what is your relationship to the person you are writing for? How long have you known the person in question? How much time do you spend together? Where did you meet?Readers of a character reference letter want to know exactly what kind of relationship the writer has to the individual for whom whom they’re vouching.


Spend time thinking about the nature of your relationship to the individual in question. Be detailed. Instead of saying, “I’ve known Tom for three years,” say instead, “I have had the pleasure of working alongside Tom for the past three years at Yum Yum Burgers in Paytonville, Ohio.”;
,


Close the reference letter by urging the reader to look favorably upon the subject of the letter. Sign it “Sincerely, .”
Keep the character reference letter short. The readers don't need page after page of information on a character reference. They need the basics. Keep this in mind when penning a rough draft for your character reference.

, It should, instead, be aimed at providing an honest but upbeat assessment of the individual’s accomplishments, goals, and personality. A successful character reference will leave the reader with a positive impression of the individual in question.


Use positive adjectives in order to stress what a good person your subject is.List, briefly, the relevant accomplishments for the person about whom the reference is being written. For instance, if the individual has donated to philanthropic causes with either time or money, mention as much in your letter. If they have a military background and served with honor, cite their acts of bravery or courage in order to minimize a harsh legal penalty. List also any contributions the individual makes to their church or fraternal organization.

, Before submitting your letter, give it a once-over to catch any spelling, punctuation or grammar mistakes. New word processing technology makes this task easier for those who are not great writers. Check any words which are underlined with a red squiggly line; unless they are names, they are likely misspelled. In addition to spelling and grammar, ensure your facts are correct. Submit a draft copy to the person on whose behalf you’re writing in order to ensure everything is correct.

, Speak honestly, but do not disparage the ability of the reader to render an effective verdict. Your reader will probably be a judge, professor, or other person of esteem.


Address judges and magistrates as “Your Honor,” professors as “Doctor” or “Professor,” and commanding officers in the military by their rank (for instance, “General” or “Sergeant”)., Reference letters are often needed for job applications and in court cases to establish that an individual’s illegal behavior is outside the norm for them. Other cases in which a character reference might be called for include potential landlords, students applying to college, and immigrants applying for citizenship.If you’re writing for a court case, ensure you know the exact details of the crime the person you’re writing for committed, and talk to them about their feelings about the case.Show the person you’re writing to that you understand the gravity of the case, and if the accused seems to genuinely regret what they did, stress this in your letter.
Do not write a letter for someone you don’t know well, or who hesitates to give you all the requisite background details as to why they need a character reference from you.

, Know the name and position of the person you’re writing to. For instance, if you are writing a character reference on behalf of a friend applying to an academic posting, ensure you know what school they’ve applied to, what the position is, and who is going to be reading the letter. That way you can personalize it and demonstrate that you -- and, by extension, your friend -- have put serious energy into the character reference.


If you’re writing to a group of people like an academic review board or an anonymous board of immigration and naturalization officials, address the letter with “Dear Sir or Madam.”

Look into granting financial power of attorney for limited transactions.,
Contact your bank for a power of attorney form.,
Create your own power of attorney form.,
Present the document to your bank.",How to Write a Bank Authorization Letter1," Most banks won't allow someone not listed on your account to make transactions in your name unless you have given explicit permission. In legal terms, this means granting the person financial power of attorney (FPOA) by signing a legal document stating what transactions the person is allowed to make. By giving someone FPOA, you can authorize them to make withdrawals, write checks for you, and take other actions in your absence.


A limited FPOA puts a limit on what the person can do with your account. You can authorize them to make a few specific transactions if that's all you want them to do.
If you want the person to have longer-term access to your account, you can grant a durable FPOA. This enables the person to make decisions for you and handle your finances in the event that you become incapacitated.;
, Most major banks have a specific power of attorney form (sometimes called a third party authorization form) for you to fill out with the details of your situation. You'll provide information on to whom you're granting power of attorney, which transactions you want the person to be able to take, and for how long they're authorized to have access to your account.


Either visit your bank in person to speak to an agent, or visit your bank's website to obtain a power of attorney form online.
Fill out and submit the form according to your bank's instructions.

, If your bank doesn't have a specific power of attorney form, you can create your own listing exactly what transactions the person is allowed to make. In order for the document to be legally valid, you will need to follow your state's laws in order to draw it up using the correct language. Execute (sign) the power of attorney form with the person to whom you're giving FPOA.You may want to have a lawyer help you draw up the form to make sure it's legally sound.
The execution of the document must also be done according to your state's laws. Some states require that you have a witness, and others require that you have the document notarized.

, Once you have your forms filled out and signed according to the requirements of your state laws, visit your bank and meet with an agent to submit the form and make your intentions clear. Once the form is put on file, the other party will now be authorized to make the transactions you laid out.

Consider opening a convenience account.,
Look into adding someone as a co-owner.,
Use caution when allowing someone else full access to your account.",How to Write a Bank Authorization Letter2," About half the states in the US provide the option of opening convenience accounts. The other person would have access to the account, but would only be authorized to use it on your behalf. In other words, the person could use it to pay your bills, but they couldn't withdraw cash to use for their own purposes.This is not an option in every state. See if your state's laws permit convenience accounts.
Contact your bank to find out whether a convenience account will meet your needs.

, Every bank gives you the option of adding a co-owner to the account to create a joint account. This person would have the exact same ability to make transactions as you do. Go online or talk to a bank representative in person to add another person to your account.


In order to add a co-owner, you'll need to fill out forms that are signed by both parties.
Once the forms are completed and submitted, the other person will be granted full access to the account.

, Opening a convenience account or a joint account are both risky options. Adding a co-owner gives that person free reign to use your account in whatever way they please. Even if you just open a convenience account, you have to trust the person to use your money wisely. In either situation, be sure you have full trust in the person who has access to your account.You may want to meet with a lawyer to discuss which option is best for your situation. The lawyer may advise you against getting a joint account, and instead recommend getting a durable FPOA. It's a good idea to think it through with an expert before making a decision.
This is especially true if you're considering adding your children to your bank account so they can take care of your bills. Unanticipated problems could arise at a later time, so make sure your finances are well protected."

Authorize someone to make a withdrawal.",How to Write a Bank Authorization Letter3," If all you want to do is allow someone to deposit money in your account, some banks allow people to do this without special authorization. Depending on what bank you use, you may not need to write an official letter or fill out any forms. Contact your bank for more information on its policies regarding third party deposits.

, Giving someone your bank card or account information is a way to self-authorize them to make a withdrawal. However, banks advise against doing this, since you won't have control over how much the person withdraws from your account. Some banks have explicit policies in place to prevent non-account holders from making transactions, so using FPOA or listing the person as a co-signer may be a better bet.

Spend some time telling kids about the family tree and who thought of them on that special day; use a map of the USA to show them how far away that relative lives and why the gift/card may have come in the mail versus attending your party or holiday celebration.,
Sending a Thank You note is not only polite, but is a small way to have the child learn to be thankful and to keep a relationship from afar alive.

,
Depending on the child’s age, you may buy or write the note and just let them sign it or draw a picture on the back.,
If you have a card and the child is now writing, you can give them hints as to what to add, such as the thank you for the ‘gift’, how they liked it, how the money might be used or saved, and one thing about their life they might share.,
And complete the ‘tradition’ by addressing and stamping the envelope and maybe waiting to see the postal carrier pick it up in the mailbox out front!

,
For older children, buying them a box of note cards for a birthday so that they can take it upon themselves to write thank you notes, because by now, you’ve taught them the meaning of being thankful for receiving and also keeping in touch with relatives or friends, both near and far.

Forget traditional formatting rules.,
Pick a salutation that shows your reader is special.,
Aim to intrigue or excite with your first line.,
Use a playful but respectful tone.,
Heighten the romance with personal touches.,
Know what to avoid.",How to Start a Love Letter3," If you're worried about how to write your love letter's header, how many lines to indent before you start writing, or which corner the date goes in, don't be. Love letters aren't exercises in formal writing. In fact, they can be some of the most casual, personal, and intimate documents written in a person's lifetime. The content of your letter is much, much more important that the way it's organized, so feel free to play fast and loose with the standard rules of letter-writing.


If you're looking for a conservative option, simply write the reader's name on the left edge of the top line, followed by a comma. For instance, if you're writing to Rebecca Samson, your secret crush from math class, you'd just write ""Rebecca,"" in the top left of the page.
If you want something more bold, don't be afraid to bend the traditional rules of formatting as you see fit. For instance, if you want to include the day's date like you would in a traditional letter, you might want to make the most of the opportunity by writing something like, ""September 29th, 2014, 145 days since I first met you...""

, In letter writing, the salutation is the greeting that begins the letter — usually, it's something like ""Dear John,"" ""To whom it may concern,"" or something similar. Depending on the purpose of your letter, literally dozens of salutations can be appropriate.While you can use an ordinary salutation for your love letter, getting creative here is a great way to show you care enough about your reader to put some thought into it. If you want to, you can even leave out the salutation entirely — it's up to you!


For example, if you're writing to John Ramirez, the hunk you met at the local book store, you could try referencing this in your salutation by writing something like, ""Dear John, my bookworm beau,""

, Love letters can be many things (sweet, sassy, sincere, or salacious, for instance), but they should never be boring. A love letter isn't just your chance to tell your secret crush how you feel — it's a chance to actually get this person interested in being with you! Your first line should reflect this — be witty, funny, or even scandalous, but whatever you do, don't begin with, ""I'm writing to inform you that I am very fond of you. Here is why...""


Here's a good example of an exciting opener: Let's say that we're writing to Susie Jackson, a ""total babe"" you know from debate club. There are a million different ways to go with this — here are just two:
""The hardest thing about debate club isn't having to deal with Mr. Nelson's rules — it's having to argue with someone I'm so crazy about.""
""Last week, when you stepped up to the podium, you fought hard for a flat tax, but it felt like you were fighting for my heart.""

, While lovers in ages past may have used stilted, formal language to court each other, modern lovers can usually get away with having a little more fun. Don't shy away from being goofy or even gently teasing your partner in your letter. If you already know each other well, this sort of informal approach will usually lead to laughter or flirtation — not hurt feelings.


For example, as long as you eventually make it clear that you're joking, you can get some serious mileage out of playfully using flowery, archaic language. Don't be afraid to ""go big."" For example, you might start off with ""My dearly beloved — the one for which my heart continues its dance. You enchant my each and every day. I would be honored to take you to the sock hop.""
On the other hand, you don't want to be too wild. Beyond one or two soft teases, don't be rude or disrespectful and don't use curse words unless you already have a history of using them with this person. Remember, you're trying to win this person's heart, not crush this person's ego.

, Your love letter shouldn't read like a form letter. Ideally, your writing should make it clear that you've written your letter with one person (and only one person) in mind. Try including specific details about your partner, like the way they look, the way they make you feel, and the ways they make your life better to show you've put some thought into your writing.


For example, if you're writing to Stefan Burnett, the star of the swim team, you might take a tongue-in-cheek approach and include the following details: ""Stefan, you make my heart skip five beats every time you climb out of the pool. Your eyes are bluer than chlorine, your abs are harder than locker room tiles, and your hair is blacker than your speedo. Marry me.""

, Confessing your love to someone is tricky — no matter how elegant you are with a pen, it's easy to make mistakes. Luckily, some mistakes can come across as sweet, endearing quirks. On the other hand, other mistakes can come across in very unflattering ways. Below is just a short list of things you may want to leave out of your letter:


Self-deprecating humor (i.e., making fun of yourself or putting yourself down). While some people have mastered this tricky skill, it can often come across as insecure.Poems. Unless you're a master poet or you're already with your reader, your masterpiece may be shared with friends and family (and not in a good way).
Mention of other people. Try to write only about two people: yourself and your reader. Now is no time to be making your crush jealous.
Crass, dirty, or overly sexual references. Wait until you're dating.

"
"
Start warmly and familiarly.,
Make references to inside jokes.,
Write candidly — even about your struggles and disappointments.,
Use flowery language for humor's sake.,
Study the love letters of history's greatest paramours.",How to Start a Love Letter4," If you're writing a love letter to someone you're already dating, the tips above may still be useful to you, but you may find that you get the best results when you use a slightly different approach. Since you've already won this person's affection, you don't have to worry quite as much about being intriguing or exciting. Instead, you can use a tone that's a little more intimate and familiar — closer to pillow talk than to high-intensity flirting.


For example, if you're writing to Mike Greene, your boyfriend of a year, you might begin thusly: ""Mike, my love. Has it already been a year? 12 amazing months? 52 tremendous weeks? 365 earth-shattering days? How the time has flown.""

, After you've been with someone long enough, you'll probably have your own ""vocabulary"" as a couple — terms, references, and jokes that only the two of you understand. To give your letter a personal touch, try sprinkling these throughout the beginning of your letter — it will show you remember and value your shared experiences.


We'll leave this one up to you — only you and your S.O. know each others' inside jokes, pet names, and obscure references.

, No relationship is perfect — after an initial ""honeymoon"" period, the members of basically every couple will slowly but surely begin to notice each others' flaws, get on each others' nerves, and sometimes even have arguments. This is a normal part of being someone's significant other. Don't be afraid to touch on these things lightly in your letter. After all, they're just as much a part of your relationship as the happy moments that are hopefully much more frequent.


However, no matter how serious the content of your letter gets, you'll want to let your reader know that you're confident in your relationship. Never give your boyfriend or girlfriend the fear that you're considering breaking up. This can make a relationship tense and uncertain and potentially even lead to an actual breakup.
For example, let's say you're writing to Kim Jones, your girlfriend with whom you've recently had an argument. You might want to include a sentence or two like this: ""I know we argue sometimes, Kimmy. In a way, our tiffs have a silver lining. After we have a chance to cool down each time, I'm more and more convinced that I've made the right decision.""

, Don't be afraid to be funny in your love letter — there's a lot of evidence to suggest that humor can be a very sexy trait to both men and women alike.Although humorous openings are difficult to pull off, and probably shouldn't be attempted if you don't have a knack for humor, they reinforce your lighter side. In addition, since you're already dating your letter's recipient, you don't have to worry quite as much about being ""proper"" or ""nice"". As long as you're not terribly rude or cruel (and you can pull the humor off), you can usually joke around without much fear of giving the wrong impression.


For example, here's an example of a ridiculously overwrought opening that's consciously cheeky:



Frozen though it may have been that night, I marched on undaunted. Harsher grew the snow. Could I go on? Despair. With every step that touched the icy ground, I grew more decrepit. My skin was starting to turn black from frostbite. I knew now that in this sullen time, I was to die, left to languish in this tomb of chill. But lo, what was this? Could it be? A light descends from the sky! Effervescent pearlescent luminescence shone through a sublime sheen of a figure most brilliant. It couldn't be. It was. You. There you were, the one thing to cast me out of the gloom, this curse, this affliction, this anathema.





, Still stuck? Don't sweat it — history is full of literally hundreds of great love letter writers, each with his or her own unique style. Below are just a few examples from the world of literature you may want to check out (there are many more from all walks of life):


Early 21st Century writer Katherine Mansfield was a great love letter writer who was able to use her literary skills to pen beautiful passages to her lovers — both male and female (Mansfield was bisexual). Here's a short passage from a letter to her second husband John Murray Mansfield: ""You are all about me - I seem to breathe you, hear you, feel you in me and of me.""If you're willing to get raunchy (very, very raunchy), the love letters of Irish author James Joyce to his wife Nora Barnacle may be great sources of inspiration. Here's a tamer passage written before the two married: ""I am like a fool hearing you call me 'Dear.' I offended two men today by leaving them coolly. I wanted to hear your voice, not theirs.""Not all love letters need to be syrupy, poetic musings. The letters of Austro-Hungarian writer Franz Kafka to his lovers were often erratic, bordering on bizarre. Here's a passage from a letter to his fiance (but never wife), Felice Bauer: ""If only I had your answer now! And how horribly I torment you, and how I compel you, in the stillness of your room, to read this letter, as nasty a letter as has ever lain on your desk! Honestly, it strikes me sometimes that I prey like a spectre on your felicitous name!"""
"
Feel free to open with a bang — or a whisper.,
Make a reference to your first shared experience as a couple.,
Focus on the ways your love has matured over time.,
Call attention to your lasting devotion.",How to Start a Love Letter5," Marriage is a decision that, for most, means a lifetime commitment. Ideally, people who are married should share such a level of intimacy that there's very little they aren't comfortable talking bout. In terms of writing a love letter, this means that virtually everything is on the table. While you'll probably want to err on the side of sincerity (rather than, say, irony), you have lots of room to be creative here.


There's no ""right"" way to begin a love letter to your spouse. Only you know your spouse's most intimate hopes, dreams, feelings and fears, so we'll leave this one to you.
If you're in doubt, simply be sincere about the way you feel. Even something as simple as, ""I love you — that's how I've always felt and it's how I always will feel"" can do the trick.

, One sure-fire trick to trigger warm feelings of nostalgia in your partner is to bring back memories of the very first time you met or went on a date. This will almost always bring back fond memories of when you and your partner were younger, more naive, and more carefree. If written with sincerity, including this sort of nostalgic reference can make your letter a tremendously poignant, bittersweet tearjerker.


For example, if you're writing to your wife Tina Smith, whom you met in the hospital when she was your nurse, on your 20th wedding anniversary, you might start like this: ""I still remember that day 22 years ago, Tina. I woke up amidst the cream-colored pillows at St. Claire's as if I had come to in heaven. Was it a dream? Had I survived the crash? Then, I saw you, and in an instant, I was more grateful to be alive than I had ever been before (or have been since.)""

, A couple that's been married for years isn't the same pair of people that they were when they started dating (or even when they married). Marriage changes a relationship — often, this change isn't better or worse, but merely different. For extra poignancy in your letter, you may want to consider calling attention to the way your relationship has changed, like the way your feelings for each other are more mature, the way you've discovered each others' secrets, and so on. As you do this, reflect on the fact that your love, though different, is no weaker than it was on the first day of your honeymoon.


For example, let's say you're writing to Jim Davidson, your husband of a little over a year. You might try something like this: ""Jim, honey. It's been just 14 months now and it feels like we've been married for a lifetime. The way we talk, the way we hold each other — even the way we look at each other is so much subtler, so much more intimate than the way we were back then. And yet, I've never loved you more.""

, It's a simple fact: not all marriages last until ""death do us part."" Your love letter to your spouse, however, should be written as if this outcome is impossible — even ludicrous. While you can bring up difficulties or struggles you've had as a couple, don't leave any doubt about the strength of your marriage. Make your love letter a bold proclamation of how you intend to spend the rest of your life with your partner (and how much you'll enjoy doing it!)


For a great example of the positive, affirmative sort of approach you may want to take, enjoy this passage from a love letter written by President Woodrow Wilson to Edith Bolling Galt, the woman who became his second wife: ""You have the greatest soul, the noblest nature, the sweetest, most loving heart I have ever known, and my love, my reverence, my admiration for you, you have increased in one evening as I should have thought only a lifetime of intimate, loving association could have increased them."""

State how you know the defendant.,
Give reasons why you support the defendant.,
Proofread the letter.,
Contact the defendant's defense attorney.",How to Write a Character Letter to a Judge," A professional-looking letter should by typed on high quality paper and signed with an ink pen. A clean sheet of white 8.5""x11"" printer paper is acceptable. You can also find ""business"" or ""résumé"" paper, which is usually thicker, and cream or off-white in color. When typing your letter, choose a professional looking font that is legible and large enough to be easily read.


If you are handwriting your letter, avoid using lined or binder-style paper. Use a ruler or other straightedge to keep your handwriting straight as your write across the page. Make your handwriting as legible as possible.;
, If you have access to letterhead (official stationery with the name and address of a person, business, or organization at the top), use it.The letterhead could be the official stationery of your workplace.By using a business's letterhead, you imply that you have authority to communicate on behalf of the business, which conveys a level of responsibility and trust.


If you are an employee, get permission to use your employer's letterhead for a personal matter before you write your letter.

, If you are not using letterhead, provide your personal information to identify yourself. In the top left, write your:


Name
Address
City, state, and zip code
Telephone number and/or email address

, Leave a blank line after your personal information, then type the date on which you are writing the letter. Write out the date rather than abbreviating it, as in ""September 21, 2015"" instead of ""9/21/15.""

, The inside address (the address written on the letter itself, as opposed to the ""outside address"" written on the envelope) should include the recipient's full name, title, and mailing address. Leave a blank line below the date, then write the judge's name and address. Use the judge's professional address, which is usually the courthouse in which he or she works. For example:


The Honorable , Judge of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, Chatsworth Courthouse, 9425 Penfield Avenue, Chatsworth, CA 91311., Beneath the inside address, let the judge know the subject of your letter. Use ""Re:"" (an abbreviation for ""regarding"" or ""with reference to""), followed by a brief identifying phrase.


For example, ""Re: Sentencing of Jane Doe, Case No. W017344""

, Write ""Dear Judge (last name),"" to start the message of your letter. Note that you should use ""the Honorable"" when referring to the judge, but use ""Judge"" addressing him or her directly. The titles are still used even if the judge has retired.The word ""Dear"" is always appropriate in a business context, and does not necessarily mean that the person is dear to you. It is simply a proper opening salutation.

, In the first paragraph of the letter, begin by introducing yourself and stating what type of work you do. Do not be modest about your credentials, especially if your career places you in a position of high esteem in your community. You want to show that the defendant has a positive relationship with you, a productive and respective member of the community.For example you might write: ""I am a local small business owner, and have served this community for fifteen years.""

, By letting the judge know that you are aware of what charges the defendant faces, you communicate to the judge that you are still willing to offer your support in spite of the defendant's trouble with the law.For example, you might write, ""Mr. Smith has informed me that he faces charges related to possession of narcotics. In light of these circumstances, I am happy to offer an endorsement of Mr. Smith's good character.""

, Your next sentence should specify how you know the defendant, and for how long you have known him or her. Tell the judge whether the defendant is a family member, friend, business associate, member of your church, etc., You will need to persuade the judge that the defendant deserves leniency. Explain why you believe he or she deserves a second chance, and how the defendant can continue to have a positive impact on his or her family and community.Mention why the defendant is needed at home or work, and how his or her family and community will be negatively impacted while he or she serves a jail or prison term.


Use specific examples of when you observed the defendant's good character. Describe a time you saw the defendant go out of his way to help someone in need. For example, ""One afternoon, Mr. Smith noticed that one of our neighbors was struggling to make some repairs to his home. I observed Mr. Smith offer his assistance, as well as his own tools and supplies. This instance, among many others, is indicative of Mr. Smith's reputation for helpfulness and generosity in our neighborhood.""Take as much space as you need for this section, but no more than you need. Judges' schedules are very busy, so your judge will appreciate a letter that are carefully edited. Put your most powerful arguments first, and phrase your reasoning as succinctly as you can.

, Once you have finished writing it, re-read your letter several times and have someone else read it for you. Make sure your letter is easy to understand and free from errors spelling and grammatical. Once your letter is as straightforward, to-the-point, and error-free as you can make it, it is ready to send.

, Do not send your letter directly to the judge. Defense attorneys prefer that their clients’ friends and relatives give the letter to the attorney first so that the attorney review the letter and verify that there is no information in the letter that may be damaging to the defendant’s case.If you know someone else who might be willing to write a good character letter for the defendant, let the defendant's attorney know. The attorney may be looking for as many people as he or she can find to write character letters on behalf of the client.

Send out thank-you letters promptly.",How to Start a Thank You Letter," It’s hard to go wrong with a simple “Dear Susan,” as the introductory address of your message. If for some reason this feels inappropriate, it’s also acceptable to simply begin with a name. The most important thing is that the recipient be able to see right away that the letter is intended for their eyes.Though they’re a more traditional method of correspondence, thank-you letters aren’t inherently formal, so there’s no need employ overly proper language.
Avoid vague, impersonal headers like “dear valued client” or “to whom it may concern.”;
, Address the person or people you’re sending the letter to by their first name, except in professional situations. “Dear Richard and Angela” sounds much more personable than “dear friend” or even “dear Thompsons.” To avoid any embarrassing mistakes, double check to make sure you’ve spelled the recipient’s name correctly.If you’re not on a first-name basis with the recipient, it’s okay to use a last name or official title, such as “Mr. Jeffries” or “Chairwoman Diaz.”Letters addressed to a large group or organization should use the entire name of the group (“Dear Boys and Girls Club of Detroit”). Don’t neglect to also send letters individually to specific people who have helped you.

, Since the whole reason you’re writing is to offer thanks, they should come first and foremost in the letter. Don’t distract your reader with a lengthy preamble. Let them know right away what to expect from the letter they’ve just opened.Keep it simple: “Thank you for coming to my going away party this weekend” or “I’m writing to let you know how much I loved your gift” are both explicit and to the point.

, After you’ve extended a few words of appreciation, elaborate on how much the recipient’s actions meant to you. Refer directly to the part the recipient played in the event that prompted the letter. This could involve describing how you’ve put a gift to use, highlighting a personal connection or displaying your excitement over their attendance.You might thank your son or daughter’s new in-laws by writing “it was so lovely meeting you and getting a chance to share such a joyous experience.”
The same guidelines apply if the letter is being sent in response to a professional opportunity. Statements like “the grant money I received will be put to good use aiding my research into aboriginal tribes” point to a connection between something the recipient has done and your desire to acknowledge them., Be candid and express yourself naturally in your own words, as though you were speaking to a close friend. Don’t overthink what it is you’re trying to say. Seek to convey a gracious attitude without downplaying or overstating the scope of the recipient’s deeds.Make sure the recipient knows their efforts are appreciated. There’s little point in taking the time to draft a thank-you letter if you don’t actually sound thankful.
Too much enthusiasm can make your letter seem forced, while too little may cause it to be perceived as a perfunctory gesture.

, In general, it’s best to limit your message to a couple hundred words or less. Otherwise, you run the risk of losing your reader’s attention. Short letters are easier to digest, which is important, since they may be read several times. Say what you need to say, wish the person well, then sign off.As a general rule, aim for 5-7 sentences to serve as the body of the letter.
Confine your message to a notecard or small piece of stationery so you don’t end up rambling in an effort to fill up space., As a bonus, you might take a moment to reinforce your admiration for the recipient in a way that will stand out to them. Adding a small side note like “it was a real treat to see you lecture at Berkeley a few weeks back” or “you and Mark make such a handsome couple!” can be very gratifying to your reader and indicate that you’re keeping up with the details of their life as well as your own.It may seem inappropriate to make observations about someone you haven’t made or don’t know personally.

, Think about who you’ll be writing to and make a note of their name and the specific act you’re thanking them for. It’s important to send a letter to everyone who has given up time, money or energy to help you so that no one feels overlooked.Single out prominent individuals who have helped you and write them all separately.
Families can be addressed collectively under the name of the household.

, Composing multiple thank-you letters can be a demanding task, but if you’re going to do it, you should make an effort to do it the right way. Approach each letter you begin as its own distinct work. Resist the urge to simply copy the content of one letter over to another with the names changed.Tackle a long list of thank-yous one at a time to keep from getting overwhelmed.
It can help to stick to a basic template or format for each letter that will allow you to get your point across without forcing you to come up with something entirely different every time., The best time to dispatch a thank-you letter is immediately after the favor has been performed. That way, the event is still fresh in both parties’ minds, so there will be no confusion as to the letter’s focus. It will also come across as much more genuine if you make it a point to express your gratitude sooner rather than later.Start the letter-writing process at your earliest convenience to give yourself plenty of time to get them completed.
If for some reason you’re late in mailing a thank-you letter, politely explain the delay to your reader.

Include your address on upper right side of the letter.,
Provide the date after your address.,
Address your recipient.,
Ask a question.,
Express your interest in something the recipient said or did.",How to Start a Letter1," For a personal letter, place your address on the upper right hand side of your paper.This will make it easier for your recipient to respond to you because he or she will not have to look up your address or save the envelope.


You do not need to include your name in the address. Just include your street address or PO box on the first line and then include your city, state, and zip code on the next line.;
, It is important to include a date so that your recipient will know when you composed your letter. Including a date can also be useful if your recipient wants to save the letters he or she receives and organize them by date. Place the date on the next line after your address.Write out the date with the Month first, then the date, and then the year. For example, “April 22, 2016.”

, Next, you will need to skip a line and move over to the left side of your page. You should always use the salutation “Dear” to begin personal letters. Follow “Dear” with your recipient’s name and a comma.Consider how you usually address your recipient when you talk to him or her. For example, you might address your recipient as, “Dear Stephanie,” “Dear Grandma,” or “Dear Mr. Thompson,” depending on how you usually address the person.

, For a personal letter, such as to a friend or family member, opening with a question is a common approach. You can open your letter with a question to show your interest in what the recipient is doing or how he or she has been.


For example, you could open with something like, “How are you?” or, “How do you like your new school?” or, “Are you feeling better?”

, Another good way to start a personal letter is to begin by expressing your interest in something that your recipient put into his or her last letter, such as a recent accomplishment, a fun vacation, or an obstacle that he or she is facing.


For example, you might start with something like, “Congratulations on your award!” or “Your vacation sounds like it was really fun!” or “I am sorry to hear that you have been having such a bad time at school.”

Decide if “Dear” is appropriate for your purposes.,
Think about how to address your recipient.,
Set a pleasant tone.,
State your purpose.",How to Start a Letter2," Your full mailing address should appear at the top of your letter. Do not include your name before the address, but you may include an email address and/or a phone number below the mailing address if desired.You may place the address on the right or on the left.

, After you have written your address and any other contact info that you wish to include, skip a line and include the date. Write out the date in full to include the month, day, and year.For example, “April 22, 2016.”

, Your recipient’s name along with his or her full address should go on the left side of your paper for business letters. Place the address after the date with one space dividing the two.Skip a line after your address as well. Your salutation (""Dear ___,"" or “To whom it may concern,”) goes on the next line.

, Starting off letters with “Dear” is standard, but it might not always seem appropriate. For example, “Dear” might seem too personal for a complaint letter or for a business correspondence.Think about who you are writing to and whether or not using “Dear” suits your purposes. If you are hoping to get to know the recipient better, such as by teaming up on a project, then “Dear” is probably appropriate.If including “Dear” makes you uncomfortable, then you can always leave off the “Dear” and just open the letter with the recipient’s title and name. For example, you could simply open with “Mr. Parker,” and then follow with your opening line.
“To Whom it May Concern” is another alternative, but this is even more distant and businesslike than leaving off “Dear.” Only use this opening phrase if you do not know the name of your recipient.

, Before you write your recipient’s name on the letter, take a moment to determine the best way to address him or her. In most cases, business letter should address recipients in a more formal manner, such as by using any titles the person holds. You can also consider how the person has addressed you in letters and your relationship with the person.



Consider the person’s title and position. If the person you are writing to has a special title or position, then you should include this in your Salutation. For example, if the person is a doctor, then you might begin your letter with “Dear Dr. Jones.” If the person is a general in the military, then you might begin your letter with “Dear General Wilson.” People who have a PhD or LLD at the end of their names should also be addressed as Dr. Check the letter you are responding to. If you are writing a letter in response to another letter, then checking to see how you were addressed may help you to decide how to address your recipient. For example, if the letter you received starts with “Dear Ms. Johnson,” then you should also start your letter with “Dear Mr./Mrs./Ms. ____.”Think about how well you know the recipient. You may also want to consider how well you know the recipient when deciding how to address your letter. Are you on a first name basis? Or do you use a title when you address the person? Keep in mind that even if you have called the person by his or her first name in the past, it might be too informal for a business letter. If you are in doubt, err on the side of caution and address the person in a formal manner, such as by including Mr., Ms., or Dr.

, No matter why you are writing, it is a good idea to set a pleasant tone to improve the chances that your recipient will be open to your message. Even if you are writing to complain or for some other unpleasant purpose, never start your letter by saying something rude or demanding. Instead, try expressing well wishes to your recipient or congratulating your recipient on an accomplishment.


For example, if you want to set a friendly tone in the beginning of your letter, then you might start by saying something like, “I hope this letter finds you well.” Or, “Congratulations on your promotion!”

, While it is good to open a business letter in a friendly way, it is also important to get right to the point and state your purpose for writing. You can let your recipient know why you are writing by using a direct, simple template that begins with: “I am writing because/to…”You can tailor this opening for a variety of purposes. For example, you might start with something like, “I am writing because of our similar interests,” or, “I am writing to voice a complaint,” or “I am writing to propose a partnership between our companies.”

Use business letter format to address your letter and recipient.,
Provide a summary of your accomplishments.,
Express your enthusiasm.,
Incorporate relevant keywords.",How to Start a Letter3," When writing a cover letter, you can apply the same tactics for addressing the letter as you would with a business letter.


Include your address on the upper right or left hand side. Do not include your name, just your address.
Include an email address, personal website address, and/or phone number on the next line.
Skip a line.
Provide the date with the month written out. ""April 22, 2016""
Skip another line.
Include your salutation. ""Dear ___,"" or ""To whom it may concern,""

, It is okay to start a cover letter with something simple, such as “I am writing to apply for X position.” However, if you want to try something a little different to open a cover letter, then you might start with a brief summary of your greatest accomplishments. Offering a brief summary of what you have accomplished can grab the attention of the hiring manager and increase your chance of getting an interview.For example, you might start with, “In the past five years, I have doubled my sales and expanded my territory to three neighboring states.” You could then go on to talk more about your professional experience, education, special training, and other qualifications for the job.

, If you are writing a cover letter, then letting your excitement come through on paper can also help to increase your chances of getting an interview. The hiring manager may be impressed by your dedication to your job.For example, you could say something like, “I was excited to see this job posting because I have always been a big fan of your company.” You could then go on to explain what you like about the company, why you are so passionate about your work, and how you think you would fit in.

, Keywords may be helpful if you know that you will be up against lots of other people for a job. Mentioning keywords early in your letter can increase the chances that your application will be noticed, especially if those keywords indicate that you might be a good fit for the job.Some good keywords to mention include those that appear in the job posting, such as specific skills or experience that you possess. For example, you might begin with something like, “In my five years as a sales manager, I have given regular presentations, developed successful sales strategies, and written numerous sales scripts for my employees.”
You can also mention the names of any person or persons who referred you to this position. This might catch the attention of the hiring manager and ensure that you get an interview. For example, you might write something like, “I heard about this position from our department chair, Dr. Smith.”

I appreciate immediate attention on this matter.
We hope to continue relying on your valued input as a customer.
I once again apologize for inconveniences this may cause.
If you require further information, don't hesitate to ask.
Please provide the necessary advice.
I look forward to meeting with you.
I look forward to receiving your response.

, For a business letter it is very important that you format your closing correctly, but don't worry. It's easy. Enter one return or one print-size space between the last line of your letter and the letter closing to format your signature appropriately.


This should be flush with the left margin in block formatted text, or centered below the body of the letter in line with the date in modified block format.

, This is typically a one or two words that follow your formal closing. Choose an appropriate closing for the letter you're writing. The closing of business letters should be professional and respectful. Depending on the purpose of the memo or letter and the person who'll be receiving it, different closings may be more appropriate than others.The complimentary close begins with a capital letter and ends with a comma. No other word listed in the closing should be capitalized.Include something like:


Respectfully,
Respectfully yours,
Sincerely,
Best wishes,
All the best,
Warm regards,
Consider to whom you're writing. A Senior Vice President of a company may require a more formal closing (""Sincerely"") than the Sales Representative you play basketball with (""Cheers"").Consider the purpose of the letter. A company memo introducing new policies will deem a more formal closing than a note of congratulations to a colleague who was recently promoted (""All best"").
Try using something like ""best regards,"" or ""best wishes,"" if the recipient is your close contact. ""Yours sincerely"" is better reserved for when you know the recipient whereas ""Sincerely"" is typically used if you do not know the recipient.

In a personal letter, it's technically optional if you'd like to capitalize any other words that follow.

, You have more freedom to get casual and even a little silly if you are writing a personal letter to someone you know very well. Use your best judgment and work within the bounds of your relationship and the reason for your letter to choose the best closing. Any of the following should work fine:


Love,
With love,
Yours,
Your friend,
Take care,
Best wishes,
Peace and love,
Thinking of you,

, If you're writing to a close friend or family member, consider a more personal closing, like:


XO,
Yours,
Hugs,
Kisses,
Til soon,
Write soon.

, If you're writing to a lover, ending words can be even more intimate. A genuine, personable closing helps the letter sound like it came from you, not a store-bought greeting card. The right phrase might even improve your relationship. Follow the sign-off with your initials or signature. Consider these:


Love always,
Yours forever,
Affectionately yours,
Longing to see you,
Patiently yours,
Your darling,

, Unlike a business letter, in a personal letter you do not need to type your name to make it legible and formal, assuming the person is familiar with you. Simply sign your name by hand directly under the letter closing.


Use your first and last name when signing. If you know the person well, it's okay to sign with your first name only.
Sign with your first and last name if you’re writing to someone you’ve never met face to face.
Use your first name or nickname on letters to friends or business associates who know you.

, Sometimes postscripts are included as a way to lighten a letter's tone with a joke, or to playfully flirt with the recipient. Since postscripts are usually just a sentence or two, they can be used as a way of including information without the pressure of writing an explanation. Take these, for example:


""P.S. I already finished off the box of chocolates. Please send more supplies.""
""P.S. Oh, I forgot to mention one thing: I'm madly in love with you.""

, If you have access to letterhead (official stationery with the name and address of a person, business, or organization at the top), use the letterhead for you letter to the judge. This letterhead could be the official letterhead of your place of work.Using a business's letterhead implies that the author of the letter has authority to communicate on behalf of the business, which connotes a certain level of responsibility.


If applicable, get permission to use your employer's letterhead for a personal matter before you write your letter.

Name
Address
City, state, and zip code
Telephone number and/or email address

It is simply a proper opening salutation.

, In the first paragraph of the letter, begin by introducing yourself and saying what your profession is. Do not be modest about your credentials, particularly if you are held in high esteem in your community because of your professional or private work. Building yourself up is particularly helpful if you are writing on behalf of a defendant, it shows that the defendant has a positive relationship with a respected and productive member of the community.For example, ""I am a local small business owner, and have served this community for fifteen years.""

, Your next sentence should specify what interest you have in the case you are writing about. For instance, you might state how long you have known the defendant, and whether he or she is a friend, relative, member of your church, etc., Succinctly describe what action you would like the judge to take. For example, ""I ask that you please impose only the minimum sentence upon the defendant.""

, You need to persuade the judge to agree to your request. For example, if you are asking the judge to impose only a minimum sentence on the defendant, explain why the defendant will turn his or her life around, why you believe he or she deserves a second chance, and how the defendant can continue to have a positive impact on his or her family and community.


Take as much space as you need for this section, but not more than you need. Judges are very busy, and will appreciate letters that are well-edited. Put your strongest arguments first, and phrase your arguments as briefly as you can.

, Once you have finished, re-read your letter several times, and have someone else read it for you. Make sure your letter is easy to understand and free from errors. Once your letter is as straightforward, succinct, and error-free as you can make it, you are ready to send it.

Find a way to get the reader to spread the message.,
You can also use the guilt-trip angle, this usually accompanies a mushy or sad tale.,
Decide how you will send it.,
Send the chain letter.

,
Be patient.",How to Start a Chain Letter," Chain letters usually include a story, poem, joke, recipe, quiz, a bunch of mis-attributed quotes, political rant, dire warning, or any combination of the above. The more outlandish and dishonest the better, since, as a chain originator, you're not going for accuracy, you're trying to be a jerk and manipulate as many people into passing on this kruft as possible. Then comes an attempt to get the reader to copy the message and send it to the specified number of, or as many users as possible. Read the examples on the side of this article for some examples.


Example letter from ""Mary""

If you're reading this you can't stop. Hi my name is Mary. I'm 15, I have long black hair, and no nose. I'm in a white dress, and if you don't copy this on 5 other videos, I will stand behind you with a knife, and kill you. If you do I will give you a prize.



, Any combination of jokes, a scary story, or a joke to get a free computer from IBM are all typical chain letter jokes. You can write one of these typical chain letters, or write something creative.


Example joke story:

A few years ago, two parents went out for dinner. A few hours later, the babysitter was calling to ask if she could cover up the clown statue in the kids' room. The father said, ""Take the kids and get out of the house. We'll call the police, we don't have a clown statue."" The ""clown statue"" is really a killer that escaped from jail. If you don't post this letter on to 10 videos tonight, the clown will be in your bed at 3:00 am with a chainsaw in his hand.



, If you wrote a scary story, like the clown story, you can say that if they do not copy the message and send it to a certain number of people, the same will happen to them. If you wrote a joke, you can just say to copy and send to people. Love chain letters often have a number of people they must be sent to, and if it is sent to 5, something will happen, 10, something else will happen, etc.


Example viral trigger:

Don’t delete……if you love someone…. This is scary. If you don’t, the following will happen to you …. (you will find out later on). Now listen……… you will probably think…. This chain letter, like most chain letters, is full of crap and does not work. But guess...... , See the infamous Billy Evans article as an example., You can send it in mail, email, or post it as a comment for a certain thing. If posting online, be wary of what the site considers spam. Obviously, you don't want to post chain letters on wikiHow, your comment may be removed.

You must start your letter with Dear friend or Dear sister. Though men can get breast cancer, your letter will most likely be given to a woman. If you want to be safe in case your letter is given to a man, you can always just write Dear friend.
Close your letter with your first name and last initial (for example, Jane D. or John S.). You aren't allowed to share your last name for privacy reasons.
Your letter must be hand-written. Typed letters are quicker to make, but since hand-written letters have more of a personal feel to them, this is an official rule.
There is no prediction on when your letter will actually be read, so don't date it around seasons or holidays (for example, You must feel like your Christmas is ruined by this).
Don't comment on prognosis, the type of treatment, race, religion, or anything else that you don't know.;
, You'll need to know how to write a correctly-formatted letter, as well as open and close the letter correctly, for your message to really count and to ensure that your words are actually shared.

, The Girls Love Mail envelope that your letter will be packaged in as it is mailed to the hospitals themselves is 4.75 inches (12.1 cm) by 6.5 inches (16.5 cm). Before you start writing, be sure that you can either fold your paper to that size or that your paper is that size.

, This isn't a business proposal; it's a sentimental letter. Rather than trying to make perfect poetry, focus on being realistic, as if you're speaking in person to a friend rather than writing a college thesis.

, The last thing your reader wants to hear is that he or she may die or that treatment for you was extremely hard or painful. Even if it's true, the letter's purpose is to console, not to inform.

, It's a good idea to share personal experiences, stories, and advice, because it will make the letter sound more realistic. If you've known anyone who had or has any type of cancer, it's a great idea to tell how that person overcame it. A great idea is to share a personal experience or story. If you've known anyone who had or has any type of cancer, especially yourself, this is a great story to share. If you don't know what the person is going through, it's okay to admit it and say you couldn't imagine being in his or her situation. The last thing your reader needs is a load of cheesy, stolen, or fake words.

, If you're going to write a lot of letters, don't make them all identical. The Girls Love Mail website suggests that if you're going to make letters identical, you should only do five copies of the same letter. You can change up your words a little, but don't write the same things every single time - it will ruin the personality.

, Once you have finished writing, send it to the address for Girls Love Mail. Don't mail it to a hospital yourself; the facility will likely ignore your letter without knowing who it is for.

Look for one or more of these nourishing ingredients in your massage medium:


Jojoba oil makes your skin supple.
Aloe vera hydrates your skin.
Shea butter seals in moisture and prevents cracking.
Almond oil deeply moisturizes your skin. However, people with nut allergies should avoid this oil.;
, The key to a good massage is relaxation. Prepare your workspace by laying a plush towel down to protect your work surface from the massage medium. Next, create an ambience by playing calming music and lighting scented candles.Other ways to create a calming ambience include:


Providing a glass of wine or cup of hot tea
Providing a soft, comfortable chair
Draping a warm blanket around yourself or your client

, If you’re massaging someone else, ask them to identify painful areas in their hands. Tell them that the massage will provide a pleasant pressure but should not hurt. If they experience any pain, they should say so. Otherwise, they may bruise.If you’re massaging yourself, be careful with your own painful areas. The massage should never be uncomfortable.

, Warm a dime-sized portion of the medium by rubbing it between your hands. Next, spread the warmed medium along the forearm and on both sides of the hand that will be massaged. Use slow, relaxing motions as you work to continue warming the medium.


Examine the skin for abrasions and cuts. If you see anything suspicious, don’t do the massage. Otherwise, you’ll risk irritating a wound and causing an infection.

, Face the palm down. Press with your thumbs and make little circles around the wrist bones. Move up and down the wrist as you work. Next, turn the wrist over and stroke the inside of the wrist with your thumbs. Press firmly and stroke towards the palm and back to the wrist.

Then, massage the center of the palm using circular motions.The palm contains many powerful muscles and tendons. Therefore, you may need to apply more pressure when massaging this part of the hand.

, Use small, precise strokes to rub areas that are especially painful. Rub the skin back and forth across the area or pinch it gently to release tension.

Melt-and-pour soap base is designed to melt easily, but it still needs to be cut or grated into smaller pieces.
You can buy melt-and-pour soap bases at arts and crafts stores. You can also buy them online.
The soap is important for this scrub. It's what allows the scrub to retain its cube shape.;
, Coconut oil is extra nourishing and has a nice fragrance, but you can use any other type of food-grade oil, such as: almond, avocado, grapeseed, hempseed, jojoba, or even olive oil.To make your sugar scrub even more nourishing, replace 1 tablespoon of your oil with vitamin E oil., If you don't own a microwave, you can assemble a double boiler, and heat the soap and oil in that., You can use any color or fragrance you like, but fragrances that work best in scrubs include: grapefruit, lavender, lemon, mint, or vanilla.

Fridge: 1 hour
Freezer: 30 minutes

, If you'd like, you can place a sheet of wax paper between each layer of cubes. The air-tight container is a must—it will keep the cubes from drying out.

Decide on a medium.,
Decide the size of your book.,
Create coloring pages by tracing other images.,
Write final drafts of the content.,
Create a cover and a title page.,
Print computer-generated content.,
Copy your book, if desired.,
Consider professional binding.,
Provide any supplementary supplies.",How to Make Activity Books for Children," Although it can be general, most books have a theme based on holidays, seasons, or your child's preferences. This is an important step because it will make it easier for you to come up with content to fill the pages. Having a coherent message will also make it easier for you to educate your child.


Holidays make good themes for activity books. You can educate your child about the cultural origins of the holiday and how people celebrate it. It also gets your child excited about the season.
Seasons of the year are also good themes. They can teach your child fun outdoor activities as well as cultural folklore surrounding that time of year.
If you want your activity book to tell a fun story, the theme may simply be adventure.
Some examples of other topics are family, farms, flowers, food, animals, history, and cultures.;
, You may already know that he or she enjoys - for example, coloring or doing simple crosswords. Ask your child their favorite activities or get together a few for he or she to try. Observe which your child enjoys the most. This is a good time to ask your child if he or she wants to help you make the activity book.Look in the newspaper for comic strips and puzzles. Children love comic book strips and they are a great way to encourage a burgeoning reader.
Examples of other children’s activities that could easily be compiled in an activity book are fill-in-the-blank stories, mazes, word search puzzles, and even open-ended doodling.
A few examples of creative activities that your child may not have tried before are stenciling, torn paper art, and stamps., In addition to reading, you can supplement an activity book with activities that include telling time, simple math, writing, vocabulary, history, and more. If you incorporate the lessons into the activities well enough, your child will only notice the fun they’re having. Choose activities at your child's level and search for them online, or write the problems yourself.


You may have a book that teaches your child days of the week, months, and holidays by having them write in the correct answer in the blanks.
Another example of educational content may be a series of mathematical crossword puzzles. If you can weave the puzzles into the plot of the book, it is a fun way for your child to learn basic arithmetic.

, This is a great opportunity to include your child in the story. Look at the types of stories they enjoy and try to create something similar. This will keep your child turning the pages and discovering what happened to his or her favorite character. Who knows, your child may enjoy the story so much you have to write a sequel.


Some examples of fun adventures may involve a child rescuing a pet, a family discovering what is in their attic on a snow day, or a knight journeying to a foreign land.
Try to include songs, nursery rhymes and poetry. This will draw your child in and promote an appreciation for music. You can write your own lyrics or put in well-known songs and poems. Choose songs that are based on the theme – such as ""Let it Snow"" for a winter-themed activity book. You all can sing the songs together.

, Now that you have a collection of activities, stories, and songs for your child to enjoy, you need to think about the physical makeup of the book. Will it be paper printouts, or will you get more creative with it? This is an excellent time to get your child involved in the joy of making something by hand.The simplest way to make an activity book is with a three ring binder or folders with built-in brads. You can print out or design pages, punch holes in the side, and put them in.
Fold computer paper in half to create an easy binding system. This will also make the book smaller and more easy for your child to handle.
Blank bound books are inexpensive. This will give the activity book a more polished feel. They are also a more interesting texture for your child to interact with. You can paste pages in the bound book, or draw on activities by hand.
A fun project is dry erase coloring exercises. Make the black and white outline on a piece of paper and place it in a plastic sheet protector. Give your child dry erase crayons and watch them redo the activity over and over again!, Larger books using an entire piece of paper for each page are good for coloring activities. If you use more word searches or are more interested in telling a story, opt for smaller paper or half sheets. Keep in mind that your child may want to take the book in their backpack, so make it small enough to fit. If your child will only play with it at home, you can afford to make a larger book.

, Print off family photos or large images and place them behind a white piece of A4 or 8.5""x11"" paper. Trace the image outlines using a thick black marker. This is a good way to create professional looking images for your child to color.

, It is easy to combine images and text in most computer project software, presentation software, and even word processing programs. Make sure you take note of which pages will be side-by-side when you print them out. This is especially important if you are binding the book by folding the paper in half.

, Be sure to include your child's name, such as ""David's Activity Book"" on the cover. A title page should list the authors, if you and your child have written a story together. Having a colorful and attention-grabbing cover will ensure that your child wants to pick up and open the book.

, Now you are ready to piece the book together. Collect your printed content and that you made by hand. Make sure you have them in the correct order before binding them together.


Number the pages on the front and back. Insert blank pages, if you want to have extra drawing paper.

, If you are making the book for more than 1 child, there are a few ways to create multiple copies. To give the copies a more handmade feel, you should repeat the same steps of drawing and printing out each page for every book. If you are creating the book for a large number of children or want to expedite the process, you can photocopy each spread to create a simple


If you use a three ring binder or folder with brads, you can continue to add activities.

, You may not have the materials to bind the book yourself, or might want a more professional look. Take your activity books to an office supply store or print shop. They have printing departments that can bind the book for you. This is usually inexpensive, depending on the materials you want them to use.

, Your book may require crayons, colored pencils, stickers, stencils or something else for your child to complete the activities. There are many ways to include them in the book. Stick a cloth pouch on the front with adhesive, or fold paper like an envelope.


Hand sewing a cloth pouch is a good activity for to teach your child basic sewing methods and safety.

Finish up the spa night with a 15 minute (or so) massage using oils of your choice.",How to Make a Nice Spa for Mom," Preferably, this should be away from other members of the family, if they're still at home, in order to create a more relaxed atmosphere.;
, Soft music can also be played in the background as a spa like addition.

, A basic facial should consist of a cleanse, exfoliation, mask, toner and moisturiser. As this facial is being done on another person as a spa treatment, avoid anything like steaming, as they then don't have to get up from their comfortable positioning. Products that you use for the facial can be your mom's skincare (because you know it's suited to her skin), or you can DIY.

, Using a balm or oil is more luxurious compared to everyday gel and cream washes. You can DIY using a blend of oil suited to your mom's skin type. To remove the oils from her face, heat a washcloth in hot water and then hold it over her face to steam away the oils and impurities, then gently buff away.

, DIY an exfoliator if you don't have one on hand; 1 tbsp honey, 1/4 tsp lemon juice, 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Honey has anti-bacterial properties and is natural humectant, so it will clear and soften the skin. Lemon juice will brighten the complexion. Cinnamon will gently exfoliate and warm the skin which will bring blood flow to the surface of the skin making it appear glowing and plump.

, While it sits, you can do your mom's nails. For a DIY mask take 2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 egg, 1 tbsp honey and 1 tbsp cream, mix it all together and apply to a clean face. Allow to sit for 10-15 minutes. Cocoa will draw out excess oils and impurities in the skin, the egg white will help to tighten pores whereas the protein in the egg yolk will moisturise. The cream contains lactic acid which will help get rid of any dead skin cells.

, Remove any excess nail polish and on your mom's nails before using a base coat, this will make sure the polish you apply stays on for longer. After applying the nail polish colour of her choice add a top coat to avoid it chipping. Once all the nail polish is dry use a cuticle cream or oil to nourish.

, After all the mask has been removed use a toner to rebalance the skin's PH and to also remove any residue from any of the products used recently. For a DIY toner you can use either rosewater (normal/dry skin) or witch hazel (combination/oily skin).

, Argan oil is the best moisturiser to use when you're having a spa night, as it has more of a spa-like feel to it as oppose to day-to-day moisturisers. It's also one of the most beneficial oils for all skin types. It helps to reduce wrinkles, acne scars, blemishes, prevents future breakout and hydrates the skin.

, If you don't have natural oils that you would prefer to massage with you can use baby oil. Other oils you can use include sweet almond and avocado.

Be sure to have everything ready and on hand before you start your spa, so that you don't have to interrupt your experience.


You don't have to do everything listed in this section. Choose items that appeal the most to you.;
, If it's been a while since you last cleaned your bathroom, give it a quick clean and hide any clutter from sight. If your bathtub looks grimy, give it a good scrub. Part of what makes spas look and feel so luxurious is how sparkling clean they are. A clean bathroom will also make your spa experience more enjoyable.While you are cleaning, turn off any electronics and other distractions. The one exception to this, of course, would be your music player!, A quick and simple way to do this is to stick your towels into the dryer for a few minutes; you can also leave them out in the hot sun for an hour or two. Once the towels are nice and toasty, set them down some place where they'll be easy to grab. This will give that final, luxurious touch to your spa.


If you have a bathrobe, warm it up, and have it nearby as well.

, Choose things like Zen music, nature sounds, instrumental, or classical music. Some channels on popular video and music-sharing websites (such as YouTube) have spa music play lists. Choose an extra-long play list, so that you don't have to get up and restart it.Even if you like fast, up-beat music, you might want to save those for a different day.

, They don't have to be scented, although a nice fragrance will certainly help! If you are hesitant about lighting candles in your bathroom, get some battery-operated ones—just be careful not to get them wet, or they will short-circuit. You could also plug in some Christmas lights; they will be just enough to cast a soft, dim light in your bathroom, but they won't be so bright as to distract you.If you don't like candles, you can also use incense, wax melts, or oil diffusers.

, Things like facemasks and foot soaks often take a while to do their ""magic,"" and not all bathrooms have a comfortable place to sit. Unless your bathroom has a comfy bench or chair, find a quiet spot in your room, and add some more candles and soft music., Some of the more expensive spas will often serve up refreshments, such as candy or drinks. It does not have to be anything fancy: lemon-water, herbal tea, or champagne are commonly served in spas.Keep food simple and to a minimum. Small candies, chocolates, grapes, nuts, or sliced strawberries would be ideal., This will help open up your pores, and make things like masks and lotions more effective. It will also help create a more spa-like atmosphere., You don't have to do everything that is listed here. Instead, pick the items that you have time for, need, or that appeal to you.

, This is great if you don't have much time. It will also help you relax. Fill a large bowl with hot water. If you want to get fancy, add a few drops of your favorite essential oil, a handful of fragrant herbs, or a couple of tea bags. Lean over the bowl, then cover your head with a towel to trap the steam. Sit down some place comfortable, and relax for about 10 minutes. After that, pour the water out, and follow up with your favorite scrub, mask, and/or lotion., You can use a store-bought scrub, or you can make your own using some sugar and oil. Apply the scrub in small, circular motions, then rinse it off with warm water. If you are using a body scrub, consider rinsing it off in the shower; this way, you don't have to dirty up the bath water for your soak!, Your hair needs just as much attention as your skin. You can use a store-bought hair mask, or you can whip up your own. Apply it to damp hair, then tuck your hair up under a shower cap. Wrap a warm towel around your hair to further the experience.Consider multitasking! Relax in your tub while the hair mask is working. Most hair masks need to be left on for at least 30 minutes.

, Fill your tub with warm water, then add your choice of bath salts, bubbles, bath fizzies, or essential oils. Slip into the tub, lean back against the wall, and relax for 15 to 20 minutes. You can use homemade or store-bought bath products. Once your bath is over, slip into a warm bathrobe.


For a quick and simple bath soak: fill your tub with warm water, then add 1 can of coconut milk, 1 tablespoon of almond oil, and 20 drops of your favorite essential oil.Rinse off in the shower. All those bath products are wonderful, but they often leave behind residue. Once your body feels relaxed, get out of the tub and drain the water. Then, turn the shower on, and rinse off. If you put on a hair mask, now is the time to wash those off too., The best time to apply body butter is right after you get out of the tub, when your skin is still damp. All those rich oils and butters will soak into your skin, and leave it feeling silky smooth. You can even give yourself a massage while applying it! You can use either store-bought body butter, or you can make your own.

, Both facemasks and foot soaks take little time to prepare, but a lot of time to do their ""magic."" It might be a good idea to do both at the same time. Prepare your foot soak, then apply your favorite facemask. Once you have it on, massage your favorite lotion onto your feet, then wrap them in plastic. After that, wrap them in a warm towel, and wait 10 to 15 minutes. Once the time is up, take the feet wraps off, and wash your mask off.Get extra cozy by slipping into a warm bathrobe first.
Dampen a towel, then heat it in the microwave for 30 to 60 seconds. You can also use spa socks instead., Fill a small tub with warm water, then add in your favorite foot soak. Slip your feet into the water, and relax for 10 to 15 minutes. You can pamper your feet further with foot scrubs, pumice stones, lotion, and a pedicure!, Take some leftover foot scrub or body scrub, and massage it onto your hands. Rinse it off, then apply some of your favorite hand lotion. Finish off with a manicure. It doesn't have to be perfect; just relax, listen to music, and have fun., If you don't own a bathrobe, you can slip into something you find comfortable, such as pajamas. Read a book, do your nails, put on some makeup, or listen to music. If you have any refreshments leftover, you can enjoy those too!

, In a large bowl, mix together 2 cups (480 grams) of Epsom salt, ½ cup (90 grams) of baking soda, and 40 drops of your favorite essential oil. For a more luxurious bath salt, add ¼ cup (60 grams) of sea salt. Once everything is mixed together and there are no more clumps, scoop everything into a glass jar. To use the bath salts: fill your tub with warm water, then stir in ¼ cup (60 grams) of your bath salts into it.You can use all one type of essential oil. For example, you could do 30 drops of lavender and 10 drops of peppermint., In a large bowl, stir together ½ to 1 cup (115 to 225 grams) of white or brown sugar and ½ cup (100 grams) of coconut or olive oil. Scoop everything into a glass jar when you are done. For an extra special scrub, consider adding any items listed below. To use the scrub: scoop out 1 tablespoon at a time, and massage it onto your arms or legs.½ teaspoon pumpkin pie spice or ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon vitamin E oil
½ to 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
15 to 20 drops essential oil

, In a double boiler, melt 1 cup (215 grams) of shea butter or cocoa butter, ½ cup (100 grams) of coconut oil, and ½ cup (120 milliliters) of almond or olive oil. Stir everything together, then chill in the fridge for 1 hour. Add in 10 to 30 drops of your essential oil, then beat everything with an electric mixer until it is light and fluffy. This will take about 10 minutes. Transfer everything into a glass jar, then chill it in the fridge for 10 to 15 minutes. After that, your body butter is ready to use!You can also use ½ cup (105 grams) of shea butter and ½ cup (105 grams) of cocoa butter for something extra special.Store your body butter at 75°F (24°C) or cooler, or it will melt., In a small bowl, mix together 1 tablespoon of plain yogurt and ¼ teaspoon of lemon juice or honey. Spread the mask over your face, taking care to avoid the eye area. Wait 10 minutes, then wash the mask off using warm water.Yogurt is naturally exfoliating and brightening. Try to use Greek, full-fat yogurt, if you can.Lemon juice can help brighten skin. It is also suitable for oily skin.
Honey is great for all skin types. It is naturally moisturizing, and great for acne-prone skin.

, In a small bowl, stir together ½ cup (100 grams) of coconut oil and ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of olive oil. For something more nourishing, add 10 drops of Argan oil. Massage the mask onto your hair and scalp, then tuck your hair under a shower cap for 5 to 10 minutes. Wash the mask out using shampoo; you may need to shampoo twice. Apply some leave-in conditioner when you are done., In a small bowl, mix together 2 teaspoons of ground oatmeal, 1 teaspoon of honey, and 1 teaspoon of sweet almond oil. Massage the scrub onto your face using small, circular motions, taking care to avoid the eye area. Rinse the scrub off with warm water, then splash your face with cool water to seal your pores.You can also leave the scrub on for 4 to 5 minutes. This will make it more like a mask.
If you can't find sweet almond oil, try olive oil or coconut oil.
If you can't find ground oatmeal, you can grind it yourself using a blender, food processor, or coffee grinder.
The oatmeal will help gently exfoliate and moisturize your skin. The honey will help moisturize your skin, and kill any acne-causing bacteria. The oil will help moisturize, nourish, and cleanse your skin., If you plan on wearing makeup, then a lip scrub is a great way to prep your lips! In a small dish, combine 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of honey, and 1 teaspoon of olive oil or coconut oil. Massage the scrub onto your lips, then rinse it off with warm water. Store any leftovers in a small jar.For some lip plumping action, stir in ½ teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
For a tasty scrub, stir in ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract.

, Fill a glass jar with 2 cups (480 grams) of Epsom salts and ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of minty mouthwash. Stir until the salt is evenly-soaked; you will get something that feels like wet sand. To use the scrub: massage 1 to 2 tablespoons of the scrub onto your feet, then rinse it off. Store the rest of the scrub in a cool, dry place.This scrub will help exfoliate and deodorize your feet. It will leave them feeling refreshed, making it ideal after a long day of walking.

, Fill a glass jar with ½ cup (120 grams) of Epsom salts and 2 tablespoons (25 grams) of baking soda. If you'd like something extra-special, add 6 drops of your favorite essential oil; peppermint, lavender, or eucalyptus work great for foot soaks! Close the jar, and shake it everything until it is evenly combined. To use the scrub:Fill a plastic tub or basin with warm water; make sure that it is big enough for your feet.
Stir in 2 tablespoons of your foot soak.
Dip your feet into the water.
Relax for 10 to 15 minutes.
Store the rest of the foot soak powder in a cool, dry place.

Go stationery shopping.,
Tidy your room!,
Set your desk in the right place.,
Power off your computer.,
Add some music for ambiance.,
While studying, make sure the room's door is closed.,
Learn for yourself, not for exams.,
Don't hate the subject.,
Think about the benefits that come with a good understanding.,
Use your colorful pens, stickers etc.,
Eat snacks while studying, and drink some juice.

,
Share the study time.,
Reward yourself once in a while.,
Have fun!",How to Love Studying," Buy yourself large cute notebooks which have simple life quotes or something you like on the cover, buy some colorful pens, highlighters, sticky notes, stickers, anything you need for studying. This may motivate you.;
, You don't want to study because your room probably is messy. Right? It definitely distracts you. Just clean it up and organize your desk and bookshelf which your studying materials are in.

, If you like simplicity, throw away your unnecessary stuff on the desk. If you like a cozy and candid places instead, organize your desk by your contents. For example, mount a board that you can stick your study notes.
, Or your iPad / mobile phone. Forget about internet. If you go online much, delete your accounts. Concentrate on your future life and your plans/dreams.

, Make a playlist full of songs that have no lyrics. Like electronic/techno or classical/jazz, such as instrumental. Don't go for a studying with music without making a playlist because you have to change the song and try to find the right one every single track ends.


Music isn't for everyone; if it is too distracting, skip this step.

, So it will block the noise coming from other rooms and you can focus more.

, Most students think they must learn or they won't have a job etc. No, that is the first false point. Be interested in things you learn in school. Like history, it can be pretty interesting if you listen to your teacher without thinking you learn it for the exams.

, It's easy to hate a subject because you find it boring, hard or irrelevant. However, every subject is awaiting discovery, unfolding of its many layers and it you haven't even tried to dig away at those layers, you'll never really know what's at the heart of the subject and just how interesting and challenging it can be for you. Keep trying and make it your aim to discover the fascinating side to each subject.

, You have more choices in life as to what you pursue, you might be top of the class, you know more things and you understand the world a little better than before the studying. Each set of learning builds on the last set, making sense of the greater puzzle.

, Write the important notes on your sticky notes and stick them on your notebook. Use related stickers on your notes. The colors help you to remember and they're a lot of fun to use.

,, If it helps, you can study with a friend as this will help you feel more motivated and someone is supporting you all the way. However if friends just distract you learn to organize your time between leisure and studying.

, This is especially important when you've experienced an amazing studying marathon, such as before a test or exams, or to get an assignment finished on time. You get two rewards in one then - the learning and passing, and the reward you've promised yourself.


Rewards can include watching a movie or TV show, going for a mall visit with friends, hanging out with friends, spending more time with your pets, etc.

, You don't have to separate learning from fun. No you don't have to make watching science fiction your all time hobbies. Everyday just try to use learning in your day to day life. Learn a name of a flower, about the history of your local centre, etc. Learning is everywhere!

Draw a circle on a blank piece of paper.,
Draw a second circle that overlaps the first in the middle of the paper.,
Ensure that there is enough space to write on the far sides of both circles and where they overlap in the middle.,
Use the Venn diagram for comparing and contrasting two things.,
Contrast the two things in the outer circles and compare them in the middle overlap.",How to Make a Graphic Organizer1," It is best to lay the paper horizontally so that you have plenty of room for drawing.


Using a compass to help you draw the circle will make sure that it is evenly sized and neat. If using a compass, gently hold both legs of the compass to avoid having the pencil end push out, enlarging your circle and making it uneven.
Draw the circle to one side, not in the middle.;
, For example, if you drew your first circle more to the right, then this circle should sit more to the left while still overlapping the first.


Keep your compass at the same setting so that your two circles are the same size.

, If you do not have enough space, then it would be best to erase and start over, or to start over from scratch on a new piece of paper, with bigger circles.

, At the top of each circle, write the things you are comparing, such as books, people, movies, animals, et cetera. Where the circle overlaps in the middle, write “Both.”

, In each of the outer circles, list details about each thing that make it distinctly separate and different from the other thing. In the middle, list details that those two things have in common.

Draw a vertical line down the middle of your paper.,
Draw a second line horizontally across the paper so that it intersects with the vertical line.,
Write a heading at the top of each column, in the small space you left between the top of the page and the horizontal line.,
List the details about each thing that make it different from the other.",How to Make a Graphic Organizer2," Use a ruler to help you keep the line straight, and draw the line from top-to-bottom.


It does not matter if your paper is vertical or horizontal; it is your preference based on how much room you would like to have for writing from side-to-side.

, Use your ruler to measure about ½-1 inch from the top so that you leave room to write headings at the top of each column.

, The T-chart is used for comparing and contrasting things, so you will write the two things you are comparing in each heading. Examples of things to compare include:


Computers
Smartphones
Stories
People
Cities
Countries

, Use bullet points or numbers to organize your list. Keep the details in the correct column.


There is no column or space to write what the two things have in common, like in the Venn diagram above. You will simply list how the two things differ from one another.
For example, you might list how the United States is different from Australia. Under the “United States” heading, you would list information such as population size, number of states, the Constitution, and other pertinent information. Then, under the “Australia” heading, you would list the corresponding information about Australia.

Draw a box in the top left corner of your paper, which should lay horizontally.,
Leave 1 inch of space to the right of the box, and then drawn an identical box in the middle of the page (3 inches square).,
Measure another inch to the right of the middle box, and complete the top row by drawing a third box of identical dimensions (3 inches square).,
Draw arrows to the right in the 1 inch spaces between the boxes, aiming from left to right.,
Number the left box “1,” the middle box “2,” and the far right box “3.” Keep the numbers small, as you will write other information in these boxes.,
Move to the bottom of the page and repeat drawing three 3” x 3” boxes along the bottom of the page with 1-inch gaps in between them.,
Draw arrows to the left between the boxes, going from right to left.,
Number the right box “4,” the middle box “5,” and the left box “6.” Remember to keep the numbers small so that you leave room to write in the boxes.,
Draw an arrow vertically downward from box 3 to box 4.,
Fill the boxes with information pertaining to a sequence of events or timeline.",How to Make a Graphic Organizer3," Use a ruler to help you draw straight lines, and make each box about 3 inches square. This leaves room to write inside the box.

, Use your ruler to help you measure the correct side lengths of the box.

, There should now be a row along the top of your paper taken up with three 3” x 3” boxes with 1 inch of space between each.

, You should have an arrow pointing from the left box to the middle box and then from the middle box to the right box.

,


Write the numbers in one of the corners of the boxes, such as the top left corner. You can put an additional small box around the numbers to separate them from the text that will be written in them.

, You should now have almost identical rows of three boxes along the top and bottom of the page, with approximately 2 inches of space between the top and bottom rows.

, Therefore, you should draw an arrow to the left from the right box to the middle box and then from the middle box to the left box.

,


Again, you can draw small boxes around the numbers to separate them from the text that will be written inside them.
Write the numbers in the same corner that you chose for the top row so that the chart is consistent.
The top row should read “1” to “3” from left to right, and the bottom row should read “4” to “6” from right to left.

, As someone is reading the flow chart, this tells them that their eyes should jump straight down the right side of the page and not diagonally across it.

, Flow charts are extremely useful for examining a sequence of events and seeing how one thing leads to another.


Plot events in a story, such as the events leading up to the climax
How to do something, in the order of “First, you do this...” and “Next, you do that...”
Significant events in a war or historical moment, like the major events of the American Revolution that led to its conclusion

Draw a large rectangle on your paper.,
Determine how to split your rectangle into five same-sized rows.,
Measure from the top of the rectangle down to the correct distance that you found in Step 2.,
Place the end of your ruler on this new line, and measure down the distance from Step 2 again.,
Measure the distance from Step 2 from the bottom of your second row and make a third small horizontal mark.,
Put the end of your ruler on the line along the bottom of your third row and measure the distance from Step 2 one last time.,
Measure 1 inch from the left side of the rectangle and make a small vertical mark with your pencil.,
Write categories for summarizing in the 1-inch vertical column on the left side of the summary chart.,
Fill in the rows next to each category with the information from the story or passage that answers that question.",How to Make a Graphic Organizer4," Your paper can be vertical or horizontal, depending on your preference.


You can draw your rectangle just inside the edges of the paper, so that it is almost the same size as the paper. This will allow you to have nice, large boxes in which to write summary information from a story, book, textbook, or other reading passage.
Use a ruler to help you make the rectangle so that the edges are straight.

, Take the height of your large rectangle and divide it by five to get an approximate measurement for the height of each row.


For example, if your paper is vertical, then 11” divided by 5 equals 2.2” (or approximately 2 ¼”) for the height of your rows. If your paper is horizontal, then 8.5” divided by 5 equals 1.7” (or approximately 1 2/3”) for the height of each row.

, Make a small horizontal mark with your pencil at that measurement.


Then, you need to turn your ruler horizontally, so that it is parallel with the top of the large rectangle, and draw a line across the width of your rectangle. It should be perpendicular to the sides of the rectangle.

, Then, repeat the process of marking a small horizontal line at the correct distance and tracing a horizontal line across the width of your large rectangle.


You now have two of the five rows that you need for your summary chart.

, Trace a line along your ruler horizontally so that you have a third row across the width of your rectangle.

, Make your horizontal mark at that distance, and draw your line across the width.


This last line separates row 4 and row 5. You should now have five same-sized rows across the width of your rectangle.
Do your best to measure each row to the correct size with your ruler.

, Then, use your ruler to draw a line vertically from the top of the rectangle to the bottom at that 1-inch mark.

, You can use this summary chart to summarize a reading passage, story, book, or nonfiction passage. Here is a basic way to summarize most stories or articles, so you would write each of these in one of the five boxes along the narrow vertical column on the left:


Who?
What?
When?
Where?
Why?

, You can use bullet points, numbers, or complete sentences.


For example, next to “Who,” you will write the person, people, or characters who are involved. Then, next to “Where,” you would write the setting of the story or where the article takes place. After that, you would answer “When” by writing the date or time period. Next, you can answer “What” by describing what happened, like a major plot event or the topic of a news article. Lastly, you will answer “Why” by explaining why that event happened, according to the details given in the story, article, et cetera.

Write about the advantages and disadvantages of being a mermaid.,
Write about the ocean or another body of water.,
Write about your everyday life.,
Learn about mermaids.,
Remember to keep your journal safe from prying eyes.",How to Write a Mermaid Journal," Look for journals that remind you of the sea, like a beach-themed one or one that has a dolphin on it. It doesn't have to be entirely sea themed though. Add your own ideas for the front cover: If you want to decorate a journal yourself, just take some glue-on or stick-on gems, glitter, stickers, or any other mermaid/ocean type decorations for your journal, and put them on. You can even make a bookmark by attaching a fake/real seashell to a ribbon for an ocean-inspired look. Don't forget to add a title to your journal! You can write something like, ""My Secret Life"", ""Life as a Mermaid"", or ""Skin to Scales"".;
, Now that you have your mermaid journal, you are ready to start writing. Talk about how you became a mermaid. Did you wander into a secret magical pool? Did someone cast a spell on you? Or maybe you were born a mermaid? Talk about your family and friends. Do they know or do you keep it a secret from them? Are any of your friends or family mermaids/mermen too? Include some descriptions of your friends, family, and school life.

, Write about how long it takes you to transform into a mermaid after touching water, like in the Australian TV shows: H2O: Just Add Water, or Mako Mermaids. Or, if you can decide when you turn into a mermaid, write about it. Do you have special powers that come along with being a mermaid? You also may want to include sketches of your tail. Can you breathe underwater, or can you hold your breath for a long period of time? Can you talk to sea creatures? Is there a special animal that you can talk to, like a companion or guardian? Write about it on your ""facts page"". What kind of mermaid are you? Are you a lake mermaid, or an ocean mermaid? A ship-saver or wish-giver? There are many types of mermaids. Find out which one you are (or want to be) and write about it.

, What are some difficulties you experience? What are some advantages of being a mermaid? IS there anything that makes being a mermaid fun or bad? Write it down!

, It's your second home! Write about how the moon affects the waves (tidal pulls), about the creatures that live there, and about the adventures you've had in the ocean. If there's a special cave or place that means a lot to you in the ocean (or whatever body of water you live near) you can write about that too.

, Being a mermaid equals having an interesting life. Write about how someone almost found out you were a mermaid or any drama that's going on. Did any friends recently find out that they are mermaids/mermen too, or find out about your mermaid secret? Remember to write about some everyday things too (if you were a mermaid scared away, write about things you are bewildered by, like the cash register). Even mermaids have to go to the store to buy their mothers' bread sometimes!

, Study folklore and conduct your own ""experiments"". A good book to look into is ""The Secret World of Mermaids"" by Francine Rose. By researching mermaids, you can find out a lot about yourself as a mermaid. You may even find that there are a lot more mer-people that are living a double life, just like you! You could even have a special talent that you never knew about. Write your discoveries in your journal, so that you'll remember what you found. This information could come in handy with finding out what's true and what's a myth. Who knows, your journal could help some other mermaid who doubles as a human too someday...

, If your journal gets into the wrong hands, it could be a disaster: life as we know it could change drastically. It's better for mermaids to remain as mysterious as the ocean.

You may want to read the letter when you’re 18, 25, or 30 years old. Choosing an age will help you define the goals you want to achieve by that time in your life.You may want to choose an age that puts you in different circumstances than you are currently in. If you write the letter as a freshman in high school and read it when you’re in college, you’ll be able to see how much your life has changed and whether or not your goals have been met.;
, You’re writing this letter to yourself, so don’t feel you have to take a formal tone. Write as though you are talking to your best friend.When talking about your current self in this letter, use “I” language. When talking about your future self in this letter, use “you” language.

, Your letter should start with a quick reminder of who you currently are. Think about mentioning your recent accomplishments, such as a 4.0 GPA, and current interests, including extracurricular activities. This will allow you to see how much your life has changed since you wrote the letter., Think about fears you may have, such as speaking in front of a group, moving out after high school, or not getting accepted at the college you want to go to. You’ll be able to see if you’ve overcome these issues in the future. Also, thinking about them now may help you realize that they may not be so bad after all, or even help you come up with strategies to cope or a backup plan., Ask yourself what guides the current you. Your belief system (whether religious or secular) and your personal code of ethics play a large role in your actions. Making yourself conscious of your values can help shape your ideas of who you want to be in the future.Include information about your church, if you belong to one, or values like accepting everyone’s faith, or lack thereof. Add morals that guide you, such as always being kind, or helping others in need.

, Pick out a few skills or abilities you can clearly identify in your current life, like winning a tennis tournament, leading the marching band, or organizing school functions. You may be a great writer or excel at math. Thinking about what you are good at now can help you decide what you want to accomplish later in life., Write about things that are important to you now, such as playing varsity soccer or getting into a good college. You should also think about what you hope to accomplish in the future, such as travel to Europe, publish an article in a magazine, or get your band a gig., Perhaps you want to quit arguing with your sister, or stop biting your nails. Maybe you want to continue going to church every week, or keep getting all As. You may want to start volunteering in your community or join a sport or club. Put these goals in your letter to see if you have achieved them in the future., Think about what advice you want to give your future self. Your advice can be simple or complex. Examples include “be nice to Mom,” “invest money in the stock market,” “attend church every week,” “don’t worry so much,” “take college seriously,” or “save up money for a nice car.” Consider what issues you struggle with currently to help you think of advice for your future self., These questions should make the current you reflect on what you’ll need to do to become who you want to be, while making the future you reflect on what you’ve done to reach the point you’ll be at. You can ask yourself:

Do you enjoy your job?
What do you do to relax?
Who is the most important person in your life?
What is your relationship with your parents like?
If you could change one thing about your life what would it be?

, Don’t be tempted to read the letter before it is time. Seal it in an envelope or tape it closed. This will also help preserve the letter, especially if you don’t plan to read it for 10-20 years. If your letter is digital, archive it or move it to a folder that you can find when it is time to read the letter., If you’ve chosen to write or print a hardcopy of your letter, you need to keep it somewhere that is both readily accessible and safe from the elements. If the letter itself isn’t easy to spot in your everyday life, you’ll need to write yourself a note that will be; otherwise, you may forget about the letter when it’s finally time to read it. You can store the letter in a memory box or even put it in a time capsule.If you keep a journal, consider writing the letter directly in your journal and marking the page, or writing the letter separately and tucking it in between the pages of your journal.

, Search out and use a program, website, or application that will let you send emails/texts to your future self. Note, though, that this option works better for short-term letters than long-term ones since you can’t be certain that the website or application you use will still be around 20 years into the future.


You might consider using a digital calendar (like Google Calendars), note-taking software (like Evernote),or a letter-writing website (like FutureMe)."

, You can also include starters about your un/favourite things to do such as ""I like eating..."", ""My favourite film is..."" and so on. Write at least 12 sentence starters. After you've finished add your personal information and pictures. Add descriptions if you like, so that it will be more interesting.

, You can embellish it with doodles, zig-zags and colours.

, Write about what seems more relevant such as if you're feeling particularly hungry that day you may write ""I feel like eating a candy bar right this instant. Think about a chocolate twice my size. I can see myself licking it, gnawing it carefully..."". Once you start your imagination will flow.

, If you want it to be completely private, considering keeping your Life Book in a computer and password protecting it until it's finished. DO NOT purchase one of those diaries with locks as they break fairly easily.

, If you are feeling uninspired follow the same procedures as you did when you started.

, If you typed it, it is time to print and bind it. If you are writing in the computer than consider having it one hundred pages as that is a reasonable amount to tell the story of your life. If your story is typed you can change fonts and add images more easily. However, a notebook never looses it's beauty and charm.

Learn from the greats!",How to Write a Journal," Traditionally, people who kept journals used literal, physical journals - small paper notebooks. You may want to use a cheap spiral or composition notebook or opt for a nicer hardcover journal. Today, however, a variety of additional digital options are also available. Any sort of computer program that allows you to input and save text is a potential journal - conventional word processors work well, as do free cloud-based writing programs like Google Docs.


If you're looking at computer-based options for your journal, you might want to consider starting a blog - essentially an online journal that other people can read. A variety of free blog sites exist, some of which allow you to control who can and cannot read your blog.

, To begin writing in your journal, label your first entry with the date, time and, optionally, location. For instance, you might start with ""Monday, January 1, 1.00p.m., Bedroom"". Next, if you'd like to, write a salutation. Many journal-writers like to use ""Dear Journal"" or a similar greeting to start each entry. However, this is completely optional.


If you're writing a blog, you may want to begin by addressing your readers.

, Let your emotions flow! There's no right way to write in your journal - however you feel in the moment is how you should write. In terms of subject matter, don't hold back - no topic is off limits. Your feelings, your dreams, your crush, your family life, and much more are topics you might consider exploring. Or, if you're feeling pretty average, you might just describe your day! Let your heart flow through your pen or keyboard. Get your true feelings down on the page - don't settle for anything less.


As an exception to this rule, if you're writing a blog, while you'll want to be open with your emotions, consider your audience. You may want to consider censoring your most intense and/or personal thoughts.

, Journals are best if they're added to frequently. Writing often allows you to keep constant, ongoing record of your thoughts and feelings. So, keep writing! It's easy to lose steam after the first few enthusiastic entries, but the benefits of keeping a journal are greatest if you can manage to make a routine of it.


Many journal-writers like to add an entry every night before bed. This is a healthy routine because it allows the writer to relax and unwind at the end of the day by ""letting out"" any lingering emotions.

, Why write your thoughts down if you never intend to read them? It's always good to take a few minutes every once in a while to look at your finished work. You may be surprised by how you felt in the past! Being able to assess your past thoughts and emotions objectively with the benefit of being separated from them by time can give you insights into how to proceed with your life in the future.


Use your past entries to reflect on your life. As you read, ask yourself questions like, ""Am I the same person who wrote this entry?"", ""Is my life going the way I want it to?"", and ""How can I work to solve any problems that may have been troubling me when I wrote this entry?""

, Each entry in your journal should be uniquely ""you"". Unless you're keeping a journal solely to record the empirical facts of each day (miles walked, tasks completed, etc.), you should try to have fun with your journal entries! Add doodles in the margins, lyrics, movies reviews, and anything else you want - it's all up to you!

, If you don't have your journal, you can't write in it! Travel is one of the best opportunities for journal writing - long days spent in planes, trains, and automobiles offer plenty of chances to write at length, and the unique experiences you often find yourself in while traveling practically beg for comment. Write frequently as you travel and be a constant observer - keep your eyes and ears open for new sensations and experiences so that you can write about them.


The experiences you have while travelling can be some of the most influential ones in your life. Discovering the beauty of nature, making a friend in a far-off place, and even simply leaving your home can shape you, so document these things!

, Unless your want your journal to be as plain and unassuming as possible (which is a legitimate option if you're worried about other people reading it), experiment with customizing your journal. The exact way you do so is up to you! If your journal is a notebook, for instance, you may want to decorate the outside with drawings or stickers. Inside, you may want to include photographs, newspaper clippings, pressed flowers, and more!


If you're using a digital journal, like a blog, try adding photographs to your posts, including links, and choosing colorful templates.

, Unless your journal is a blog that's open to the entire internet-browsing public, you should probably assume that no one will read it but you. If you choose to share it later, it'll be up to you to do so, but a journal is perfectly useful even if it's never shared. Try to consider your journal as a ""safe haven"" for your innermost thoughts. It's a place where you won't have to worry about being judged or embarrassed about the way you feel, so have no shame while you write.

, Most people have internal thoughts that they ""filter"" whenever they interact with other people. If you meet an ugly person on the street, for instance, you would never blurt out that you find them ugly - instead, you choose which thoughts to let out and which thoughts to keep in. The trick to good journal writing is to ""turn down"" or even ""turn off"" this filter. This can be tricky - often, its' something people don't have a lot of experience doing.


If you're having trouble turning off your filter, try writing ""free form"" as an exercise - scrawling your thoughts down in a stream-of-consciousness form the moment they come to you, whether they make sense or not.

, While you'll want each journal entry to stand up on its own merits, you may find that your entries can be made better by explicitly referencing past entries. By searching for explanations of why you wrote the way you did previously, you can come to a greater understanding of your own emotions.


For instance, were you in a miserable mood when you wrote yesterday, but are now feeling better? Comment on this! By doing so, you may start to understand why you felt this way in the first place.

, Not every day will be eventful. Writing won't always come easy. Instead of giving up for the day, try, instead, to answer any one of the hundreds (if not thousands) of journal prompts available online. Writing educators occasionally use journal-writing as an academic exercise - when they do, they sometimes share the writing prompts for the exercise online. A simple search engine query like ""journal writing prompts"" can yield dozens of interesting results. Use the tools at your disposal for consistent journal greatness!


You may find that, by pursuing a prompt, your writing ventures into interesting new areas you might otherwise never have explored. Be adventurous and pursue these new topics to your heart's content!

, Many famous and highly influential books are either the actual journals of real people or works of fiction written in the form of a journal. Both can help you become a great journal writer. Below are just a few of the works you may want to consult for inspiration:


The diary of Samuel Pepys

The Diary of a Young Girl (Anne Frank's diary)
The diary of Jemima Conduct
The diary of Franz Kafka
Bridget Jones's Diary
Diary of a Wimpy Kid
The Color Purple
Flowers for Algernon
Dracula
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes

Just make sure that it contains blank pages you can write on, and that the pages are bound up so they won't scatter and get lost.

, If you chose to use a word processor in Step 1, you can skip this step. If you're using an actual book, locate a pen you like. (You can use pencil to write in your journal, but it will fade dramatically over time.) Some journal-keepers have a particular brand of pens that they prefer, or they favor a certain style (such as gel pen over ballpoint). Either way, your writing implement should feel comfortable in your hand and help you write at a pace you enjoy.

, You might want to bring your journal with you wherever you go, so that you can write down your thoughts as they strike you. You could choose a particular time each day to sit down and clear your head. Whatever you decide, make it a habit. Journaling as part of a routine will make you more likely to stick with it.

, Place yourself in an environment that makes you feel calm and want to write , whether it's the privacy of your own room or a busy coffee shop. If you're not sure where you like to write, try out a few different locations at different times during the day.

, This may seem a real drag, but this is the only real rule when it comes to keeping a journal. You’ll be amazed just how useful having each entry dated can be.

, As you begin your journal entry, write down your thoughts as they occur to you. If you're stumped, start out by discussing what you did during the day, or any major epiphanies you've had lately. These topics might lead you to other interesting topics about with you can write.


Try to see your journal as ""thinking on paper."" Your thoughts don't need to be perfectly constructed or written with the right grammar and punctuation. Instead, try to think of your journal as a space where you can write out and organize your thoughts and feelings.
Don't feel self-conscious. Unless you're planning on showing your journal to someone else, remember that it's just for your eyes and don't worry about what other people think. Feeling free to express yourself is a vital part of keeping a meaningful journal.

, Try incorporating different styles of writing into your journal, such as lists, poems, screenplays or stream-of-consciousness writing. You could also include artwork such as sketches, drawings and collages.

, You might stop writing as soon as you feel like you've exhausted your thoughts, or after you've reached a certain page limit. Whatever you choose, stop before you feel completely drained - remember, you want to have enough energy to come back to your journal and write again.

, Either read it directly after making the entry or set aside a time to read your past entries. You can potentially gain a lot of insight from going over your journal.

, The more dedicated you are to your journal, the more valuable it becomes. Find ways to make journalism a habit, and keep doing it.

Understand the assignment.,
Stick to a schedule.,
Date each entry.,
Start writing the entry.,
Write in first-person.,
Make sure each entry is long enough.,
Conclude each entry with a closing thought.",How to Write a Journal Entry3," Have you been assigned to keep a journal of your personal experiences, or a journal of your thoughts as you read a certain book? Whatever it is, make sure you read and reread the assignment so that you understand it well.

, You'll probably need a set number of entries in your journal in order to pass the assignment. Instead of trying to write them all the night before the journal is due, try to keep a schedule. If you forget to write your entries, set an alarm on your phone, or ask someone else to remind you periodically.

, Start each journal entry by noting the date. If you want to note what time it is when you start writing, you can do that, too.

, One or two lines beneath the date, start writing your journal entry. Here are some suggestions to consider if you're writing the journal for a school assignment:


Reflect on what you've learned. How do you plan to apply it to your own life?
Quote pieces of the book or assignment that were meaningful to you. After you've included the quote, write why you like it.
Discuss your thoughts or impressions about the assignment. For instance, if you're supposed to write the journal as you read a book, you could talk about your reaction to a certain character or chapter.

, Because a journal is meant to be a personal narrative, you should probably write it from a first-person perspective. That means using ""I"", ""me"", ""mine"" or ""my"" in your sentences.

, If your assignment specifies how long each entry is supposed to be, stick to that number. If not, shoot for about 200 to 300 words per entry.

, As you're wrapping up your entry for the day, it might be nice to summarize your thoughts in a sentence or two. For instance, you could start with ""What I've really learned today is..."" or ""I'd like to spend more time thinking about...""

Consider prewriting your response to the text.",How to Write a Journal Response to a Book," The first half of any journal response should involve a concise summary and analysis of the book and any main points the author seems to make. The summary section of your journal should be thorough enough that you could read through your journal response and be able to write a short paper on the book.Address what the main thesis is for the reading. What is the reading about, and why did the author write the text?
Acknowledge any conclusions or commentary/arguments the author arrives at. If the book is about something, like the social and political happenings of the author's time, what does the author ultimately think and how do you know this?
Incorporate one or two important quotes that are representative of the rest of the text.

, The second half of a journal response should be your commentary on the text. This part of the journal is your subjective opinion of the book and any arguments or conclusions you believe are present in the text. While the summary focuses on the ""what"" of the reading, your commentary should focus on the ""why.""Don't be afraid to make connections between the book and your own life; if there is a theme or character that speaks to you, write about why.
Address and evaluate the author's arguments and conclusions, which should have been detailed in the summary part of your journal.
Think of the commentary as either supporting or rejecting (what you consider) the author's main points.
Justify your opinions in the commentary. Agreeing or disagreeing is only the first step; for a thorough response, you'll need to analyze your own opinions and arrive at a reason why you had that reaction.

, The goal of a reading response journal is to give yourself a semi-private space to reflect on the text and develop your thoughts and opinions. You don't need to have it all figured out right from the start, but your journal should help you figure it out along the way.Allow yourself to explore a topic covered in the summary. Think about why you believe the author addressed certain subjects, as well as what you think about those subjects and the author's depiction.
Analyze your opinions. Don't just write that you liked or disliked something, or that you agreed or disagreed with it - dig deeper and figure out why.
Ask yourself: How far can I run with a given idea, and how can I make sense of it? Think of your journal as a place to make sense of both the academic and personal experience of reading a given book.As your journal progresses over the course of the semester or school year, your responses should become longer and more complex.
You should be able to chart the development of your thoughts within each individual response and across the journal as a whole.

, At the very least, your journal entries should be dated. You may also want to use headings and titles so that you can easily identify a given response to a particular text.Remember, the point of a response journal is to be able to track your own progress with that book and to better understand your experience of reading it.


Consider using clear and descriptive headings in your journal. It will help you more easily find your thoughts and insights as you read through your journal at a later date.It's okay if the actual journal entries wander a bit while exploring the subject - in fact, this can be very helpful.The goal is to organize your journal as a whole so that you can make sense of your entries and track your progress.

, Critical analysis of a text may require more than one reading. Try to absorb the general ideas during the first reading, then come back to the particular ideas and concepts while you re-read (if you have time to do a second reading). At the very least, reading critically should require you to think about what you're reading and engage with the text every step of the way.Try to get a general understanding of what the text is about before you read it. You can do this by reading a summary, skimming the chapter(s), or browsing a reader's companion to a given text.
Contextualize the text in terms of its historical, biographical, and cultural significance.
Ask questions about the text. Don't just passively read the book; analyze what's being said and have an ""argument"" in your notes when you disagree with the author.
Be aware of your personal response to the text. What shaped your beliefs on that subject, and how might your beliefs be similar to or different from the author's (or a reader of his or her time)?
Identify the main thesis of the text and try to trace how it develops over the course of the book.

, Writing notes in the margins of a text is called annotating the text. When you annotate, you jot down your initial thoughts and impressions, your reactions, and any questions that you're left with as you read through the text.Annotations don't have to be eloquent. They can be half-formed thoughts and impressions, or even exclamations.
Some critical readers annotate a text to clarify things that were vague in the text. Other readers annotate to assess and evaluate the author's arguments.
Try to make your annotations as diverse as possible so that your notes approach the subject matter from multiple angles.

, Once you've finished the reading and annotated the text, you should take some time to read your notes. Your annotations are essentially a note to yourself. Read through your notes and try to process the thoughts you laid out on the page before you attempt to write a response to the text.Try to read through your annotations within a day of writing them, and then several times over the following weeks.

, After critically reading the text, annotating its pages, and freewriting or making a story map/web, you'll have a lot of information about the reading to work with. Some notes will be more useful than others, and evaluating those notes can help you decide what information is vital to the summary and commentary of your journal response.Highlight or draw a star next to the 10 or so notes, comments, or passages that you identify as being somewhat significant.
Underline or put a second star next to the five notes/comments/passages that you think are most significant. They can be significant to the plot, to your understanding of the plot, or to the argument you hope to support in your response.

, Story mapping and webbing can help you recognize patterns in the book, clarify the relationships between characters, and chart the overall plot of the story. Some critical readers may not need this step or find it helpful, while others may find that story maps/webs can be a valuable tool when it comes time to write a response.


Story webs are typically organized by a central topic or question in the middle, surrounded by boxes or bubbles that link to that topic and support, deny, or comment on that topic or question.
Story maps can be more like a flow chart. They track the major plot points and break down the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the book in a visual format.

, Freewriting can be helpful if you're not sure how to begin a journal entry or if you haven't figured out what you thought about the reading. It is unstructured and informal, which makes it a great opportunity to ramble on the page. Freewriting allows you to explore your thoughts until you figure out where to begin your commentary on the text.Try not to copy your freewriting word for word into your journal. Instead, pull out a few key thoughts and phrases, then try to expand on them to develop your ideas for the journal entry.

, If you're still not sure where to begin your journal response, prewriting may help. Prewriting involves listing your responses or reactions to various elements of the book. For example, you might write out ""I see in chapter two that _______,"" or ""I felt that _________."" Think of prewriting as a step between freewriting and composing the actual journal response.Freewriting can be helpful to work out your summary of the reading, where prewriting may be useful for working out your commentary on the text.
Try not to restrict or limit yourself while prewriting. Let yourself explore the thoughts and opinions you had as you read the text and trace those thoughts to their logical conclusions.

Be Thankful.,
Make it a rule to write down a certain number of things you are thankful for per day.,
Many people start by writing down basic material things that they are grateful for in their lives.,
Write about extended material things in your life.,
Describe how you are grateful for yourself.,
Think about your abilities.,
Consider the people in your life.,
Write about situations and experiences.",How to Start a Gratitude Journal," Thankfulness is an attitude that you can practice and develop. Cultivating gratitude as the norm in your life will make keeping a gratitude journal much easier.;
, Avoid repeating the same things. This will make writing in the journal more challenging as time goes on, but that's how your awareness and thankfulness will grow. You'll be challenging yourself to find new things to be thankful for that perhaps you never noticed before.

, It's easiest to recognize things that sustain your life here on Earth like your house, your bed, your clothes, your food etc. Be sure to explain how this makes you feel and why you're grateful for it.


Example - I am grateful for my house. My house warms my body and shelters and protects me. It gives me a sense of relief knowing that there is always a comforting place to come back to.

, These things vary from person to person depending on what you like and take interest in. For example, if you love to paint, you may be grateful for the paint that you have. Or, if you like music you may be grateful for your CD collections.

, You can start by feeling grateful to be alive at all. Then start writing about feeling grateful to have the body you have, even if you don't like everything. Avoid the trap of being grateful for something that is better than what other people have. Instead, compare whatever you are grateful for with how you would feel if you didn't have it at all.

, You may start with basic abilities like your ability to see, your ability to hear, your ability to walk. Then progress to the extended abilities that are unique to you. Think about skillful things like dancing, singing, writing, and features that make up your character like your listening skills, your skills in cheering up people, your skills in being a good friend.

, Think about all the people you care about, like your parents, your friends, your significant other, your pets. Write why you are grateful for each person and how they make you feel. This helps you to appreciate them and see only the good in them. It's also good to write about the people that you don't really like and find a reason to appreciate them. This can be difficult as we don't really appreciate people we don't like but it can be very uplifting. There is good in everyone and it's very mood shifting to find the good in even people we dislike and feel grateful for them.

, There are always situations that have made us happy. For example, you may be grateful for a fun party, a good day at school/work, a fun vacation.

Buy a notebook with lots of blank pages.,
Look at the basic things you have.,
Take notice of your talents and the activities you enjoy.,
Visit your love ones.,
Listen to the sounds of earth.,
Taste wonderful things.,
Smell great odors.,
Notice people’s kindness.,
Touch things around you.,
Take a hard look at your life.",How to Write a Gratitude Journal," Form the habit of writing in it every day.;
, We can all start with the things we take for granted. Such things as our memory, our eyes, our legs, our hands, and our good health are blessings. As you get older you will even be grateful for your teeth. Appreciate the fact that you can move, even if you need some form of help to do it.

, Maybe you have a great talent for painting or dancing or playing music. All of this brings joy to your life. Record it in your journal.

, You may have cousins or grandparents you do not visit often. If your are older you may have grandchildren that you have not enjoyed. Be grateful for the time with them.  Write in your journal all you did and the fun you had with them.

, Listen to birds, or children laughing, or beautiful music. A deaf lady who was given back her hearing said that the best sound on earth is a baby making cooing sounds. Then be grateful that you can hear.

, Experience such things as grape jam, chocolate of any kind, peanut butter. Eat something like pasta and savor the sauce.  You could write I had chocolate and peanut butter candy today and it was wonderful.

, Go to a bakery and smell the hot bread. Go to the mall and smell perfume or bath lotions.  Then go home and write I smelled apple body lotion today and it was delicious.

, Remember the kid at the fast food restaurant that said, “We missed you”? Your teacher who said, “You are the best in the class”. Appreciate the good things and refuse to focus on the negative.  Tell yourself “I am not going to give any space in my book for any negative comment.

, Take time to hug others, pet your cat, pat the head of a child, and shake a hand with a smile. Feel the polished wood of your table or the fabric on your sofa. 

, Be grateful for this earth and all its beauty. Be grateful for a dishwasher that works, a car that runs, heat in your house and that you do not live on the street. In conclusion we become what we focus on. We can be beautiful people with a song in our heart or we can be Grumpy Gus and be all alone. It’s all depends on what you tell yourself. So start writing and tell yourself the wonderful things that you notice every day and people will flock around you because of your attitude. They too will want a great life filled with the passion of living rich. Now you know you always had it and didn’t realize it.

Journal when you need to heal.",How to Start a Journal," The book can be simple or ornate. If you're happy with a simple journal, then just buy a basic college-ruled notebook. If you want something more serious, look for a nice leather-bound journal – perhaps even one with a lock and key!


Choose between a lined or an unlined notebook. A lined notebook can be better for writing, while an unlined notebook might facilitate art and drawing. Think about how you prefer to set down your ideas, and choose a notebook that inspires you to fill it.
If you plan to carry your notebook with you (in your purse, pack, or pocket,) make sure to use a notebook that is small enough to conveniently pack around.

, Make the journal your own by infusing it with a unique style. Personalize the covers with words, art, stickers, and colors. Take clippings from your favorite magazines, and post them on the inside or outside of the journal. If decoration isn't your thing, then feel free to leave the journal plain!


Consider numbering the pages. You can do this all at once, or you can gradually number the pages as you fill them. This can be a great way to keep track of what you write.

, This can be a secure and easy-access means of preserving your thoughts. Log your entries in Microsoft Word or another basic word processor. Save the entries in a special folder, or compile them into a single, canonical document.


Consider using a system that you can access with a password through a cloud or over the Internet. This way, you can open and edit your journal from any computer or device! Try WordPress, or even using your email client.
For all the benefits of digital journal-keeping, you may miss the charm of a physical journal. Try it out, if you're curious. Consider keeping some notes in a physical notebook, and others in a drive on your computer.

, The most important step of starting a journal is actually setting down the first entry. The notebook, the decoration, and the security are all just ways of making the journal feel like a safe space for you to write. Think about the sort of journal that you keep. Then, write what's on your mind.Write about what happened today. Include where you went, what you did, and who you spoke to.
Write about what you felt today. Pour your joys, your frustrations, and your goals into the journal. Use the act of writing as a way to explore your feelings. Consider keeping a dream journal.

Keep a learning log. Write about what you learned today. Use the journal as a way to explore and connect your thoughts.Turn your experiences into art. Use the journal to write stories or poetry, to make sketches, and to plan out projects. Feel free to mix this in with your other entries.

, If you are going to keep a regular journal, then it's good to establish some way of tracking when you wrote what. Write the full date, or whatever you'll need to jog your memory: e.g. 2/4/2016 or Feb. 4, 2016. For a slightly more involved record, write the time of day (morning, afternoon, night), your mood, and/or your location. Log the date at the top of the page or the top of each entry.

, Try not to think too critically about what you're setting down. Let go of your doubts, and write your truth. The beauty of a journal is that you can tell the story that you don't usually people: the deep thoughts and feelings that lie behind your day-to-day decisions. Take the opportunity to explore yourself.Imagine that you are talking to someone. Whether you are talking to a close friend or pouring your thoughts into a journal: you are putting them out into the world, and thus making them real. It can be hard to really get a grasp on what you're thinking until you make your thoughts real.Use journaling as a healing tool. If there is something haunting you or bothering you, try to write about that thing and understand why exactly it has stuck on your mind., If you're having trouble finding your flow, try taking a few minutes to quietly reflect on what you're feeling. The act of writing can help you tease out these feelings. However, it can be hard to write until you have a clear idea of where to begin., Try setting aside a discrete amount of time to write in your journal. Set a timer for 5-15 minutes, and then let yourself go. The ""deadline"" of the ticking clock may help motivate you to get writing. Don't worry about making it perfect! Simply write down everything that's on your mind.


If the timer goes off and you haven't finished journaling, then feel free to keep going. The point of the timer is not to limit you, but rather to spur you.
This can be a great way to fit your journaling practice into the busy flow of everyday life. If you have trouble finding the time to write in your journal, then you may need to schedule it in., This way, you can record your thoughts whenever they strike. Keep the journal in your purse, your pack, or your back pocket. When you have a free moment, try pulling out your journal instead of your cell phone. You may find that this helps you stay grounded on a day-to-day basis.


Carrying the journal around has the added bonus of keeping your words private. If you always keep your journal close, then it's less likely to fall into the wrong hands.

, If you've poured your deep, personal thoughts into this journal, then you probably don't want anyone else to read it. Hide the journal somewhere that no one else will find it.


Slip the notebook behind the books on your bookshelf. Keep it under your mattress, or in the drawer of your bedside table. Put it under your pillow, or behind a picture frame.
Try not to label the journal things like ""Private! Do NOT read!"" This will make people curious and want to read it even more. If you do want to label it ""My Journal"" or ""Private!"" be sure to hide it well, as if people can see the label, they'll most certainly get curious.

, Make a practice of keeping a journal. Reap the various mental-health benefits of staying in touch with your emotions on a day-to-day basis.Each time you write in your journal, remind yourself to be honest and tell the whole truth.


Try scheduling journal time into your day-to-day flow. Some people journal before bed, or immediately after they wake. Some people journal during their daily commute or during their lunch hour. Find a time that works for you.

, Studies have indicated that writing in a journal can be a powerful way to process grief, trauma, and other emotional pains. Let your writing habit hold you up when you feel that everything is falling apart."

Therapeutic journaling includes a great deal of introspection, reflection, and intention.Journaling is helpful for many reasons. You can sort out your emotions, track patterns of behaviors, and give you a sense of relief. Journaling can also help you reduce stress, problem solve, and improve your health.Instead of writing down what you did, write about how certain situations affect you. Write about positive experiences and negative experiences, and how you handle them. For instance, journal about the positive experience you had a restaurant and how good it felt to order something at a restaurant. You can also write about your fears of ordering at a restaurant, and how you deal with them.;
, Set aside time each day for journaling.You may wish to set a timer for the duration of your journaling, or you may wish to set an alarm to remind yourself to journal. The important part is to prioritize your journaling so it becomes a part of every day.


You may choose to write your journal on paper, on your computer, or online. Whatever you choose, make sure it’s accessible and easy to keep up. If you use a paper journal, keep a pen handy.

, When you write, don’t worry about spelling, grammar, or how it sounds. This is your opportunity to write freely without censorship. You can connect with the purest part of you and write from that level, without judging yourself or fearing criticism.If you notice yourself becoming critical of your thoughts, feelings, writing style, handwriting, etc., gently remind yourself that this is a time for you to express yourself, not criticize yourself.

, Use a journal to track your symptoms, emotions, and triggers every day.Having a daily/weekly/monthly/yearly tracker can help you pick up on when you may be vulnerable to relapse, what situations bring you stress, and when you turn to food or to your eating disorder. For instance, you may find out that you are vulnerable to feeling insecure about your body around your period, or that when you work overtime, you start to cope through food.


Track the things that feel relevant for you. You may choose to track your mood each day, or the times you want to restrict or binge eat.

, Part of the reflection process in journaling is to see your progress and look for patterns. Reread your previous entries to gain inspiration and offer perspective of how far you have come.You may have started a series of entries you forgot about, or decide to go back to an old style of writing or entry when you reread your journals.


Reread your entries in the same day or week, or go through your journal periodically, like every month.

, To properly track and monitor your nutrition, work with a dietician. Your dietician will help you determine what foods to eat each day and in what amounts to eat them.Your dietician can help you maintain proper nutrition and make adjustments to your diet.


Your dietitian may give you a log to easily track foods. You can also use a smartphone application or find downloadable resources online.

, For each meal, indicate where you eat. Be specific on your location. For instance, instead of writing “home” or “out,” write “home — at table” or “home — on couch” or “out — Chang Family Restaurant.” Also, indicate at what time you eat. Be as specific as possible.Your entry may look like this: “Tuesday, April 12, 2016. 11:26AM. Home — at the table.”

, Avoid counting calories and instead aim to eat certain amounts of food each day.Record your food intake (for example, bananas or a vegetable sandwich with lettuce, tomato, two pieces of bread, and mustard) and indicate what food group you are fulfilling. For instance, your dietician may tell you to have two servings of fruit each day. Instead of counting calories, use servings and mark off each serving after you’ve completely eaten the serving.


Your entry may look like this: “Smoothie — full serving of bananas and strawberries, soy milk (full serving). Then, check off food groups this fulfills.
Write down both foods and liquids, including water, coffee, tea, and alcohol., Before you eat, record your hunger level. You can do this by assigning a number to the level of your hunger. For instance, a zero may indicate feeling empty, a five may indicate feeling neutral, and a 10 may indicate feeling stuffed or so full you feel sick. Record your satiety after a meal using the same scale.Record your hunger and satiety for every meal, every day.

, Write your feelings before, during, and after meals. This can help you discover your triggers that affect eating behaviors. For instance, if you tend to overeat, notice if you eat more following a stressful exam or difficult meeting at work. Or if you restrict, notice how your feelings around meals affects the urge to restrict.Write down a brief background of what is occurring before, during or after meals, then re-read entries to find any patterns. For example, you may write, “Had a fight with a friend before eating,” or, “Feeling lonely today.”

, If you purge after a meal, indicate this on your food log and note the time. If you binge, also write this down. If you purposefully restrict, also write this in your journal.


If you purge, note your method of purging. You can write “V” for vomit and “L” for laxatives.

, Use your journal to track your exercise.Record your activity, the intensity, and duration.


Use your journal to note any changes to activity and exercise as related to your eating disorder and stress.
Be honest about your behaviors. You may be tempted to skip recording when you binge, purge, restrict, etc., but this defeats the purpose of the journal and makes the diary a much less effective tool.

, If you’re feeling overwhelmed by an urge to binge, restrict, or are struggling with your eating disorder, practice this exercise. Write down the main physical feeling you’re experiencing, and the thoughts that are running through your head. Once you complete that, write a pre-emptive “after” scenario. What is a better physical response? What are some calmer, more positive thoughts? What reaction would benefit you better than your current reaction?Situations might include a fight with a friend or boyfriend or girlfriend, a test at school, or your weight. Let's say you're stressing over a fight with your boyfriend. Write down the physical feeling you are experiencing — maybe you feel sick to your stomach, or your arms and legs feel heavy, or you feel hot or numb. Write those sensations down.
Next, write down the thoughts that are running through your head. ""He's probably going to break up with me,"" ""I hate him! He's such a jerk!,"" or ""I can't deal with this; I'm going to go eat that box of cookies.""
Look at how you are reacting, or how you are showing that you are upset. Did you scream insults at your boyfriend? Did you break something?
Now imagine a different, more productive and healthy way to react to the stressful situation. What can you do to counteract your physical reaction (Maybe with deep breathing or muscle relaxation)? How can you challenge those negative thoughts? Perhaps something like: ""My boyfriend misunderstood what I was trying to say. I'm going to think of a different way to explain myself and help him understand."" Finally, what might be a better way to respond outwardly? Instead of screaming, maybe you can stay quiet and say, ""I need a break. We can talk about this later,"" and remove yourself from the situation., When you experience stress, write a one word representation of what is bothering you. Then, write one thing that can help you keep perspective about this situation. Lastly, write what you can do or say to reassure yourself about the situation.Following the previous example, your one word might be: ""Boyfriend."" In other situations, this word might be the name of a place or an emotion.
For perspective, you may wish to write that relationships are sometimes difficult, but also loving.
Lastly, reassure yourself that you are loved, despite your difficulties with people or yourself. Think about those who love you, from your dog to your grandma to your best friend. Write something like, ""I may get in fights with my boyfriend sometimes, but everyone struggles with relationships. I know he cares about me, and even if things don't work out with him, there are a lot of people who care about me.""

, When writing in your journal, try writing from the perspective of other people, not just yourself.For instance, if you are struggling with body image or weight, write a journal entry from the perspective of a medical doctor, psychologist, or family member. This can help you understand different perspectives and bring validity to any words they say.


Avoid becoming overly judgmental in these journal entries. Remind yourself that this is an exercise to explore varying viewpoints, not play out any negative scenarios you think your mother or medical doctor would say to you.

, Grab a photograph (or a few) and journal about them. Reflect on how you feel looking at the photograph, and what memories you have surrounding the photo. What would you like to say to the people in the photo? What do you think they would like to say to you? This can be especially helpful if it is a photo of someone who is no longer a part of your life.Many people with eating disorders have complicated family lives.Use the photographs to reflect on your family life, both the positives and the negatives.
Look at a photo of you before you had an eating disorder. What was life like then? What made you happy?

, Write a letter to your past self, or to your future self. Write the things you wish you could say but feel you cannot, or the things you wish you could have said given the opportunity. Write to your past self and say the things you wish someone would have told you then.

, You can’t evaluate something clearly if you’re in the middle of it. Remind yourself that emotions do not last and often they are fleeting.If you feel a strong emotion or urge, go to your journal. Re-read a positive journal entry, one that recounts a happy, relaxed, or calm experience. This can help remind you that just as you feel sad, angry, frustrated or upset now, you have felt and will feel happy, calm, relaxed, and balanced.


Try this exercise: write down your emotions and your current experience as you see them. Now, try the exercise but from three different vantage points: the view of someone you know well, an acquaintance, and someone who makes you uncomfortable. This can help you recognize that your thoughts and feelings are but one reaction, and not the only “right” one.

, Naming and exploring emotions can help you gain control of your emotions instead of them taking control of you. If you are struggling with feelings about body image or weight, stop and think about what emotion is behind this. For instance, you may feel guilt, shame or embarrassment. For each emotion, write about how you interact with that emotion. Where do you feel it in your body? What thoughts or memories come to mind when you think of the word “shame” or “guilt”? Focus on your awareness of each emotion. Increasing your awareness of emotions can help you identify and intervene sooner.Go deeper into understanding the emotion: What color is the emotion? What does it smell like? What are its friends like? What type of weather is it?

, If you feel negatively, you may feel a surge of energy. Instead of devoting that energy to feeling badly, see if you can divert it into something creative. Use your journal to doodle, write a story, or approach your emotions in a different way. Approach the negative emotions from a positive place, meaning, try to funnel them into something productive that adds to your life instead of detracting from life.If you’re angry with yourself for binge eating, go to your journal. Channel the negative feelings into a story or poem, or a picture. Note how you feel as you do this. Sometimes anger can be a very motivating emotion and help you make changes.

Distill the essence of what you believe.,
Rough in your argument with the standard five-paragraph essay.,
Get the readers attention by telling a story.,

Offer your readers facts and evidence.,
Present a call to action.,
Test your essay.,

Publish your essay.,
Draw attention to your essay by making visual impact.,
Find readers.,
Take action to express your opinion vividly.,
Go ahead!",How to Express Your Opinion through Writing," The first step of writing an opinion essay is figuring out what you believe and why you believe it. An opinion essay can be about anything. You can inform about why the city shouldn’t put a parking lot in what is now a park near your house or why it’s cruel to declaw cats, really—it can be about anything.


Sit down at your computer or with a pad of paper and write down a list of bullet points regarding what you believe regarding your issue. On a separate page or column, list why you believe each point.
The “why” is crucial because publishing an opinion essay means communicating with strangers. Saying “All my friends believe this” or “Everyone knows this is true” isn’t really going to change any minds, but connecting through solid reasoning may.;
, The lead paragraph introduces your topic, what you’re going to say. The next three paragraphs present stand-alone points, while the final paragraph sums it all up—emphatically.


Even a lengthy essay follows the same format: an opening section that introduces the subject, a body of facts and examples that support the contention, and a final section that summarizes in an impactful way.

, It is crucial to grab the reader’s attention right out of the gate, and since humans are story-telling critters, a sure way to start strong is with a true-life incident that relates to your theme, to what you want to convey with your words. You undoubtedly have a personal connection to the issue because it is important to you. So, as a way to get your creative juices flowing, jot down memories and personal anecdotes that relate, then choose the one that flows most easily into your narrative, and is vividly memorable.

, Step away from your own viewpoint and see the world from someone else's perspective in order to answer the question every reader will have: ""What does this issue mean to me?"" After all, it’s easy to spend time on websites and blogs where everyone (except for trolls, maybe!) agrees with the writers' particular world view. But the strongest opinion essays are written for readers who aren't familiar with the particular issue you're addressing or haven’t formed a strong opinion about it yet.


In your essay, try to find examples of how the issue you're addressing can touch other people's daily lives so that they can see your point of view through their own experiences.

, Expressing an opinion without facts may give you a feeling of power or importance, but it rarely changes someone’s mind. Combining your opinion with facts is a far more effective way of reaching your readership and letting them come to their own conclusions. Instead of telling your readers what to think, present facts that will give them a reason to change their thinking.

, If you’ve done your job right, then you’re ready for the best part of your essay. This is when you challenge your readers to do something. This doesn’t have to mean signing a petition or going on a march. Ask your readers to do something that’s simple and basic, but profound and meaningful in their own lives. Ask them to demonstrate the value of their new opinion, and help them by, once again, providing examples of actions they can take.

, Show your essay to some friends or relatives before going public. By sharing your work, you can see whether you've succeeded in communicating what you intended to. Note that your test readers don’t necessarily need to agree with you, but they can tell you if you've effectively made your points.

, After a rewrite or two of the main body of the essay, you’re ready to boil it down to one summarizing paragraph describing:


why you’ve written the essay
what it’s about
why someone might want to read it

, Once you’re done with the summary, you’re ready to publish your essay online.

, As an example, consider Marni Halasa, a self-described “professional protester” in New York City. Marni has become skilled at using witty homemade costumes to attract attention to the issues that are important to her. . Marni has learned the first rule of political engagement: You need to project a quick visual message that will stop someone from walking away from you. Once people stop and look, they’re ready to listen.


Use images, just like the one of Marni Halasa (above). If you don’t have the budget for professional designer, download one of your own photos or get a free image from Shutterstock or a similar website.
Remember: you’re looking for a visual image that’s both powerful and informative.

, You’ve got your essay, a summary, and a great visual image; you’re ready to find readers. Here are some ways to do this:


You can put the essay up on your personal website.
You can publish the essay in public opinion forums like Medium.
You can publish it on Amazon and a variety of other eBook sites.
You can offer sections of the essay, or the full thing, to publications by pitching to op-ed sections.

, You have a choice. You can stay silent or express your opinion. Remember: Your actions can change both your environment and your life. Writing and publishing an opinion statement on the internet can make you feel active, powerful, and engaged with your world, ... and it can make a difference.

Write about a specific theme in your outline.,
Expand a character in the outline.,
Explore a setting in the outline.",How to Expand an Outline Into a Novel1," You may have had a specific theme in mind when you started writing the outline for your novel. Or you may realize you are interested in a particular theme only after you have finished your outline. Read over the outline and pick out moments or sections that seem to speak to this theme. Then, write down scenes or character moments that are about these theme or that connect somehow to this theme.For example, you may notice the theme of “female friendship” keeps popping up in your outline. You may then write a scene between two female characters that explores this scene further as a way to start your novel.;
, Another option is to pick a character that you are interested in or curious about in your outline and expand from there. Perhaps you are itching to dig deeper into your main character’s perspective. Or maybe you want to start with exploring a minor character in a specific scene. Focusing on a particular character can make starting your novel less daunting and allow you to lean on your outline to help you chart what happens to this character.For example, you may decide to focus on a supporting character in your story and expand them on the page. You may have a note in your outline, “Father character who is distant and closed off to the main character.” You may then think about why the father character might be distant and closed off as well as why the father character treats the main character the way he does.
You may also try exploring the backstory of your main character. Think about your main character’s life before they entered into the action in the novel. You may write about their childhood or adolescent experiences. You may explore formative moments in their life that brought them to where they are at the start of the novel.

, You may have brief notes on the setting in your outline, or notes of several different settings that appear in your outline. Take one of those notes and expand on it. Write about the objects in the setting and how it feels to be moving in the setting. Use sensory details like how it smells and how it sounds to explore the setting more fully.You can also place your main character in the setting and have them interact with the setting on the page. Think about how your main character might describe the setting to someone else and how they might feel walking around in the setting. Put their body in the space and explore how that feels for them.

"
"
Fill in the gaps in the outline.,
Use a specific section or chapter in the outline as a starting point.,
Focus on areas of tension and conflict in the outline.,
Deepen the outline by showing, not telling, on the page.",How to Expand an Outline Into a Novel2," One way you can use your outline to help you start your novel is to read over your outline and look for any gaps or missing plot points. Is there a plot point in your outline that feels lacking and needs to expanded further? Do you feel a certain character moment needs to be fleshed out more on the page? You may choose one of these gaps in your outline as a way into your novel.For example, perhaps you notice you have a gap between two crucial events in your outline. You may then write what happens between these two crucial events in the form of a scene with a setting and characters. Once you’re done, you can weave together what you have written with other scenes focusing on the two crucial events to create the beginnings of your novel.

, Maybe there is one chapter or section in your novel that you are excited about. Focus in on this chapter and explore it more fully by writing out a scene with dialogue and action. Start fleshing out the chapter so it moves from a note in your outline to a full fledged chapter in your novel.For example, you may have a chapter early in your outline that explores the climax of your novel. It may noted briefly in your outline as, “Chapter with climax between two main characters.” You may then flesh out what the climax is and how the two main characters interact leading up to the climax in the chapter.

, Read through the outline and identify any chapters or sections that feel full of tension and conflict. You may then pick that chapter as a way into starting your novel. Think about why there is so much tension and conflict in the chapter. If there is not enough tension or conflict, add in more details to up the stakes in the chapter.For example, you may notice that a chapter about a fight between two characters in your outline. You may then pick this moment of tension and explore it further on the page. Use dialogue and character actions to up the conflict so it feels engaging and meaningful to your reader.

, Another way you can use your outline to further your plot is to follow the “show, don’t tell” rule. Choose a chapter or section in your outline and think about how you can describe it on the page by showing the reader what is happening. Avoid telling or explaining too much of the action. Instead, put your characters in the setting and have them interact. Use action and dialogue to show the reader what is happening in the scene in an engaging way.For example, you may have a pivotal scene between your main character and her father in your outline. You may then use sensory details and unique description to explore this scene in more detail. Focus on showing the reader how the interaction occurs using your main character’s perspective or narrative voice.

"
"
Create a first draft.,
Show the draft to others.,
Revise the draft.",How to Expand an Outline Into a Novel3," Start by creating a first draft of the novel. Use an element of your outline, such as a theme, a character, a setting, or a particular scene, to get started. Set up a writing area that is private in your home or in a quiet setting, such as a coffee shop or a shared work space. You may challenge yourself to write a certain number of words a day or to hit a certain page count. Try creating a writing schedule to help you get the draft done.


You may also remove any distractions in your area, such as people talking around you, social media, or your internet connection. Shut off your internet while you are writing and turn off your phone or switch it to silent.

, Once you have completed the draft, do not be afraid to get feedback on it from others. You may show the draft to a mentor, such as a writing teacher or professor. Or you may show the draft to friends or family. Be open to constructive criticism and listen to what others have to say.


You may take notes when you discuss the draft with others or have your reviewers write comments on your draft for you to read.
You may also ask your reviewers follow up questions to help you understand their feedback better. For example, you may ask, ""What did you mean by this note here?"" or ""Can you explain how you want me to expand this scene?""

, Once you have received feedback on the draft, you should sit down and revise it. You may have your outline nearby for reference to make sure all the scenes listed in your outline are in the draft and to ensure your novel follows your outline. You should also apply feedback you receive from others to the draft to make it that much stronger.


You may try reading parts of the novel out loud to make sure the sentences flow well and have a distinct narrative voice. You may also read the novel to others and have them listen to the words to ensure the language is strong.

Help your child find a suitable journal.,
Provide your child with access to a digital “journal.” If kids find the idea of journaling in a paper notebook to be old-fashioned, they may be more interested in a digital journal.,
Provide toddlers with journaling supplies that suit their age.,
Explain to older children that their journal is a safe place for writing.,
Give kids access to fun writing prompts.,
Write down a list of writing topics for kids to pick from.,
Encourage your children to use new vocabulary.,
Give your child a daily time to journal.,
Model journaling for children.,
Provide ambitious writers with multiple journals.,
Encourage children to re-read their own journal entries.",How to Teach Kids Daily Journal Writing," To excite kids about the prospect of daily journaling, start by purchasing them a suitable paper-copy journal. Take the kids to your local office-supply store and ask them to look through the aisle containing journals and notebooks. Allow the kids to pick out a journal which appeals to them; they’ll be more inclined to write in a fun, personalized journal.


Younger kids may appreciate brighter, fun-colored journals, or journals that they can decorate and put stickers on.
Older children are more likely to prefer a more subdued journal, such as a standard composition notebook or a leather-bound journal.;
, If this is the case, encourage them to compose on a computer or tablet, and to save their work either on the hard drive or in the cloud.


Explain to children that these objects are much more expensive and delicate than a paper notebook, and need to be treated with care. Don’t allow younger kids to eat or drink while using electronics, especially if they’re writing using your computer or tablet.

, While young children won’t be able to compose their thoughts in a journal in a traditional sense, you can still help them “write” on a daily basis. Provide your toddler with a plastic tub full of markers, colored pencils, crayons, stickers, and glitter sticks. Then, help them draw on and paste things to the pages of a journal, or supervise as they color in a coloring book.As your toddlers age, they can graduate from markers, stickers, and crayons to pens and pencils, and will begin to actually write sentences. If you’ve already ingrained in them the habit of daily journaling, they’ll have an easy time maintaining the habit as older children.
At this young age (and probably for the majority of their childhood), children will probably be eager to show you what they have drawn and written in their journals.

, This means that they can write whatever they please, and it will not be criticized, corrected, or evaluated. Even if as younger children they were eager to share their journal entries with you, as they age, they may decide that their journal is private and not for others to read. Privacy will help kids enjoy their daily journaling time and encourage them to improve in their thinking and their writing.A journal is also a great place to encourage older children to try creative writing. Ask them to write a poem, a short story, or a one-act play.
If kids aren’t sure where to begin on a creative piece, search online and provide them with a suitable prompt.

, Kids may be unsure of what to write when you first start teaching them to journal daily. You can help overcome this inertia by providing kids with writing prompts. These ideas will give kids something to write about and help them feel confident expressing ideas on the page. If you’re struggling to come up with sufficient writing-idea prompts on your own (especially if your kids want more than one prompt each day), look for prompts online. There are several websites that list fun, simple writing prompts for kids to try.For example, ask children to write one or two pages about:


Something interesting they saw or heard that day,
A favorite family memory,
Their own daily emotions and experiences, or
Their favorite book, movie, or TV show.

, If children find a prompt to be too narrow or limiting, consider presenting a broad topic for the day. Older kids especially may find a topic helpful to their journaling; it will give them the freedom to approach an idea from a variety of perspectives.As long as the topics are related to a child’s interests, they should approach the writing with enthusiasm.


For example, if your child is interesting in surfing, you could write topics like, “Describe a wave you’d like to surf,” “Who is the best pro surfer?” or “Which brand of surfboard would you buy if you had unlimited money?”

, A journal is a great place for a child to try out using new vocabulary words that they may have learned at school or from friends. Children are more likely to enjoy the process of daily journaling if they can see their writing improve and learn how to spell and use new words at the same time.Help your kids with spelling when and if they ask you to; otherwise, let them figure out how to use and spell words on their own.


Along with stressing new vocabulary words, you can also encourage older kids to use more complex sentences and to try to express more complex ideas as they become increasingly adept at journaling.

, Children will be more likely to remember to write in their journals if you ask them to do it at a consistent time every day. This will also help kids understand journaling as a daily practice, not simply something to do once a month. Over time, your children should come to view daily journaling as a pleasant and habitual activity, like brushing their teeth or getting dressed in the morning.


For example, ask you children to spend 20 or 30 minutes writing in their journal after they get back from school, after dinner, or before they go to bed each day.

, If kids view journaling as a chore, show them that you’re willing to journal alongside them. This should incline the kids to be more open to spending time writing, since children often imitate behaviors that they see adults model. Sit with your kids in their room or at the kitchen table and keep your own journal that you write in while they write in theirs.


Since you may be next to your children while writing, and they’ll probably want to look at your journal and read what you’ve written, avoid writing anything too personal or unsuitable for kids.

, If your child enjoys writing in a variety of genres, styles, or modes, and has a habit of filling up personal journals very quickly, consider giving the child multiple journals, one for each type of writing they enjoy. For example, the child could use one journal for a personal diary and use another for journaling things observed in nature, a third for recording dreams, and a fourth to practice creative work: writing as well as drawing and sketching.As journals are often not cheap, consider giving them as Christmas or birthday gifts. Alternately, if your child is old enough to do chores around the house, make it clear that they’ll need to use their own money to buy their journals.

, This can be a valuable practice, especially if your children choose to keep a journal of their personal insights, emotions, and observations. Revisiting previous journal entries will allow children to see how much their writing has improved over the months, and also allow them to how they felt about and responded to forgotten life events.As an example of how to encourage children to regularly revisit old journal entries, on the last day of each month, request that they read at least one or two old entries from the preceding two or three months.

Choose who is going to be kissing whom.,
Determine where the kiss is going to take place.,
Think about how the kiss is going to take place.,
Consider why the kiss is taking place.,
Build on established conflicts between the characters.,
Put both characters within close proximity of each other.,
Have one character notice something new or interesting about another character.,
Use the five senses.,
Use body language.,
Discuss how the kiss ends.",How to Describe a Kiss," Maybe you have two characters that have been circling each other for a long period of time, or two characters who suddenly realize their feelings for each other. Regardless, it’s important to isolate which two characters in your story are going to pucker up so you can shift the point of view of the story to them.


Keep in mind you don’t necessarily have to have two people kissing each other, as it could be multiple characters kissing each other or one person kissing themselves in the mirror. In any event, it's a good idea to identify the characters in the kissing scene.;
, The setting for the kiss is important because the setting will inform the mood of the kiss.In writing, mood is a literary element that evokes certain feelings or vibes in your audience through words and descriptions.Think of it as the atmosphere your characters are moving around in, or kissing in.


By figuring out the setting of the kiss, you can create a lot of implied meaning. The setting will help you establish a certain mood or atmosphere, and you can show your audience a certain mood, as opposed to tell them.
For example, a kiss in a dark empty parking lot has a completely different mood or atmosphere than a kiss at a party. One setting implies a more intimate mood and one setting implies a more exposed or open mood.

, Are your characters going to be alone or surrounded by others? Is one character going to be more aggressive or eager for a kiss in the scene? Will both characters know the kiss is coming or be completely surprised by it?This is a good moment to also think about how your characters are going to be positioned in the scene. Maybe one person is going to be standing beside someone else in a room. Or maybe both characters are going to be sitting side by side.
Think about the physical presence of your characters and how they are going to move around in the kissing scene.

, This is really a chance for you to think about the motivations of your characters and why they would end up kissing each other. If they hate each other throughout the story but suddenly end up in a deep, sensual kiss, this may not be very believable for the reader.Re-evaluate how and why you have reached this point in the story where the characters are in a kissing scene. Did you establish their relationship well in the early stages of the story, so a kiss between them makes sense? And if you are going for the element of surprise, ask yourself if you created enough character details so the kiss will throw readers off guard but will not throw them out of the story.

, While it may be tempting to just throw two characters together into a locked room or dark cave, where they will eventually resort to a kiss, a more effective technique is to use past conflicts or ongoing conflicts between the characters to create a convincing build up to the kiss.This could be a past love that reappears in a character’s life, or a previous scene where one character sees another character do something that they find attractive or compelling. Remember, a kiss is usually an indication of desire, so make sure your characters desire each other, if only for a moment, to make the kiss seem believable.
Don’t neglect all the hard work you’ve put into building up your characters. Instead, use characterization to your advantage and build off of previous conflicts or scenes to create build up.

, Now that you’ve established how a past conflict has led both characters to consider kissing each other, it’s important to place both characters within kissing distance.You can do this by having two characters accidentally bump into each other, or have one character plan to run into another character. There are many ways you can move your characters physically so they are in a setting and mood that feels appropriate for a kiss, but the point is to get them close to each other.
Focus on the body movements of your characters. A quick, fast move towards each other will likely indicate intense longing or desire, and a slower, more labored move towards each other will likely indicate a more unsteady or unsure passion between the characters.

, Because you now have your characters within kissing distance, they have the opportunity to notice small details on the person’s face or neck. Your characters are seeing each other in a new, intimate way, so reflect this by including physical descriptions of something not noticed before.


For example, your character could notice the other character has a speck of green in their eyes, a freckle on their nose or a small birthmark on their neck.

, Rather than simply throw out a whole bunch of adjectives to describe the kiss, focus instead on how the kiss is affecting your character’s sense of sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. This will make the descriptions feel specific to your character’s point of view and ensure you are hitting all the sensual aspects of the kiss.Sight is probably one of the easiest senses to describe; simply write what the character is seeing during the kiss.
Sound could mean background noise like music at a party or the character’s loud, excited heart beats. Depending on the duration of the kiss, you could also include soft moans or other noises of pleasure (or disgust), as appropriate to your character.
Smell could be what your character smells in the air or on the other person as they kiss them, such as perfume, cologne, or a natural scent.
Touch is a very important aspect to describing a kiss. Focus on tactile details like how the character’s skin feels and how their lips feel.
Taste can be broad or very specific when describing a kiss. Keep in mind describing a kiss as sweet implies it was enjoyable and describing a kiss as sour or bitter implies it may not have been enjoyable at all.

, Think about how your characters are moving their bodies as they kiss. Body language will also let your audience know how the characters are responding emotionally to the kiss. A physical reaction like pulling or pushing away from the kiss will imply different emotion than a physical reaction like falling or relenting to the kiss. The easiest way to use body language in the scene is to focus on the movements of specific body parts:Lips: perhaps the most important physical detail in a kissing scene, focus on the texture of the character’s lips or how they feel against another character’s lips.
Tongue: another very important physical detail in a kissing scene that can indicate aggressive desire (lots of tongue) or unsure, gentle desire (no tongue). Think about what type of kiss you’re trying to convey and include or do not include tongue descriptions accordingly.
Heads: most people tilt their head to one side when they kiss. Of course, if you’re going for a more awkward kiss, it may be beneficial to have a moment of bumping foreheads.
Eyes: are your characters’ eyes opened or closed? Open eyes usually indicates a surprised reaction or a detached reaction. Consider the emotions of your characters and decide from there.
Noses: keep in mind that though your characters may tilt their heads when they kiss, their noses will likely still brush against each other or against the side of their faces.
Hands and arms: during the kiss, a character’s hands could be up in the air (usually indicating an unwelcome or surprised kiss) or wrapped around the character’s body (usually an indication of an enjoyable kiss). They could also run their fingers through a character’s hair, hold the back of their head, rub their lower back, etc.

, Your characters can’t lock lips forever! Somehow, one character or both characters have to pull away from each other, or be interrupted and be forced to pull away from each other.If the kiss happens early in your story, you will likely need another conflict to arise to complicate the kiss and create enough tension to keep your audience interested.If the kiss happens towards the end of your story, think about how your characters might feel after the kiss and how the kiss affects their emotions towards the other character.

Journal about your social or romantic life.,
Write about your personal thoughts.,
Reflect on your professional life and aspirations.,
Write with your audience in mind.,
Reflect on anything you want.",How to Start a Journal Entry1," One of the easiest things to journal about may be your social or romantic life. Ultimately, you’ll have very little trouble starting an entry about something you feel strongly or passionately about. Think about starting entries on:


Your love interests. Write about someone you have a crush on, someone you just broke up with, or someone you’re in a relationship with.
Write about things you did or are planning to do with friends. For example, if you and your friends have a big party planned, write about it.;
, Perhaps the most therapeutic subject to write about is your deep personal thoughts. These might be thoughts you don’t want to share with someone else, but might feel comfortable writing in a journal. Start entries on:


Your hopes and dreams for the future. For example, write about your vision for your life in the future.
Personal doubts. For example, reflect on doubts you have in yourself or in your own abilities. If you think you’re a clumsy person, write a little on the topic. It might help you gain more confidence.
Individual fears. For instance, write about your fear of death, fear of loneliness, or fear of never loving someone., A great way to get started journaling is by using it as an opportunity to write about your professional life. This should be a relatively easy journal entry to start, as you’ll have plenty to talk about. Write about:


Where you want to be in five, ten, or twenty years.
Big projects going on at work.
Frustrations you have with coworkers or management.
Ideas you have for how to do your job better or to make your business more efficient.
A business you might want to start in your spare time., When deciding what to write about, you'll need to keep your audience in mind. This is important, as you may be writing for a wide variety of reasons. Some potential audiences include:


A therapist. If you're writing for a therapist, you may want to focus on issues you discuss with them. For example, if you have anxiety disorder, write about the anxiety you experience on a daily basis.
Family. If you're writing for your children in the future, focus on subjects that might interest them, like family events or family history.
You in the future. For example, focus on events that you want to remember in the future, like a great day you spent with your significant other., Perhaps the most important thing to remember is that its okay to write about anything you want. Ultimately, journaling is your opportunity to explore your thoughts, aspirations, and more.


Don't stop yourself from writing something because you think someone will judge you.
If you're nervous someone may read your private thoughts, use a journal with a lock on it. You can also journal on your computer and require a password to access it."
"
Start as a daily log.,
Begin with a thought.,
Write your journal as a letter.,
Embrace the bullet approach.",How to Start a Journal Entry2," If you choose to begin your entries as a daily log, you’ll begin by recounting what you did at the beginning of the day. You’ll likely find that this is an easy and effective way to start writing. In the end, it might lead to more involved journal entries.


Start off by journaling about monotonous daily activities. For example, write “Today I woke up at 6am and had Frosted Mini-Wheats for breakfast.”
Use the entry to recount the activities of your day. Cover major discussions you had with family or friends, what you saw on the way to work or school, and even the weather., You can also start your entry as a thought. By starting with a thought, you’ll set the tone of your entry. In the end, you’ll open yourself up to the possibility of expressing your thoughts and feelings.


Start by writing “I’m happy today.” Continue by explaining why you feel that way.
Think about starting with a thought and then just continuing your entry as a sort of “stream of consciousness.” Put everything that enters your mind onto the paper., One of the easiest ways to frame your entry is as a letter. By framing it as a letter, you’ll be able to start it and write in a familiar and easy way. In the end, you’ll produce natural prose with a solid narrative.


Start as if you are writing to yourself in the future.
Write as if you are writing to a friend. For instance, write: ""Dear friend, its been a while since I last wrote to you. So much has happened since then.""
Get creative and craft your letter/entry as if you are writing to a famous person or someone you wish you knew., Another way to start an entry is by bullet listing different things that are important to you at that moment. That way, you won’t have to pressure yourself to write in-depth about any one thing.


Start at the top of the page and write a word or phrase that is important to you. If you want to add more, do so.
Leave yourself a couple lines and write down another word or phrase.
Continue down the page until you’ve exhausted ideas about things you could write about.
Feel free to fill in the bullets whenever you want."
"
Write at a planned time.,
Journal whenever you have time.,
Make entries when you have a major life event.",How to Start a Journal Entry3," One way many people approach their journal is by writing at a planned time every day. That way, starting an entry will be as simple as sitting down at a given time and writing.


Many people who journal regularly like to journal right before bed at night. This way the experiences of the day are fresh in your mind.
Think about journaling in the morning. It might be relatively easy for you to start an entry right when you get up., For a lot of people, it’s hard to find the time to start a new entry every day. Thus, you can take the approach of beginning an entry whenever you have time. This way, you won’t feel as if you are forced to produce a new entry every day.


Journal on weekend mornings or evenings when you have time.
Think about starting entries on holidays or days off from work.
Start an entry when you feel like it.

, One way to approach journaling is to only create an entry when you have a major life event. This way, when you do journal, it’ll be very easy to start because you’ll have an important issue or event to write about. Major life events might include:


The birth of a child
A wedding or divorce
The death of a loved one
The start of a new job
Moving houses"

Choose your collaborator wisely.,
Define what you each hope to accomplish by writing together.,
Decide who has control over the content of the work.,
Decide how you will break up the work.,
Develop a plan for dealing with creative differences as they arise.,
Decide what order your names should appear in on the cover.,
Decide whose agency represents the work to publishers and who deals with the publisher's representatives.,
Determine who handles the money and how it's to be divided between you.,
Put it all in writing.",How to Do Creative Writing with a Friend," Your reason for writing together should be that each of you brings something to the project that the other could not. If you're writing a space romance and one of you provides the knowledge of astronomical distances and rocket propulsion systems while the other provides the knowledge of human interaction, you probably have the makings of a good partnership. If, however, you have different, and strong, ideas on writing styles, you probably will spend more time arguing over writing than actually doing it.


The above assumes you're both new writers. Many times, writers who've been previously published professionally as solo authors are teamed up by their agents and may not meet face-to-face until they've signed the contract in their agent's office. Regardless of your previous level of writing experience, try to choose a partner whom you can respect as an equal.;
, Even if you each contribute knowledge that the other collaborator can't, you also bring your own expectations and personalities to the project. Discuss ahead of time what each of you expects from collaborating on a writing project, whether it's simply to have the experience of writing together, to get published, to create a series of joint projects, or something else. You should, from the outset, want enough of the same things to make the collaboration viable.

, This means deciding whether the universe your characters operate in is only for this work and subsequent joint projects, or whether either of you can write stories in this universe alone or with another collaborator. It also means deciding what 1 author can do to the other's characters in that portion of the current work, whether 1 author can use a character created by the other in a project outside the collaboration, and certainly whether 1 author can kill off the other's character.


Also consider what happens to the universe and characters if either or both of you drop out of the project mid-way through. Decide whether either of you can resurrect the project at a later time alone or with another collaborator.

, Writing consists of researching, drafting an outline, drafting a book proposal (principally for nonfiction works) or treatment, writing, revising, editing, and if and when the book is published, proofreading the galleys. You can assign duties between you and your collaborator by task, specific areas of expertise (such as the astronomy expert handling astronomical research, while the psychology expert looks for psychological terms for the psychologist character to spout as needed), alternate chapters or drafts between you, and so on.


Regardless of how you divide up the other tasks, only 1 of you should have the responsibility for the final edit for this manuscript. You can always alternate this duty on subsequent manuscripts.
Also be aware that different authors have different opinions on how many revisions are necessary between creating the first draft and the final draft to be sent to a publisher. If you and your partner are used to working with a different number of revisions, you'll have to figure out a suitable compromise before starting in to write.

, This is a catchall for issues that may arise while writing together that don't relate specifically to the universe or characters, such as the tone (lighthearted or serious) of the work.

, Unless you add additional collaborators to future projects, you'll use the same order each time for the sake of consistency, so it's best decided now.

, If one of you already has an agent and/or has a working relationship with an editor at a publishing house, you'll probably have that agent market the work and have the collaborator who knows the editor deal with that editor. If you've both been published previously, you'll have to decide whose agent has charge and who deals with the editor on this book, assuming your existing solo contracts allow you the freedom to make this decision.

, Unless you're roommates, you'll have to decide which address the advance and royalty checks will be sent to if the work is published and therefore who pays the other collaborator his or her fair share. That ""fair share"" can be either a 50-50 split or divided proportionate to the amount of work each of you puts in; either way means keeping track of the amount of work you each do to avoid arguments later.

, You need to create 2 documents:


A contract that covers ownership of the work and its components, the division of labor, order of credits, distribution of the proceeds, and methods of dealing with creative differences that may occur.
An outline to delineate the structure of the book, its number of chapters, and what is to be covered in each chapter.

Get a journal, something that you enjoy writing with (colorful glitter pens, mechanical pencil-whatever) Make a special time to write everyday and make sure it is well lighted, quiet, and you can concentrate and be inspired.,
When you are writing in general, ensure that you always try to keep the words flowing.,
Read widely!,
Whenever you find out a very interesting, new word or an important English rule or even a new random fact, write it somewhere.,
Write what makes you want to write more.,
Observe your surroundings.,
Inspiration is good, but the best writers, the masters of the craft, learn to control their 'muse' to some degree- try to do the same.",How to Enhance Your Writing,";
, A great way to practice this is to pick a random topic and write about that for 5-10 minutes, and never stop writing! Even if your words run dry, keep it flowing! It doesn't matter what you write; just write something!

, Read whatever you enjoy reading and figure out what you like about that author's writing and try to write like that. Also you will learn all sorts of new words.

, Anywhere. Try on your arm or sticking bits of paper in your pockets.

, If you hate writing about owls, don't write about owls. Eventually, you'll become comfortable writing about anything, but even then you'll always have favorites.

, If you are in a forest, pretend like you're a character and imagine what you'd write if you were describing this place and what kind of mood you would set and what kind of action would take place.

, Occasionally, to challenge yourself, write about something you aren't fond of. Eventually you may even like writing about owls.

Start with the Thesis.,
Brainstorm.,
Group related ideas together.,
Begin with Roman numeral I.,
Introductory Paragraph: The Introductory Paragraph should start general and end specific.,
Body paragraphs: Body paragraphs contain the substance of your argument.,
Conclusion: A proper conclusion should provide a sense of closure while also leaving the topic open to further exploration.",How to Create an Outline for an Argumentative Paper," Your thesis is the central argument of the paper. Every following sentence must be written with the intention of supporting this idea.


An effective thesis should attempt to elicit a strong response from the reader. A reader should not finish the introductory paragraph and think, “So what?”
Be prepared to change your thesis as often as possible. As you generate new ideas and make new logical connections, the scope of your paper will likely change and as a result so should your thesis.;
, List anything that you believe is related to the argument, including quotes from primary and secondary sources.

, Take a look at the list of ideas you’ve generated and begin to organize them into groups.


A sound argumentative essay will have a hierarchy of ideas that follows a logical progression. When grouping your ideas, keep in mind how each group relates to the others.

, Each section’s heading should start with a capitalized Roman numeral (I., II., III., etc.) and contain the topic of that paragraph.


Label subheadings with capitalized letters (A, B, C, etc.). Secondary subheadings begin with lowercase numerals (i., ii., iii., etc.) and tertiary subheadings begin with lowercase letters (a., b., c., etc.).

,


The very first sentence can be anything from a question or an observation, as long as it gets the reader’s attention. The following sentences must then narrow the topic down to a very specific point: the thesis.
As you narrow the topic down, you must of course mention the primary text which your paper is concerned with. If necessary, you may also mention a secondary source that you feel is important to your central argument.

,


In a standard 5 paragraph essay, you will have 3 body paragraphs to develop your argument. Each body paragraph must explore a distinct idea that supports your thesis and include evidence from the text and or secondary sources.
For a fully developed argumentative essay, you may include counter-arguments to your thesis and subsequent refutations.

,


Do not simply restate the thesis. Your conclusion should return to the thesis with a deeper understanding as a result of the arguments and evidence of the body paragraphs.

Change your surroundings.,
Stay with a friend.,
Go outside.,
Seek out a public place to write.",How to Boost Your Writing Productivity1," A writing block can be overcome by a simple change of venue. Productivity increases when you are in a calm and comfortable environment.If your apartment or home is not an environment well-suited to writing consider the following:Try a local coffee shop.
Go to the park or into nature with a lawn chair and your laptop when you need to do some writing.
Play your favorite music to drown out outside noises if you cannot leave your house or apartment.;
, Ask a friend with a home or apartment that has the type of environment that you are looking for if you could spend a few hours each day writing there.Being in a comfortable environment with the company of your friend may increase your productivity. You might even ask your friend to be your work-buddy and to hold you accountable for using your time wisely while you are at his house.

, Staying inside all day to work lowers a person’s productivity. Instead, if you feel unmotivated, wander outside for a walk or to exercise.Being outside in the sunshine helps you relax and relaxation helps to improve the flow of thoughts, productivity, and motivation.

, Sometimes writing from home can be an isolating experience.If you begin to feel isolated, seek out a more public place to write such as a public library or a coffee shop. This will put you in close quarters with other people and will help you feel less isolated as you work.

"
"
Create realistic writing goals for yourself.Hold yourself accountable for meeting these writing goals.,
Keep a writing productivity chart.This is where you make a chart that keeps track of how often and how much you write each day.,
Break projects down into smaller parts and pieces.When you have a large project looming before you, it is easy to be overwhelmed by the amount of work you must undertake.,
Reward yourself when you’ve completed a writing task.Tell yourself that you will be able to do something that you want to do only after you’ve accomplished your writing goal for the day.",How to Boost Your Writing Productivity2," If you feel as though you might need added accountability, let your friends or family know what goals you’ve set for yourself. Be sure that your goals aren’t too lofty. For example, don’t make a goal that you will write for eight consecutive hours a day. Instead, you might decide that your goal is to write one page a day, or that you’ll write for two hours a day.

, You might choose to make your unit of measurement hours, the number of words written, or the number of projects completed. This chart will enable you to see what your writing productivity looks like over a specific period of time.

, However, if you break the project down into smaller components, the project will seem much less daunting.For example, if you plan to write a 3,000 word essay, tell yourself that you will write the essay over the course of three days and on each day you will write 1,000 words.

, This will help to motivate you to write. For instance, if you want to play your guitar, tell yourself that you can do this after you’ve finished composing your 1,000 word goal for the day and hold yourself to it.

"
"
Get some exercise.,
Take a shower.,
Eat or drink something.",How to Boost Your Writing Productivity3," When you are experiencing writer’s block, try to undertake a physical activity. Exercising has been proven to help writers move beyond writer’s block. Exercising brings more oxygen to your brain and helps to release endorphins, which can help your mind to relax and focus on what you are doing at the moment.When you return to your desk, you will find it easy to write.

, The water touching your skin will also refresh your brain and unleash the creativity.Taking a shower is a relaxing experience, which causes the brain to release dopamine, which, in turn, leads to a rise in creativity.Moreover, you will feel energized and ready to work again, as your mood will experience a positive boost.

, Your brain will operate at its highest function when you have supplied your body with adequate nutrition.Eating the following foods can boost your brain function, which will help you to become a better and more productive writer:Coffee
Fish
Blueberries
Whole Grains
Avocados
Ginseng

Work to the Pomodoro method.,
Write every day.,
Create your own routine.,
Switch it up.",How to Boost Your Writing Productivity4," The Pomodoro method is working for twenty five minutes, then taking a pause for five minutes.Every four sequences, take a fifteen minute break instead of a five minute.This way you will be able to track your working schedule and give you some time for internal and external distractions, such as social media accounts or hunger.

, It is important to set up a schedule in which you write every day even when you don’t need to.Having a word count objective for each day also helps you to stay on task and maintain your routine.For example, you might choose to write 1,000 words each day. Once you’ve set up a routine like this, working becomes more of a habit and less of a chore.

, Some people prefer to write in the morning, others like to write at night. Some people prefer to utilize a word count goal each day, while others prefer to write on a specific assignment. Whatever your preference, set a routine for yourself to turn the act of writing into a habit for you.While scheduling the same time of day for writing may seem inconvenient at first, after a while, you’ll find it very helpful. Here are things to keep in mind:


What time of day do you prefer to write?
How long do you prefer to work at a stretch?
What is your preferred objective when writing? Is it a word count goal, a deadline, a specific assignment, or a particular topic?
What type of writing habit are you seeking to build?

, When you work on a big project you may find yourself stuck on a certain chapter. This means it is time to switch to something else, like a second project. This can unblock your creativity and make you productive again. When you feel tired of the second project, return to the first one. This way, you will boost your productivity and work on two different projects at the same time.

"
"
Use free writing techniques.,
Write a sloppy copy.,
Jot down placeholder sentences.",How to Boost Your Writing Productivity5," Free writing is where you write whatever comes to your mind, though staying on topic is certainly helpful. This will help you get your ideas down on paper, which can relieve writer’s block. Free writing can be done by following these steps:Relax and turn your mind into a blank canvas. Try not to think about anything.
Set a time limit for this exercise. It might be five minutes or it might be a half an hour.
Write for your chosen length of time without stopping. It’s okay if you write nonsense, have spelling errors, don’t use punctuation or correct grammar. It’s okay if you jump from topic to topic, or if you forget the idea you had begun to write down. If you get stuck, you can write something like, “I am free writing, “ over and over again until a new idea pops up.
Stop writing when you run out of time. You might be in mid-sentence and that’s okay, but make sure that you respect your time limit.
Go back and read what you’ve written. Is there an idea or set of ideas that sparks your imagination or compels you to write more about them? If so, get to writing. If not, try another free writing session.

, The sloppy copy is your first draft, but it is so called because it will inevitably have mistakes. Don’t worry about fixing spelling, punctuation, or grammar until you’ve gotten all of your ideas down on paper.The goal is to create an entire essay or article in first draft form. Once you have completed your rough draft, you can begin to make revisions and edits.

, Using placeholder text allows you to fill up your page, so that you aren’t staring at a lot of blank space when you are beginning a project. You might decide to put the placeholder sentences in a different color font so that you know where they are and can delete them when you’ve finished writing what you want to write, Ideally, the placeholder sentences that you use might have something to do with what you are writing about, but that needn’t be the case.

See the image in your own mind first.,

Add simile.,
Don’t overdo it.,
Obey the rules of grammar.,
Use style to emphasize your writing.,
Break the rules of grammar occasionally!,
Don’t overuse adverbs.,
Watch out for the passive voice.,
Avoid clichés.",How to Create Sentences That Paint Pictures in People's Minds," If you can’t see the scene you’re trying to write about in your own mind, you can’t expect your reader to see it. Close your eyes, or keep them open—whichever works for you—and imagine everything that is going on in the scene you want to describe in your writing.For example, if you’re going to describe a house, start by picturing the house in your mind. Pictures the details of the house: is it small or big? Wooden or brick? New or crumbling? The more details about the house you can picture in the mind, the more you’ll be able to convey the scene to your reader.
Not everyone has a good “mind’s eye.” In other words, not everyone can see clear pictures in their minds. If you have a dull mind’s eye, don’t fret: you can likely still imagine scenes in your mind—you just don’t see them in clear pictures.Your reader will never see exactly the same scene you see in your mind. That’s OK. That’s the beauty of reading: each person uses their own experiences and imagination to fill in the gaps.;
, Take the image in your mind and write down what you see. You can begin by writing down more about the scene than you’ll keep in your final sentence.Pay attention to the details you want the reader to notice and ignore the unimportant details. If you describe the whole scene in equal detail, the reader won’t know they you wanted them to focus on one specific thing in the scene.
For example, if you’re writing about a tree you want to focus on the details of the tree and leave out too much detail about the tree’s surroundings. “The dull-gray birch tree swayed in the breeze,” calls attention to the tree. “The landscape was mostly barren, with a few tall trees jutting out of the yellow grass,” calls attention to the landscape as a whole rather than a particular tree.

, Pay attention to all of the sounds happening in the scene. In ordinary life we often times tune out sounds. As a writer, it’s your job to get the reader to tune in to the sounds you want them to hear. If there are any sounds you want the reader to pay attention to, write them down. For example, “The screech of an owl pierced the silence in the field.”Consider all of the available sounds in your scene. For example, if you’re describing a busy apartment complex, you might hear people talking or arguing through the walls, a car honking in the parking lot, or the sound of muffled music coming from the apartment below. All of these sounds help paint the scene in your reader’s mind.

, This is important if you’re describing a character’s experience of touching an object. For example, “Bruce picked up the rock and held it. From the ground it had looked smooth, but in his hands it was rough and covered in a slimy film.”Try to think of any tactile sensations that will help your reader identify with the scene. If your character is in a dentist’s office, you might talk about the feel of the vinyl arms of the dentist’s chair, or the vibration of the drill on the patient’s teeth.

, Do this by considering the context of your scene. Did your character just wake up? You could describe the slimy taste of unbrushed teeth.Taste can sometimes be used to describe a setting. For example, if you’re writing about a coal mine you might say, “The workers arrived every morning at 4 a.m., and each morning they were greeted with thick curtains of black dust and soot that coated their tongues, so that they could taste their own deaths approaching day-by-day.”

, Smell is the strongest sense associated with memory, so describing smells is a good opportunity to get your reader to picture a scene in their minds. For example, you could write a descriptive sentence like: “A fire burned in the distance and Robin could smell the that it was seeded with pine and oak.”Think of all the little smells that we notice on a day-to-day basis. If your character is walking through a busy New York street, you might describe the smell of hotdogs or flowers, or the sudden whiff of garbage or sewage as they turn a corner., Metaphors compare the idea you are writing about directly to another idea in a way that brings your idea to life. Metaphors offer you unlimited creativity in your writing and can turn a bland sentence into a colorful image.There is almost no limit to how you use metaphors. Don’t be afraid to step outside the box (that’s a cliché metaphor!).
For example, if your character is depressed, you might write, “In his depression, it was always 3 a.m. in his mind.” In this example the writer is describing depression and comparing it to the feeling of being awake at 3 a.m. all of the time. In describing scenery, you might write, “The birch trees were white fire, lit up by the setting sun.” In this example, the writer is describing the birch trees and comparing their color to white fire.

, Similes are a kind of metaphor that uses indirect comparisons with words like “like” and “as.”To emphasize a character’s affectation, you could write, “He waived his finger at her like a magic wand.” To call your reader’s attention to quiet in a scene, you could write, “The night was as still as the surface of the moon.”
With similes (and metaphors), it’s important that the comparison conveys something meaningful. The best way to describe this concept is with a bad metaphor. “He waited for her like a man waiting for a roast beef sandwich,” is a simile, but it’s hard to see what meaning if being conveyed since it isn’t obvious what a man waiting for a roast beef sandwich is like., Metaphor and simile can greatly enrich your writing, but they can also be distracting if used too often. Limit your use of metaphor and simile to places where it will help the reader understand the picture you and trying to paint.Here’s an example of too much metaphor and simile: “Her face was a red beet of rage. She rushed at him like a bullet from a gun and struck his frozen face. He fell back as though struck by a train.”

, Grammar rules exist for a reason: they make writing easier to understand so the reader doesn’t have to work to figure out what you’re trying to say. Grammar rules also help avoid ambiguity. For example, consider the following sentences: “Let’s eat Grandpa,” and “Let’s eat, Grandpa.” Each sentence has a different meaning thanks to the absence or presence of the comma.You don’t need to be a grammar expert to write good sentences, but you do need to have at least an intuitive feel for the rules of grammar. A good way to check if you’re using grammar correctly is to read a sentence that you’ve written and ask yourself, “would this sentence make sense to me if I hadn’t written it?”
Don’t be afraid to refresh your grammar skills if you need to.

, Two sentences can convey the same information but have a different feeling depending on how they use grammar. Consider this pair of examples: “The verdict was in. He was guilty,” and “The verdict was in—guilty.” The second sentence empathizes “guilty” more than the first sentence.The most recommended book on style out there is still Strunk and White’s “The Elements of Style.” Pick up a copy if you need some inspiration., The cliché that rules are made to be broken applies well to grammar. You shouldn’t break the rules before knowing them. But ignoring strict grammatical perfection can add color and feeling to your writing.Most authors break the rules of grammar from time-to-time, so you’ll be in good company. In fact, breaking the rules of grammar can add style and flourish to your writing. The following phrase breaks the rules of grammar - notice the lack of conjunctions, for instance - but presents vivid imagery that couldn’t be achieved by following the rules: “The craft descended, the night was lit up in an array of colors, the stars dimmed to nothing behind the brightness of the lights, all the color washed out of Mindy’s face under the light’s intensity, the night was made brightest day.”
You still want your writing to make sense, so don’t break a grammatical rule if it will make your writing difficult to read. The goal of grammar—and the lack thereof—is to make the reader understand what you’re trying to say. For example, the following example makes it hard to understand what the author is trying to say: “She bit into the apple a cold thing crying not knowing why.”

, Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs and usually end in -ly. The problem with adverbs is that they show the reader you’re afraid of not getting your point across. You want your writing to be clear, but you don’t want to spell everything out for the reader—otherwise there’s no room for the reader’s imagination.Try to let your descriptions of things speak for themselves, without the need for adverbs. For example, the sentence “the front yard was covered in car parts,” conveys the same information as “the front yard was completely covered in car parts,” but the second sentence is redundant. If the yard is covered, it’s covered.
Watch for adverbs in dialogue attribution. Authors use adverbs in dialogue attribution when they’re afraid the reader doesn’t understand the characters in the story. For example, if two characters are having an argument and you have to write, “Tom slammed the door angrily,” you probably haven’t done enough work to convince the reader that there’s an argument going on. “Tom slammed the door,” conveys the same meaning if the reader understands the character’s motivations.
Sometimes using adverbs makes sense. The key is not to overuse adverbs; you can still use them if they help the reader. For example, if your story takes place in London, it might be OK to say, “It was especially dreary that day,” since it’s always kind of dreary in London.

, The passive voice sucks energy and agency out of your writing. Simply replacing every instance of passive voice with the active voice will likely improve your writing.One use of passive voice is where an object has something done to it instead of an actor—an agent—doing something to an object. For example, “Kara flung open the door,” and “The door was flung open by Kara,” convey the same information, but the former is active. In other words, it has Kara doing something rather than having something done by Kara.
Another use of passive voice is where the actor is left out altogether. “Mistakes were made,” is a good example. That sentence hardly paints a picture at all. What mistakes? And who made them? Instead, you could say: “Donald’s career was full of mistakes: small mistakes—typos, missed deadlines, not-so-sick sick days—, and big mistakes—lying in court, covering up crime’s for his rich clients, bribing elected officials.”

, Some clichés are obvious. “The pen is mightier than the sword,” or “You really struck out this time.” Others are so embedded in our language that we hardly notice them. “He was running on empty,” or “Danny needed to blow off some steam.” Clichés are dangerous because they oftentimes feel very descriptive; the problem is that they’re so overused that they’re no longer effective as calling up an image in readers’ minds.Clichés mostly pop up when you’re trying to think of metaphors and similes. For example, you might describe the night as “black as pitch,” or a character as “boiling over with rage.” Watch out for these clichés, and try to use your imagination to come up with original metaphors and similes. For example, you could write, “she walked outside and the dark fell over her like a blanket,” or “Danny’s anger was an iron core just short of nova.”
It’s OK to use clichés if you do so with a purpose. Maybe one of your characters is meant to be very cliché, or maybe you’re using a cliché ironically. The important thing is to be aware that you’re using clichés and you know why you’re using them.

Think about why you want to write in English.,
Examine your current skill by doing a simple test on the internet.,
Make a list of things that you need to improve on.,
Read lots of books, newspapers, and articles in English.,
Start writing your story using grammar and spell check on the computer.,
Talk to native English speakers.,
Complete your work and decide if it is worth trying to publish.",How to Become a Writer Using English if It's Your Second Language," Perhaps you think English is more popular and there are more chances for your books to become a best seller, or perhaps you have problems writing in your first language. Whatever your reasons are, if you have made up your mind that you want to write your novels, books, facts, fictions or any article in the English language, then there is nothing to worry about because a language becomes yours if you fully master the language.;
, Search on the Internet for English literacy tests and choose one which suits your style. If you are living in a country where people speak English, then you must have an idea how good your English is, so rate yourself, on a scale of one to ten, by judging your own skill in conversations and discussions. Once you have found out on which level your English stands, then find the root of your weaknesses in the language, such as grammar, spelling mistakes, vocabulary, and most of all, your style of writing. Writing mostly depends on your talent as a writer, and you can easily improve your mechanics.

, For example, if you need to improve your grammar, then work out the best way to improve it. If you don't have time to join a class in your area, or there is no course for your grammar needs, then purchase some good literature in English (both writing help and original literature).

, This will help you improve your writing, as well as help you learn the norms of English writing. Although reading other books will improve your writing style in English, bear in mind that you can't copy people's work (called plagiarism), but you can always learn from reading, and reading might inspire your writing as well.

, Also, read your work and be your own editor, work with patience, ask your English-speaking friends to read your story, and get their critiques in order to improve your writing.

, This way you can learn how to write dialogue in your story.

, If it is, do not hesitate to send it to publishers. Do your best, but don't obsess about making it perfect before you send it, because the publishing company has professional editors to do that for you.

Read the story.,
Take notes.,
Find the main characters.,
Note down the setting.,
Note the story's conflict.,
Note the main events.,
Note the conclusion.,
Organize your notes.,
Write the summary.,
Look at examples of plot summaries.,
Revise your summary.",How to Summarize a Story," It will be very difficult to summarize a story without actually reading it. So crack open your book, or plug in some headphones and listen to it on your iPod. Don't always trust the internet sites that claim to summarize books, because they aren't always accurate.


As you're reading you need to keep in mind what the central idea of the story is. For Lord of the Rings, for instance, the central idea might be something about how the power of greed (i.e. the Ring) is a strong force for evil, or even the actions of one insignificant person (like a hobbit) can change the world.

, You'll need to take notes as you read so that you have refer to them when you're ready to start the summary. Look for the ""who? what? when? where? why?"" These will give you the basis for what you want to cover in your summary.

, You'll need to know who the story is about, after all, and you need to figure out which characters aren't as important to the narrative. If you're reading a story with tons of characters, you won't want to note down every single character that appears.


For example: for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone you would write down Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, because they are the main characters. You might even note down Hagrid, Dumbledore, Snape, Quirrell, and Voldemort because they figure importantly in the story.
You wouldn't need to write down Peeves the poltergeist, or Norbert the dragon, because while they are important in their places in the story, they don't influence the main storyline enough to be part of the summary.
A shorter story like ""Little Red Riding Hood"" is easy because you only have to note down Red Riding Hood, her grandmother, the wolf, and the woodcutter (depending on the version).

, The setting is where the events take place. Now this can get complicated if the story you're reading takes place in a lot of different places. If that's the case, you'll need to be more broad.


Continuing the Harry Potter example: the main action takes place at Hogwarts, so you could write down something like 'the magical school Hogwarts in the United Kingdoms.'
Now for a story like Lord of the Rings, which takes place over a large amount of territory, you can mention that it's Middle-Earth, and note some places of important like the Shire, Mordor, and Gondor. You don't have to go too specific (like mentioning the forest Fangorn, or the tower Minas Morgul).

, This means whatever is the main problem that the characters are having to overcome. It doesn't necessarily have to be a villain, like with Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.


For Harry Potter, the main conflict is Voldemort's attempt to steal the Sorcerer's Stone and return to menace the Wizard World (and kill Harry).
For example, if you're summarizing The Odyssey, the main conflict is Odysseus trying to get home to Ithaca. Everything about the story is driven by his desire to get home and all the obstacles standing in his way.

, These are the most important parts of the story. You don't need to note down every single thing that a character does. In fact, that is exactly what you're supposed to not do! Just look for the events that further the main conflict, or help resolve it.


For Harry Potter, some main events would be Harry finding out he's a wizard, or Harry meeting the three-headed dog and, of course, Harry, Ron, and Hermione defeating Voldemort.
It might seem easier for a shorter story like 'Little Red Riding Hood,' but you should only note down the most important moments like Riding Hood meeting the wolf, getting eaten after she mistakes the wolf for her grandmother, and the appearance of the woodcutter.

, This is the big event, usually, that wraps up the story's conflict and resolves the problems. Even in a book that is part of a series there is usually some sort of conclusion to the story. Spoilers below!


For Harry Potter the conclusion is defeating Voldemort. The story after that isn't important to the summary, even if it is important to the overall story. You won't need to go into the conversation between Dumbledore and Harry at the end, or even the Gryffindor House winning points, because it isn't really part of the main Voldemort storyline.
For Red Riding Hood, the conclusion is the appearance of the woodcutter to save her and her grandmother.
For something like Lord of the Rings, the conclusion is complicated for a summary, because you may want to stop off at the destruction of the Ring, but (especially if the central idea of the story is the importance of the the deeds of one insignificant person) you will want to mention the Scouring of the Shire, and Frodo's departure from the Grey Havens.

, The hardest part is already finished, reading the book! if you've taken all your notes, you're completely ready to write the summary. You'll want to organize your notes based on the chronology of the story. Look at where the story begins and ends and how the main character gets from the first to the last.


To continue with the Harry Potter example, you'll need to look at how Harry went from learning he was a wizard to defeating Voldemort.
For something like The Odyssey you'll need to look at how Odysseus gets from his losing all his men and washing up on Calypso's island to defeating the suitors and convincing Penelope of his identity.
A short story like Red Riding Hood, you'll need to look at why Riding Hood was going into the woods, how she was fooled into being eaten and how she was saved.

, This will be totally easy, now that you've gotten all your notes in order. All you need to do is write a short paragraph covering the key points of who? what? when? where? why? which you've already covered in your notes. Make sure that you also include the title of the story and the name of the author.


Make sure that you only focus on the main plot of the story. Don't get side tracked into Harry's Quidditch playing, or his feud with Malfoy.
Likewise, don't quote from the story itself. You don't need to replicate conversations from the story in the summary. You might need to briefly mention the key point from a conversation (like 'When Harry and his friends discover from Hagrid that the Sorcerer's Stone might no longer be safe, they go to stop the thief themselves.')

, It is a lot easier to write something if you've looked at a couple examples and get the hang of the kind of wording to use and the way to incorporate all the different elements into one short, cohesive piece.


'J.K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" tells the story of eleven-year-old orphan Harry Potter, who discovers that he is a wizard and goes to study magic at the British school for wizards, Hogwarts. While there he discovers that his parents were killed by the evil wizard, Voldemort, who was destroyed by Harry when he was a baby. With his friends, Ron Weasley, who comes from a large family of wizards, and Hermione Granger, the smartest witch in their year, Harry figures out that the Sorcerer's Stone, which gives eternal life, is hidden on the off-limits third floor. When Harry and his friends discover from Hagrid that the Sorcerer's Stone is no longer be safe, they go to stop the thief themselves, who they think is Professor Snape, who hates Harry. When Harry finds the Stone, he discovers that the thief is Professor Quirrell, who is possessed by Voldemort. Because of a spell cast by Harry's mother, he is able to defeat Quirrell and Voldemort is forced back into hiding.'
'Homer's epic poem ""The Odyssey"" tells the story of the Greek hero, Odysseus, and ten-year voyage to get home to the island of Ithaca where his wife, Penelope, and his son, Telemachus waited. It begins with Odysseus imprisoned by the nymph Calypso until the Greek Gods force her to free him. The god Poseidon, who harbors a grudge against Odysseus for blinding his son the Cyclops Polyphemus previously in his travels, attempts to wreck his ship, but is stopped by the goddess Athena. Odysseus makes it to Scheria, home of the Phaeacians, where he is given safe passage and asked about his journeys to this point. Odysseus tells them of the variety of adventures he suffered through with his crew, the trip to the Land of the Lotus Eaters, his blinding of Polyphemus, his love affair with the witch-goddess Circe, the deadly Sirens, the journey into Hades, and his fight with the sea monster Scylla among them. The Phaeacians take him safely to Ithaca, where he enters the hall disguised as a beggar. In Ithaca, supposing Odysseus to be dead, suitors have taken over his hall, tried to kill his son and tried to convince Penelope to choose one of them. Penelope, believing Odysseus to be alive, has refused. She arranges a contest with Odysseus's bow, that only he can string. Once he's strung it, he shoots all the suitors and is reunited with his family.'
These summaries cover the main plots of the stories that they're summarizing. They use sentences like ""When Harry finds the Stone..."" instead of explaining exactly what it took to find the stone, which is not the point of a summary. They are brief and they focus only on the most important main characters, like Odysseus, Penelope, the gods, etc.

, Make sure that you've edited it so that there are no spelling errors, that the events are in their proper order and that you've spelled all the characters and place names correctly. It's best to have a friend look it over to catch anything you've missed. Once you've revised it, the summary is ready to go!

Solicit and respond to feedback.",How to Become Better at Academic Writing," Whether it be your favorite fashion magazine, a news article, or a novel, reading introduces you to different writing styles and techniques and gives you an idea of what does and doesn't work. Reading academic writing in your field will familiarize you with the standards and habits of fellow writers, and as you read more, you will start to get a feel for how you should be writing. Pay attention to writing tricks and techniques as you read, and take note of any you might use in your own writing.;
, The more you practice your writing, the better you will become. Try writing academic papers on any topics that come to mind, whether or not you have to turn them in for an assignment. Work on developing your writing style and try out different tricks in each piece you write. Try not to get stuck on the mechanics of grammar, spelling, and formatting - think instead about the overall tone, how you organize and present your ideas, and the goal of your writing.

, As a writer, you need to do more than make well-supported, and consistent arguments. Remember that you are not writing in a void. It is important to engage the audience and realize that yours is not the only one out there. Be well aware of the body of current and emerging work. Read other works that are related to your own, and respond to them in your own writing. When doing so, make sure to explicitly identify other viewpoints and respond to them appropriately, otherwise, your writing probably will not make any sense. In other words, what you are trying to say may be clear to your readers, but not the reasons for saying it nor how it fits into the milieu.

, Do plenty of research before you begin writing, and choose only those sources that provide new, interesting, relevant material to use in your work. Above all, when choosing sources, consider the relevance to your own writing. Your sources should support your claims, not lead the reader off on tangents. At the same time, your writing should not simply paraphrase various sources; you should offer a unique perspective or new information, adding something important to the wealth of existing knowledge.

, Citations are absolutely necessary in order to avoid plagiarism, so must always credit your sources. Additionally, citations indicate how grounded and in-depth your knowledge is, and contribute to making you more trustworthy as an author. Use specific, targeted citations to support your claims, particularly the more controversial ones.

, Order your paragraphs and supporting evidence in a linear progression through use of verbs, transitions, and signal phrases. For instance, begin with a summary of the background research, then turn to your own work. Introduce your project or experiment, describe your methods, report your findings, and then discuss their significance. Always make it clear exactly what you hope to accomplish with each part of your paper and with the paper as a whole, and organize your paper in a way such that this logical progression is perfectly clear.

, When writing, keep your readers interested by showing them why your thoughts are important. It's not enough to discuss your ideas and present your findings.—You also have to address the broader significance of your work. #Place your work in context of the academic field at large. Talk about what it does different from or more than every other paper; discuss the implications of your work for the field and open up suggestions for for the future, where to go next.

, When writing an academic paper, it can be tempting to use big words and complex sentence structures to try to sound smart. In fact, however, these structures only succeed in complicating your writing and obfuscating your ideas. They can make you seem pretentious and make it much more difficult for your readers to understand your ideas. Keep your tone casual and informative, and make sure the whole paper reads as simply and clearly as possible.

, This will help you develop a more effective writing style.

, Ask contemporaries and experts in the field for their impression of your ideas and their formulation. Plan to iteratively respond to the issues raised by each piece of feedback. Here, it is important to remain flexible and responsive, both in your viewpoint and your writing style. By stretching into new ways of thinking and writing, you will increase your ability to write clearly and in an understandable way so that your ideas will have maximal impact.

Once you've learned all the rules, break them.",How to Become a Writer," The large field of creative writing splits into subcategories (fiction, poetry, creative-nonfiction) and there are even specialized genres (sci-fi, mysteries, experimental… the list goes on). Figure out what you want to write. Write what you would want to read. Your best writing will spring forth from something that you, and maybe only you, are passionate about. When your passion is injected into your writing, your readers will, in turn, be interested. Your passion for your individual writing project is a powerful tool that will serve well as a starting point.


Remember that you don’t have to limit yourself to a single field. Many established writers spread out and explore—perhaps they write creative essays while publishing their creative non-fiction work. Maybe their short novels have poems inside of them.;
, Establish a particular time of day, location, and atmosphere for your writing sessions. As you establish this routine, the creative side of your brain will become accustomed to working in these familiar conditions. Things to consider are…


Noise: some writers enjoy absolute quiet. Others will listen to music to jog their creative juices. Others will want the company of friends to bounce ideas.
Time: Some writers jot down thoughts just before they sleep. Early mornings hours work well for others, as fewer people are awake to bother them. Other writers may enjoy being badgered, and therefore write in between coffee break or other work sessions. Other writers will like long periods of undisturbed writing time, and dedicate their weekends to writing.
Location: establishing a particular building, room, or even chair can help the writing process. This familiarity will train your brain to work creatively, or technically, to suit your goals.

, Reread the things you have enjoyed and study them—figure out what makes them effective, what makes them work. Try to understand the structure of your favorite poem, or the evolution of the characters in your favorite novel. Find a sentence that you think is great, and wonder—why did that author choose that phrase? This word?


Do not limit yourself single genres or fields. To truly enrich your writing experience, you must explore. You may not enjoy fantasy, but other people read and write fantasy for a reason. Read with this motto in mind: “I read to write. I read to learn. I read to be inspired.”

, Notice things. Pay attention to the world around you. Look for mysteries and try to solve them. If you have questions, pursue the answers with obsessive interest. Take special note of the quirky and unusual. When writing, having noticed things will help give you something to write about. Moreover, it can help make your writing more compelling, richer, and more realistic. Here are some pointers that will help you explore the world around you:


Nothing is ordinary or boring. There’s something odd or special about everyone and everything.
There’s a mystery in front of you: a TV that won’t turn on, a bird that won’t fly. Figure out how things work, don’t work, and why.
Pay attention to detail. The leaves are not only green: they've got long, thin veins, rigid stems, and are shaped like spades.

, Write down things that you notice or that inspire you. Take it everywhere you go. Some famous writers even went as far as to sew extra pockets into their jackets in order to carry more scraps of paper. Use this journal to produce ideas, take note of things you see, hear, or read, and flesh out your writing material. When you get stuck on your project, you can revisit it for inspiration. Understand that everything can go in your notebook, because everything is a source of inspiration. Some useful things are:


Dreams: a major source of the weird and unusual. Write it down before it disappears!
Pictures: photographs and doodles
Quotes: things people say, sentences that surprise you, short poems, the insides of a fortune cookie

, This is the most important part, and it can be very hard. Many of us stare blankly at the computer screen, with no words to write. Some call it “writers block.” To help, here are some basic writing exercises that can help jog your creative juices and provide a material for your project:


Go somewhere busy, preferably a place with lots of people. Imagine that your vision of the scene is a video camera, recording everything. Take out your notebook and write down exactly what is happening. Include all the senses—sight, smell, hearing, taste, and touch.
Take a voice recorder, and spy on a conversation. Don’t let the speakers know! After you've recorded for an adequate amount of time, transcribe the conversation on paper. Play with the words—delete things, change things, add things. Create a new setting, or a new situation.
Create a character. What do they want? Fear? What is their secret? Who are they related to, and where do they live? What’s their last name…if they even have one?

, There are a billion half-novels in the world and a trillion half-short stories. Setting a goal and sticking to it, however unpleasant the work gets, is essential to figuring out what you want to write. By the time you finish whatever you set out to write in the first place, you’ll have three things:

a good idea what you really want to write about
some skill with which to write about it
the tenacity to finish the job

, Sharing ideas and getting feedback is one of the best ways to become inspired and to improve your work. This can be scary for beginner writers, for your work can be something incredibly personal, and you may be afraid of rejection. However, writing in isolation means that not only is no one reading your work, but you can also run the risk of compounding bad habits (being too wordy, redundant, or melodramatic, etc.). Instead of being scared, think that every person you share your work with is a potential person to give you new ideas and inspire you.

, Being a writer is almost like being a superhero: awkward office job by day… dragon-riding, super sleuth, knight in armor WRITER by night. Some creative writers do not have day jobs—but this is very rare. However, having a day job is not a bad thing. In fact, a good day job can even be helpful to your goal in becoming a writer. When finding your dream day job, here are some things to consider:


Does it pay the bills? A good day job should ease your financial burdens so you can write without worry. Stress is not conducive to your project.
Does it leave you enough time and energy to write? A good day job should be easy enough on your energy level so that you’re not exhausted afterwards.
Does it provide a good “distraction”? Having a space away from your writing work can be helpful. Spending too much time on a single project can be overly immersive. It is good to take a step back.
Does it have other creative people? A good day job should give you awesome coworkers. Creative people are everywhere! They are not just writers or artists.

, No, don’t literally put them in handcuffs! Immerse them in your work. Suck them into the writing so that they will read and read and never want to escape, so that they will want you to handcuff them to your next book. To do this, here are some techniques you can use:


The senses. We perceive and experience the world through our senses. An immersive and convincing work will often have readers seeing, touching, tasting, hearing, and smelling.
Concrete details. These types of details provide a specific sense of understanding of what is going on in the writing. Rather than generalizing an image—“she was pretty”—get specific: “She had long, golden braids, which were interwoven with daisies.”

, If you are more familiar with something, you can write about it in more detail, realism, and depth. If you don’t know a detail that is important for your project, do research. Google it. Ask someone who knows. The more information you know about a situation, a person, or setting, the more you will be able to render it realistically on the page.

, Sometimes, the best way to write a story is “Linear Structure”: Beginning, Climax, and Resolution. However, there are many, many other ways to write a story. Consider “In Media Res”—when the story begins in the thick of things. Or, a story interspersed by multiple flashbacks. Choose your structure depending on your story’s progression.

, The 3 main categories are 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Person. When deciding point of view, think about what information you want your readers to have access to.


1st POV: uses ""I""

involved – narrator is an active player and teller of the story
detached – narrator is not telling their own story specifically, but maybe the story of a central character
Plural (we) – a collective narrator, maybe a large group of people


2nd POV: uses ""You""

inverted, the narrator is referring to him or herself as the writer, and perhaps dissociating themselves from distasteful thoughts/traits/memories
You = a character, distinct with their own unique qualities
You = direct address to the reader
You = reader is active character in the story


3rd POV: uses a character name

omniscient – narrator knows everything, has free reign in the story and complete authority, and can hurl judgments
limited – this POV is missing something. It is like a window of vision that gets smaller and smaller as you become more limited
single characters’ thoughts and feelings -- Harry Potter is limited to Harry's thoughts and feelings
direct observer -- a narrator's telling of situation, but cannot explicitly discern the emotions of the characters
fly on the wall--the narrator is spy, watching the situation from a distant perspective, but is not privy to everything for information is limited by the narrator's location on the wall



, Simple is the best way to start. While you will undoubtedly need a well-stocked vocabulary (more on that later), too many big words will drive all but the most dedicated readers away. Start small. Don't hold onto a grandiose word just because it sounds fancy. Aim instead to allow everyone who reads your writing to comprehend exactly what you wanted them to comprehend. Nothing more, and nothing less.

, Short sentences are easy to digest and are very readable. That's not to say that you can't, or shouldn't, write a long sentence every once in a while. It's just that simple sentences deliver information without stopping the reader in his or her tracks, stranding them on an island of befuddlement.


Take a look at a notorious long, overwrought sentence. The following sentence won the satirical Bad Writing Contest second-prize. It's no secret why it qualifies as ""bad writing."" The sentence is caked in jargon, riddled with imprecise catchphrases, and is way too long:

""If, for a while, the ruse of desire is calculable for the uses of discipline soon the repetition of guilt, justification, pseudo-scientific theories, superstition, spurious authorities, and classifications can be seen as the desperate effort to “normalize” formally the disturbance of a discourse of splitting that violates the rational, enlightened claims of its enunciatory modality."", Verbs are the great drivers of sentences. They carry meaning from one thought to the next. On top of that, they help writers achieve dazzling degrees of precision.


Pay close attention to certain problem verbs. Verbs such as ""did,"" ""went,"" ""saw,"" ""felt,"" and ""had,"" while occasionally appropriate, don't really add any spice to your writing. Substitute a more specific word for problem verbs when appropriate: ""accomplished,"" ""skipped,"" ""gazed,"" ""experienced,"" and ""secure"" all communicate more specific ideas.
Use the active voice instead of the passive voice, as a rule of thumb.
Active voice: ""The cat found her master."" Here, the cat is doing the work, so to speak. She is actively finding her master.
Passive voice: ""The master is found by his cat."" Here, the cat is more removed from the action. The master is being found; the cat isn't finding.



, The beginning writer will go crazy with adjectives. There's nothing wrong with adjectives, except that they can sometimes be redundant and are often more obscure — and therefore harder to understand — than other parts of speech. Don't feel like you need to include an adjective before every noun in order to describe the noun.


Sometimes, adjectives are redundant. Take the sentence ""I watched as he lifted the last pawn and set it down, checkmating the king, clinching his successful victory."" What victory isn't successful? Here, the adjective simply restates what we already know. It doesn't add anything to to help the reader comprehend what's going on.
Other times, the adjectives writers use can be pretty obscure. ""He is a puissant adversary"" is a sentence that is neither accessible nor fitting. ""Puissant"" means powerful, and substituting ""powerful"" for ""puissant"" would have made the sentence both understandable and bearable.

, Keep a dictionary and thesaurus by your side at all times. Whenever you come across a word that you don't know, look it up. It's hard to call yourself a writer if you're not at least marginally interested in etymology. At the same time, use your vocabulary sparingly. Just because you know the words ""defenestrate,"" ""pyknic,"" and ""agnomen"" doesn't mean you should be finding excuses to use them.


Study roots of words. Word roots (especially Latin roots for the English language) will help you decipher the meanings of unknown words without a dictionary. Knowing the roots mal-, ben-, epi-, eu-, ag-, and con- is a good start.

, It's tempting for people who use words for a living to use them a little loosely. Often, when we're stuck and we don't know which word to use, we wing it and write down a word that's ""good enough."" This strategy is useful and necessary in everyday conversation, but problematic in writing.


For one, there's no social context. The writer can't use his or her hands to gesture, and can't rely on facial expressions to steer the conversation toward clarity. The reader is all alone, and must rely solely on the words to gather meaning.
Second, the reader takes what the writer says at face value. The reader doesn't expect to have to ask the writer whether she meant what she wrote; the reader assumes that the writer meant what she wrote. The writer doesn't clarify confusing words, which means that if you write down a confusing word, the reader is left confused.

For these reasons, take the time to say what you mean. Figure out what you want to say before you say it. Be dogged about sniffing out the right word, even if it takes you time. A lot of sub-par writing is the refusal to fit the right word with an idea, not issues with plot or stylistic concerns.

, Examples of figurative language are metaphor and simile. It's best to use metaphor and simile when you want to dramatize or draw the reader's attention to something specific. Like saying ""I love you,"" figurative language loses much of its power if used incessantly.

, Good punctuation is neither seen nor heard, but is powerful nonetheless. Underuse punctuation and your readers won't be able to understand the meaning of your sentences. ""Let's eat, Mommy,"" and ""Let's eat Mommy"" have two very different meanings. Overuse punctuation and your readers will be distracted. No one wants to read a sentence in which colons, semicolons, and dashes make more appearances that actual words.


Exclamation points. Use exclamation points sparingly. People don't often exclaim things; nor do sentences often merit exclamation. Elmore Leonard, the great crime writer, has this to say: ""Keep your exclamation points under control. You are allowed no more than two or three per 100,000 words of prose.""
Semicolons. Semicolons act as hybrid periods, connecting two sentences that have logical connection. Still, Kurt Vonnegut argues against them: ""Do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show you've been to college.""Although Vonnegut's assessment might be a little harsh, it's probably only good to use them from time to time.

, Don't be afraid to invert rules or play with them to achieve the sort of writing you want. Some of the greatest writers have successfully broken grammatical, stylistic, and semantic rules, making literature better by doing so. Know why you're breaking the rule in the first place, and understand its likely effect. But if you're not willing to take some risks, what are you doing calling yourself a writer?

Ensure that your conclusion is clear and purposeful.,
Assess the value of the written piece.,
Proofread your work.",How to Revise a Piece of Writing," Setting aside written work for a few hours, a day or several days will give you a fresh perspective.
, An effective introduction is clear, easy to understand and an accurate indication of what the reader can expect from reading the rest of your piece.

Assess the clarity of your introduction. Ensure that your main argument or point is stated clearly. If you are using terminology that the reader may not understand, clarify its meaning and context at the beginning of your written piece.

, A well-organized essay or article leads the reader through a clear line of thinking. Decide whether your work is properly structured. For example, in a how-to article, the steps should be in a logical order. In a thesis paper, your strongest argument should be presented in the beginning of the paper., If an idea can be expressed in 1 word or sentence rather than 2, use the shorter option.

Look for repetition of ideas. Remove repetition of thoughts, details and arguments. If you have said it once, it does not need to be said again.
Correct repetitive sentence structure. Avoid starting consecutive sentences and paragraphs with the same subject and verb. Limit instances of ending consecutive sentences with the same word.
Revise word repetition within a sentence. Replace words with alternative language to avoid repetition. Use a thesaurus, if necessary, to find the most suitable words.

, Read your work out loud to get a sense of its flow. Insert transitional words and sentences to correct abrupt changes in thoughts and ideas., Determine if your conclusion is an effective ending for your piece. In an essay, the conclusion should be a brief summary of your thesis and main points. The conclusion of a blog post might be a call to action or a request for input from readers., High-quality writing reflects a person's own ideas, thoughts and conclusions. Determine if the piece presents a fresh perspective on the topic at hand. If what you have written is simply a regurgitation of existing material, examine your own thoughts, experiences and/or opinions to inject original ideas into the piece.

Review your written work for effectiveness. Ensure that the piece meets your objective. Your goal may be to persuade, inspire, entertain, educate or inform the reader. Determine if your work is accomplishing its goal.

, This step should be completed at the very end, after you have made all organizational and content changes.

Use a spellchecker to catch errors. Comb the work for incorrect punctuation, spelling, grammar, syntax and spacing issues.
Print out the piece. Errors are typically easier to spot on paper than on a computer screen.

Stay away from minor details.,
Write a statement that serves a purpose.",How to Conclude a Paragraph," Read through your paragraph and note what you’ve covered. You can also refer to your outline if you made one. Since your concluding statement should sum up what you’ve said, it’s important to go over those details while you’re writing the closing statement.Focus on what you lay out in the topic sentence.
Note your evidence and details.;
, Your concluding statement should reinforce your main idea. This is what you stated in your topic sentence. Make sure that your paragraph sticks to this main idea, and then craft your concluding statement around it.If your topic sentence reads, “Cats may be small, but they’re mighty predators,” then your main idea is that cats are big hunters.
Your concluding statement should show how your paragraph supported the idea that cats are big predators. For example, a closing statement might read, “Based on these statistics, cats are predators who hunt frequently and decrease the area bird population.”

, A concluding statement reminds the reader of your main idea and what you’ve just said about it, so it will act as a loose summary of the paragraph. Since it’s only one sentence, you don’t want to go into detail. Instead, jot down a brief summary of your paragraph, the use it to draft the sentence you’ll use for your essay.For example, the closing statement above, “Based on these statistics, cats are predators who hunt frequently and decrease the area bird population,” reminds the reader that the paragraph just provided statistics about how often cats hunt and how they impact the local bird population. These details support the main idea, and the writer has mentioned both.

, Show your reader that you are ending the paragraph by starting the sentence with a transition word that signals the sentence type. This will direct your reader to what they need to understand.Examples of signal words include:

Finally
Lastly
In the end
Consequently
As a result
Overall, Look back at your topic sentence. This is your main idea, so it needs to be reflected in the closing statement. However, you shouldn’t just paraphrase what you wrote in the topic sentence. Instead, add what the reader learned about the topic in this paragraph.An example topic sentence might read: “Cats are natural predators because they enjoy hunting and will even hunt for sport.”
Your concluding statement for this paragraph might read: “As a result of their continued hunts even after they’re domesticated and provided cat food, cats are proven to be natural predators.”

, Your concluding statement should reflect the type of paper you’re writing. In a persuasive or argument paper, you should use the closing statement to remind the reader of your stance.As an example, “The data shows that cats hunt even when they have steady meals, which proves that they are natural hunters.”

, Your concluding sentence should point out for the reader what you have compared or contrasted in the paragraph, as well as what the reader should take from the information you provided. This will direct your reader back to the purpose of your essay.For example, “As the data shows, feral cats hunt 140% more than domestic cats.”

, A cause and effect essay should show how one event leads to or contributes to another. Explain in your concluding sentence how the details you provided in your paragraph support the relationship that your essay is trying to prove.For example, “Consequently, homes that own cats have fewer birds living in their yards.”

, If you’re writing to inform your audience, remind them of the facts you’ve provided in the paragraph. You don’t need to list everything you said. All you need is a summary of what it all means.For example, “In the end, cats hunt out of instinct.”

, Another way to be effective is to show the reader how the evidence or examples you provided in the paragraph link back to the topic sentence. While you should have already done that in the paragraph itself, the concluding statement should cap off what you’ve said.For example, “To conclude, feral cats are more dangerous to birds than house cats because they have more hunting opportunities and kill more birds each year on average.” This sentence supports the main idea that feral cats hunt more than house cats and shows how the two details provided in the sentence link back to the topic sentence.

, Use your concluding statement to set up the next paragraph. This does not mean stating that you will be adding another paragraph. It means that you should provide the reader with a smooth transition into the next topic sentence.

Signal words like “To conclude,” “In summation,” “As the data shows,” etc. all signal to the reader that you are ending your discussion of a main idea.For example, your closing statement could read, “In summation, statistics show that cats who wear bell collars are less of a threat to birds because they kill fewer birds even if they have the same number of hunting opportunities.” This signals to the reader that the writer has finished with one main idea and is moving onto another in a new paragraph.

, Many writers are tempted to conclude their paragraphs using statements that begin with “As I have shown” or “This shows my assertions are correct.” Keep your essay in the formal third-person, which will make your ideas more convincing.

You also want to avoid the word “you.” For example, don’t say, “As you can see” in your concluding sentence.

, While you want to allude to the evidence or examples you provided, don’t make your concluding sentence about those minor points. Instead, keep it focused on the main idea. Reread your concluding statement, then compare it to your paragraph. Do you reference one detail but not another? If it does, rewrite the sentence to address the main points, not the subpoints.

, Sometimes closing sentences can become formulaic or repetitive. To prevent this, make sure that your main idea comes through and the sentence connects the explanation in the paragraph to that main idea.A poor closing statement might read: “As you can see, the evidence suggests that cats like to hunt.""
A better closing statement could read: “Based on the data, cats look for opportunities to hunt for sport, proving they are natural predators.""

Successful writers often need to adopt the methods of others to become better rounded. Find writers that you admire and read their work. What is it that you like about their writing? Determining that will help you adopt their successful methods into your own writing.
Try to adopt the facets of their writing that you appreciate without copying their writing style. Incorporate their strengths into your writing skill set.;
, Not everything about their writing may translate well into your own style, but it will help you develop a better rounded understanding of the craft and establish a rhythm to your work. Start by reading the work of some of these authors:


Ernest Hemingway
James Joyce
William Faulkner
Charles Dickens

, If there are writers that are succeeding at the type of writing you hope to do, study how they write. Some kinds of writing require specific formatting or tones; reading successful work can help you understand those requirements.

, Choose strategic detail. Think about what your words are saying about your environment, your characters, your narrator, and your style. Rushing could cause you to make unnecessary mistakes. Craft your writing carefully like you're cooking a complicated dish. Leaving out an important ingredient could ruin the final product.


Write your first draft by hand so you're forced to slow down your pace and choose words carefully. This will give you an opportunity to select your word choices and establish a rhythm to your writing. If you are submitting your writing to be published or for a grade, taking your time will help you avoid spelling or grammatical mistakes.This will reduce the time you have to spend revising your work.
Keep writing. The more you write the more you'll know what works and what to cut later. For now it's important to get words on paper. You can always return for another edit. It's always better to have too much and remove content than it is to have to try to strengthen your argument in later revisions.
Allow yourself plenty of time to create an outline and write your first draft. Step away from your work for a while after the draft is complete so you can return to it with fresh eyes.

, Writing large words doesn't always mean having large ideas. It's okay to use big words, but remember to keep your audience in mind when writing. Difficult words can sometimes alienate readers and if you aren't sure about the definitions of your word choices you run the risk of using a word incorrectly.

, Choose your words carefully to best convey your thoughts without using slang terms or colloquialisms.If you're unsure if a word is slang, look it up in the dictionary to confirm.

, Using simple words doesn't have to mean using small words. The length of a word is less important than how commonly understood it is. Sometimes your writing may call for larger words, but make sure you have a thorough understanding of the word's use and try to choose words your audience will understand. Again, if you are unsure about a word, look it up to make sure you have a good understanding of its meaning and how to use it.


Convey your ideas in the simplest way possible. Ernest Hemingway said it best when he said, ""My aim is to put down on paper what I see and what I feel in the best and simplest way.""Use a thesaurus to find alternate words with the same or similar meanings. Be simple and concise without sounding repetitive by using alternate words.
Convey your ideas without adding unnecessary information or unrelated descriptive terms.

, After you've studied the work of experts, it's important not to lose yourself in their methods. Adopt things that help you strengthen your writing, but don't focus on writing just like them. Everyone has their own voice or perspective, and yours may be exactly what a publisher or teacher is looking for.

, Remember, length isn't necessarily a goal. The difference between, ""the giant night sky was starry,"" and, ""the darkening sky was a silent black dome to infinity, pierced by mystique white eyes of charisma, gazing down upon the mundane lives of mankind,"" is style. Style is a tool to support the kinds of quality writing you wish to create.

, It's hard for some readers to invest in characters that haven't got a single ounce of feeling. Balancing reason and emotion is a way to create narrative tension and develop character. It's that tension that will draw readers toward your story and make them want to know what happens next.

, Revising is one of the most important steps in creating good quality writing. A first draft provides you with a framework to work with as well as a chance to put your ideas down. Good quality writing is often created in the revision process. Make sure to set aside enough time to properly edit and revise your writing to ensure you end up with the highest quality final product you can. This may require making significant changes to your work, so keep your writing goals in mind.

, Re-read your draft and make sure the organization works and that all of your points support your main thesis. You may need to reorganize the piece, add or remove content, or revise your thesis to match your supporting information.Don't be afraid to scrap sections of your writing that don't work with the overall tone of the piece. If you have written enough material, you may not need to add to your work, but don't hesitate to do so if it strengthens the piece.

, Once your content is organized and strong, read it again while you pay close attention to your word choices and sentence structure to make sure your writing flows and follows all of the appropriate grammatical rules. Take a little time away from your work and then return to proof read it again to make sure you can approach it with fresh eyes to catch small errors.

, Reading your word choices aloud can help to catch clunky sentences or places where you may have used a word too many times in close succession. Reading out loud will also give you an understanding of how naturally your thoughts flow from one to the next.Awkward wording is easiest to catch when read aloud; if you stumble to get the words out, they may require revision.

, The best way to get better is with frequent practice. Mistakes are bound to happen as you go, so learn from each issue that comes to your attention and focus on not making the same errors in the future.Don't get discouraged if a piece doesn't come out as good as you'd hoped. Try to identify the weak points in your writing and strive to improve upon them. Every piece you write is an opportunity to strengthen your weaknesses and identify areas that could use improvement.
Welcome constructive criticism as an opportunity to get better. If you focus on improving where you've gone wrong before, you will become a better writer with each piece you complete.
Remember that no one has ever succeeded without first failing. It's a natural part of the process and may happen far more often than your successes. Each failure is a step toward becoming the strong writer you were meant to be.

Remember that writing is meant to be shared.,
Don't defend or explain your work.,
Never blame someone who ""doesn't get it,"" for being too dumb to understand.,
Recognize that people naturally focus on the negatives, and that's a good thing.,
Realize that none of this is personal.,
Remember that, in the end, your opinion is the one that matters the most.",How to Take Writing Criticism Gracefully1," Writing is a form of communication, and all communication is between more than one person. Aside from a journal or diary, writing is meant to be shared with other people, and, most importantly, the reader's response to your writing matters. This is why criticism is so important-- you get to see exactly how your work affects an audience, which will help you hone it into the best work it can be.


Your professors, workshop, friends, and bosses are only trying to make you a better writer, not belittle you. Taking their criticism gracefully is about remembering this end goal.;
, You will not be in the room with a publisher, investor, professor, or reader to preface sections or provide explanations. What you write is what they get, and you should treat your critique the same way. Imagine that you are just a fly on the wall during a book-club meeting over your writing. Do they react well to chapters you like? Where do they get hung up or confused? Is all the information needed to understand the writing in the writing, or do you have to explain it yourself?


Ask questions about criticisms you don't understand -- ""can you elaborate on why the thesis wasn't clear?"" ""where did the plot get confusing?"" -- instead of trying to fight the criticism.When asked a direct question you should politely answer, but be brief.

, It bears repeating, but writing is communication. If multiple people ""don't get it,"" the fault lies in how you wrote it, not how they read it. It is easy for something to seem clear to you, it's your idea, after all, but that doesn't mean people encountering your idea for the first time will pick it up instantly. Your job as a writer is to make the idea as clear on the page as it is in your head, without explaining., It may seem like people briefly mention the parts they love and then move on to 30 minutes of hate, but that makes a lot of sense when you think about it. You need to work on the parts that aren't good, not the ones you've already got down. A critique isn't useful if people simply go on and on about stuff you've already done well-- you need to learn how to fix the things that need work.


That said, good critiques will always find a way to mention the positives, at least briefly.

, At the end of the day, you asked this person (by handing them the work or signing up for the class) to give a critique on your writing. They are not out to destroy you, hurt your feelings, or break your will to write, even if they feel harsh at the time. They are doing their best to make your work better. At the end of the day, their opinion is just that: an opinion. You may agree or disagree, but it is not a personal attack. It is just a critique of your writing., You have to stay true to your own vision, even as you find ways to share your vision with others. Do not let a negative critique force you to abandon your own style and ideas. People will naturally give suggestions that fit their own personal style, but that doesn't mean you should adopt their style in return."
"
Think about what you want out of criticism.,
Consider who you ask to give a critique.,
Communicate your goals to the person or group in advance.,
Give good, thoughtful criticism to get good, thoughtful criticism.,
Make sure your work is ready to be critiqued.",How to Take Writing Criticism Gracefully2," Why are you sharing this work and opening it up to a discussion? There are many potential reasons to accept criticism on your writing, but knowing them ahead of time is essential to get the most out of your work.


Do you need an outside perspective to solve a problem or fix a chapter? If so, then you should be able to keep an open mind and accept criticism as the help that it is.
Do you need to be criticized for class or your job? If so, remember that you are here to learn and that the best way to learn is from your own mistakes.
Do you want to be criticized to hear your work praised? If so, you're not really looking for criticism -- you're looking for validation. Remember, however, that you will not become a better writer until you face your weakness as and find ways to fix them., There are some people who, no matter how you ask, will not give you any negative feedback or risk hurting your feelings. There are other people who will hate everything you put in front of them, nitpicking each sentence. But the majority of people will fall somewhere in the middle, giving your some problems they had as well as parts they enjoy. Generally, good critiquing partners are:Honest -- you know they will not sugarcoat the problems or lie about the parts they like.
Thoughtful -- a good critique doesn't just talk about issues, it suggests solutions.
Knowledgeable -- this doesn't mean they are an expert of literature, but they should have a basic knowledge of the work and its background. While it is helpful to ask someone if they liked your poems, you will not get a lot of usable feedback if they rarely read verse., It's difficult to listen to 30 minutes of critiques on grammar and spelling when you really need character development work. Keep your preface brief, but state your hopes for the critique so that the group/person knows how best to help you.


Consider giving these goals in advance, saying ""I'm having trouble with the rhyme in these poems, would you mind giving me some feedback."" This allows people to approach your work with a specific eye towards what you want criticism on.

, You cannot sit silently while the group is workshopped and expect people to leap out of their seats to critique you on your turn. Showing your engagement, taking your time to note something you like as well as the things you don't, and giving good notes will ensure that most people do the same to you.Attempt to make at least 3 points with each piece of writing at a minimum: one thing you like, and two suggested places for improvement.

, Why should someone spend an hour of their time giving you nice notes and critiques when you haven't even taken the time to run spell-check? Dismissing a problem someone raises because ""you already know it's a problem"" but haven't fixed it tells them that you aren't there for a serious critique. Putting out the best work you can ensures that you are given the best critique you can get.


Never turn in work, especially to an employer or professor, until you're sure it is the best you can possibly make it.

"
"
Take notes.,
Look for patterns in your critique.,
Ask questions about possible solutions.,
Take some time away from the work before returning.,
Make your revisions, and don't give up on the writing.,
Move on to new projects if the writing is finished.",How to Take Writing Criticism Gracefully3," Print out your own copy of the writing and make notes in the margins about problems, possible solutions, and even parts people like. This will help tremendously when you sit down for revisions. It also shows other people that you are listening and taking their critiques sincerely and graciously.

, Are there certain comments that most people are making or agreeing on? Is there one spot where almost everyone gets confused or caught up? Chances are good that you are not some solitary genius who understands what no one else does, you simply have a spot that needs improvement.

, Once you feel confident that something needs fixing, you may consider opening the floor to suggestions. A good way to do this is to make your own suggestions and ask what people think -- ""would this paper benefit from more historical research?"" or ""would the story work better in the 3rd person instead of the 1st?"" This can help you find a direction for revisions. Even if you don't go with any ideas, this gets the ball rolling and helps you start thinking about criticism in a productive manner., Let any negative feelings of anger or worry dissipate for a few days while you mull over your criticism. You'll be surprised what things you eventually agree with, or what criticisms you think are ill-founded. When you return to the work, it will be with a fresh set of critical eyes, and you can try and tackle the problems you've deemed need work., Criticism means nothing if you don't do anything with it. After a little time to clear your head, highlight the sections that need work and tackle them head on. You may realize that the criticism is spot on, and you need to overhaul the writing. You may also realize that it is better than you thought, or that one quick sentence or clarification is all you needed. But you will never realize these things unless you take the time to rewrite.


All writers rewrite. Even Ernest Hemingway is noted for saying that ""The first draft of anything is s--t!"", Reading a review/comment of an essay, story, or poem you've already published will do you little good. While you may get some tips for future projects, ultimately you can't do anything to correct the ""mistakes"" of an already published work. Even if you aren't published, sometimes the best thing to do with a piece of work is to leave it alone and write something new. If you feel attached to the current version and rewrites feel unbearable, then let it be. Ultimately, the most gracious way to take criticism is to just keep writing."

It could be a new narrative mode, a new style you want to try out, or even a new character. Read a lot of writing in the genre you like to write in, but also think about expanding into other genres as well. You can borrow ideas from any style of writing.;
, Use small writing prompts to kickstart your creative juices and keep them flowing. You won’t sit down and write a novel the first time you try, and you may not even crank out a short story on the first attempt. Start with one page observations, journal entries, poems, or essays, and slowly build up. Here are a few ideas to get you started:You’ve been chosen to compete in the Olympics.
You are the “alligator whisperer,” the only person on earth who can talk to alligators.
A mysterious package arrives on your doorstep and leads to unparalleled adventure.
You get hit in the head and begin hallucinating.
You are an explorer who (unbeknownst to the rest of the world) arrived in the Americas in 1491, just before Columbus’ famous voyage.
You and your friends have been abandoned in a haunted amusement park.

, At some point, every writer has sat staring at a blank page trying to figure out the perfect phrasing. Instead of wasting your time, get your thought down on paper and come back to it later. , If you have been struggling to perfect a passage or even a sentence, leave it alone for the day. Come back to it tomorrow. You might be surprised at how easily the words flow after your thoughts have had some time to gel in your brain. , Even a piece of terrible writing could have a brilliant line or two hidden somewhere in it. Develop a routine of saving each of your drafts, just in case you need to go back and borrow from an earlier draft.


You might also find that something you wrote on one topic could be helpful to you as you write about another topic. For example, maybe you wrote an essay about your memories of your first birthday party. Later, maybe you discover that this scene would work perfect in a short story.

, One of two things will happen. Either you will be impressed by how good what you wrote six months ago was, or you will wonder what on earth you were thinking to have written something so dreadful. Even if it’s the latter, you will still learn from your mistakes or take inspiration from a few lines.

, Experts recommend setting aside no less than one hour per day to write. It would be very easy to let this slide as “more important” issues come up, but try hard not to let that happen. When you get out of the habit of writing, it’s hard to get back into it. .


Try to block out a period of time every day that works well for you. If you write best in the morning, get up a little earlier than your roommates, kids, parents, or partner, and spend the first hour of your day writing. You’ll be surprised at how much you can write in a short amount of time this way.
Defend this writing time! Don’t let yourself make excuses not to write during this time.

, Keep track of your goals and whether or not you achieved them in a log. Sometimes it’s hard to look back and see your progress. Chances are, you have absolutely no idea how much you’ve written. Keeping a log can help you feel proud of your accomplishments. Some people find that a word or page count (easily tracked in Microsoft Word or Google Docs) works very well for this purpose. Keeping a log alongside other writer friends works well. Google Spreadsheets is great for this purpose. Record your own progress and see how much progress your colleagues make!
If this seems overwhelming at first, make your daily goal very small. 1 page is plenty at first. As you build up your endurance, you will be able write much more every day.

, Sometimes a burst of inspiration will occur then as you go along with your day and go home that inspiration may have escaped you. Avoid this by taking a notebook or journal around with you wherever you go.


However, don’t fall into the trap of only writing when you feel “inspired.” It’s important to write even when you’re not excited about it, in order to keep yourself in the habit.

, Just as with any other skill that you want to perfect and feel good about, you have to build up your endurance as a writer. , If you think of yourself as a fiction writer, take a step outside of your comfort zone occasionally, and write an op-ed or a nonfiction essay. You may learn new techniques by trying a new new style, or you may find a new way of writing that you prefer. , Writing is both art and science. There is plenty of room to be creative, but there are loose rules for how to structure some types of writing. If you’re stuck or feeling unsure, try looking at a formula. For example, a 5-paragraph essay formula often looks something like this, and you can expand it to apply to other types of nonfiction essays:

Intro with hook and thesis that gives a “road map” of the paper
Body paragraph 1 with topic sentence and 3-4 pieces of evidence
Body paragraph 2 with topic sentence and 3-4 pieces of evidence
Body paragraph 3 with topic sentence and 3-4 pieces of evidence
Concluding paragraph summing up body paragraphs and restating thesis


Don’t try to follow a formula every time you write. You will likely get stuck trying to make your story or essay fit instead of letting it flow naturally. Try this technique when others aren’t working.

, Sometimes your thoughts get in the way of writing what you really want to say. You second guess yourself before you get the words on paper. Speed writing can help you avoid this problem.


Spend about 5 minutes pre-writing. Brainstorm if you want. Create an outline if that helps you. Or just sit there and think.
Set a 15 minute timer.
Write without stopping for the entire 15 minutes. You can use a laptop or a piece of paper. If you get stuck, write down absolutely anything, including, for example, “I’m stuck. I’m stuck. I’m stuck.” You won’t be stuck for long!
It’s okay to use abbreviations and incomplete sentences when you try exercises like this one. , If you find that your thoughts are coming faster than you can type, try recording them and transcribing them later. Most smartphones have dictation capabilities, as do microphone-enabled computers.


Apps such as Dragon Dictation and Olympus Dictation work well if you aren’t happy with your built-in smartphone dictation.
Some websites, such as VoiceBase, offer free transcription.

, Even if your goal is to write fiction, start by writing observations of the real world. This will not only give you practice with creative phrasing, it will also build your confidence. Try writing about the memory of your favorite birthday to start.
Or write the story of the best (or worst) day you’ve spent in the last month.

, Part of growing your confidence as a writer is about getting compliments. Don’t let publishers and reviewers be the only people who see your writing. It’s their job to critique it. Instead, seek out people who want to pay you compliments on your writing.


Show it to your dad, your grandma, your husband, your cousin - anyone who will tell you how proud they are of you.
Participate in coffee shop readings and open mics - anywhere the audience will give you applause or snaps.

, School newspapers and online blogs, which usually don’t have a rigorous screening process, are a great way to gain confidence publishing your writing without the fear of rejection.


Be careful about which online venues you choose. Some have a culture of caring, careful critique and praise, while others can be a venue for vitriol and trolling. Take time to read through the comments on other people’s blog posts, and consider only publishing for a closed group. .
Choose wisely when you publish your best material. If you are considering having a story or essay published in a professional publication, that publication may not be willing to print a piece that has appeared elsewhere.

, Start small, with local or obscure competitions. Winning will give your confidence a boost, and you might be inspired to enter more serious competitions. , You will definitely get some rejection letters, which could be detrimental to your confidence. On the other hand, especially if you try to publish in peer-reviewed publications, you will also get valuable feedback, advice, and even compliments about what you’ve done well.


If you have a full-length piece (like a novel manuscript), submit to both print and digital publishers. You may have better luck with ebooks, because the screening process sometimes isn’t as rigorous (depending on the publisher). "

Remember a few spelling rules.,

Look at the list of commonly misspelled words below.",How to Spell Commonly Misspelled Words," Though English isn’t known for its consistency, learning a few spelling rules can go a long way. For example:


“I” before “e” except after “c” or when sounded like “a” as in “neighbor” and “weigh.”

Some exceptions to this rule are “weird” (which is kind of weird, right?), “their,” and “protein.”
Words containing “cien,” like “ancient” and “science,” don’t follow the “except after ‘c’ ” part of the rule.
There are also a bunch of “eigh” words that don’t follow this rule like “eighty,” “height,” and “foreign.”



They’re with their things over there. To understand the differences, remember that:


They’re = they + are; the apostrophe marks where the “a” and the space used to be.

Their is possessive; after all, you can’t write it “their” without “heir.”

There denotes a location; you can’t write “there” without writing “here” any more than you can with the word “where!”



When two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking. In words like “foe,” “toast,” “scream,” and “bait,” the vowel sound is determined by the first vowel, not the second. This is quite often the case, though many “ie” words (“chief,” “grief”) don’t follow this rule (not to mention the word “you”).

, Note the bolded differences between them; many of these should look familiar to you now that you have learned the rules above."

Get organised by making a revision table that makes space for fun breaks.,
Stick to one revision timetable throughout your whole revision schedule.,
Colour code your timetable.,
Schedule time for fun into that revision timetable.",How to Make Revising Fun1," It is always important to make a revision timetable so you are organised. Get information from your school teacher on the subject exams that you will be taking. Aim to begin revising well ahead of the actual exam dates; that way you will have less stress about the whole thing and can afford to let yourself take a more graceful pace to your revising.;
, This reduces the decision-making involved and creates comfortable routine for you, saving that extra decision-making space for learning and relaxing later.

, Choose software that allows you to colour code your timetable. This is a whole lot more fun than dull black and white with the occasional greys. For example, Microsoft Excel will let you color code the revision timetable in a digital format.


If you're not using a digital timetable, use highlights and stickers on your paper timetable.

, It is important to include relaxing time as well as revision time. The relaxing times matter; they give you distance from what you're learning, allowing your brain to process everything properly, at a gentler pace. This helps your short term memory layer down into long-term memory and is a whole lot more useful and kinder to your future self. Moreover, having relaxing breaks and fun time will help to keep your brain calm and peaceful. Most importantly, schedule in adequate sleep, for it is during sleep that you process all that you're taking in, allowing your brain to properly comprehend it and retrieve it for you mid-exam. to give yourself enough sleep! Here is one suggested timetable list of things to give yourself:


regular breaks, every half hour to an hour
eating time
hobby time
school time
3-6 hours of revision is recommended for each day.

"
"
Allow yourself to be creative in the approaches you take to learning.,
Make revision posters.,
Use A4/printing paper to make a small poster, larger thin cardboard for bigger posters.,
Refer to revision guides or websites related to your subject.,
Use digital tools to help you revise.,
Use MOOCs to help you.",How to Make Revising Fun2," This creativity will help embed your understanding much better than rote reading or writing; using artistic and interesting revision tools will allow your mind explode with different revision ideas and the information will stay foremost in your memory.

, Posters are the perfect thing to use for revision. They can be as bright and colorful as you like, they can allow you to use lists, circles, mind maps, arrows, pictures, decoupage, etc. Since they're a work of art and interesting, they almost persuade you to revise from them!

, Some subjects may be more suitable to making posters for than others. Here's a list of suggested additions to help:


Science (explaining processes, making diagrams)
Art (explaining artists)
History (bubbles to explain different people in the time period)
French (translation bubbles)
English (novels with plots and imagery)


And any other subject you can think of. The process of deciding what to turn into a poster is a learning exercise in its own right.

, Make your poster bright and colourful with felt-tips so you will be tempted to revise from it later. Try to colour code it with colours associated with your subject. Make any writing big and bold, enough to see from a long distance. Hang up your revision posters in your bedroom, around the house... Anywhere you go to often so you can see your revision posters when performing everyday tasks.

, Use mind mapping software, note-taking apps, quiz apps, online educational games, Wordless, lists, Pinterest, etc. to keep your revisions ideas, information and notes in. Wherever you go, you can access these digital notes from your smartphone, tablet or other digital device, making it easy to revise when traveling, at a sports game, waiting for a friend, in the park, or wherever else you'd rather be. Going outside or going somewhere different can help your brain absorb new concepts and information, or can help rev up a tired brain sick of being stuck in the one place for ages. Make use of the digital tools to give you this freedom.

, Find a MOOC that is right on topic and check out what it's offering. Use the tools they offer, including their videos, forums and reading material, to give you new angles and interest on the topics you're revising.

Get a revision helper.,
Test your knowledge.,
Encourage each other.,
Do active revision with your friends.",How to Make Revising Fun3," Having a live person take time to help you revise can add a lot more pep to your learning. This person can be your sister, brother, a friend, a parent or someone else you know loves to help you.


You might find you feel better off with someone who is about the same level as you, or is taking the same exam, so you can revise together. However, even having someone go through quiz-style on information they know little about can help you and can even inspire you to ""teach"" them (and in teaching, you learn).

, Assign projects to your learning buddies every week, and expect them to do the same for you in turn.


For example, you could tell your revision helper to make a PowerPoint with a model to explain their topic and at the end of the week, they can present their work. You can give them a WWW (what went well) mark and an EBI (even better if) mark. Next time they will know how to improve.

, Try to cheer each other on to complete revision and correct each other. Two people working together means double the knowledge and twice the entertainment. Bind together your knowledge to create a ""What we know"" sheet explaining your topic.

, Active revision gets you moving, enjoying and remembering. Here are some ideas:


Get your friend to be a teacher and let them teach you what they know about a topic. Challenge them. Swap afterwards.
Explore different places to do revision. For example, geography is the perfect subject for this idea.
Do experiments (specifically aimed at science) e.g. paper aeroplanes, diffusion, friction etc.

"
Familiarize yourself with the term ""cognitive blindness."",
After you've proofread your work yourself, if you have any doubts as to if something is a mistake or not, ask your teacher, a colleague or another trusted person.,
Read your work through several times.,
Make use of delay between the time of writing and the time of editing.,
If possible, try using a program that will identify grammar and spelling errors, such as Microsoft Word.,
If you're still unsure if your work is adequate, there are some online programs that will proofread your work as well.",How to Proofread Your Own Work1," It means that your mind will see things the way it thinks it should be seen, rather than how it really is. So, if you're reading your own work, your mind will read it the way it should have been written. This means that if you have a double-word, a poorly worded sentence, and so forth, you may not catch it because your mind will read it the way it should have been written. Here are some ways you can beat this cognitive blindness:


Read your work out loud. Doing this will increase your chances of catching a mistake. Do not read too quickly or too slowly, though; aim for a medium pace.
If you have WiFi, try copying your work into an online voice modulator. Hit play and listen to your work while you're reading it in your mind. This will also increase your chances of catching a mistake.
Read your work slowly. If you rush through it, you'll likely miss mistakes. Try to read it as you imagine an editor would read it.;
, Alternatively, look it up online if you have access to the Internet. If for some reason you can't do either, try referring to similar works (if you're proofreading an essay, read someone else's essay; if you're proofreading a short story, read someone else's short story) and pay attention to how they word their sentences.


It will make reading other works more tolerable if you choose those which have a topic that interests you.

, This can be a pain sometimes, especially if you want to hurry up and share it. However, if you read it more than once, twice, even a few times, it will really solidify your confidence that your work is exactly the way you want it.

, It helps if you try to do something in between each time you edit your work so that it's easier to distance yourself and spot the errors more objectively; it will also make it a little more tolerable to read it once more. Try watching a television program, having a meal or snack, just something you enjoy doing before having to read your work again. If your work is long, as in a novel, for example, you should probably stretch your proofreading out over a matter of days or even weeks. Read a couple of chapters one day, then another couple the next, and so on; then repeat.

, If the program wants to correct something and you don't understand why it needs correcting, try seeing if the program offers some kind of explanation (which is why Microsoft Word is recommended, as it will explain any grammatical errors).

, Or, of course, you can still ask your English teacher/professor or fellow writer to proofread your work, if you're comfortable with that.

Replace all redacted text with .,
Copy and paste the text into Windows Notepad.,
Reformat the document.,
Save the formatted document as a PDF.",How to Redact a Document1," Start by replacing all the text you want redacted with the word . You can do a find and replace search to find all the text that needs to be redacted. This will ensure you redact all the necessary text in the document so it is hidden.For example, instead of noting the personal information of a customer: “Amy Hempel, 1031 SW Park Ave”, you may replace it with “” or simply “”.
You can also place black squares or rectangles over information you want to redact. The black squares can be created by drawing long squares over the removed text areas and coloring them solid black. Make sure you delete the text underneath the black squares to ensure the black squares cannot be removed somehow to reveal the information.
Make sure you do this for all instances and all variations of the information. You may need to do this manually if you use someone’s name in different ways throughout the document. For example, you may list “Amy Hempel” as “A. Hempel”, “Amy Hempel”, and “Ms. Hempel”. You will need to redact all instances of her name. You can do a find and replace search for every variation of her name or go through the document manually and replace them all with .
Save this version of the document as the “Temp-redacted” version. This will ensure you have two copies of the document, one with the original information and one with the information redacted.;
, Windows Notepad is a simple-text editor that does not save any of the hidden code found in a text file. This format only saves basic text information so no other text that can be uncovered in the document. This is essential, as you do not want someone to be able to trace back to the original code of the text file, thereby exposing the redacted information.Select all the text in the text file. (CTRL-A or Edit > Select All)
Copy the text in text file. (CTRL-C or Edit > Copy)
Paste the text into Notepad. (CTRL-V or Edit > Paste)
Save the file in Notepad as the “Text-redacted” version. It will be saved as a text (.txt) file.
If you do not have Windows Notepad, you can use WordPerfect, WordStar, and Text Editor.

, Once you paste the information from the text file into Notepad, most of the formatting in the document will be removed. The document will have no page numbers, tabs, justifications, paragraph numbering, or any bolding, italics, and underlining. You can reformat it before you save it as a redacted file.To reformat the document, you must close the Notepad file and open the “Text-redacted” text document in your word processing program. Reformat the text in the word processing program but do not change any of the text.

, To create the final version of the redacted document, save the formatted document as the “Final-Redacted” version. This will ensure you have a redacted document that does not contain any sensitive information and/or any information that can be uncovered or shown.Convert the text file to a PDF by choosing the PDF format in the list of save file as options. Select PDF and save the file as the “Final-Redacted-PDF” version.
Delete the “Text-redacted” and “Temp-redacted” versions so there is no paper trail to the original redacted information. You can now use the “Final-Redacted-PDF” version as the redacted file.

Get some practice editing.,
Check the spelling.,
Perfect the grammar.",How to Proofread Your Own Work2," Make use of sites such as wikiHow, to improve your editing skills on other people's work. This can build up your understanding of the common errors writers make. By practicing editing regularly, your sight skills will be honed and ready to find any errors as you read through your work.

, If you're an inexperienced writer, or you're just unsure if your spelling is correct, try going to your local library to check out a dictionary, many people have dictionaries at home too. Check any word you are unsure of, and double-check any other word if you have any doubts that you spelled something incorrectly.

, Grammar can be the trickiest thing to proofread. This is a skill that really comes to the writer as he or she writes, something you pick up on with repeated practice, learning, reading and writing. Many people learn to use correct grammar in school. Think back to anything you were taught that might be useful. Some things are self-explanatory, such as punctuation, where to capitalize a word, or what makes a complete sentence. However, other grammatical finessing is a bit harder to grasp, such as the correct order of words, verb agreement, overuse of the passive voice, and prepositional phrases. Such things can be researched on the internet or in a library or asked to a more experienced writer.


Get hold of a good grammar book for writers. There are also good online sites and podcasts concerning grammar––choose the best way for you to absorb more grammar learning.

Understand how structure is formed and used in other people's works.,
Understand that part of structure is purpose.,
Check the tone of voice you write with.,
Stay on topic.,
Omit the unnecessary.",How to Proofread Your Own Work3," Structure is another skill that typically comes to the writer as he or she writes. If you intend to write for a living, whether professionally or just as a hobby, it is important to read as much as you write. Whether you are planning to write for a living or not, if you are planning on writing something, be sure to carefully read a long piece of professional work and pay close attention to how the author forms his or her sentences. Here are questions to ask yourself when reading a piece of work:


How does the author transition into the next paragraph?
When does the author use a section break and why?
How often does the author use certain words or phrases? If it's often, how does that contribute to the work?
What is the author's purpose in this particular piece of writing? What is he trying to say to the reader?
Does the author use references, metaphors, or other such comparisons? How does this contribute to the overall work?
(for fictional writing) How does each scene compare to the ones around it? How do they contrast?
(for fictional writing) How might the impact of the work change if it were written in someone else's point of view?
Can you talk to the author? If so, have a chat about why he or she has used particular techniques in the writing, and take notes. You can learn a lot from another writer's knowledge and experience imparted in this manner.

, Why are you writing? To persuade, inform, or entertain? Does this purpose stay adamant throughout your work? It's okay to do a combination, such as informing before persuading, or entertaining while persuading, and so on, but be sure that everything makes sense. If you're writing something for a teacher, professor, or publisher, be sure that your writing meets their requirements.

, Be careful that you haven't fallen for a cliched style of writing, such as using a marketing tone that causes your work to read like an infomercial. Given the pervasiveness of marketing, such writing is a common fallback for many writers and comes across in such things as:


Making assumptions about things the reader lacks (for example, ""so, you're trying to be the smartest ever, but you have failed so far"")––the author can never presume why a reader is reading his or her work or anything about the reader's life;
Trying to perfect or arrange the reader's life with simplistic or opinionated solutions (for example, ""if your self-esteem if better, so too your life will be!""). Providing shallow solutions, offering platitudes or pushing your own agenda down the reader's throat will cause the reader to feel cheated, questioned or uncertain, none of which is ideal if you want to keep your reader enthralled by your writing; or
Making almost every sentence appear as a climactic moment, as if the excitement is barely containable (including overuse of exclamation marks). For example: ""Get a boat! Be free in your boat! Sailing home is the best way ever!"".


Remember that not all of life is about transformational potential summed up in a simple platitude, so take care to curb your enthusiasm. Too much of this bubbly or bossy style of writing can alienate a reader.

, This may become difficult, depending on what your purpose is. When checking your writing, be sure that it includes relevant information. However, even if something is related to your topic, it doesn't necessarily mean it's relevant, as the following examples make clear:


For example, if you're writing to inform the public about global warming, don't include how you felt when you saw your neighbor throw an aluminum can on the ground. If you're writing to inform the public about the effects of bullying, don't say things like: ""How would you feel if you were bullied?"" or ""You wouldn't want someone to do these things to you."" Such moral judgments narrow your audience and alienate those who feel you've just judged them harshly without reason, which you don't want.


Even if it may seem relevant, be sure it's really something that must be included in your work. If it adds no real meaning to your work, you should probably consider omitting it.

, Picking up from the last point, this is one of the key things a writer must learn and embrace. Yes, you have spent hours crafting the perfect paragraph, laced with deep meaning and pretty word associations. Yet, if it holds up the story or points being made, if it adds nothing vital and useful, or if it is clearly a saunter off into the craft of writing without relevance to the story or central point, then it's fluff and it needs to go. You will get better at spotting this the more you practice editing. Hence, this is why it is really useful to edit other people's work, to help you recognize when you fall into the same traps. Every writer overwrites; the good writers either know how to chop well or trust their editors to do it for them.

Use Adobe Acrobat Version 8.0 or higher.,
Open the Redaction toolbar.,
Remove any hidden text.,
Rename the document and save it.",How to Redact a Document2," Only version 8.0 and higher of Acrobat can reliably redact information in a PDF document. Though you can try using other programs to remove information from a PDF document, they will not be able to remove the hidden information in the document effectively and are not recommended.The redaction tool option is only available for Adobe Acrobat Pro. It is not available for Adobe Acrobat Reader.You can try a plug-in made for other versions of Adobe Acrobat, such as Redux. These plug-ins or add-on software can be used to redact information in a PDF file using other versions of Adobe Acrobat.If you have access to the document as a text file, you can go through the redaction process for a text file and then use the final redacted PDF. However, if you only have access to the PDF file and need to redact the PDF file, you will need to try this method.

, To do this, go to View > Toolbars > Redaction. You can then choose the “Mark for Redaction” tool from the toolbar. Use the tool to mark all the items you would like to redact.To redact a line or item in the document, double-click on a word or image. Press CTRL as you drag to select a line, a block of text, an image, or an area of the document.
Click OK to remove the selected items. Keep in mind the items are not permanently removed from the document until you save the document.

, Once you apply the redactions, the “Examine Document” function will pop up. You can use this function to search for any hidden text or metadata and remove it.Hidden text can appear as the original text or a version of the original text. Metadata may look like coded text, where there are numbers or symbols within the original text.
Repeat this process until you have removed all the necessary content from the PDF document. Make sure you remove any hidden text or metadata as well.

, Once you have removed all sensitive information, as well as any hidden text, you should rename the document “Final-redacted” and save it. You should now have a redacted version of the PDF and an unredacted version.Once you save the redacted document, you should delete the unredacted document. You should now have a redacted PDF version of the document that has no hidden text or metadata. This will ensure that no one can access the original, unredacted document.

Scan the document and save it as a PDF.",How to Redact a Document3," It is difficult to use software to redact a scanned file, such as a tiff, jpeg, or gif. There is a risk of the hidden text or metadata remaining in the scanned document. You may want to try to paper document method for scanned documents, where you print out the document and redact the information by hand., Start by printing out the paper document using the one sided print option. This will ensure you have text on one side of the paper and a blank page on the other side. You will not be at risk of cutting out important information on one side or neglecting to remove sensitive information on one side.Keep in mind this method may be time consuming if you have many pages of a paper document that you need to redact. However, this is considered the most effective way of redacting information from a document, whether it is a text file, a PDF, or a scanned document.

, Use scissors to cut out all text that you need to redact. Make sure you find every mention of the sensitive information in the paper document and cut it out.You should then shred the paper clippings to ensure the cut out information cannot be traced or found.

, Opaque tape is 100% impenetrable by light and is not transparent or translucent. This is the best option for filling in the redacted sections so they cannot be traced or uncovered.You can also use opaque paper that does not allow any light reflection, not plain-paper as a scanner can pick up images through the paper. Use tape or glue to attach the paper over the redacted sections.

, To create a polished version of the paper document, you can scan the document and save it as the “Final-redacted” PDF of the document. You will now have a fully redacted version of the paper document."

Ensure all sensitive information in the document has been removed.,
Have someone verify the redactions before finalizing the redacted document.,
Test the redacted document to ensure it cannot be uncovered.",How to Redact a Document4," You should read over the redacted document to ensure there is no sensitive information in the document. Sensitive information could include:Social Security numbers. If you must include someone’s Social Security number, only use the last four digits.
Any financial account numbers. If you must include financial account numbers, use only the last four digits.
The names of minors. If you must note the minor involved, use the minor’s initials only.
Dates of birth. If the individual’s date of birth must be included, only include the year.
Home addresses. If the individual’s address must be noted, such as in a criminal case, use the city and state only.

, To make sure you caught all the information that needs to be redacted, you may want to ask a trusted individual to verify that you did not miss any information. Sometimes, having another set of eyes on the document can also help to catch any information that you may have missed. Let the reviewer know what method you used to redact the information so they can test it properly.If you are dealing with very sensitive information that could have legal implications, you may want to consider using a redaction expert. These individuals are trained to do redactions and can verify the document for you to ensure it contains no errors or mistakes.

, To confirm the redaction was done properly, you can do a simple test on the final, redacted PDF.Select text several lines above your redacted area and ending one to two lines below it.
Paste the content into a word processing document or in Notepad. Check to see if the redacted text is not present in the content. If it is not present, the redaction has been a success.

Take your audience into account.,
Explain unfamiliar concepts, terms, and data when necessary.,
Know the definition of the word you are using.,
Beware of undesirable connotations.,
Avoid jargon.,
Stay away from clichés.,
Choose the right words and structures for each specific form of writing.",How to Improve Written Communication1," It’s important to choose the right words depending on your audience. For example, you should use formal language when sending an email to your boss or drafting a cover letter for a job application. Save your informal language, such as beginning an email with “Hey,” for close friends and family.;
, Choosing the right words also means explaining them to audiences who may be unfamiliar with particular words or phrases. For example, if you are writing about a new technology, you may need to explain the technical terms that appear in your paper or email as your audience may not have encountered them in the past.

, One of the most common mistakes in written communication is misusing a particular word. Oftentimes you may think a word means one thing, but it in fact means something entirely different. For example, you might write that Native Americans are not a monotonous culture, when in fact you mean that Native Americans are not a homogenous culture.Ask yourself, “Am I sure I know the definition of this word?”
Use a dictionary to look up the definitions are words whose meaning you are not quite sure about.

, Sometimes you will write a sentence without realizing that your choice of words is delivering an unwanted meaning. For example, you might write, “I looked inside the boy’s private place,” when in fact you meant, “I looked around the boy’s hiding place.”, It’s easy to fall into the trap of using jargon or technical terms when it’s not necessary to do so. While it’s sometimes necessary to use technical terms, make sure you don’t overload your writing with unnecessary jargon. For example, don’t write, “The dialectical interface between the Republicans and Democrats offers an algorithm for neoliberal thought.” Instead, try writing, “The dialogue between Republicans and Democrats offers a model for neoliberal thought.”, A cliché is a phrase that has been overused to the extent that it has lost its original effect or meaning. These trite and often stereotypes expressions should be avoided if you’re aiming to improve your written communication skills. Instead of writing, “in this day and age,” try writing, “today” or “presently.” Instead of writing, “dead as a door nail,” just write, “dead.”, It’s important to understand that different types of written communication have different requirements. An email, for example, has different requirements than a corporate report. A letter to an insurance company, similarly, will be written differently than a set of guidelines for employees.

Buy yourself a word search magazine, do a search to find puzzles on-line, or maybe, borrow some word searches from friends.,
Use the list that comes with each word search to know what words to look for.

,
Using the list is helpful, but once you have gained enough experience, you will find the list almost unnecessary.,
Look for words in the puzzles, and then start looking for words without using the list...perhaps pitting yourself against the puzzle by seeing if you can find all the words without the list.

Notice that you will start to recognize patterns, as well as, knowing what order the letters are likely to be in.

Read widely.,
Learn the rules.,
Choose words carefully.,
Be clear and concise.,
Listen to how people speak.,
Make your characters believable.,
Begin and end on a strong sentence if you are writing an essay.,
Practice.,
Edit exhaustively.",How to Improve Your Writing Style," If you are only exposed to your own writing, your 'writing world' will narrow considerably. There's no better tutor than a beloved book that inspires you to write. Explore new genres and authors as well, to expose yourself to new vocabulary and new styles of writing.


Try writing in the style of a certain author as an exercise. Mimicry can force you to flex new writing muscles, although you should use your own voice for serious writing projects.;
, Your writing will read more smoothly if you follow the rules of the English language. If you could improve in these areas, read our advice on grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

, Find descriptive words that communicate the exact feeling you're going for. If you don't like the sound of a word, or you aren't sure it's the right choice, think of synonyms or alternatives.


Try to avoid overused words, such as ""good"" and ""bad"" and ""ugly"" and ""said."" Instead, think about what you're trying to say. Does ""good"" mean charming, sunny, lucky, or something else?
If you have trouble writing vivid descriptions, try a ""comparagraph"" exercise. Write a paragraph comparing any two people, objects, or settings. Try comparing a sunset to jewelry, or a forest to a woman.

, Cut every unnecessary word from your writing. You may prefer lengthy descriptions or flowery language, but be strict at this stage. Most novice writers use many more words than necessary.

, To improve your dialogue, listen to how real people express themselves. How does someone's speech change when they're angry, sad, or in love? Learn how to reproduce real speech accurately in print if you ever want your dialogue to sound natural.

, If you're writing fiction, make your characters sound authentic. A doctor might sound educated and use obscure medical terms. The patient may just say he is feeling sick.


If you're having trouble making characters sound different, give one of them an accent. An accent is difficult to write convincingly, but it will make the character seem different.

, Spend extra time polishing the first and last sentences of each paragraph in an essay. Aim for a punchy sentence that grabs the reader's attention. This practice can help improve the first and last sentences of a short story or novel chapter as well, although you have more room for stylistic changes.

, You can read all you want about improving your writing, but if you don't actually put it into practice, you will not improve. Try to write every day, or as often as you can. If you keep putting it off, ask a friend to help keep you on task while she works on her own project in the same room.

, One famous piece of writers' advice: kill your darlings. Cut every passage that doesn't fit into the rest of the work, or that's too personal for other people to appreciate. Edit for clarity and style as well. Correct mistakes and try out alternatives until you're satisfied.


Never be afraid to trash something and start over. Authors have written and thrown away countless books, usually for good reason. If you don't feel good about what you wrote, scrap it and start over. The second (or fifth) version is often better, as you march in knowing the entire storyline.
Ask your friends to give feedback. Even people with no writing experience can identify awkward passages, although you may need to find the solution yourself.

"
"
Begin each paragraph with a topic sentence.,
Use body sentences to develop the topic of the paragraph.,
End with a concluding sentence.",How to Improve Written Communication2," A topic sentence states the paragraph’s main idea. It helps your reader recognize the topic of the paragraph and what they might expect to read in the paragraph. While advanced writers may not introduce the paragraph’s topic until the middle or end of the paragraph, it’s a good idea for those developing their writing skills to include a topic sentence at the paragraph’s beginning. If you are writing a paragraph on different breeds of dogs, you could begin with a topic sentence such as, “There are two hundred different breeds of dogs.”, Once you’ve introduced the content of a paragraph with a topic sentence, use the next two to three sentences to describe, analyze, and compare data, events, or quotations as they relate to the topic of your paragraph. Body sentences are where you will include and analyze any evidence you are presenting in your paragraph, or provide details about an event, person, or situation., After you’ve introduced the paragraph’s scope or argument in a topic sentence and analyzed or presented data and evidence in the body sentences, conclude with a concluding sentence. This is where you wrap up your ideas and major points before moving on to the next section of the email, paper, or letter you are composing."
"
Use an apostrophe to show possession.,
Follow capitalization rules.,
Watch out for sentence fragments.",How to Improve Written Communication3," One of the most common grammar mistakes is the improper use of an apostrophe. Remember that an apostrophe shows ownership or possession. For example, if you are talking about the television your husband owns, you should not write “my husbands television.” You should write “my husband’s television.”If a noun does not end in s, add ‘s to the end of the noun. For example, if you are talking about the paws of a dog, write, “the dog’s paws.”
If the noun is plural and already ends in s, just add an apostrophe. For example, if you are talking about the paws of two dogs, write, “the dogs’ paws.”

, Proper nouns and the words formed from them should always be capitalized. You should always capitalize names, countries, cities, states, nationalities, languages, educational institutions, educational degrees, government departments, political parties, and trade or brand names. You should also capitalize the first word of a sentence as well as the first word of a quote., A common grammar mistake is the use of incomplete sentences, also known as sentence fragments. Each sentence that is punctuated should be a complete thought and be able to stand on its own as a sentence."
"
Avoid wordiness.,
Don’t use redundant pairs of words.,
Eliminate meaningless words.,
Substitute a single word for a phrase.",How to Improve Written Communication4," Writing concisely means you must convey your message in as few words as necessary. Eliminate any extra or unnecessary words that convolute your message. For example, don’t write, “I am emailing concerning the matter of your last report.” Instead try writing, “I am emailing about your last report.” Try substituting “regardless of the fact that” with a simple “although.” If you feel the urge to write “due to the fact that,” try writing “because” instead., Combining pairs of words with similar meaning should be avoided. Doing so only clutters the sentence and does little to convey your message. Examples of redundant pairs include sudden crisis, each individual, future plans, and past history. Don’t write, “The true facts of the case are clear.” Instead try writing, “The facts of the case are clear.”, You should not use words that do not add meaning or have relevance to the sentence. Words like obviously, basically, very, really, and clearly should be eliminated from effective written communication. For example, you should not write, “Actually, Amanda kind of looked at the elephant when it was basically urinating.” Instead write, “Amanda looked at the elephant while it was urinating.”, Oftentimes you can eliminate an entire phrase by simply replacing it with a single word. For example, phrases like “in the event that” and “under circumstances in which” can be replaced with the word “if.”"

Look for opportunities to write.,
Build a portfolio.,
Consider an education.,
Gain experience in advertising and marketing.,
Read as much as you can.,
Start a blog.",How to Get Into Copywriting1," Experience writing for a specific audience is one of the most important skills a copywriter needs to develop. You may have to do work for free at first as a way to prove yourself. For example, if you're involved with a political organization you can volunteer to revamp their Facebook page. You could also write blog posts for a local charity or team up with a freelance graphic designer who needs some web copy written for an ad he's working on., Your portfolio is a collection of your published work you will give to prospective employers. When it comes to copywriting, a solid portfolio is as important as a resume. Start looking for opportunities to publish your work. This way, you'll have material from which you can build a solid portfolio.


Before you get your first job, your portfolio may be a little sparse. That's okay. If you have a strong voice and solid writing skills, you may still get a call back even if you lack experience. Cobble together anything you've written that's been published, no matter how small. You can include an opinion piece for your school's newspaper, for example, or something published on a small scale blog or online magazine. One caveat, however, is that you should strive for marketable content. A list of the best dive bars in your college neighborhood is a better choice for your portfolio than a heartfelt personal essay that was published on a site like The Rumpus.If you have nothing to show, make things up. Choose a product or service and start brainstorming (it’s called “concepting” in the ad business.) Choose something that’s not so easy. Everyone wants to do perfume, liquor, cars, condoms, and beer because everybody already wants them (well, not so much the condoms) and you can do basically anything you want as long as it’s arresting. Try toilet bowl cleaner or socks, shingles: there’s a challenge. Creative directors want to see you can find something fresh and interesting no matter what, because fresh and interesting is the whole game.
Develop an ad, a series of blog posts, some tweets, a TV script, whatever seems like it would get some consumer action. Make it really good. Try it on friends. If you can, get a designer friend to mock it up. But only put the mockup in your portfolio if it’s really good. Bad design kills a concept. Put the finished piece in your portfolio and do another. Three is a minimum. The more you have (up to a point), the more you look like you want it. Creative directors want to see that you want it.
Publishing work is increasingly easy in the digital age. There are a vast variety of websites, catered to many different interests, that take submissions for brief, shareable content. If you're reading a list on a website you enjoy, go over their submission guidelines and consider putting together a piece for them.Cater your portfolio to the job you want. If you want to work in nonprofit, for example, writing an article for your local humane society could be a great addition to your portfolio. If you want to work in the service industry, however, try to publish a piece for an online magazine on something like the best Mexican restaurants in your city.

, For copywriting, no specific degree is required. However, individual jobs may request candidates have a bachelor's degree. It's a good idea to get some kind of degree if you want to go into copywriting.


Courses in journalism, professional writing, and marketing may help with a copy writing degree. Consider a bachelor's degree or minor in one of those fields.If you already have an unrelated degree and want to get into copywriting, consider taking an online course in a relevant field. This may help prepare you for copywriting as a career and give your resume more legitimacy when sending it out to clients and agencies.
While a degree or related coursework can help, an aptitude for writing is the most important requirement for a copywriter. If you have a biology degree, for example, but keep up an active blog, you may just as easily land a copywriting position as a creative writing major. While education can help, keep in mind it's not the most important key to a career in copywriting., Perceptiveness is very important to copywriting as a career. Jobs that require you to work with people may help prep you for a copywriting career. Consider taking an internship or part time job at a marketing or advertising firm. This will allow you to gain insight into how company's attract clients.If you're still in college, a marketing internship can be a great way to kickstart a copywriting career. You could also consider taking a marketing or advertising class.
A retail job could also help bolster your resume, as this entails selling a product and working with people. You could try working a part time job at a popular clothing store at your local mall, for example.

, Copywriters need to understand how good writing looks and sounds. You'll be writing commercially, so your work is not expected to be literary in quality. However, reading works of quality fiction and nonfiction can help you gain better language skills. The works of Ernest Hemingway can be particularly helpful for copywriters. When writing copy, less is always ideal and Hemingway was known for his minimalistic writing style.You should also read actively when simply browsing online content in your free time. For example, when navigating a Facebook pause and consider the language, the length, and the audience the ad is targeting. Take every encounter with advertising, web copy, or other content as a learning experience.

, A blog is actually an incredibly valuable marketing tool when it comes to copywriting. Starting your own blog can showcase your voice and writing skills. If you want to get into copywriting, it's vital you start blogging. You can include a link when messaging potential employers so they can get a feel of your writing.


A blog can have any topic you choose. Some people find it easy to blog about a hobby. For example, if you love baking you can start a baking blog. If you're a knitter, blog about knitting. You can blog in a way that's marketable. You can make lists of products you enjoy using for your hobby, for example, which showcases you ability to advertise a product.Keep your blog creative but professional. Avoid cursing and other bad language. If you choose to post about your personal life, keep it work appropriate. Never complain about an employee, past or present, on your blog.
As you continue to establish yourself in the copywriting game, you can add links to your work and writing samples on your blog.

Look for early opportunities.,
Network and learn from people in the business.,
Build a resume.,
Practice good interview skills.,
Navigate a phone interview.,
Seek work from nonprofits.,
Try freelancing.",How to Get Into Copywriting2," When starting out, opportunities may be hard to come by. With limited experience, it can be difficult to land a job. You may have to start out doing part-time or unpaid work.


If you're still in school, look into an internship that involves writing or editing. An internship looks great on a resume and gives you invaluable professional experience.
You can also take small freelance gigs. You can apply to such jobs on places like Craigslist. Often, employees are looking for copywriters to do a single article or blog post for them. You may get a paid a very small fee, but it can help build your resume and gain contacts for the future.
As previously stated, volunteer copywriting is also a good idea for early experience. Writing for a local charity's newsletter or web page may not pay. However, you'll gain something to add to your resume., If you can, get coffee dates with creatives. Writers or designers, it doesn’t matter. Ask them to describe their days, what they love, and what they hate. Everyone loves to talk about themselves. Ask them how many hours a week they work.


Ask them to email you a creative brief. A brief is the bible. Among other things, it contains concise, exact descriptions of audience, strategy, and mandatories (stuff you have to shoehorn into the concept or at least into the copy). A kid coming in knowing what a brief is will impress a creative director.
If you talk to a copywriter, ask for a copy document. Format any copy in your portfolio like the agency document. This makes it look like you know something about the business.
One note: briefs and copy documents are internal documents. Ask politely and make clear it’s just for you to study.

, If you're ready to begin seeking full time copywriting work, you'll need a resume. A resume is an invaluable tool when it comes to marketing yourself to potential employees. There are some specific considerations to keep in mind when making a copywriting resume.


You should follow typical resume format when it comes to things like basic layout. Choose a professional, easily readable font. Any choices you make regarding things like spacing, bullet points, and use of bold and italics should be consistent. Always include contact information, like your name, e-mail, and phone number, near the top of your resume.
Emphasize your skill set first. Include a section in which you list your copywriting experience. This is where you would include things like past publications, your blog, and any areas of expertise you have. You can include technical skills, like experience with sites like WordPress. You should also include what kind of copywriting you typically do, like whether you've done brochures, online ads, social media copy, and so on.List only relevant jobs. Jobs in marketing, sales, advertising, or business are appealing on a copywriting resume. Jobs in creative writing and journalism may not look as great, however. While both career-paths include writing, copywriting is mostly focused on marketing and sales. An employer may be wary to take a chance on someone whose experience is mainly rooted in non-commercial writing.Keep your education towards the bottom. While many traditional resumes have the education section listed at the top, a specific education is not necessarily important for a copy writing job. Prioritize your skill set, publications, and experience over your education., In the event you're called in for an interview for a copywriting position, make sure you practice solid interview skills. A successful interview can help you land the right job.


Always research the business before going into an interview. You want to have some sense of a company's history, ethics, and atmosphere. Do some research on a company's website and browse their social media profiles.Dress up for an interview. While you're on the job hunt, have a few go-to interview outfits ready. For men, a button down shirt and tie with dress pants is always a good choice. For women, a nice skirt and blouse, a suit, or dress pants and a nice top can work. Make sure to wear dress shoes as well. You don't want to offset a professional outfit by wearing sneakers with it.Arrive a few minutes early and try to make a good impression on everyone. Be polite to the person who checks you in and offer a smile to anyone you see in the hallway. Use body language to convey confidence when first meeting the interviewer. Give a firm handshake, make eye contact, and smile and nod during the interview to show you are listening.Ask questions at the end of the interview. You should not merely ask questions of logistics, like, ""When can I expect to hear back?"" Ask open-ended questions that convey a genuine interest in the company. For example, ask something like, ""What's your company's culture like?"" or ""What do you like about working here?"", Many current copywriting positions entail remote work. Copywriters often do temporary or freelance work for a client and the hiring process may involve a brief phone conversation. Learn how to navigate a phone interview in addition to an in-person interview.


When you know the call is coming, make sure you're in the right place. Find a quiet place, free of distractions. If possible, you want to be at your own home or apartment as it's easier to minimize outside noise.If you need any documentation, have it ready to go. Keep your resume close by during the reference, as well as any other information the interviewer asked for. For example, if the interviewer wanted to know your hours of availability, have your schedule in front of you during the interview.Smile while on the phone. Even if it feels silly, smiling can actually subtly change your tone of voice. You may sound perkier or more interested if you smile during a phone interview.Follow up in writing. When the phone interview is complete, send an e-mail the following day. Thank the interviewer for taking the time to talk to you and express your continued interest in the position., Nonprofits are often a great route for copywriters just starting out. They're always on the lookout for quality writers to write brochures, press releases, web copy, and more. You also may find this work more fulfilling as you're helping a worthy cause rather than just selling a product. If you're looking for work as a copywriter, browse the websites of some organizations you support. See if they're currently hiring copywriters., If you can't find a stable position at first, you can keep your resume free of gaps by freelancing. You can work with individual clients on a case-by-case basis, charging a fee for your services.


Crowdsourcing sites, such as Copify, often have posts looking for freelance copy writers. You can start contacting potential clients through websites like this, e-mailing out your resume and portfolio.You can also go to local businesses and see how much they typically pay for copywriting. You can develop a competitive rate from there and provide them with your resume and portfolio. Tell them to give you a call if they want to hire you as a freelancer for a job.Keep in mind you'll probably have to have another job on the side if you're freelancing. Freelancing work is not always reliable and you may not be able to count on freelancing alone to pay all your bills and living expenses."

Add to your portfolio.,
Stay in touch with connections.,
Maintain a LinkedIn profile.,
Create a web presence.",How to Get Into Copywriting3," As you continue to work in copywriting, add to your portfolio. If you did a particular ad or blog post that went over well, add that to your portfolio. Always look for opportunities to diversify. If you don't have a lot of ads in your portfolio, apply for jobs writing ads. The bigger and more diverse a copywriting portfolio, the better chance you have of landing jobs.

, Networking is one of the best ways to find a job in any field. Copywriting is no different. Stay in touch with contacts from past jobs and freelancing experiences. This may be somewhat easier if a lot of your work is freelance or remote, as you can stay in touch via social media. Add past clients on Facebook and Twitter. E-mail them on occasion. If you ever need a reference or a job lead, you should have a variety of contacts on call.

, Much of modern copywriting is electronic. People in search of potential copywriters may browse LinkedIn for leads. If you do not already have a LinkedIn account, create one. Keep it updated regularly as you gain more experience.


Showcase your work on LinkedIn. In the publications section, link to any articles, web copy, or other content you have worked on. Double check with clients before doing so, however, to make sure it's okay to take credit.
Have ""copywriter"" written somewhere in your general description. This way, you'll more easily come up when recruiters are searching for copywriters.
List your past jobs, including part time or freelance work. Ask post clients to endorse you for skills or to leave reviews.
Checked your LinkedIn regularly. Those interested in your services may contact you via a LinkedIn message.

, A web presence is important in copywriting. As so much of modern copywriting is digital, being on the web is vital to your success.


Create and sustain a LinkedIn profile. Do not hesitate to reach out to past contacts to ask them to endorse you for certain skills or write you a recommendation.Have a separate social media for work and personal use. Post only content relevant to your field on your professional Twitter and Facebook.As stated, it's a good idea to have a blog that you update regularly.

Write in clear, simple sentences.,
Use one or two syllable words.,
Transition between different parts of your Word document.,
Write in the active voice.,
Keep your paragraphs skimmable.",How to Improve the Readability of a Word Document1," Try to stick with one idea in each sentence so you don’t confuse the reader. This will make your sentences easy to understand and follow to the next idea or sentence., Try to avoid too many three syllable words, since that can be confusing for the reader and harder to follow. Keep your words as transparent as possible.


If you are writing a more academic piece, it may be a good idea to use longer words; however, keep your words as clear and direct as possible even if they are longer.

, Transition words like “first,” “however,” or “therefore” can tell your reader how parts of the document relate to one another. It can help them move between sentences and between paragraphs more easily.

, In each sentence, make sure your subject is always doing an action, not having an action done to it. For example, write “Sally threw the ball,” rather than “The ball was thrown by Sally."", Your readers should be able to view the document and understand the point of each paragraph or section immediately.

Consider the several types of spacing.",How to Improve the Readability of a Word Document2," The standard margin size is 1"" all around. Sometimes, a document may have larger margins on the sides or top, depending on the header and footer of a document., Consider using headings, lists, or shorter paragraphs to highlight white space. This helps draw your reader’s attention to the things you want them to pay attention to., Your test should be justified to the left side of the page and have a ragged right margin. This is the standard for most documents and helps readers follow your document easily.


Centered alignment can sometimes be useful to highlight headings or lists. Think about the use of white space when deciding to use centered alignment for parts of your Word document.

, Spacing can be either designed by punctuation, margin size, line, or by paragraph. Each type of spacing may be appropriate for different types of Word documents.Punctuation spacing is when you include 1 or 2 spaces after punctuation. This is not always standard, but can improve readability, especially in documents with a lot of text.
Line spacing is usually only single or double-spaced. Double-spacing is usually required for academic writing, since it makes it easier to insert comments and corrections. However, typical business documents are single-spaced.
Paragraph spacing has an empty line between paragraphs to break up the text. This is most commonly used for business documents that are single spaced as a way of transitioning.

Try to describe the character in a wider setting and gradually narrow to a specific location. Go from a description of the country/state/region, then move to the town, then neighborhood of the town.
You may also want to go from physical setting to the population by describing the type of people who live in the town. This is a common way to transition from inanimate objects to living beings that think, feel, and care. This starts to give the story meaning., Use the five senses: touch, sight, smell, sound, and taste. Many writers only use sight, but this is a mistake because it makes the writing two-dimensional. Of course you have to describe the way something looks, but you also need to include descriptions from the other senses as well.


Think about what the room smells like. What does the sand feel like under the characters feet? Is the edge of mountain cutting into the character's hands? Describe the way the character's favorite meal tastes.For example: She entered the front parlor. Lady MacDougall sat enthroned like Queen Victoria on a blue chintz-covered settee and motioned Elizabeth to take the matching armchair opposite. The salmon-painted walls made the duchess' white hair glow pink. Elizabeth flinched when a log shifted in the blazing fire in the enormous fireplace surrounded by the marble the previous Lord MacDougall had brought back from Egypt himself., The setting should enhance the story, not block it. This can happen if you stop in the middle of the scene to provide a lengthy description of the world around the characters. Instead of providing separate setting description in the middle of a scene, describe the setting through the characters' actions. The setting should be integrated along with what the characters are doing.For example, if the character is running from a vampire in the woods, don't stop and describe how scary the woods are. Have the character notice how dark it is and the lack of sound. Have the character trip over an exposed root and get a cut on her cheek from a branch. Focus on how the character can't see anything, but can hear the footsteps behind her. This incorporates the setting with the action so it doesn't block the story.

, Show the setting instead of telling. Don't say, ""The desert was hot."" Instead, show that the desert was hot by describing the sun burning the character's skin, the heat rising from the sand in waves, and the thick air that is hard to breathe.


To do this, use vivid language. Choose nouns and descriptive adjectives to describe the setting. Use concrete action verbs.
Telling: The girls were excited.
Showing: Giggles and screams filled the arena. The soft curls were now damp with perspiration and the anticipation of the event. They held tight to each other in a mock effort to contain themselves. Arms flailed upward, and voices echoed in varying tones. The moment was here., There is such a thing as too much setting description. Refrain from describing things that have no importance to the story and its themes. Instead, make a conscious choice about everything you describe. Each setting description should have a reason for being in the story.

, Setting includes many things, but the most important to start with is the location. You have to choose somewhere the story happens. The choice of location is extremely important. It sets the mood and comes with connections and stereotypes you can use to support your story, or that you can have your characters fight against.


Start by choosing a country, state, region, city, or town. You can be more specific, such as describing a neighborhood or a street. Decide if your location is an urban city, a farm, islands, or mountains., Give the physical details of the house, yard, or room. Use these physical details to describe the character(s). You can also use the physical details to further theme, values, and attitudes.When you do this, setting helps give meaning to your story.
For example: The walls were made of dark stone, dimly lit by torches. Empty benches rose on either side of him, but ahead, in the highest benches of all, were many shadowy figures. They had been talking in low voices, but as the heavy door swung closed behind Harry an ominous silence fell., Time setting is an important part of your story. This can influence your plot and the behavior of your characters. The following are important time settings to consider:


Time of day. Does your story happen in the morning, the middle of the day, or at night? Each time of day has a specific association with it. Also keep in mind the different ways that characters may act at various times in the day.
Time of year. Is your story set in the summer, the winter, or the spring? Is it centered around a holiday, like Christmas or Halloween? Time of year can also include the anniversary of a significant historical or personal event.
Elapsed time. Think about the transition of time in your story. This includes hours and even months. You have to describe the passing of time through the setting. This can be time progressing as the story unfolds, or situating the reader within a flashback., Weather can help set the mood for your characters. It can also influence the plot. Describe the temperature, whether it's raining or windy, and even the brightness of the sun.


If your story is set in a harsh climate, you need to describe this for your reader. Describe the difficulties of living in the desert or arctic temperatures. Or explain the ease with which someone lives in their beach house.For example: And after all the weather was ideal. They could not have had a more perfect day for a garden-party if they had ordered it. Windless, warm, the sky without a cloud. Only the blue was veiled with a haze of light gold, as it is sometimes in early summer. The gardener had been up since dawn, mowing the lawns and sweeping them, until the grass and the dark flat rosettes where the daisy plants had been seemed to shine., The geography of a story is important. If there are certain trees, flowers, or food that grow in the area, describe them. Think about why it's important to the character and plot to live in this geography.Think about geographical formations, like mountains, rivers, lakes, or forests. The character should interact with these things and they should be important to the story. Otherwise, ask yourself why you are setting the story there in the first place.

, If you are writing a historical story, you must describe the setting within the paradigm of the historical era. This includes the way the world looked at that moment, but also the way technology was and the way people acted.


Think about social and political settings. This is important for a modern or historical story. These things influence the values and actions of the characters.
Cultural settings can include religion, traditions, and community interaction. Population of your location can play into this. Is the place densely populated, or is it remote?, Use your character to describe the setting. As the character moves through a scene, have her notice the setting around her. What does she immediately notice? What does she notice later? Have your character physically interact with the environment instead of just stating something is in the room.Have the character react to the setting. This can provide important character and plot development.

, Different people will see things differently. Decide how your particular character will describe something. This influences the way you describe the setting.A native New Yorker would describe the subway very differently than someone from a southern, rural farm. Decide whose point of view you want to describe the scene from and why it's important to get that character's perspective.

, The mood and personality of your character affects the way you describe the scene. Think about how the character would view the setting and how they would feel about it.Think about how a high school freshman and senior would view a school dance. The freshman might be excited because it's her first dance, while a senior may groan and complain about being there. A kid who has been bullied may be afraid of going to the dance in case the people who bully him are there, while the popular president of the student council is excited to see all her friends at the dance.
Plot events can also affect the mood of the character. A forest stroll in the afternoon may be a relaxing event for one character, while another character may be lost in the woods and be scared.

Read frequently.,
Understand writing styles.,
Identify your writing style.,
Start small.,
Have the confidence to spot and fix errors.",How to Improve Editing Skills1," Reading is the best way to get better at any language, even when you are a native speaker. Read quality books, magazines, and articles as frequently as you can to develop your reading skills. Great readers make good editors since they have developed a mastery over the language and are familiar with different grammatical structures.While you can read different types of writing to learn different skills, it is helpful to focus on reading the type of writing you'll be working with. For instance, focus on reading modern and historical fiction if you'll be editing fiction or focus on academic writing if that will be your focus.You can read fiction to heighten your attention to detail, creativity, and emotion. Non-fiction texts can help you get a better sense of article structure and how authors incorporate facts into a larger argument.
The more you read, the better you’ll become at identifying good pieces of writing and picking up on mistakes.;
, Everyone writes in different styles and voices. If you ask ten people to write a sentence about a topic, like ""Jack and Jill have been best friends for ten years"", people will word the sentence in different ways. They will also use different words to describe things and their sentences can take on different tones. Good editors can take a piece of writing and make small changes to the structure and grammar without losing the author’s original tone.Some people have developed their writing style naturally, especially if they write frequently. For some, writing is very natural and they enjoy the process. Others need a specific tone to focus on, like an academic tone or a joking tone, while they write.

, A good editor is usually also a good writer. Good editing complements a writer’s style and allows the message of the text to shine through without poor grammar and bad structure holding it back. By identifying your own writing voice, you can be more aware whenever you start to ignore the author’s voice and replace it with your own.Think of an interesting topic that you can write about. Take 30 minutes and write whatever comes to mind. Have someone read over your work and ask them to tell you what sort of tone they think you have. Professors and other authors can provide helpful insight about your writing style as well.

, You don’t have to edit ten or twenty pages of material to practice. You can start with shorter pieces like 1,000-word articles and practice with these. This is also a good way to expose yourself to different writing styles and topics. Choose a handful of short texts to edit and practice with these before moving on to longer pieces where you’ll need to check for logical flows and coherence throughout.This is a good way to keep from getting bored with the texts that you’re editing. Since you’ll be working with multiple shorter pieces instead of one long piece, you will have more variety in the material.

, Good editing skills go beyond the mechanics to having the judgment to recognize mistakes and having the confidence to fix them. As you progress through your editing career, you will find yourself relying less and less on outside methods, like spell check, and relying more on your own intuition.


This process takes time. You develop confidence in your skills when you know that they are as strong as you could possibly make them at this point in time.

Decide where you want your myth to be set.,
Start to create your characters.,
Understand the conventions of myths in the culture you are created; most are passed down orally 'by speech' and this means they have features of speech, such as repetition 'Fee, Fi, Fo Fum...' or the rule of three; 'three fairies' or 'three boxes'.,
Come up with appropriate names.,
Don't make it overly complicated, at least initially.,
End your story with a solution to the question or problem, such as 'And that is how The God (BLANK) Created Rain.'",How to Create an Interesting Mythology," Location is the best place to start. If your myth is set on a different planet or place, try reading about real cultures and ways of life in areas similar to where you want your myth to be set. Write down three main locations, and what life around those places might be like.;
, Most myths contain Gods and Goddesses, so try to read around other Gods and Goddesses you are interested in. Use traits or parts of their myths to build your own. For example, Thor, the Viking God of War and Lightning, had a hammer he used to create thunder. Your God/ess could have a similar instrument for creating a problem in your story. Most myths answer a question, such as 'Why does it rain?' or 'How did the world begin?'. Be inventive and stick to your cultural or historical setting.

, Use this within your own myth to create the structure. Don't worry if it isn't perfect, or is totally different, there are always exclusions to the rule.

, Naming your characters and settings can be done earlier, but unless it is vital to your story, don't feel blocked if you can't work them out immediately. Try to make the names fit with the culture you are creating; a neolithic war god called 'Trevor' may not be the best name to keep the readers engaged with the story. Try to make them pronounceable if possible, especially if it will be read aloud. Look at local names or languages to the area you are trying to imitate.

, Many stories are very simple and short, and can be formed in about a paragraph. However, others may be longer, such as the Saga  Beowulf. If your work is longer, try to plan it using the previous steps as much as possible, so it can meet it's final ending.

, If your story/myth ends sadly, such as with the death of the main character, such as in Oedipus, remember to include a reason for their death. Everything that happens in a myth is always relevant to the story, as they are usually spoken with little room for much else. You will need to include a message or moral about fate, greed or something to do with human nature, as this is a very common factor in most myths. Good luck!

Develop a mastery of the language.,
Consider continuing your formal education.,
Familiarize yourself with different writing styles.,
Become a subject-matter expert.",How to Improve Editing Skills2," This is the foundation for every editor’s skills. Regardless of the language that you are working in, whether you are a native speaker or you’ve learned it later on in life, you need to have a mastery over it. You need to feel confident in your ability to recognize and conform to the language’s rules for punctuation, grammar, and style, and idioms.Brush up on your syntax, grammar, and punctuation skills by reading format and style guides. Practice using MLA, Chicago, Turabian, and APA style guides to get a broad understanding of different writing formats.

, While a formal education, like a bachelor’s or master’s degree, is not required to be a good editor, it can help you strengthen your skills. Many editors have degrees in English, journalism, or communications that help them develop their editing and writing style. A classroom setting can be a great environment to learn and master the skills you need to improve your editing.


You can also continue your education by attending a writer’s group, listening to lectures online, or by reading.

, Read pieces from as many different authors as you can. Each type of writing has different standards and expectations that the piece must conform to. So while authors have different voices, they will usually write a in a style that corresponds to the type of work they’re creating. An author writing their first fiction novel will need to write and structure their story in a very different way than if they were writing a press release. Becoming familiar with these different styles of writing will help you identify the tone of the text and to edit with its audience in mind.While writing styles are often stylistic choices, they also reflect an author's background. For example, someone who is not a native English speaker will write an English poem very differently than a native speaker. It can also reflect an author's education, particularly when they are writing more formal pieces, like for an academic journal.
For example, news articles and press releases are written in an ""inverted triangle"" format, with the most important information at the beginning and progressively less important detail following. Advertising copy needs to effectively state the benefits of the product or service to the prospective buyer., While you may already edit a certain kind of writing, like blog posts or academic research, it’s a good idea to market yourself as an expert in a particular sub-field. Your specialization might be in news articles or press releases. When you’re specialized, you can tailor your research and practice your editing skills with documents that are within your field.It helps to specialize in a field that you’re passionate about. People that are passionate about world news might be more drawn to editing journalism pieces instead of creative fiction novels.
This type of editor would often work at the developmental and substantive phase of writing. An expert would be able to press the author to make sure that the content is coherent, logical, and factual.

Communicate with your client.,
Practice being honest.,
Know the purpose of the work you're editing.,
Give yourself time to do the job right.",How to Improve Editing Skills3," Editing someone else’s work can be very personal. Some writers, especially those who aren’t as experienced, feel like critiques on their writing are really a critique on themselves. However, editing needs to stem from a healthy line of communication between you and the writer. You need to know exactly what they want out of you. If they need help with structuring their book, that’s what you’re there for. If they only want someone to do a grammatical check without changing any of the structure, you need to obey their wishes even if you see something you’d like to change.Having an open line of communication between you and the writer will allow you to tailor your editing process and have a better final product. Speak with them over the phone and use email to communicate with the author whenever you are unable to meet with them in person. , This goes along with communicating with your client. You want your communication to be honesty and open so the two of you can work together to put out the best piece possible. You also have to become used to telling them what you honestly think about their work. This doesn’t mean that you should be rude or condescending, but that you should be objective when you approach revisions.When you are very familiar with a client, it may be more difficult to be objective, especially when you consider them to be a friend. Approach each piece as if you didn't know the name of the author; edit the piece based on the writing instead of basing your edits on your relationship with the author.
This is also true when you’re editing your own work. Being honest with yourself about the quality of your work takes practice and you can become a better writer and editor by making honesty your policy.

, Understanding the goal of the article or the nature of the story will enable you to determine what things are wrong and to focus your editing skills on correcting them. This is an essential step in the editing process that most editors could do better with. While it is tempting to jump into editing as soon as you receive the piece, take some time to talk to the writer about what their goals are for the work.


An author that wants to publish the piece might have very different sets of criteria than your friend who needs help with an essay for her class.

, Rushing to edit your own work after you finish it will cause you to miss errors that become apparent only after a second reading at a later time. You need time to adjust your mindset; it may be a few minutes, or it may be longer.


If you agree to edit something for someone else, make sure that you agree on a deadline that gives you enough time to do your best work.

Gather the information.,
Brainstorm.,
Choose the size.,
Begin small.,
Cast Page.,
Thank You's.,
The Front Cover.,
Good job!,
If you are printing them yourself, be sure the order is as follows: Outside - Autographs page on the left, Front Cover on the right when looking directly at it.,
Good work and here's hoping it's an amazing performance!

",How to Design a Playbill," Without the information, you only have bland design pages. This information includes:


Who plays what character
Who needs to be thanked
Who the play is directed by
Who wrote the play
(If it applies) Who wrote the music
(If it applies) Who directed the orchestra
When and where the performances are
Who is presenting (performing) the play;
, All plays have themes. Whether it's cowboys, detectives, hippies, or stars, it'll be the base of the designing process. (I will be using examples from my own designs throughout this how-to.)

, For most off-Broadway plays, a simple playbill can be designed. This is usually 4 pages of design fitted onto 1 piece of paper. The front and back covers on one side, which will be the outside of the playbill, and the thank you's and cast page on the other side, which will be the inside of the playbill. This is usually the best option if you have a low budget. If you have a bigger budget and have a lot of things to cover, you can add more pages as you see fit. (We will cover the simpler design for now.)

, The beginning is sometimes the easiest if you have a lot of ideas, but you want to start out with the simplest and easiest of pages to get you into the mood. This page is the Back Cover, or the Autographs Page.


Open up your graphics design program (ex: GIMP, Photoshop, PaintShop, etc.) and start a new page with the dimensions: 612(width) x 792(height). This is the standard size of printing paper converted into pixels. Be sure that the background is white.
You want to use a simple, small, space-saving design to put along the bottom of the page. Open up a new layer, and set it to 'transparent'. This saves you the hassle if you need to update anything between now and the performance.
Choose your design. Any colour can be used, but if it's a very bold design, you might want to set it to 70% opacity. This makes it less of an eye-sore and more viewer-friendly.
The text. You want to use a fancier font than Arial, but you want it to remain subtle and readable. See tips for a free text download website (completely safe). Your program should automatically bring up a new layer for the text, but if it doesn't create a new layer before adding the text. The text should be a large size, but be sure to keep it at the top of the page and space-saving. The autographs page is made so that audience members can get the cast to sign it for them. That means you need a lot of room. If need be, increase the space between letters until the word ""Autographs"" fully covers the span of the top without you having the increase the size. (By increasing the spacing between letters, you can make the word grow width-wise without growing length-wise. A very useful feature.)
If you want, you can add in smaller words at the bottom ""Designed by: Your name"", but some designers, like myself, choose not to for the humble aspect.
Save the image in the format of your program. . Be sure to save it in your program's format so that you can edit it later if needed.
Save the image again, this time in your desired format (.jpg, .gif, .png, etc.).
You're done the first page!

, This is by far the most complicated page. It seems easy enough at first, sure, but it is deceitful. You forget names, characters, misspell names. Some people like their name spelled a certain way, and sometimes people drop out. The extras are constantly changing all while you're trying to make more room on the page! Tread carefully, my friend, for you tread on a minefield.


Get the list of names. You can ask the director, co-director, or anyone in charge for this. It'd be wisest to ask if they have a list of who plays who. Be sure to confirm this list with multiple persons. (It ends up wrong most of the time.)
Open up your graphics program. Create a new image with the dimensions: 612 x 792. Be sure that the background is white. Create a new transparent layer.
Start with the background design. It doesn't have to be very flashy, or even there if you wish, because the cast page is all about the cast and that pretty much covers the entire page. However, if you do choose to make a background, lower the opacity as you see fit so that it doesn't out flash the words in front of it. As I am doing a detective play with a smaller cast (18 people), I made it look as if the cast page was part of a newspaper and at the bottom I had a bit of the newspaper ""ripped off"" to give it an authentic feel. When you have a smaller cast, you usually have a space at the bottom. You can fill this with a design.
The title. At the top of the page, over to the left side, add the text. This can be as simple and straight forward as ""The Cast"" or, if you're very creative and the opportunity arises, adjust it to the theme of the play. Examples: The Suspects (detective), The Groovy Gang (hippies), The Riders (cowboys), The Stars (Hollywood). This text can be the same size and font as that of the autographs and thank you titles, as this gives it a nice consistency, but it doesn't have to be. (NOTE: You will most likely not be playing with the letter spacing, as we want this text to reach a little more than halfway across the page. If it doesn't with the spacing at normal, adjust it. Do not let the text reach all the way across the page! It is very important, as if you do this, it'll look very awkward.)
Start another text layer underneath the title. It usually starts at about halfway down the title text, or at about the quarter way point on the page, but this can be adjusted to the text length and what you find most appealing. This text will be smaller than the title text, and perhaps a lighter version of the title colour. It can be a different font if you want. It will usually read ""(in order of appearance)"", ""(in order of speaking)"", or ""(in alphabetical order)"", but you'll adjust it to the order. See tips for additional information about the cast page's text.
Now it is time to add the cast. On the left side of the page, a little down from the bottom of the text at the top, begin a text layer. Write down all the names of the characters in the play, starting a new line as you finish each. Now, if you'll be adding the ...'s leading from the character name to the actor's name, you'll only be adding one text layer. Be sure to balance out the text so that all the names line up on either end (this can be done by adding an extra '.' or taking away an extra '.') but if it just doesn't line up exactly, switch it so that it aligns not left but center.
If you are not doing the ...'s leading to each name, you will have to start a new layer after you finish typing the characters. This layer has to start directly across from where you started the last layer. Be sure to start it near the middle so that you have room to type longer names. Edit it so that it aligns not left but right. Then type out the names of the actors who play the character directly across from their name.
Check this over. Read it through to check for errors in spelling, and then read it again, comparing it word for word against the list you acquired. Check again that all the characters are there, and check another time that all the cast is there. Compare the cast page you have to the cast page in the script, and then compare the cast page in the script to the characters on your image. This seems excessive, but it must be done. I checked my cast page over again and again, and I thought it was good. Turns out I completely forgot a character.
Save this page with the extension of your program (For example, GIMP is: .xcf).
Save this page again with the extension you wish to use (.jpg, .gif, .png, etc.).
Print out the cast page and show it to a few people in charge. After this, get the entire cast to check it over. The cast will have the best eye, as they are the ones on the page and they'll notice if their name or character is misspelled or missing.
If it all passes approval, you are done the cast page!

, You are halfway finished designing your playbill. Now it's time to complete the inside by working on the Thank You's.


First find out who you have to thank. Usually, you thank the actors, choreographers, technical crew, the director and co-director, the place which you are performing in, the place you practiced in (which sometimes is the same place you perform), and, finally, the audience. Most likely your thank yous will be slightly different. You have to thank the actors and (if it applies) the people who drove them. You must thank people who handled the technical aspects and those who designed the set. The director, of course, and anyone else who worked with them (Co-director, stage director, etc.). The place you practiced at and performed, as well as where you got your costumes. If it applies, who choreographed the play and who wrote the music. Finally, your audience, because really, what is a play without the audience?
Open your graphics program, and create a new image. Make the background white, then create a new transparent layer.
Make the text layer. If you want consistency, you'll have the same font and size as you had on the cast and autographs page, but it doesn't have to be this way if you don't want it to be. Start the layer at the top of the page. What you type is up to you, but make it similar to ""Thank you"", ""We'd like to thank.."", or ""A thank you to.."". Adjust the letter spacing until it reaches across the span of the page.
Add the Thank You's. You should keep a simple, readable text at a reasonable size for this. Be sure that if your program does not start a new layer when you add text, that you add a new layer before adding more text.
Create a new transparent layer. There will most likely be a space underneath the thank you's. If this is the case, you're step will be easy. Create the design underneath the text. Lower opacity to 70% so that it is viewer-friendly.
However, if there isn't a space underneath, you have to go back to the layer you first added in the beginning. (No, it wasn't a mistake formed by the habit of typing 'add new transparent layer'. There was a point to it.) Getting back to that layer might vary from program to program, but trusting that you know your program well, go back to that layer. If your program is like GIMP, you will go to the bottom layer then go up a layer. You can design from here without covering the text you have just typed.
Create your design. It should be related to the theme of the play. Clowns do not belong on a playbill relating to pirates. Lower the opacity to your taste. Remember, you want the text to pop out from the design.
Save this page .
Save this page again
You're finished the thank-you page!

, Possibly the hardest part in the designing process is the front cover. The Cast Page is complicated, but can be conquered with lots of review and checking. The Front Cover requires creativity, and it's likely to stump you.


Consider your theme again. What can relate to this theme? For example, I have a detective theme. What related to it? I might write cities, cases, cops, Polaroid’s, fedoras, newspapers. Do you think I might write cows? Absolutely not. The Front Cover has to reflect the play, and a cow will not say 'detective' to the audience.
Open your graphics program. Create a new image with the dimensions: 612 x 792. Make the background white and create a new transparent layer.
Design. So long as you stick to the theme, you can create anything on the front cover. Don't hold back. Bold and beautiful are the designs of the cover. Make it so eye-catching it's breath-taking! You really have to rely on your creativity here. I cannot teach you how to do this. If needed, get the opinion of a friend, preferably someone artistic. Just remember to leave some white space for the information.
Create a new text layer. It's time for the title text. This can go anywhere on the front cover, so long as it stands out, as unlike the titles of the previous pages, it doesn't have to always be at the top. Make sure the text is big, bold, and eye-catching. It's the title of the play! It has to be the most eye-catching words on the playbill.
Create another new text layer. Add the other basic information. This should be a plainer, simpler font, which will be smaller than the title. Information such as ""Directed by ~"", ""Written by ~"", and ""Performed by ~"" will go here.
You might have to put the performance information on here as well. Such things like the performance dates, times, and where it is at. You can probably discuss this with someone in charge if you feel it'd be best if this wasn't on it. Seeing as it is a playbill, it shouldn't be necessary.
Save this page with the extension of your program (For example, GIMP is: .xcf).
Save this page again with the extension you wish to use (.jpg, .gif, .png, etc.).
You're done the Front Cover!

, You are done your playbill. Email the designs to whoever needs them (Whoever is checking them, printing them, etc.).

, Inside - Thank you's on the left, Cast page on the right when looking directly at it. It looks best if you print it in Full Bleed. Take note that normal printer paper won't usually handle the playbill, as it will show through the other side. Fold it in half to complete the playbill.

The 14 lines of the Shakespearean sonnet is formed by using 3 quatrains (4 lines of verse x 3 repetitions = 12 lines) and 1 couplet (2 lines) to result in the required 14 lines.Usually, there is a problem expressed in the first three quatrains, which is then resolved by the closing couplet.
Each quatrain extends a thought or idea expressed in the preceding quatrain.;
, Shakespearean sonnets are typically written in lines of 10 syllables, 5 of which are “stressed” when spoken aloud. For example, this line written by poet Percy Bysshe Shelley: If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind? The five stressed syllables are Win-, comes, Spring, far, -hind.To create more variation within the lines, it’s also possible to include 11 syllables, which would end the line on an unstressed syllable. For example, this line from Shakespeare’s Sonnet #29: “Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,” the stresses are In, thoughts, self, -most, -pis-.
The combination of stressed and unstressed syllables are known as a metric foot. Since penta means 5, pentameter means 5 feet.
Iambic pentameter is the rhythm that most imitates everyday speech in the English language, so it isn't really hard to write., The Shakespearean sonnet has rather strict rules about what words should rhyme at the end of every line. This pattern of rhyming end words can be symbolized by an alphabetical letter. A series of rhyming couplets can be symbolized as AABBCC, etc.The rhyme scheme of the Shakespearean sonnet is ABAB CDCD EFEF GG.
By looking at the rhyme scheme, you can see that there is a predictable flow to the end rhymes of each of the 14 lines.

, The Spenserian sonnet, named after the famous British poet Edmund Spenser, consists of 14 lines with the rhyme scheme ABAB BCBC CDCD EE. The quatrains are linked in this form by end line of each quatrain that continues in the first line of the following quatrain.The Miltonic sonnet, which is what the British poet William Wordsworth often wrote, uses the rhyme scheme ABBAABBA CDECDE. This is, in fact, a version of the Italian or Petrarchan sonnet, in which the 14 lines are created by 8 lines (2 quatrains) and 6 lines (or sestet) with a volta (or turn) in the middle. The Miltonic sonnet omits the turn in the middle.
The Shakespearean sonnet was actually developed by the Earl of Surrey in the 16th century, but it was made famous by Shakespeare in his sonnet sequence printed in 1609.

, A lyric poem is written to express personal emotions, such as love and grief. A sonnet is almost always a lyric poem, rather than a dramatic or narrative poem. If you’re considering writing a sonnet, you should think about using this form to express something you feel strongly about.In ancient Greece, a lyric was a poem written for accompaniment with the lyre, an early stringed instrument. Currently, lyric poetry is written as an expression of individual emotion.
The word sonnet literally means “little song.”, Shakespeare’s sonnets were written mostly about love, whether happy, unhappy, or forbidden love. Later poets, most notably John Donne, wrote sonnets about religious love.Grief is another popular topic for sonnets, as grief can be seen as an expression of lost love.
Within the topic there is a conflict that will be developed in the first quatrains, and concluded in the final quatrain.

, People have written sonnets about love, passion, lost love or squandered love, unrequited love, or the grief of losing a loved one. While love, grief, or other strong emotions make compelling sonnets, there are no rules about what a sonnet should be about.If you aren’t sure what you want the topic of your poem to be, it’s okay to start with an image that captures your attention or even a quote that you find interesting to think about.
Because the form of a sonnet is short and intense, it makes sense to use this form for interior, self-directed topics.
Sometimes writing a poem can help you sort through an experience that’s confused or overwhelmed you. You might find yourself writing a poem to figure out your own thoughts.
The topics of Shakespeare's own sonnets included time, love, beauty and mortality.

, One reason to write a poem is to write about an experience that’s been important in your life. Focusing on a particular moment in your life can help you address larger, more abstract, topics.For example, if you want to write about someone your life, you might start by writing about an experience that you shared together, such as a drive or a meal.
This event might serve as a metaphor, something that serves to convey information that’s larger than the literal meaning itself.
An example of a sonnet written by Shakespeare about an actual experience that was also a metaphor was in Sonnet 22, where he writes about looking into a mirror and seeing the signs of aging in his own face., Using clear and concrete language is a good way to convey strong emotional experiences. Sometimes people feel like they have to write poetry using “poetic” language, when nothing could be farther from the truth. The best sonnets are written in language that is simple and direct. Sensory detail will help you show the reader your meaning, rather than simply telling your meaning.
Make sure to include plenty of sensory details, such as what you can smell, feel, taste, and hear.

, Cliches are phrases that have been used so often in language that they no longer bring any meaningful information. For example, “pretty as a picture,” or “cool as a cucumber” are comparisons that are cliches. One way that Shakespeare avoided cliches was to make fun of them, such as in Sonnet 130 where he writes, ""My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than her lips' red...""Because it was a common cliche to compare a woman's body to flattering images, Shakespeare does the opposite.
One way to determine whether or not you’re using cliches in your writing is to read your poem out loud to someone else. If your listener can predict the end of any phrase before you say it, you’re probably using a cliche.
In order to eliminate all cliches from your poem, focus on what you really intend to say.

, Some writers can write in coffee shops or at the kitchen table, but others require a quiet room and a desk. The most important aspect of writing a poem is to make sure you set aside time to focus on your work.Whether you write your poetry in a journal, a notebook, or on your computer is up to you.
There’s no “wrong way” to write your poem, so feel free to explore as many different writing styles as you’d like.

,
The final sonnet’s last line may be the first line of the initial sonnet.

Observe female characters that already exist, from classic literature to contemporary fiction.,
Just because they are strong female characters does not mean you have to avoid any feminine traits.,
Create variety.,
Be careful when creating the femme fatale .,
Make sure your characters aren't obviously created from an agenda.",How to Create Strong Female Characters,"


Pay attention to characters that people don't like. Bella Swan from Twilight is often considered weak, passive, and flat. Try to understand why, and avoid creating characters that many don't like.
Characters such as Hermione Granger from Harry Potter, Katniss from The Hunger Games , Catherine Earnshaw from Wuthering Heights , and Elizabeth Bennet from Pride and Prejudice are all noted for being powerful characters. Even if you haven't read the books, research what makes these characters so admirable.

Don't take everyone's word. Just because many people find Hermione a strong character, try to figure out how you could weave those traits into your story and whether you really like her yourself.

;
, For example, Katniss often avoids and rejects many things considered feminine, such as dresses, makeup, hair, and girly-ness. Don't consider those things the enemy. It is perfectly OK for female characters to be more feminine. This can make them more relatable, since many girls like these things as well. You rarely (if ever) see male characters rejecting every stereotypically male trait.



Feminine can be strong too. Just because your character may whine about breaking a nail does not mean they're not capable of defending their family. The same character can be witty and extremely intelligent. By rejecting femininity, you may imply to readers that you do not find everyday females strong.
Avoid immersing your characters in these stereotypes. Stereotypes exist because someone does follow them, but most people do not meet every stereotype. Creating a character as such makes them appear unrealistic and flat. But many people don't consider that doing the opposite can come off the same way. Instead, find the perfect balance so that your characters seem unpredictable and real.

, This doesn't just apply to female characters, but since they're the most poorly-executed characters, it applies mostly to them.


Creating variety helps you play around with traits and finding the right balance. You can some minor characters have more exaggerated traits, while your more important characters (especially the protagonist) must seem realistic and interesting since readers will have more interaction with her.

Often, this helps make characters with more obnoxious traits more tolerable. For example, you can have a minor character that is shallow, narcissistic, and celebrity-obsessed if you can balance her with a sensible, more subdued character.


This isn't an excuse to make flat characters! Even if some of your characters are more extreme and flamboyant, you have to at least provide a reason for their behavior, and make sure they have other traits that make them less ridiculous.

, Literally meaning ""fatal woman"" in French, these are female characters that often use their sexuality as a weapon. They're lustful and alluring, yet also controversial.


To a few, these characters, while powerful and tough, can be offensive and exploitative. Because they're overtly sexual, they're also seen as amoral. These types are often antagonists, but sometimes appear as protagonists.
But writing is all about taking risks, and the allure of femme fatale characters is undeniable. It's not impossible to pull off such characters. They don't have to be necessarily sleazy, and like the few in the picture, many can be classy. They are mysterious and seductive, though. And since these characters are already very intense, it's best make them slightly vulnerable.
The hardest part of creating such characters is making them memorable. They can be easily dubbed as too sexual, predictably using her sex appeal to get what she wants. Avoid this.

, Many writers create female characters knowing how hard it is to not step on any toes and remain politically correct. The goal to make a realistic, feminine yet not whiny character can end up with an author pushing their agenda on how women should be.


The best way to avoid this is not to create characters that show how women should be, but how they are. No one can deny that your characters are just political symbols when they can easily relate to someone they know.
Most authors probably do this to some extent with their female characters. Even Suzanne Collins (author of The Hunger Games ) had to carefully consider how she wanted Katniss (and women) portrayed in her novel before writing it.

Start writing your book!",How to Begin Writing a Book," Before you begin writing your book, you will need to have an idea. This is the seed from where your book grows. Coming up with the concept can, however, be difficult. Ideas will come when you open yourself to more experiences, so the best way to get an idea for a book is to go out and do things.


Starting concepts can take many forms. You can have an idea for the general plot; you can have an image of an environment, an outline for the main character, or even smaller, less developed ideas. It does not matter how rough it is, any idea can turn into a magnificent book.;
, Once you have a vague concept, start researching to get more ideas. For example, you want to write a book about kids playing a futuristic video game. Do some research by going to arcades, reading up on the latest game innovations, and playing some games yourself. In doing these activities, you may see or experience things which give you ideas for what the story can be about or could be included in a story.

, With a few ideas about what could be included in a story, you will want to develop your concept. Make the concept more complex by following it to its logical conclusion, thinking about what might result from the set of circumstances, or anything else to make it a more complex idea. Having a more developed concept will help you build your plot.


For our story about video games, for example, we might develop the concept by asking ourselves who made the futuristic video game. Why are they making it? What happens to those who play?

, When coming up with and developing your concept, you will need to consider your audience. Whom are you writing this book for? Different people are into different things and there be particular sets of experiences and prior knowledge to go with the various demographics. You will need to consider this so you understand how to proceed with the plot, characters, and how the book is written.

Try creating a false ad for your book. Include a summary, a cover idea, and the title. This will help you think of ways to make the book appealing.






Don’t feel limited: there’s no reason a book about kids playing video games can’t be enjoyable for older people who have never played video games. However, if you intend to write a book that aims at people who have never experienced what you are writing about, you will need to do an outstanding job at describing the experiences of the characters and making the topic accessible.

, In the beginning stages of writing a book, you will want to organize your plot. It is okay to leave some room for movement when you begin writing, but writing your story without some road map rarely works out. The best place to start is with choosing a structure that works for you. Writing theory teaches that there are several classic structures, which most works fall into, but most are not mutually exclusive and can be combined. The two major structures are:


Act structure: The act structure, commonly associated with plays and film, can easily be applied to novels as well. This theory of structure states that stories do well when broken up into clearly identifiable sections. The normal number of sections is three though two and four are common. In the classic three act structure, the first act introduces the main and secondary characters, the setting, the problem to be conquered, and often some background information (this act usually comprises roughly 25% of the story).The second act moves through and develops the conflict in the story, usually containing a plot point where the main character faces a major setback. This is the meat and potatoes of the story and usually comprises roughly 50% of the content. The third act is the conclusion, where the hero faces the villain and the story reaches its climax, followed by a rewarding or, at least, less exciting ending scene or series of scenes.Each of these acts can often be boiled down into three subsections, each with its own arch or mini-story.
Monomyth or the Hero’s Journey: This theory of story structure was famously put forward by Joseph Campbell.It states that almost every story with a hero can be boiled down into one main series of archetypes. This begins with a hero who is called to adventure though s/he initially refuses the burden. The hero is given some aid before crossing from the world, s/he has always known into the adventure (where the hero feels lost and alone at first). The hero then undergoes a series of trials, during which they will often encounter helpers, at the end of which the hero goes through some significant personal change. The hero then confronts the main antagonist of the story and returns home, enriched with wisdom and treasure.

, You may want to think about what type of conflict you wish to have in your story. This can help you develop a plot, as well as lead you to other similar stories to gain inspiration. There are many theories about the types of conflict in stories, but the main sources are:


Man against nature: This is a story where your main character faces off against some natural phenomena. An example would be stories where the main character becomes lost in the wilderness or the antagonist is an animal. An example of this kind of story would be the film 127 Hours.
Man against the supernatural: This is a story where your main character faces off against creatures like ghosts and demons, God himself, or other beings not of this world. The Shining is a good example of this type of conflict.
Man against man: This is the most basic story conflict, where your main character faces off against another person. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a classic example.
Man against society: In this type, your main character faces off against the rules of a society or societal norms. An example would be the novel Fahrenheit 451.
Man against self: This is a story where your main character faces off against his own inner demons or his own internal conflict. An example of this would be The Picture of Dorian Gray.

, Whether it is intentional or not, your story will end having a theme. This is what the story is about. Through writing about this theme, you will end making some statement about what you think on the topic. Think about the themes in your book or that could be in your book and what you want to say about them. This can help you develop a plot, through creating situations which present your ideas.


Frank Herbert’s Dune (for example) is not about a guy trying to avenge his family. It’s about the perils of imperialism and Herbert makes it clear that he believes Western powers have become hopelessly entangled in a situation where they do not belong which they cannot hope to control.

, Plot points are turning points in your story, important events which change the course your character must take. You will need to plan what these will be and try to space them evenly. There is a plot point, which serves to convince your character that they must go on their adventure. This is a point at which all of your character’s plans for dealing with their problem go right out the window and then some climax which incites the final battle.

, Once you know where you are going and how you are going to get there, write down the whole thing. This will be your roadmap and is vital to a smooth writing process. Write down the basics of each scene, what purpose the scene serves, what characters are in the scene, where they are, what they are thinking and feeling, etc. Every minuscule detail of the sequence of events should also be written down for each scene. This is the best way to prevent crippling writer’s block, as you can still cover the basics of a scene, even if you may not feel that it is perfect.

, When planning your book, you will want to think about how many characters you want to include. Do you want only the smallest number possible, to create a minimalistic, lonely feeling? Or do you want to include a vast wealth of characters which serve to create an elaborate world within your book? This is important, as you will need to plan your characters around each other to create balance.

, No one is good, great at everything, and without faults (the word for this in writing is a Mary-Sue and, trust us, no one will like her but you). Giving your character real struggles and faults will make them more realistic and help your readers to identify with the character. Remember: your readers have faults, so your characters should too.


Your character’s faults will give you the space necessary to improve them over the course of the story. This is what makes a story good: your character undergoing challenges to make them better human beings in the end. This is what your audience wants to read about, as it helps them believe that they too can be better people at the end of their struggles.

, Once you’ve got a balanced character, get to know them. Think about how they would react in different situations (even if those situations would never be in your book). Think about what it takes to get them to reach different emotional points, what their hopes and dreams are, what makes them cry, who is most important to them and why. Knowing these things about your characters will let you better understand how they would act in the situations that you do put them in, leading to a more consistent, more realistic character.

, Once you are fairly far along into the character development process, you may want to stand back and evaluate your characters. Make sure that they are truly important to the plot. If they are not, you may want to consider cutting them. Having too many characters, especially characters which never distinguish themselves, can confuse readers and hurt your book.

, Think about where your book takes place. Think about what the architecture looks like, how cities are laid out, what the natural environment looks like, etc. Now, write all of that down. This will allow you to (first of all) be consistent in your descriptions but also more detailed, creating richer more realistic environments.


You can tell someone the sky is green, you just have to make them believe it by telling them how at sunset it faded from the pale green of a leaf’s belly to a rich green which made everything seem dull by comparison before darkness set into an almost iridescent color like a crow’s feathers. Make them see it by understanding it well enough yourself that you can explain it.

, Say you are writing about a band of adventurers trying to reach a fabled city on the other side of a mountain. That’s great. The problem is, it takes a long time to cross a mountain. Things are bound to happen during the crossing of a mountain. You cannot simply have them cross in two days as if it is no big problem. If they have to cross a continent on foot, you need to allocate time for that in your plot.

, You will need to appeal to all of your audience’s senses if you want them to be fully immersed in the text. Don't just tell them what your characters ate. Tell them how the juice of the meat burst forth as they bit into it and the taste is a mix of the grease and the smoke from the fire. Don’t just tell them that a bell was ringing right above your character’s head. Tell them about how the sound was so loud that it pierced every thought until only an awareness of the ringing persisted.

, Think about how you want to write your book. As technology develops, the number of choices becomes greater and greater. You will need to choose a method which works best for you but keep in mind that it may affect how you go about publishing your work.


You can write the text with a pen and paper, type on a typewriter, type on a computer, or use a software program which records your voice as you talk and translates it into typed text. Different methods work best for different people.

, You will need an acceptable space, which allows you to work without interruption. It will need to accommodate your chosen writing method and be comfortable and not distracting. Common options include a coffee house, office, or library.

, You will want to be sure that you do not become distracted while writing so have everything you may need. Many people develop a specific thing, which they cannot write without, such as a particular food or sitting at a particular chair. Make sure that these needs are met before continuing.

, Get to know yourself and how you write. Do you write better at a specific time of day or in a specific place? Maybe you write best after you finish reading someone else’s book. Knowing how you write can tell you about how you should proceed and what you should avoid; you can build your writing schedule around the habits you know yourself to have.

, Once you decide what time of day works best for you and form some kind of writing schedule, stick to that schedule. Have a time that is only for writing and always write during that time. You can use it to free-write or plan your novel, but you should always use the time for writing. This will help you get into the habit and be more productive.

, It can sometimes become difficult to write, but you should not stop and ignore the problem. This often leads to unfinished books. Do things to inspire yourself and continue to work, even though it is slow and much more difficult. You can always return to a section later when you feel more inspired.

, You have now completed all the steps and twists needed to plan your book, but now it is time to write it. wikiHow offers several different how-to's about writing books that you should use as references:

The speaker refers to the first and last name of the writer. If the writer has any credentials that lend to his or her authority on the matter at hand, you should also briefly consider those. Note that if the narrator is different from the writer, though, it could also refer to the narrator.
The occasion mostly refers to the type of text and the context under which the text was written. For instance, there is a big difference between an essay written for a scholarly conference and a letter written to an associate in the field.
The audience is who the text was written for. This is related to the occasion, since the occasion can include details about the audience. In the example above, the audience would be a conference of scholars versus an associate in the field.
The purpose refers to what the writer wants to accomplish in the text. It usually includes selling a product or point of view.
The subject is simply the topic the writer discusses in the text.;
, Appeals are the first classification of rhetorical strategy and involve the ethos, logos, and pathos.


Ethos, or ethical appeals, rely on the writer's credibility and character in the garnering of approval. Mentions of a writer's character or qualifications usually qualify as ethos. For instance, if a family therapist with 20 years of practice writes an article on improving familial relations, mention of that experience would be using ethos. Despite their name, these appeals don't have anything to do with ""ethics"" as we usually think of them.
Logos, or logical appeals, use reason to make an argument. Most academic discourse should make heavy use of logos. A writer who supports an argument with evidence, data, and undeniable facts uses logos.
Pathos, or pathetic appeals, seek to evoke emotion in order to gain approval. These emotions can include anything from sympathy and anger to the desire for love. If an article about violent crime provides personal, human details about victims of violent crime, the writer is likely using pathos.

, Style details are the second rhetorical strategy and include a wide variety of elements, such as imagery, tone, syntax, and diction.Analogies and figurative language, including metaphors and similes, demonstrate an idea through comparison.
Repetition of a certain point or idea is used to make that point seem more memorable.
Imagery often affects pathos. The image of a starving child in a third-world country can be a powerful way of evoking compassion or anger.
Diction refers to word choice. Emotionally-charged words have greater impact, and rhythmic word patterns can establish a theme more effectively.
Tone essentially means mood or attitude. A sarcastic essay is vastly different from a scientific one, but depending on the situation, either tone could be effective.
Addressing the opposition demonstrates that the writer is not afraid of the opposing viewpoint. It also allows the writer to strengthen his or her own argument by cutting down the opposing one. This is especially powerful when the author contrasts a strong viewpoint he or she holds with a weak viewpoint on the opposing side.

, Before you begin writing your analysis, determine what the information you gathered suggests to you.


Ask yourself how the rhetorical strategies of appeals and style help the author achieve his or her purpose. Determine if any of these strategies fail and hurt the author instead of helping.
Speculate on why the author may have chosen those rhetorical strategies for that audience and that occasion. Determine if the choice of strategies may have differed for a different audience or occasion.
Remember that in a rhetorical analysis, you do not need to agree with the argument being presented. Your task is to analyze how well the author uses the appeals to present her or his argument.

,


By letting the reader know that your paper is a rhetorical analysis, you let him or her know exactly what to expect. If you do not let the reader know this information beforehand, he or she may expect to read an evaluative argument instead.
Do not simply state, ""This paper is a rhetorical analysis."" Weave the information into the introduction as naturally as possible.
Note that this may not be necessary if you are writing a rhetorical analysis for an assignment that specifically calls for a rhetorical analysis.

, Clearly identify the text or document you plan to analyze in your paper.


The introduction is a good place to give a quick summary of the document. Keep it quick, though. Save the majority of the details for your body paragraphs, since most of the details will be used in defending your analysis.

, Mention the speaker, occasion, audience, purpose, and subject of the text.


You do not necessarily need to mention these details in this order. Include the details in a matter that makes sense and flows naturally within your introductory paragraph.

, The thesis statement is the key to a successful introduction and provides a sense of focus for the rest of the essay. There are several ways to state your intentions for the essay.


Try stating which rhetorical techniques the writer uses in order to move people toward his or her desired purpose. Analyze how well these techniques accomplish this goal.
Consider narrowing the focus of your essay. Choose one or two design aspects that are complex enough to spend an entire essay analyzing.
Think about making an original argument. If your analysis leads you to make a certain argument about the text, focus your thesis and essay around that argument and provide support for it throughout the body of your paper.
Try to focus on using words such as ""effective"" or ""ineffective"" when composing your thesis, rather than ""good"" or ""bad."" You want to avoid seeming like you are passing value judgments.

, The most standard way to organize your body paragraphs is to do so by separating them into sections that identify the logos, ethos, and pathos.


The order of logos, ethos, and pathos is not necessarily set in stone. If you intend to focus on one more than the other two, you could briefly cover the two lesser appeals in the first two sections before elaborating on the third in greater detail toward the middle and end of the paper.
For logos, identify at least one major claim and evaluate the document's use of objective evidence.
For ethos, analyze how the writer or speaker uses his or her status as an ""expert"" to enhance credibility.
For pathos, analyze any details that alter the way that the viewer or reader may feel about the subject at hand. Also analyze any imagery used to appeal to aesthetic senses, and determine how effective these elements are.
Wrap things up by discussing the consequences and overall impact of these three appeals.

, This method is just about as common as organizing your paper by rhetorical appeal, and it is actually more straight-forward.


Start from the beginning of the document and work your way through to the end. Present details about the document and your analysis of those details in the order the original document presents them in.
The writer of the original document likely organized the information carefully and purposefully. By addressing the document in this order, your analysis is more likely to make more coherent sense by the end of your paper.

, Rely on hard evidence rather than opinion or emotion for your analysis.


Evidence often include a great deal of direct quotation and paraphrasing.
Point to spots in which the author mentioned his or her credentials to explain ethos. Identify emotional images or words with strong emotional connotations as ways of supporting claims to pathos. Mention specific data and facts used in analysis involving logos.

, A rhetorical analysis can make an argument, but you need to be scholarly and reasonable in your analysis of the document.


Avoid use of the first-person words ""I"" and ""we."" Stick to the more objective third-person.

, Do not simply repeat the thesis in your introduction word-for-word. Instead, rephrase it using new terminology while essentially sharing the same information.


When restating your thesis, you should be able to quickly analyze how the original author's purpose comes together.
When restating your thesis, try to bring more sophistication or depth to it than you had in the beginning. What can the audience now understand about your thesis that they would not have without reading your analysis?

, In restating your main ideas, you should also explain why they are important and how they support your thesis.


Keep this information brief. You spent an entire essay supporting your thesis, so these restatements of your main ideas should only serve as summaries of your support.

, If more information should be done to further your efforts, say so.


Indicate what that research must entail and how it would help.
Also state why the subject matter is important enough to continue researching and how it has significance to the real world.

Thus, it's best to have good old-fashioned pencil and paper no matter where you are. Moreover, many writers swear by the connection from mind to hand to pen on paper, so at least give it a go before dismissing this as an option to aid your writing experience.


A leather-bound or heavy card notebook is the most sturdy and can take lots of abuse in a backpack or briefcase, whereas a spiral-bound notebook, while not as robust, is easy to keep open. Better still, should you decide the page you just wrote is utter garbage—it's easy to rip out!






Spiral or bound, consider using graph paper versus standard lined paper. You may end up creating drawings and sketches as you go, and it's useful for indenting paragraphs, or outlining.








, Now that you have your notebook, it's time to squash the traditional bugaboo of all writers: that empty first page. Use those first pages to write out ideas for stories. Once you feel you've written down enough ideas, read over them twice. Then, take your ideas to someone else to get feedback. Decide which idea to go with and make sure it doesn't sound like anything recently published. Then, wait a few days, read over the idea again to be sure, and move onto the next step

,), places - all the little things that go into a larger story. There are several advantages to this overview approach, including:


It will give you new ideas for your story as you describe different parts of it (write those down!)
Nothing goes to waste. You may describe a character, for instance, who never appears in the story directly but who influences another character.

, Use your notebook to write a lot about them.—Even create a backstory for a couple of them. This helps you visualize and think about them more and even learn about your own character more.


You always have something to refer to when you run out of immediate ideas.


, An outline will help you define the arc of your narrative—the beginning, development of plot and characters, the setting up of all the events leading to the big conflict or climax, and then the resolution and ending.


The beginning of the story is often the hardest part depending on who you are—if you want it to be. The best thing to do is start as broadly as possible. Say, for example, you want to write a mystery novel, and you're a fan of World War II. Write that down: Mystery, WWII. The beauty of this is that both categories are very broad, but simply by putting them together, you instantly narrow the field of possibilities. You now have, at the very least, a time period, and a focus. Something mysterious happened during WWII. Try to focus it a little more.

Is it personal, or is it sweeping? WWII was certainly both. For the sake of example, say it's personal, one soldier's story.
When does it take place? WWII is obvious if it's about a WWII soldier's story—or is it? This is one of those decision points you will come to right away. Say it actually takes place now, which leads to the next question, ""How now?"". To move right along, lay out the beginning scenario: Your main character finds a journal—his grandfather's journal from WWII. This is a revelation, because Grandpa never made it home from the war, but nobody knows what happened. Perhaps, in this journal, your hero will uncover the answer.
You now have several key questions answered, right out of the gate: who: your hero; when: then and now; what: a journal, and the mystery of a missing person. You don't know ""why,"" yet. That is one of the things you must discover. How? Again, this must be uncovered through asking yourself questions.


Develop your characters. Start with the obvious. In this case, you have already created two characters—a young man and his grandfather. You can determine characteristics of both simply by the setting, and expand your characters in the process. Grandfather would likely have been married, so there would be a grandmother in the picture. There's a generation between grandpa and the young man, so there would be one of his parents who is also Grandpa's son or daughter. See how easy that is?
Continue along in this fashion, extending from one character to all the others that they may interact with. Before long, it's possible that you'll have too many characters and interactions. This is good, especially in a mystery. You may have need of ""red shirts,"" like the hapless, disposable ensigns from the original Star Trek!
In the process of developing your characters, you will likely ask yourself the same question your readers will soon be asking: what happens next? Use these questions to develop the story. You know, for your story, that the young man wants to find out what happened to Grandpa. Since all he has is the journal to go on, he reads it, and discovers Grandpa's story that lead him from his small town in Kentucky and his pregnant wife (grandma!), to the beaches of Normandy, to finding himself wounded behind enemy lines—all of which he wrote of in his journal. He never makes it home. Knowing these things, you see questions and a pattern emerge:

Events take place in ""today's"" time, and also during WWII: As the journal is read, the date is 1944. As the grandson explores, it's today.
To add some action to the mystery, the young man must do something. Since Grandpa isn't coming home, send the young man to Germany to find him—dead or alive.
Where was Grandma in all this?


Continue along this process of creating the arc, but at this point you could even hazard a tentative ending: the young man discovers why Grandpa never made it home, and how his journal did. Then all you need to do is write down everything in the middle!
""Timeline"" your outline. Now that you've created the basic story (minus all the words), sketch your outline as a timeline, with each character's milestone events laid out on their own line. There will be times when two or more characters intersect, and where some disappear altogether. Just draw a line where those events happen. This too will give you something to kickstart your muse when she falters.


, If you find your plot goes nowhere, and nothing you can do will help it—back up to where it last made sense, and try something else. Your story is not required to do anything you tell it to do in the outline. Sometimes, the story has other ideas where it wants to go. Wherever you are in the process, the muse may beckon you elsewhere. Follow her—this is part of the joy of writing.

Write out the name of each chapter for your book and decide what you're going to put into it, that way you'll always know where you're going with the story.,
Know the elements of a good novel.,
Write out your plot.,
Start writing!,
Remember that your notebook should only be used for planning!",How to Write a Book3," Writing about your characters at the start, too, can be helpful down the road.

, If you want to be a successful writer, think twice about taking creative writing as a course in college (unless you've already done so); instead, take English Literature. You have to know how to read with discernment and a critical eye before you write anything. Sentence structure, character distinction, plot formation, and character personality development all fall into place if you know how to read critically before you write.



Setting. The setting of a book is the time, place, and circumstances in which a story takes place. You don't need state this outright, of course. Like a painter might do, you create a picture in the mind of your reader by painting around the subject.






For example: Maria walked down the steep slope surrounding the castle. Before she could get very far, one of her father's maids stopped her and said, ""King Ferdinand would like to see you."" This suggests that Maria, possibly a young girl, lives on castle grounds. This would give the reader clues that the book might take place in medieval times. Maria is also a Latin name, which could suggest where she lives, and ""King Ferdinand"" is a giant clue! In fact, the wife of King Ferdinand—Isabel of Castile—approved and funded Christopher Columbus's voyage to the New World in about A.D. 1492, so this story probably takes place around that time.



Characters. Every story has major and minor characters. It's important that you make yours interesting and introduce them properly. Introducing the setting, and maybe even the characters, is called the exposition.






There are several types of characters that many books have. The protagonist is usually a main character and one that the book follows. For every protagonist, there is usually an antagonist, the character who provides the friction a story needs to proceed. The villains in books are generally antagonists, but not always.
Keep this in mind: very often, one man's villain is another man's hero. Regardless of the roles they play, these character types are important to make your story successful.



The conflict. A conflict is a large problem that a character faces, usually the reason for the story to exist in the first place.






Maybe Maria, the King's daughter, has been asked to make the decision whether to let Columbus use Spanish ships and sailors for his adventures. She may continue to face this problem for most of the story.



The climax. The climax is the point of highest tension in the book, the point where the reader is really holding their breath.






Perhaps Maria has just decided against letting Columbus use Spain's money to explore when he shows up, begging her to let him go and saying he'll do anything to have this chance. This is the point where Maria has a big choice to make, one that determines the whole outcome of the story.



The resolution. The climax is over, the problem has been solved, and any loose ends have been tied up. Note: if you intend to make a sequel, leave at least one or two loose ends unresolved.






For the example here, Maria decides to honor Columbus's wishes, lets him go, and convinces her father to let her go with Columbus on his journey. It's often interesting for the reader if there is an ending you weren't expecting, so don't always make the ending of your book predictable.



Details are some of the most important things to write in a book. Instead of just saying. ""The sky was blue"", say what kind of shade of blue it is, such as ""The sky was a light shade of indigo."" It can really boost the interest level of your story. But don't go overboard. A bad example would be: ""The sky was a light shade of indigo, which set off the deep burnt onyx of the sands, flecked with effervescent spittles of foam from the lime-tinged aquamarine breakers.""






Over-the-top embellishment can make you look like you're trying too hard (and likely you are). Be descriptive and light on your feet, and maybe add a poetic tone to your story.



, This will give you a starting point to anchor your story. Nothing fancy, just a general idea of what goes on. Halfway through the book, look over the original plot you wrote down. It'll be amazing how your perception of your book may have changed. You can change your book to match the original plot or scrap the plot and go with what you've written. You could even integrate and mix the two––whatever you want. Remember this is your book!

, This is the best part. If you're having trouble starting, skip to the conflict of the story, and go from there. Once you feel comfortable with your writing, you can add the setting. You'll probably change loads of things in the story, because the great thing about writing a book is you can let your imagination run wild. The only thing you have to remember is that you have to enjoy the process, or your book will probably end up in a cylindrical metal container flecked with deep brick-colored oxidation and peeling shards of turquoise latex pigment (namely, a rusty old trash bin).

, It is best to type up your story so you can create multiple copies of it, easily remove mistakes, and pitch it to publishers.

Pick something you know, or want to know—about.,
Research.,
Format your book.,
Add copious descriptive details.",How to Write a Book4," Your nonfiction book could be information about a place where the reader might be vacationing, or information on a place in general. It could be about today's society, or a contemporary or historical leader or person of interest. The only caveat for true non-fiction is that it be factual.

, As much as they may know, every expert has at least one new thing to learn! You can never know too much about a subject. If you are having trouble or reach a stumbling block, try these things:


Go online. Sometimes it will take a bit of digging to narrow things down, but let the search engines of the world help you in your knowledge quest. Follow not just the main articles, but the referenced articles as well. Leave questions on forums and other places in case anyone can help you resolve them.
Read another non-fiction book about, or related to your subject. The author may see things from a different perspective, and may have some information you were not aware of, which you will duly confirm from an independent source before including it in your story, right? Right!
Ask an expert. There is likely an expert in the field who has made it their life's work to know everything about the topic you're writing on. Seek them out, honor their time, and ask them if there is something that might be unique and interesting about your subject.
Read an encyclopedia. Yes, it's a boring job, but somebody's got to do it. It might as well be you, as you gather all the information you need for your book.

, The books that don't get published are the ones that are poorly organized. For example, don't talk about good places to fish and good beaches in Europe in the same chapter. For more information, consult the Related wikiHows below.

, No one wants to read a boring book! Good books are enriched with details and color.

Be persistent.,
Keep asking questions of your motives, your story, and your characters.,
Take breaks to get back some perspective.,
Find opinions other than your own.,
Ditch what doesn't work.,
Remember that many authors fail at many drafts before they find an actual idea that's good enough to stick with.,
Write what you know.,
Keep at it.",How to Write a Book5," A cabbie was stopped by a young man in Manhattan who asked, ""How do I get to Carnegie Hall?"" ""Practice,"" replied the cabbie. Practice makes perfect. Write constantly—whether it's your story, or just a thought or an observation. The more you do it, the better you'll get. It doesn't have to be perfect, it doesn't have to read how you want it to initially––what matters most is getting it out. There will be plenty of time to review the approaches to writing taken later.

, Everything and everyone in your novel should have a reason for being there—saying the leaves are green shows the readers it's spring or summer. Saying the character had a three-day beard shows that he's under duress of some sort (or he's a Hollywood actor). Every character has a motivation for what they do, so ask ""them"" as you write. ""Why are you about to get on that plane and leave him alone in Morocco?""

, Writing improves with distance. On returning to it, you'll often see what works and doesn't work in your written piece, whereas trying to perceive this when you're stuck in the middle of it is a lot harder. Set aside a chapter for a week and come back to it later, refreshed and with new eyes.


If you get writer's block, stop writing for a few days or so, and listen to some calming music to clear your head.

, Let other people read your book's manuscript. They can give you valuable feedback, and perhaps even help you as you continue to write.

, Unsurprisingly, there will be plenty that doesn't work. Don't be afraid to delete characters, plots and anything else from your book if it isn't working. Equally, don't be afraid to add new elements and characters that seem to bridge gaps and give sense to what you're writing. In the case of non-fiction, never be afraid to find more facts to back up your statements!

, Take Veronica Roth, author of the Divergent trilogy. She says in her blog that it took her at least 48 tries to find an idea to stick with, and that was in college!

, This old saying can either work for you or not. It's good to not need to do a whole bunch of research before writing, but a little doesn't hurt. Also, it's a good exercise: Writing new things could help unearth an idea!

, Try to make your mind churn out ideas all the time, so you never have an excuse not to write. You don't need to fit EVERYTHING into your story, just enough to satisfy the reader. If you get sick of writing, and just come to a stop, take a break and re-connect with the world outside, where you get some ideas from. Or try free-form writing-just write, no edits, no erasing ""because it sounds bad"" just write, write and write, - even if they are scattered scenes, rhymes, or two words.

Ultimately, you’ll want to fill your portfolio with some of the best samples of your work. Without working on your writing skills, it’ll be tough building a portfolio that will impress a good agent.


Consider taking writing courses at a local college or university.
Read instructional books on writing.
Write as much as you can for a variety of outlets. Try to contribute to your local newspaper, local magazines, websites or blogs, or just about anywhere you can get others to read your writing.;
, Freelance writing work is one of the best ways to hone your skills and to get experience writing for public consumption. As a result, securing some sort of writing job, no matter how informal or consistent, is an extremely important step in your path to secure a writing agent. In the end, freelance work will help you in your goal of creating a portfolio you can submit to agents.


Many of the best agents won’t take on writers who have limited or no experience writing.
Browse the internet, job list websites, or newspapers for writing jobs that might work for you.
If you’re just starting out, most any writing job will work. Remember, the goal here is to get experience so you can begin to hone your craft and build your portfolio., This step is not technically essential, but having a short story or magazine articles to your name proves you're a decent writer and gives you an air of experience. If you’ve been published before, a writing agent will likely take you more seriously.


Submit your work to genre or subject appropriate newspapers, magazines, or journals.
Browse online literary or academic list services or postings about essay collections that you might be able to contribute to.
Generally, the larger and better known a publication your work is published in, the more it’ll count when being viewed by an agent., After you’ve honed your abilities and published your work, you need to begin the process of putting together your portfolio. As a representation of your body of work – and your best work – your portfolio will serve as an ambassador of your abilities.


Include your best work.
Use samples of your work that is best representative of the type of work you want your agent to find you.
Feel free to include a wide variety of your work, but make sure to leave out anything that is mediocre or substandard.
Include a minimum of 3-5 samples., Before you decide on an agent and try to secure their services, you need to think carefully about what you need in an agent. Knowing and understanding what an agent will and can do for you is perhaps one of the most important things you need to do before signing with one.


Many agents specialize in different things. While some may specialize in fiction, others may specialize in more academic work. Know what you want and need before you look for an agent.
Agents work for compensation. Understand how your agent will be compensated. Usually, agents work for a percentage of the project or deal they broker for you. , If you have friends or associates that already have a writing agent, ask them about their agent. They’ll be able to give you great first-hand information about how their agent treats them and how their agent works for them. Ask them:


What type of work/projects/deals their agent has gotten for them.
What sort of fee or commission their agent takes from each project.
How quickly their agent responds to their inquiries., Another way of finding an agent is to spend a little time browsing the internet or trade publications for agents that might work for you. This will help you get some relatively objective information about agents. For instance, consider:


Reading internet reviews about agents you might be considering.
Check out Poets&Writers.org for a list of literary agents.
Pick up a current copy of the writer's and artist's yearbook and browsing the writing agents section., The initiate point of contact between you and an agent will be your query letter. Your query letter is essentially a mini-work prospectus that outlines your work and focuses on your current project (if you are working on a large project). Your query letter is intended to get literary agents excited about your work.


Your query letter should include a genre and a quick plot summary, similar to what you'd see on the back of a book jacket.
If you’re not working on a major project at the time, instead describe your work, major publications, and mention work you are interested in.
Reserve all business details (like word count) for the bottom of the letter.
Mention any writing credits.
The finished letter should be about 200 words., After you have a draft of your query letter, take some time to proofread your letter. This is extremely important since, as a writer, you are expected to be able to write well.


Make sure you avoid obvious mistakes like talking about a ""fiction novel"" and other redundancies.
Have a friend or colleague proofread the letter for you.

, After you’ve written and corrected your letter, you should send it out to several agents. Sending it to a number of agents is important, as some may not be interested in your work or some may not be accepting new clients at a given time.


Don’t send your letter to more than four agents at any given time.
Remember, sending a query letter to an agent is not any type of commitment on your behalf.
Make sure to read submission guidelines and address your letter to the right person., After agents receive your letter, they may or may not respond. Once one does respond, you should set up a meeting. Meeting with a writing agent is the only way you’ll know if the agent’s personality and professional approach work for you. When arranging a meeting, consider:


Calling them for a quick conversation.
Setting up an in-person meeting. This will enable you to get to the agent better and will better facilitate communication between you.
Setting up a Skype meeting, if you are in different cities. Depending on your location, the best agent for you won’t be in your town or city.
They might be the one invite you to meet. Be open to accepting their invitation.

, No legitimate agent will ever ask you to pay them to represent you. If an agent demands pay to represent you, look elsewhere.


While compensation to agents vary, depending on region and the reputation of an agent or author, you should never have to pay an agent in advance.
Your agent's fee is a percentage of the money you make once signed. If someone asks you to hand over money, they're almost certainly a scam.
If you’re serious about having your work published in order to demonstrate your writing ability (and you want to make money), avoid “vanity presses.” Vanity presses are presses that will publish your work if you pay for the cost of publication. At the same time, avoid agents who recommend vanity presses., Unfortunately, there are scam agents out there that will try to take advantage of struggling or naïve writers. Always be on the lookout for these agents and agencies.


Research them thoroughly and make sure they're right for you. If you got one offer you can get another, and a bad agent is worse than no agent at all.
If an agent tells you to go to a specific editor before they'll represent you, they're probably a scam agency working for the editor.
Never sign over the rights of your work to an agent.
Do not agree to a commission or compensation system that is lopsided – in which they will be making more money than you., In your work to find an agent, much like your writing work, you should never give up. While a lot of agents might not be interested in representing you and your work, you’ll eventually find someone.


Some people say getting an agent is like being struck by lightning; it's all about luck.
Continue writing and honing your craft.
Try to develop new work or enter a new genre.
Keep sending query letters out to other agents.
If an agent tells you to contact them at some later point (and you respect that agent), make sure to contact them."

Reading everything you can will not only help you develop your writing skills, give you more ideas for how to craft your work, and help you develop the patience you need to write a book of your own, but it will also give you a better sense of what is selling in the market. Set aside a few hours a day to read as many books as you can, and try to read widely in as many genres as you can.If you already have an idea of what genre you want to write in, whether it's science fiction or non-fiction, you should focus on reading books in that genre. However, to become more well read in general, you should read widely when you can.
The more you read, the more you'll become attuned to common clichés. You want your book to stand out, so if you find ten books that are too much like it, you may have to find a different angle.
When you find a book you really like, ask yourself what it is that makes it so special to you. Is it the ridiculous main character? The beautiful prose? The sense of place? The more you can pinpoint why you like a book, the sharper you'll be when you try to make your own work appeal to a wide audience.;
, If you want to be an author, then you will most likely have to start off by publishing a full length work of non-fiction or a novel. It's very difficult to sell a collection of short stories or essays as your first work. Having said that, it's also difficult to jump right into a novel or a full-length work of non-fiction. So, if fiction is your thing, try your hand at writing some short stories first to help yourself get a feel of the craft. If you're more into non-fiction, try to write a short essay before you jump into an entire work of non-fiction.


This is not to say that short stories are somehow inferior to novels. Alice Munro, the winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature, never published a novel during the entire course of her illustrious career. Still, it is a lot harder to gain a reputation in short stories these days., If you want to publish a work of literary fiction or non-fiction, then getting an M.A. or M.F.A. in Fiction or Non-Fiction is the typical route to follow. If you want to write something more commercial, such as a science fiction or romance novel, then this route is less necessary, though it can still be helpful. Getting a degree in creative writing can initiate you into the life of a writer, get you in a community of other like-minded writers who give helpful feedback, and will also give you two or three years to focus on your craft.Many successful writers who publish their books find work as teachers at M.F.A. or undergraduate writing programs. You'll need a degree in creative writing to do this, so if this is your end game, consider getting the degree.
Getting a degree in creative writing can also help you get your foot in the door in terms of connections. You'll meet faculty members that may be able to help you publish your work or develop as a writer in other ways.
The writing degree it not a direct path to success as a writer. But it can help you improve your craft significantly.

, If you've chosen to enroll in a writing program, then you'll be spending plenty of time at writing workshops, where you will receive ample feedback from your peers. You will have also worked independently with faculty and received feedback from them individually. But if you have not gone this route, then you should join a writing group in your community, take a writing workshop offered by a local community college or adult school, or even just ask a few trusted friends to take a look at your work.


Though feedback should always be taken with a grain of salt, getting feedback will give you a better sense of where you stand.
Getting feedback will help you realize if your work is publication ready, or if you have more work to do. You have to make sure that you're asking the right readers -- people who really get your work and know what you're about.

, If you have some short stories or essays that you think are ready to be sent out into the world, then you should try your hand at submitting them to literary journals or journals that publish work in your genre, such as journals that specialize in historical fiction or romance. Check out duotrope.com to get an idea of all of the journals out there. All you have to do is get your manuscript in order and send a brief cover letter to the editor of the journal; after that, you play the waiting game.This will be your first exposure to something common to the writer: lots of rejection. Try not to take it personally and consider it a way of thickening your skin.
Some journals charge a $2-3 fee for submitting your work. This is a pain, but it doesn't mean the journals are trying to rob you; they are often run on a shoestring budget.

, The first thing you have to do is to come up with an idea that will intrigue and excite people. You may have to start writing before you find your idea -- you may even write three hundred pages before you realize what your book is really about. Still, start with a general premise -- the story of a girl growing up in Ukraine during the Bolshevik revolution, a work of non-fiction about the growing importance of charter schools in America -- and see where you can take it.


You may want to complete the whole book before you start thinking about how marketable your idea is. Still, it can help you to research the market on your topic before you begin. You may find that there is a book on your exact topic already out there and that you may have to tweak your idea a bit.

, Though genre-bending books are getting more and more popular -- such as the novels of Margaret Atwood, which blend literary fiction with science fiction, it can help you to work within a genre that helps you communicate your ideas. Once you know what your genre really is, you should be aware of all of the conventions within that genre, and you can start thinking about ways you want to turn those conventions on their head, or if you want to stick to its rules. Here are some popular genres you should consider:


Non-fiction
Science fiction
Flash fiction
Action stories
Horror
Mystery
Romance
Adventure
Fantasy
Political fiction
55 fiction
Young Adult Fiction
Middle Grade Fiction

, This may be something you do as you go along, or you can have some of the basics figured out before you write a word. Here are some of the points you will have to consider as you write your book:


Who: The main and/or Supporting character(s), The antagonist.
Point of view: Will your book be written in first, second, or third person?
Where: The location and time-era of your work, where they will travel over the course of the piece.
What: The main idea or plot.
Why: What the character will/hopes to accomplish.
How: The methods they use to accomplish it.

, In her classic book about writing, Bird by Bird, Anne Lamott writes about the importance of the terrible first draft."" And that's exactly what you'll have to write: a truly awful, embarrassing, messy piece of writing that will contain the kernels of the final draft that you will write one day. You don't have to show the very first rough draft to anyone, but the important part will be knowing that you will have achieved something. Write without censoring yourself or worry about people will think. This is your time to get your ideas down; you can refine them later.


After your first rough draft, keep on going. If you get lucky, you may be able to have something presentable after the first or second draft, or you may have to write five drafts before you think you've really figured it out. This can take a few months, a year, or even years, depending on how much time you have and how long it takes to develop your project.

, Getting feedback too early can stifle your creativity and make you think that you're not taking your work in the right direction. But once you've written enough drafts of your book and are thinking about taking it out into the world, it's important to get some feedback to see where you're headed. Ask trusted friends who are critical and helpful readers, turn it in to a writing workshop, or ask an expert on the topic to take a look at it if you're writing non-fiction.


If you've written a novel, you can try submitting some chapters to literary publications to get some feedback.
Once you get some feedback you trust, work to address it. You may have to write another draft or two before you get it right.

, You won't get very far if you have a typo on the first page of your book. Once you feel like your work is really ready, then you should print it out and look for any typos, grammatical mistakes, repetitive phrasing, or any other errors that you want to remove from the book before you move forward with it. You may even try reading your work aloud to see if you catch any funny phrasing or misplaced commas.


Proofreading is the final step to getting your novel in shape for publication. Though proofreading can help along the way, too, there's no reason to proofread rough drafts too closely because you may end up changing many of the sentences anyway.

, There are three main routes you should take once you feel that you have a book that is ready to go out into the world. Here they are:


The traditional route. This involves submitting your book to an agent, and having the agent submit your work to publishing houses. Most people will tell you an agent is necessary for getting your work published through a publishing house.
Submit your work directly to the publishing house. You can forgo the agent and go straight to the publishing house (the ones that are willing to look at unsolicited manuscripts, anyway). But without an agent, this is very, very difficult to do.

Self-publish. Self-publishing your work will get your book out in the world, but it's unlikely that the book will give you the attention you may be looking for if you want to live the life of a true author. But if your goal is to just get your work out there, then this is a great option. You can self-publish through an online service, a vanity press, or even just completely DIY.

, Whether you want to submit your book to a publishing house or a literary agent, there are a few basic conventions you should follow. Your manuscript should be double-spaced, in a readable font such as Times New Roman, have an appropriate cover page, and have pages numbered with your last name and the title of the work.You can also look online for more information about how to format your manuscript. If you're submitting directly to a publishing house, each one may have slightly different instructions for how your manuscript should look.

, Don't just blindly submit to any agent who is open to reading solicited submissions. Use the Poets & Writers guide to agents or check out AgentQuery.com to find agents that are actively accepting new clients, open to and excited about work in your genre, and who are reported to actually respond to submissions. Your best bet is to check out agents who accept simultaneous submissions, so you can send out your book to 5 or so agents at a time instead of waiting six months from a fancy agent who never responds to you.To submit your work to an agent, you'll need to write a query letter, which will be a succinct cover letter that briefly describes the plot of your book, situates your book within the framework of the writer's market, and offers a few words of biographical information.
Check each agent's submission guidelines. Some may only want to see the query letter first or may ask to see just the first two chapters.
Don't send your manuscript to 20 agents at once. You may find that you get the same feedback over and over, which can help you make your work more exciting to agents. If you get rejected by an agent, you can't approach him again with the same book unless he asks for a revision, so make your chance count.
The key word in this game is patience. It may be months before you hear back from an agent, so you will have to learn the art of waiting and avoid checking your email every three seconds if you don't want to go insane.

, Woohoo! An agent has written that he or she is in love with your book and wants you to sign with her. Do you sign a contract ASAP? Absolutely not. You talk to the agent, ask a lot of questions, discuss his or her vision of the book, and make sure that he or she is legitimate and committed to selling your work. A legitimate agent never asks for money up front and will only receive a cut of the profit if he or she can sell your book.If you get an offer from an agent, it is perfectly okay to let the other agents who have your manuscript know and to see if they have an offer to give you as well. You'll be surprised to hear how quickly they'll get back to you once they know someone really wants you.
Talk to the agent on the phone, or even meet in person, if it's geographically possible. It will help to get a sense of his or her personality, and to know if you two click or not.
You and your agent don't have to be best friends, but you do have to be able to share ideas.
Your agent should be, well, at least a little aggressive. This is the trait that will help get your book sold.
Your agent should also be well-connected and should have impressive records of sales so he or she will know where to send your book.

, Once you've signed with the right agent, you will work vigorously, sometimes for a year or two, to revise the novel until the agent thinks it is ""saleable."" Then you'll prepare a package and the agent will take the book to the editors at different publishing houses, and you will hopefully get an offer from at least one of them. Sit back and wait for this stressful process to be over, and you will hopefully hear about a sale soon!


If you get multiple offers, you and your agent will decide which is the best fit.

, Awesome, you signed with an editor at a publishing house! Get ready to see your book hit the shelves next week...not. Guess what's in store for you? Even more editing. The editor will have a vision for how the book will look, and you will also work on the small copyediting stuff too. This process will take a while too, usually at least a year between the time your book is sold and when it comes out.


There will be other details to figure out, such as what your cover will look like, what blurbs you can get on the back of the book, and the people you acknowledge at the beginning or the end of the book.

, Once you have worked with the editor and your book is deemed ready, you will see your book out on sale and in the stores. You will have been given a release date, and it's likely that you've been counting down until the day when your book hits the stores and the virtual Amazon shelves. Grab a hold of the physical copy, twirl around, and celebrate yourself! But your work is just beginning.

, Unless you've written a best-seller, it's unlikely that the book sale will get you a mansion and a Ferrari. Maybe you'll get a little spending money, and the ability to take some time off from your ""real"" job. Still, you should be prepared to keep your day job, or find part-time work, or even find work as a creative writing teacher if you have the degree and your book is successful enough.


If you're really all about the life of an author, the most common route is to teach creative writing. But those jobs are hard to come by, and your published book has to really stand out if you do.
You can also teach different summer workshops. If you get these gigs, they'll give you some extra spending money and the ability to travel to a great location.

, Being a true author will require you to maintain an online presence these days. Even if you're not tech savvy, you'll have to get the hang of promoting yourself online and developing your author persona online. Make a Facebook fan page for yourself; make your Facebook profile about promoting your book. Get a Twitter account and tweet about events related to your book. Make sure you have a website that is well-maintained and that all of your other online profiles link to it.


Start a blog about the writer's life that you update as often as you can. Keep things fresh so people keep on reading.
Don't feel guilty about shamelessly promoting yourself. Even if you have a publicist, your job will now be 50% writing, and 50% promoting yourself as a writer. Get used to it.

, If you have a publicist and a successful book, then you will likely have a reading schedule for your book. You will travel across the state, or even the country, to read from your book, sign your book, and promote your book to your audience. You may read in tiny bookstores or a big Barnes and Noble (for as long as they exist, anyway). This will be a great way to meet more people, make connections, and to get people to actually buy your book.


Promote your reading schedule on social media so people know where they can find you.

, A writer is not an island. Make sure you go to the reading events of other writers, go to panel discussions or be a part of a panel if you are invited to do so, stay in touch with writers in your area, and generally make yourself known wherever you are. Meet other writers at writer's retreats, writing workshops, or in your institution if you belong to one.


Get to know writers in your field and genre. They can help you get ahead.

, You've published a book and are going on tour -- awesome. But this doesn't mean you can rest on your laurels, consider yourself done for a while, and toast to your own success for months. In fact, when you sell that first book, you may often tell the editors about the second book you're working on, or you may have to pitch your second book to your agent ASAP if you haven't already. The writer's job is never done, and if you really want to be an author, then you always have to be thinking about the next book.


Don't worry if you don't have the idea for a second book all lined up. Just make a goal to write every day and soon enough, an idea will present itself.

"
Learn about your topic.,
Know your goal.,
Understand your audience.,
Choose the right persuasive approach.,
Outline your main points.,
Write a strong opening.,
Offer persuasive evidence.,
Address the counter-argument.,
Conclude with a call to action.,
Practice your speech.,
Dress appropriately.,
Relax.,
Involve your audience.",How to Write a Persuasive Speech," It is important to know as much as you can about the topic you'll be speaking on. If you aren't already well-versed in the subject (e.g. because it has been assigned to you), do some research and learn as much as you can.


Especially if your topic is a controversial one, it's a good idea to know the arguments on all sides of the issue.Whatever argument you are making, you'll be more persuasive if you can address the views of the opposing side.
Spend some time reading books or articles about your topic. You can go to the library and ask a librarian for help finding books, or just go online and find some articles. Make sure to use reliable sources, like major news organizations, or academic books or articles.
Opinion-oriented sources, like editorials, talk radio, or partisan cable news, can be valuable for finding out what other people think about your topic. But, don't rely on them as your only source of information. They can be very biased.If you use them at all, make sure to read a variety of viewpoints on the matter, not just one side.;
, It's important to understand exactly what it is you are trying to achieve with your speech. This way, you can tailor your content to fit your goals.For example, if your topic is recycling, it's important to know a lot about recycling. But, your speech will need to reflect exactly what you hope the audience will do. Are you trying to get people to vote in favor of a citywide recycling program? Or are you trying to convince them to sort out their glass and cans and put them in a separate bin? These will be different speeches, so having the goal spelled out early will help you craft your message.

, It is also important to understand your audience and their views and knowledge about the topic. This will also influence the content of your speech.An audience that knows little about your topic will need more background information and simpler language. An audience made up of experts on the topic would likely find such a simple speech boring.Likewise, an audience that already supports your view on a topic will be easier to persuade to take some action. You won't need to convince them you are right, but only that they need to do something. By contrast, an audience that does not agree with you will need persuasion to even consider your point of view.For example, imagine you want to convince your audience to support a city-wide recycling program. If they already think recycling is important, you only need to convince them of the value of this specific program. But, if they don't care about recycling or oppose it, you will need to first convince them that recycling is worthwhile.

, Depending on your topic and your audience, there are several ways you might try to convince people of your point of view. Since the days of ancient Greece, speakers have relied on three main persuasive approaches.


Ethos. These are appeals to the audience's ethics or morals.For example: ""Recycling is the right thing to do. Wasting our limited resources steals from future generations, which is immoral.""
Pathos. These are appeals to the audience's emotions.For example: ""Think of the animals that lose their homes every day because of trees being chopped down. If we recycled more, we could save these beautiful forests.""
Logos. These are appeals to the audiences logic or intellect.For example: ""We know that there is a limited supply of natural resources. We can make this supply last longer by recycling.""
You can rely on any one or some combination.

, Once you've chosen the best persuasive approach for your audience, brainstorm the main points you'll make during the speech.


The number of points you can make to support your position will be determined by how much time you have to speak.As a rule of thumb, three to four supporting points is usually a good number.For example, in the speech about recycling, your three main points might be: 1. Recycling saves resources, 2. Recycling reduces the amount of garbage, and 3. Recycling is cost-effective.

, Before you can begin persuading your audience, you need to open the speech in a way that will make them want to pay attention. A strong opening has five main elements:An attention grabber. This could be a statement (or sometimes a visual) that gets your audience's attention. It can be a good idea to be a little startling or dramatic at the opening of your speech. For example, you might start with information (or pictures) showing how a nearby landfill is nearly full to capacity.
A link to the audience. This is a means of showing that you have something in common with the audience. Show that you have a similar background or share an emotional connection of some kind. This will really depend on knowing your audience. For example, if you are a parent, speaking to other parents, you might emphasize the concern for your own children's future. If you share a common interest or ideological position with your audience, you can emphasize that.
Your credentials. This is a means of showing that you are knowledgeable or an authority on the topic of the speech. Highlight the research you've done on your topic. If you have any personal or professional experience with the topic, be sure to emphasize that, too. In the recycling example, you might say ""I've invested many hours studying the recycling issue and the types of programs available in other cities.""
Your goal. Explain to the audience what you hope the speech will accomplish. For example: ""I hope by the end of my talk that you will agree that we need a city wide recycling program.""
A road map. Finally, tell the audience what the main points of the speech will be. For example, ""I believe we must start a recycling program for these three reasons....""

, The main body of your speech should contain the points you outlined in Part 1. It should provide the audience with several convincing reasons to support your viewpoint.


Arrange these points logically. Don't jump from one point to the next, and then back again. Instead, complete an argument, then move on to another that flows logically from it.Use credible sources from your research to back the points you are making. Even if your point is more emotional (pathos), introducing some factual information will make your argument stronger. For example ""Each year, 40,000 acres of beautiful forests are destroyed to make paper, according to a study from the American Recycling Institute.""
Use real life examples that the audience can relate to. Even an argument based on facts and logic (logos) should relate to the audience's lives and interests. For example: ""In these hard economic times, I know many of you are afraid that a recycling program will mean a costly increase in taxes. But, the city of Springfield started a program like this one three years ago. So far they've seen an increase in revenue as a result of the program. Many residents have seen a decrease in their taxes as a result.""

, Although it is not strictly necessary, your argument may be stronger if one or more of your supporting points addresses the views of the opposing side. This gives you a chance to address your audience's possible objections and make your argument stronger.Make sure that you describe opposing views fairly and objectively. Consider whether someone who actually holds that view would approve of the way you are describing their position. If you aren't sure, find someone who thinks that way and ask!For example, you would not want to say: ""opponents of recycling just don't care if we waste our precious resources, or our money."" That's not a fair description of their opinion.
Instead, you might say: ""opponents of recycling are concerned that the cost might be much higher than just using new materials,"" and then go on to offer an argument about why recycling might be the more cost-effective option.

, The conclusion of your speech should remind your audience of what you have told them. It should also make it clear exactly what you hope they will do next.


Don't just restate, verbatim, what you've already said. Instead, use this as an opportunity to reinforce the way your main points support your call to action. For example: ""To sum up, I've shown you (points a, b, and c). These three undeniable facts point to a city-wide recycling program as the most sensible and ethical step we can take in helping create a more sustainable future. Please, join me in voting 'yes' on this program in November.""

, When it comes to making your speech work in real life, the most important thing you can do is practice, as much as you can.


Try practicing in front of a mirror, so that you can see how you are delivering the speech. This can help you notice your facial expressions and body language. These can help or hinder your ability to get your message across.For example, you might notice you are slouching, or that that you fidget with your collar. These actions suggest to an audience that you aren't confident.
Better still, record yourself with a video camera and watch the tape afterwards. This can help you see (and hear) where your delivery needs improvement.It has the benefit of providing audio, and also won't distract you as much as a mirror when you're speaking.
Once you've practiced on your own a few times, try giving the speech to a small group of friends or family members. Ask for their feedback on your message and delivery., On the day of the speech, dress appropriately for the venue and audience you'll be speaking to.Generally speaking, this will mean dressing professionally. But, the degree of formality will vary. A speech to a film club to convince them to show your film won't require the same degree of formality as speaking to the executives of a movie distribution company.For the executives, you would want to wear a suit. For the film club, that might be overdoing it.

, Many people find public speaking intimidating, but try to relax and be yourself as you give your speech.


Be friendly and make eye contact with the audience.Move around, where appropriate, but don't fidget or pick at your clothes or hair.Don't read the speech. It's okay to use a few notes to keep yourself on track, but your speech should be mostly memorized.Roll with the punches. If you make a mistake, don't let it derail your whole speech. This might be an opportunity to use a little humor. Then, move on., If there is something specific you'd like your audience to do, provide them with any resources you can to make it easier. It is difficult to motivate people to take action, but if you make it simple, they will be more likely to follow through.For example, if you want them to contact the mayor, demanding a recycling program, don't just ask them to do it. Give them stamped, addressed envelopes to send a letter, or cards with the mayor's phone number and email address. If you do this, many more people are likely to follow through.

Find a central point.,
Write a strong introduction.,
Study great campaign speeches.,
Figure out what makes you unique.",How to Write a Presidential Speech1," What is the number one thing, or theme, that you want people to remember about your speech? Figure that out, and make sure that you get to that point quickly.


You should make this theme simple enough that you can express it in one sentence. Hope and change was President Obama’s theme. Make America great again is Donald Trump’s theme.
Almost everyone knows these themes because they are simple and easy to remember. Politicians understand that simplicity is memorable. They find a way to capture what they will do and believe in a single theme.Once you figure out this theme, and you figure out how to capture it in a single, memorable sentence, make sure that you repeat it several times in your speech. It’s important to mention it fast, and at the end, and return to the theme in the middle too.;
, You want to use your introduction to develop an immediate report with your audience and to introduce your key theme.


It can be a good idea to give people your name so they remember it more. Unless it’s obvious, tell people the position you are seeking. You could start the speech with an anecdote, a quip or a strong quote.Make sure the opening of the speech stands out. Don’t be afraid to offer a little humor, but make sure that it’s immediately clear what you would bring to the table.End the introduction with a concise preview of the issues that you plan to discussion. For example, “If elected school president, I will focus on lengthening lunch hours, adding more student clubs, and reducing student fees.”

, You can find many of the best campaign speeches in history online. You should read them.Read the written speeches if you can find them, and then try to watch candidate speeches on You Tube. You will get a sense of what works and what doesn’t and how the speeches are organized.
If you’re running for a student position, review sample student campaign speeches. There are many of these templates online.

, You don’t want to be too generic, repeating boring campaign slogans that everyone will use.


Instead, figure out what sets you apart from the other candidates. Perhaps it’s because you’ve held a leadership position before. Perhaps it’s because you used to run a small business.
Whatever your unique selling position is, make sure that you reveal it to the audience early on in the speech. Tell the audience an anecdote relating to this uniqueness in order to make the point memorable. Make sure the unique point you bring out has a direct linkage to the audience’s needs and your campaign promises. #*For example, if people are concerned about the economy, and you have training in economics, and your opponents do not, mention it.

"
"
Organize the speech like an essay.,
Explain the problem.,
Outline your solutions.,
Keep the speech short.,
Relate issues to your audience.,
Give the audience a sense of your background.,
End with a call to action.",How to Write a Presidential Speech2," It’s really no different. An effective presidential speech should have a beginning, middle, and end.


In the beginning of the speech, you should build rapport and introduce your theme sentence as well as a brief summary of the key points you will address.
The middle of the speech is where you will make your case. It should be longer than the beginning and the end because it’s where you outline your promises, the need for them, and how you will solve that need.
The end of the speech should tie back into the beginning by reinforcing the candidate’s central theme sentence.

, In order to get people to buy into your solutions, you need to convince them that change is needed.


Stick with 2-3 key points. Don’t inundate the audience with too many details or nothing will seem memorable. You could open by saying, here are the three things we need to change.
Be specific. Use statistics and human anecdotes to highlight the problem. However, be brief. You want to focus on solutions more than problems.

, It’s better to be positive than negative. Paint a vivid picture for the audience of what the world will be like with you as president (or your school environment).


Again, boil down the speech to 2-3 key issues that you plan to change. Be very specific when you outline your solutions.
Your speech should focus more on solutions than on the problems. Make your promises first, then outline the need, and then return to the promises.
Expand on each of your key promises by detailing the problem and how you plan to address it specifically.
Don’t make the middle of the speech too dry, though. Constantly reinforce your personality and theme throughout the details of your promises.

, No one wants to listen to an hour long speech. In fact, some politicians whose speeches ran too long at their party’s convention became the butt of jokes.


A good rule of thumb is that less than 7 minutes is probably too short and more than 25 minutes is probably too long. Unless the event you are speaking at has a specific requirement, shoot for somewhere in between the above.
It’s probably advisable to err on the lower side of the equation. A 15-minute speech is about the point where people will start to squirm. If you’re not sure, go short., You want your audience to care about the points that you are making. Find a way to directly connect your promises to their needs and experiences.


Let’s say you are talking about the Vietnam war. This might seem remote to 18-year-olds in your audience now – unless you remind them that many soldiers who died in Vietnam were no older than themselves.
Similarly, perhaps you are running for high school president and you want to find a way to ensure the administration does more to meet the needs of students. If you provide a specific your audience can relate to, this will be more effective. Perhaps you say that you will ensure the administration listens to student wishes for a longer lunch break.

, Make sure you give some sense of your qualifications for the job. Don’t talk endlessly about yourself, though, or it will seem arrogant.


If you are running for school president, you could mention things you’ve done that helped the school or student body, clubs you’ve belonged to and previous positions you’ve held.Politicians often present a few anecdotes from their family background, too, if they think it will build a sense of character to the audience. Some politicians emphasize their parents’ coal mining backgrounds, for example, in an attempt to connect with a blue-collar audience.

, This is a principle often seen in advertising. At the end of the speech, you should urge people to take action.


Perhaps it’s to join your campaign. Most likely, it’s that you will want them to vote for you. Don’t hesitate to ask people for their vote. Thank them for considering you.
Tell people how critical their vote is, not only to you, but also for the platform and change that you are eager to implement on their behalf.

Decide on the tone for your speech.,
Keep your sentences short.,
Write like people talk.,
Show passion.,
Practice the speech.,
Remain civil.,
Try a joke.,
Tell stories or anecdotes.",How to Write a Presidential Speech3," Remember that you are going to be reading the speech out loud. You will want to figure out to sound. Try to speak in your natural voice.


Some speeches play to people’s fears and anger, but the best ones remain positive and play toward people’s optimism. People want to know how you will improve things for the better; they don’t only want to know how you think other people have messed up. Ronald Reagan had a gift for optimism that worked in speeches. John F. Kennedy did too. Their tone embraced what was good about the country.
Make your tone conversational. You don’t want it to sound like you are too rehearsed or reading from a piece of paper. The most effective speakers sound like they are speaking directly to the audience. Thus, people don’t see them as regular politicians. Bill Clinton was a master at this. George W. Bush also had a conversational style.

, Remember that you are writing for the ear, not the eye. People process less information through hearing than reading. So keep your sentences short.


This is why broadcast writing is less dense than print writing, generally. When writing a speech, keep the sentences concise.
Try to use one direct point per sentence. People can understand complex topics better when they are reading.

, People don’t back into sentences with endless opening clauses generally. Use strong verbs and active, not passive, voice. Read your speech out loud as you write it so you can make sure it sounds conversational.


You don’t need to fixate on proper grammar, punctuation, and so forth in a speech that will be given verbally (and presidential speeches are designed to be spoken).
It’s more important to capture the cadences and colloquialisms of regular speech, while staying true to yourself.

, No one wants to vote for someone who sounds dry, boring and cold. Take off your professor’s hat, and speak with emotion that appeals to the common man or woman.


Ancient philosophers who perfected the art of rhetoric called this “pathos.” An appeal to the emotions. Figure out the emotional response you want to create in your audience and then use sensory language and anecdotes to create it.
The philosophers believed that the core of any persuasive speech should be logos (an appeal to reason). However, they believed that speeches without pathos failed to move.

, Don’t wing it. You need to know the speech like the back of your hand. There are some politicians who know their speeches so well that they don’t need notes.


The key though is to practice the speech without sounding too rehearsed. There are some politicians who prefer to use an outline and speak more contemporaneously so they don’t sound “like a politician.”
Remember that giving a speech is theater. You need to be dramatic and show passion, but you don’t want to stumble over words or look down like you’re reading it.

, It’s a big mistake to go on the attack against your opponents. It will make you seem smaller, and it risks building them up.


Focus on your own platform. What you will change and how you plan on doing that. Talk about the qualifications that you bring to the job. Don’t bog down by attacking other candidates.
They say that when people get in trouble, it’s usually because they went negative.

, Of course, putting a joke into a speech is risky. If it’s not funny, you can fall flat and create an awkward moment. However, if you pull it off, a joke can make your audience connect with you and this is a key to an effective speech.


Presidential speech writers recommend that, if you’re going to use a joke, that you open the speech that way. Create a rapport with the audience and use a joke that is specific to the location.
Stay away from any offensive jokes and make sure a joke is appropriate to the occasion.

, It’s important that the audience be able to identify with you early on in the speech. Tell stories or anecdotes to illustrate your points.


This technique will also make your points more persuasive. If you are promising to deliver on a certain campaign point, the anecdote can humanize the topic and show why change is needed. It can also illustrate the human importance of voting for you.
The key phrase to remember is to “show, don’t tell.” Show your telling points with vivid human stories. You could also tell an anecdote or two about yourself to show the audience you’re relatable or have been through what they’ve experienced.

Do not be concerned about giving the perfect eulogy; the important thing is to do the best you can given the short time frame and fragility of your well being. Put aside such nagging questions as, ""What do I say?"" ""Will people like it?"" ""How long will it be?"" ""Where do I even begin?""

, You can flip through old photo albums, watch old home videos, or look at scrapbooks. Ask friends and family members for their stories and fond memories.

, It can be sad, serious, thoughtful, or humorous. You are best positioned to judge which is suitable for the occasion.

, An outline will help you organize your thoughts, and to focus on and organize the primary ideas and themes, thereby making the writing process easier. After listing the main ideas, each can be broken down into smaller pieces, so the little details aren't forgotten. The more details you include at this stage, the easier it will be to write the draft.


You may outline by using whatever method you feel most comfortable with. There are traditional vertical outlines, using letters and roman numerals. Or, you could outline by free association; this stimulates creative thinking because you are free to jump from one idea to the next, no matter how unrelated the thoughts may seem. Write the person’s name at the top of the paper. As thoughts come to mind, any thoughts, write down a word or phrase that quickly summarizes that thought. For example, ""charitable contributions.""

, Just keep writing down everything that comes to mind. After you have jotted down many ideas, go back over your outline and number the main points in the order they should be addressed.

, You are experiencing difficult emotions. If you are having troubles writing, don’t panic or give up. Take a moment to gather yourself. Review your outline. It is also important to remember that editing is a large part of the writing process, and you will improve your draft as you work with it. Start off slowly, without knowing exactly what you are going to say. Stick to your outline and let your ideas flow onto the paper. Try writing a letter to your loved one to get more ideas out (in fact, a letter format can be your entire eulogy). Write as quickly as possible. You will have time to go back and check for grammatical errors, or to change words around.

, Finding the perfect words to capture the attention of those in attendance can be the most difficult parts of the writing process. If you can’t think of the right way to start the eulogy, skip over it and keep writing. You can always go back to it. Do you want to say something humorous? Touching? Thought-provoking? Any of these beginnings are acceptable. You want, however, to draw in the audience; whatever it is, it should be powerful. Here are some different ways to open your eulogy:


Quotes can be a humorous, inspirational, spiritual, or a religious way to kick start your eulogy. The quote can be from someone famous, your loved one, a friend, the Bible, or any other book. Remember that such quotes can be used anywhere throughout the eulogy.


“Johann W. von Goethe once said, ‘A useless life is an early death.’' Luckily for Jennifer, this never applied to her extraordinary existence.”
“I remember when Bill used to say, ‘God sure has a since of humor, because if he didn’t, I wouldn’t have married your mother.’ I used to chuckle every time he poked fun at his wonderful marriage. Bill and Molly were definitely soul mates.”


Questions. Begin the eulogy with a question, and give the answer.

""My father once asked me, ‘Michael, what do you think you will wish for on your deathbed?’ I looked at him blankly. He replied, ‘I can tell you what I won’t say. God, I wish I had worked more, or made more money. I will say, I wish I had more time to spend with my family.’ That is what made Dad so great. His complete, unconditional love for his family.""


A poem. A poem is a great way to begin a eulogy. It can be one you created, or a favorite poem of your loved one.


""That we may mark with wonder and chaste dread. At hour of noon, when, with our limbs outspread lazily in the whispering grass, we lie to gaze out fully upon the windy sky-Far, far away, and kindly, friend with friend to talk the old, old talk that has no end, roaming-without a name-without a chart the unknown garden of another’s heart."" --C.S. Lewis


Continuing the eulogy: The body of the eulogy should follow the opening of your rough draft or outline as closely as possible. When you are done writing about one subject, move on to the next topic in your outline. The more detailed your outline, the faster your writing will occur. When you run out of thoughts within a topic, just move to the next topic and complete the others.

, Make them feel involved. Tell stories that make them laugh, or cry. You want them to remember the person they knew or loved.


Completing the eulogy: You want the ending to be a few sentences that ties what you have said together. You want your listeners to have a feeling that everything has been closed and tied neatly together. You can restate an important point or theme found throughout your eulogy, or you can summarize how your loved one touched your life. Doing so with a quote or a poem is an excellent way to do this.

, The chances of your first draft being perfect are slim. Correct any mistakes you might have, or change around your ideas and topics. Some further hints:


Write conversationally. Write as if it were a letter to an old friend. You don’t want it to sound mundane and boring. Don’t worry about sentence fragments or run-ons.
Change the name of the deceased around. Refrain from only using he, she, Mom, Dad, Kevin, or Sarah. Instead, use them interchangeably. Go from saying he was this, to Kevin was that, and so on. This really strengthens how a eulogy sounds, and holds the listeners' attention.
Be concise. Say everything that you want to say, but remember that keeping the attention of the audience is important. A great length is 3 to 5 minutes; depending on the speedy of your delivery, this is anywhere from 1 to 3 pages, single-spaced.

, The more you practice, the more confident you will become, and the more effective your eulogy will be. Practice anytime you can. Do it in front of the mirror and in front of people; the latter will also help any anxieties you might have over public speaking. Your confidence will allow you to speak naturally and more relaxed. You will begin to memorize your speech, which will again, give you the confidence to give great eye contact to your audience.

, This may be the most difficult aspect of the whole process. Remember, however, that everyone in attendance will be behind you 1,000 percent. Nobody will be disappointed if your eulogy does not have the profundity of the Sermon on the Mount, nor will they will not be judging your stage presence, nor critiquing your rhetorical skills. All those present will be very emotional. This includes you; it’s OK to pause during your eulogy. Try to keep calm, and take your time.

Single out the topics you’re knowledgeable about but also know you can be funny about. This might rule out topics that are hard to joke about, like poverty, domestic violence, etc.
Use this list (in combination with the next step) to select a potential topic.;
, Think about who you’ll speak.Of the list of things you wrote down in Step 1, what are the topics that would appeal to your audience? Some questions to consider:


What’s the general age of your audience?
What do your audience members have in common?
What kind of speech are they expecting to hear?
What kind of humor are they likely to appreciate?

, A humorously informative speech will still be primarily about conveying information to the audience while also making them laugh. A strictly humorous speech, on the other hand, will primarily aim to make the audience laugh -- whether or not it’s particularly informative isn’t the main concern.


If you’re writing a speech whose primary goal is to convey information or ideas, you’ll want to integrate humor while focussing on the ideas you want to convey. So draft the informative parts of your speech first, then integrate jokes and humor.
If you’re writing a speech whose primary goal is humor -- perhaps a satire or parody -- then you’ll want the humor center stage from the beginning. Choose a topic that lends itself to your sense of humor as well as to what the audience is likely to find amusing.

, Decide what main message you want to get across.Remember to choose a specific topic -- if your main idea/topic is too broad, you won’t do it justice in a relatively short speech. Choose something that you can describe in reasonable depth in the time allotted.
For example, if you’re writing a humorously informative speech about early American cinema, your main idea might be, “the advent of sound in film hurt rather than helped the medium by detracting from its visual potential”. This is specific enough not to be overwhelming while still leaving you room to develop substantial supporting points.
If, on the other hand, you’re writing a satirical speech, say, about reality television, your main idea might be, “nothing has contributed more to the cultural and intellectual richness of American society than reality television”.

, Use your favorite brainstorming technique to come up with potential significant points you can discuss to support your main idea.Write down your main idea.
Below it, write out everything that comes to mind when you think about that idea. Use whatever visual or textual brainstorming method you prefer (eg, clustering, listing, freewriting, etc.).
Eliminate anything that’s too far away from the topic, that you don’t feel comfortable discussing, or that would require too much time and depth to cover.
Select your strongest points and decide which ones to include.

, Flesh out how you’re going to talk about your main points to support your “big idea.”A commonly used outline for speeches resembles the following:


I. Introduction (where you state your main topic and the points you’ll make)
II. Main point one
III. Main point two
IV. Main point three
V. Conclusion (in which you sum up the main points, re-state your main idea, and issue a call to action from the audience, if appropriate)

, Because you’re writing a humorous speech, this is an ideal time to work in a bit of humor.


Effective hooks include humorous personal anecdotes, surprising or entertaining examples, or direct questions to the audience that invite their participation and give them a chance to laugh at themselves.For example, if you’re writing a speech about studying abroad, you might start by asking if anyone has ever wished they had an accent or intentionally faked one. You can then suggest they do it right and live somewhere they’ll actually have a legitimate accent.

, We only absorb some 25 percent of what we learn by hearing it. Because your audience will hear rather than read your speech, be sure your diction is clear and your language simple and direct.


Err on the side of clarity over style, subtlety or artistry. Unlike a written piece, a speech is as much about delivery as it is about content, and the audience will be less attuned to the intricacies of sentence construction and more attuned to your overall message and the expressions as you give it.
Avoid overly long and complicated sentences. Long and difficult sentences will be hard to follow. Simplify your point and/or break complicated sentences into smaller, more easily digested ideas.

, Clear and direct sentence structure is enhanced by your choice of descriptive words which should be as vivid as possible. The more apt and descriptive a word, the fewer needed to communicate the same idea.For example, a word like “incendiary” is both more vivid, specific, and aurally interesting than a word such as “controversial”. “Incendiary” communicates the idea of something explosively provocative, while “controversial” is a more general term for something that generates disagreement.

, This part is important -- but it can also be tricky if you aren’t careful.


Consider generational differences with humor -- use references and jokes that address topical issues for that age group. For example, if you’re writing a speech about volunteering to an audience of high school students, relate the information in your speech to specific things and events relevant to teenagers. You might make a joke about volunteering versus staying home and trying to be Jimi Hendrix on Guitar Hero. Or you might pick a guitarist more recent than Jimi!
Know what the audience members have in common. Use it when writing jokes oriented around those shared elements, which are more likely to hold the audience’s attention. Doing so is invariably a crowd-pleaser. For example, if you’re addressing teachers, you might make a humorous reference to students’ most bizarre homework excuses.
Situational and observational humor that’s tailored to its audience is often particularly effective., It’s much easier to write with humor when you’re in a humorous mood, so before sitting down to write something funny, get inspired by the things you find amusing.Watch your favorite funny movie, television show, or comedian.
Read works by your favorite humorous writers.
Don’t hesitate to take cues from their delivery -- learn from what they do to make a joke successful. (But don’t plagiarize!)
Pay attention when you make people around you laugh. Note the things you do or say that make people laugh and how you do it.
If, for example, your friends can’t stop laughing when you humorously re-enact stressful situations or conversations, try to incorporate similar elements into your speech.

, Don’t go for cheap laughs at the expense of particular people or groups.


Targeting particular people or groups is not only inconsiderate, it can alienate members of your audience.
Avoid jokes that are made at the expense of one side or another in a contentious issue, like jokes about one side of a political or religious debate.
Don’t make jokes about experiences you don’t understand. A good general rule is to write what you know. So if you, for example, have a learning disability, you might make a joke about the difficulties of dealing with standardized tests. But if you don’t have a learning disability, don’t make jokes about those who do -- you don’t share their specific experience, so you may unintentionally be making jokes about sensitive, potentially even hurtful, issues.Also take the taste level of your audience into consideration when deciding if a joke is going to be offensive. If you’re giving a speech to a room of educated adults, you’ll probably want to avoid overly bawdy or sexual humor.

, Don’t just drop a joke into your speech for the sake of having a joke to tell. If it isn’t clearly connected and relevant to your speech, it will only confuse the audience and likely fall flat.


The more relevant your jokes are to the specific matter at hand, the more likely they are to be successful with and entertaining.

, Audiences tend to respond well to speakers who are gently self-deprecating -- it allows them the chance to feel more comfortable with you and with the idea of laughing with you.But don’t go to extremes of self-loathing, as that will have the opposite effect. The audience won’t know whether to laugh or what you’re trying to accomplish.

, Don’t lose sight of the ultimate purpose or main idea.


Remember just what information it is you need to convey and ensure that it’s clear.
Don't let the humor become distracting. Humor can be a great tool for enhancing the information you’re conveying, as long as it doesn’t become a larger focus than the informative content itself., Getting your message across in just the way you want it, with just the right sense of humor is tricky -- and it will definitely take more than one draft. And realize that only if you’re very lucky will your first draft be funny. Generally, the really good stuff comes from revisions.Give yourself enough writing time so that you can go through and revise multiple times.
The more attentive you are to the details, the more successful your speech is likely to be.

, Before you’re scheduled to deliver your speech, be sure to practice the delivery.


Read the entire speech aloud until you’re comfortable enough with the material that you don’t need to read directly from your script but can simply use it as a prompt when needed.
Once you’re comfortable reading the text aloud, you can begin to fine-tune the humorous aspects of your delivery. Use friends or family as a practice audience so you can determine what works and what doesn’t.

, To avoid sounding overly rehearsed or robotic, practice varying your tone appropriately with the context and use expressive facial and body language.


If you watch comedians and humorists closely, you’ll find that they tend to lead in to their jokes in a particular, deliberate way. Specifically, they’ll use a combination of slower speech, significant pauses, and punctuated emphasis. So when you’re leading up to a joke, cue your audience by slowing down your delivery, pausing slightly before delivering the punchline, and emphasizing key words within the punchline.Emphasize important words, but not to the point that it becomes distracting. Practice how you would naturally speak the lines, paying attention to specific places where your tone rises, falls, or becomes more expressive. Keep those inflections in your speech and play them up enough to be animated, but stop short of being continually exaggerated, which will likely distract the audience from the content of the speech itself.
Watch and listen to speeches you admire. Pay attention to how the speaker manipulates their tone and pacing to enhance the speech and try to apply those same techniques to your own speech.

, Preferably video record yourself giving your speech, since doing so will allow you to observe and fine-tune both your vocal and physical presentation. But if you aren’t able to take video, an audio recording can also be helpful.


Watch or listen to the recording to find places where the speech lags or where your tone may be off. Make sure you aren’t speaking too quickly or too slowly and that you don’t fidget or say “um” too often.
It can be somewhat uncomfortable to watch or listen to yourself, but doing so will help improve your presentation enough to be worth the momentary discomfort.

, Because you’ll be at least some distance from the audience and they’ll be trying to take in visual and aural information simultaneously, use broad physical gestures that the audience can clearly see and understand.


Think of being somewhat theatrical, you want your gestures to be visible and distinct from a distance. Favor several broad gestures over a series of small ones., As stressful as it might be to write a speech and as nerve-wracking as it might be to have to speak to an audience, remember to have fun.


Allow yourself to feel nervous. Accept that you’re going to feel that way and decide not to worry about it.
The more confidently you act, the more confident you’ll eventually feel.
You have a chance to share your humor and ideas with an interested audience -- enjoy it!

You may also have knowledge about the theme that you can share in the keynote.If there is a theme of the event, you may use this as your purpose or inspiration for the speech. For example, if the theme of the event is “Social Responsibility,” the purpose of your speech may be to explore your experiences with social responsibility on a professional and personal level.;
, Ask yourself, “Who am I speaking to?” “Who is my speech meant for?” Think about the age range of the audience as well as their background and level of expertise. Tailor the speech to suit the audience.For example, if your audience is within an age range of 20-30 and are social responsibility advocates, you may make the speech light, engaging, and full of specialized language that you know your audience will understand.

, A good keynote speech will have at least one to two key points, or takeaways, that the audience can engage with. Write down one to three key points that expand on the main purpose of your speech. These could be one to three terms that you are going to discuss in detail, or one to three ideas.For example, if you are writing a speech around the theme of social responsibility, you may focus on three key points: the history of social responsibility, the current state of social responsibility, and where social responsibility is headed next.

, To get a better sense of the style, tone, and language of a keynote speech, read good examples online. You can look at a list of the top keynote speeches online or search for keynote speeches presented on popular public speaking sites, like TedTalks.


You can find the top keynote speeches of 2016 at https://www.bigspeak.com/best-keynote-speakers-of-2016.

, One of the best ways to grab your audience’s attention is to tell a short, engaging story. Pull a story from your own experiences in the field. Look at current events for a story that relates to the purpose of your speech. Try to tell the story in bullet points, highlighting the key moments in a few sentences.For example, if you are writing a keynote speech on diversity in the classroom, you may tell a story about a student of color that you worked with in your classroom as a teacher.
You may also look in the news for a story about a student of color who publicly spoke out about difficulties with diversity in the classroom, preferably a news story based in your area or country.

, Another option is to start with a fact you find interesting or engaging. Pick a fact that may not be known by a lot of people, or by the majority of your audience. You may use a fact from your own research or look for facts from trusted sources that relate to the purpose of your speech.For example, if the purpose of your speech is to discuss social responsibility in the corporate world, you may open with a fact about how consumers tend to buy more if a brand is socially responsible.

, In the beginning of your speech, you should also state the purpose clearly and concisely. You may state the purpose right after your opening story or fact. State the purpose by saying, “I am here today to talk to you about…” or “Today, I am going to be sharing…”.For example, your purpose may appear as, “I am here today to talk to you about social responsibility, the theme of this conference and the theme of much of my professional work.”

, Humor can be a great tool in a keynote speech. Being funny can help to engage the audience and make your speech more memorable. Try to adopt a joking, light tone throughout the speech. Have a balance of funny asides and serious moments.For example, you may make a funny aside that is self-deprecating, such as, “I wasn’t always a great teacher. Sometimes, I was known as the fun teacher or the angry teacher. Not always the great one.”

, Repetition can be a great way to reinforce your ideas and remind the audience of the key points in your speech. Return to several key terms in your speech so the audience stays engaged. Bring up a point made earlier in the speech so the audience is reminded of the purpose of your speech.For example, you may highlight terms like “unity,” “engagement,” and “social consciousness” in your speech by returning to them at least twice. You may begin the speech by mentioning these terms and then return to them again later in the speech.

, Don’t try to put on a professional or formal tone, especially if it makes you feel awkward or uncomfortable. Try to express yourself like you would to a colleague or a friend. Use language that you use everyday and try to infuse the speech with your natural voice. You will come off more convincing and engaging this way.For example, you may use a funny saying that you use with your students in your classroom in the speech. Or you may use less formal words and terms to keep the tone of the speech conversational.

, End the speech by compelling the audience to take some kind of action. The action could be to think about an idea they may not have considered before or to engage more with certain members of their community. Wrapping up with a call to action will give the audience a clear takeaway.


For example, you may have a call to action that refers to the story or fact you used at the beginning of your speech: “Just like my student who reached out to a peer in need, I ask you all now to be vulnerable, to try to reach out to someone in your community who needs help.”

, Once you have a draft of the speech completed, take the time to read the speech aloud to yourself and to others. Listen to how the speech flows. Notice if there are any awkward sentences or sections. Adjust them so the speech sounds natural and polished.When you read the speech aloud, notice if you skip over any words. You may be able to remove any words you skip over for flow.
If you read the speech aloud to others, you can ask them for feedback. Ask them if they found any parts of the speech boring or hard to follow. Be open to getting constructive feedback on the speech so it is at its best.

, Make sure the spelling, grammar, and punctuation in the speech is correct. Try reading the speech backwards to confirm each word is spelled correctly. Circle all the punctuation and confirm it is correct.Correct punctuation is especially important if you are going to read the speech aloud to an audience, as the punctuation will tell you when to pause or take a breath. Often, a comma means pausing in your speech and a period means taking a short breath.

, You should also look over the speech to make sure each section is clear and easy to follow. Often, shorter is better so if there are any wordy or overly long sections, try to make them shorter. Look for any words or terms you do not need.If there is a time constraint for the speech, you should also time yourself reading the speech to confirm it is within the limit.

You don't want to sound too stuffy or like someone who is nothing like you. At the end of the day, what's most important is that you say some heartfelt words and stay true to yourself.


For example, most best man speeches have a bit of humor in them for levity and to get the crowd going. But if this really isn't for you and making jokes just feels too forced, you don't have to follow that convention.
On the other hand, if you're known for your humor and sarcasm, you don't have to force yourself to be overly sentimental. Just a few words of honest sentiment would get the message across without making you feel like you're faking it.
If public speaking is not for you, don't be nervous about it. You can even make a joke about how much you love public speaking, or about how this is the groom's way of punishing you/getting you back for that time you made him push your car up a hill.

, You don't want to just say ""Cheers"" or deliver a one-liner, but you also don't want to ramble on and on; this day is not about you. Your speech should be long enough to say what you want to say and no longer. As a rule of thumb, try to keep the toast between 2 and 4 minutes; most people won’t have patience for anything over 5 minutes. The groom and bride may even have an idea of how long they want speeches to be, so don't be afraid of asking them.


Though your speech should be well prepared in advance, take a look at the crowd; if people are particularly restless or eager to drink and dance, then you may want to cut out that second anecdote you weren't sure about.
Though it's typical for the best man and maid of honor to give a speech, there may be other speeches given out there. The father of the bride sometimes speaks, and there may be two maids of honor and thus, two speeches. And maybe even drunk Uncle Bertie will try to say a few words. If there are a number of speeches, then it's especially important to keep it short so the crowd doesn't spend all night listening to people talk.

, The sooner you get it written, the more time you'll have to practice and perfect it, which will boost your confidence when you have to get up in front of everybody. Don't think that you'll just gather some liquid courage and start spouting things off about the newly married couple. In fact, this is one of the worst ideas you can have, because you may end up saying something you deeply regret or may just completely lose your train of thought. It's important to be well-prepared in advance so your big speech goes off without a hitch.


Don't be embarrassed about keeping a written version of your speech with you when you go up there during your big moment. Even if you don't use it as a reference, just having it there can make you feel more confident about not making any mistakes.

, If you're really struggling, there's no shame in going on YouTube and checking out the thousands of great best men speeches that people have videotaped and posted there. You may get an idea that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise when you sit down to write your speech. You can also search for written versions of speeches on-line, or even ask friends or family members who had given those speeches if they can give you a copy of what they'd written or even give you some words of advice.

, Though each wedding is different, the best man typically gives his speech some time during dinner, when the guests are seated and hopefully are able to give their attention to the speaker. This means that a few hours can go by between the end of the wedding ceremony and your speech. There may be a cocktail hour as well as a fair amount of time that goes by before you are called to the microphone. This means that you may have to show some self restraint and not drink too much, or you will risk embarrassing yourself. Once you give your speech, you can let loose a bit, if you like!Remember that people often videotape best man's speeches. You don't want yourself looking sloppy on camera for all of eternity.

, You may face a rowdy crowd and may have to hit the tines of your fork against your wine glass a few times, or to wait for people to settle down before you begin your speech. Since the first thing you'll do is introduce yourself, it's important that people are listening so that they know who the heck you are and how you're connected to the groom. Just say something simple like, ""Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like a moment of your time.""


Depending on how the reception goes, someone else may introduce you and you won't have to do this part. But be prepared in advance in case you're given the microphone and find that your audience isn't exactly rapt.

, The first thing you should do is to tell the audience who you are. Though many of them will probably notice that you're the best man by now, after the wedding ceremony, it's still important to say who you are and how you know the groom and bride. It's likely that not everybody present will know you, so you should say who you are, how you met the bride and groom, and how long you've known them. Even if you haven't memorized your speech, try to memorize the opening lines so you can begin sincerely. Here are some easy ways to introduce yourself:


""For those of you who don't know me, I'm Brian, 's little brother.""
""I'm Jake, 's best friend. I've known him since the seventh grade, and I've known ever since their second date.""
""I'm Danny, 's best friend. I've known and ever since our freshman year of college. We all lived in the same hall.""

, While it's traditional to thank the people paying for the wedding, usually the bride's parents, be subtle. Don't thank them for ""paying for"" the celebration, but rather, for helping to make it possible. You can say something about how beautiful the wedding and wedding venue are, and what an amazing time everyone is having. This is a way of thanking the bride's family for making it possible without being too obvious about it. Just keep in mind that, with the changing culture, often the bride and groom's family split the cost of the wedding, so don't short-change anyone who helped make it possible.


It's also nice to thank the guests for being there. You can also thank the bridal party.
Optionally, you can also thank the bridesmaids. Mention what great friends they have been for the bride and tell them how lovely they look. You can play this for laughs a bit as long as you don't come off sounding like a total creep. You can say something about the lovely color of the dresses, how big of a help they've been during the wedding, and whatever else you can say that is quick and tasteful.

, A good best man usually shares a joke involving the groom, giving everyone a peek at the groom’s personality. If you want to throw in a classy but funny quote, consider Oscar Wilde’s ""Marriage is the triumph of imagination over intelligence."" You shouldn't be offensive, but you can make a joke about how shy/outgoing/perfection-oriented the groom is. It's best if it's a trait that most people can recognize about the groom so people don't feel like you're making an inside joke.Remember that half of the people in the room may not know each other. People should be able to find your speech funny and moving without knowing the groom or hearing an excessive amount of detail about someone they don't know. Of course, if it's a more intimate wedding and it seems like most people do know each other, then you can go into a bit more detail, if you like.
If you're the groom's brother, you can joke around about how he used to tease you mercilessly when you were little, or how you used to give him a hard time. You can also make a joke about how not much has changed in that regard.
Remember to keep up a nice emotional balance. You should have as many sweet and heartfelt comments about the groom as jokes., The main part of your speech should be a brief story about the groom and, possibly, the bride. While the goal of the story is to give your speech a more personal touch, avoid dredging up unpleasant details from the past. The story should be able to show why the couple is meant for each other, or why the groom's personality is perfect for being with the bride. Here are some ways to go about it:Tell a funny story. This will not only break up the formality of the ceremony, but also help endear the couple to the audience. A great way to grab everyone’s attention would be to introduce it by saying “I'm about to let you in on a secret about the groom"" or ""the groom begged me not to include this story in my speech but I simply had to.""
Alternatively, tell a touching story. A particularly appropriate story might describe how the bride and groom met or something sweet that helped move their relationship forward. Since you are the groom’s best friend, this might be a good place to describe how you watched him fall head-over-heels for the bride.
If you can't think of any appropriate stories or don't know the bride well enough to include her in one, make some observations about love or marriage in general, or about the groom's feelings for the bride. Even if you haven't spent a lot of time with the bride, you can make observations about the first time the groom told you about the bride, or what the groom said about their first date.

, Though you may think it's funny to make fun of the groom's annoying ex-girlfriend or to talk about that time he spent a night in jail for public drunkenness, the groom, his bride, and their families will definitely not think this is funny. Your jokes should be harmless and tasteful and should only be slightly edgy if you're one hundred percent convinced that everyone in the audience, happy couple included, would truly appreciate them.


Though you want to choose a humorous anecdote, make sure it is appropriate for everyone; the last thing you want is to come across as humiliating or mean-spirited.
If you mention that time when the groom and bride broke off their engagement for three weeks or talk about how much more fun your best friend used to be before he got with his ""ball and chain,"" then his wife may never forgive you. You don't want to sever your relationship, or put it in question, over something like saying a few thoughtless words in a speech.
Don't make it a speech about how you first really didn't like your buddy's wife and then came around, either.
And lastly, do not think it's funny to insult the venue or the food. Someone shelled out a lot of hard-earned cash for what you might think are tacky Christmas lights or rubbery chicken.

, For example, talk about his loyalty, his compassion, or the fact that you know how much he loves the bride and that he’ll make a great husband. In a way, you can think of yourself as a salesman selling the groom to members of the bride's family, who may not know him as well as you do. Let them know how much he means to you, how he's helped you out in the past, or how you couldn't have gotten through a difficult period of your life without him.


You can talk about something the groom did for you. Say something like, ""I'll never forget the time Mark helped me move across the country to follow my dream. I couldn't have done it without him.""
It's completely normal to find this part a little embarrassing. Just remember that this is your buddy's day, and no one's going to laugh at you for getting a little sappy.

, You don't want to give the impression that you don't know why this wonderful guy is marrying her. In fact, you can even talk about how much more outgoing/happier/calmer/more laid back the groom has become since meeting his bride. You can say something like, ""After Jeff met Mary, his tendency to over-analyze and worry about everything began to disappear...""If you don't know the bride very well, that's okay. Instead of saying that bluntly, you can say something like, ""Though I haven't spent as much time with Mary as I would have liked, I could tell right away that she was right for Jeff.""

, This can add a nice touch to the end of the speech, especially if you've spent a lot of it poking fun at the groom. There are a number of ways of complimenting their relationship, from talking about how compatible they are, how they work together as a team, how they really balance each other out, or how you can tell just by looking at them that they are completely in love.


Say something like, ""Even when Mary and Jeff are on the opposite side of a room, you can feel them looking out for each other. They don't have to be glued together to have such a strong, incredible bond.""
You can also make a comment about how much you admire their relationship and have always looked for a love as strong as theirs (if you're single). If you're married, you can share some thoughts on marriage and why the groom and bride are a great match.
You don't have to overdo it and say they are a perfect pair, meant for each other, soul mates, or the like, if you don't really feel that way. You can mention the strengths of their relationship without making it sound too forced.

, Though you don't have to use a quote, they can serve as nice bookends between talking about the groom and bride and proposing a toast. You can search for inspiration on-line or use a commonly loved quote about marriage, such as the words, “Marriage is not about finding a person you can live with, it’s about finding the person you can’t live without.” You can even relate the quote to the bride and groom, if it's possible.


Don't force yourself to do this unless you find one that's really fitting. There's another one that goes, ""Marriage isn't about looking at each other. It's about looking outward in the same direction.""

, Wishing the couple the best in their lives together is the most important part of the speech. This should wrap up your speech and bringing everyone together. Raise your glass of champagne and will the other guests to toast to the happy couple. You should ask the guests kindly to join you in raising their glasses, and to wish the best for the newlywed couples.


You can say something like, ""Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to propose a toast to Mary and Jeff. May they have years of joy, happiness, and health ahead of them.""
You can also say something like, ""Here's to a lifetime of happiness for Mary and Jeff.""
If the bride took the groom's last name, you can propose the toast to ""Mr. and Mrs. Thompson.""

,How to Write a Eulogy1,
"
Pick a specific topic.,
Consider who your audience is.,
Make sure there’s adequate information available.,
Consider if your topic will work for a speech.,
Create an outline for your speech.,
Craft the body of the speech.,
Write a conclusion.,
Write an introduction.,
Decide what kinds of visual aids are important.,
Practice performing the speech alone.,
Make any adjustments that the speech needs.,
Give the speech to a few friends.,
Ask for feedback.,
Adjust your speech based on the feedback.",How to Write a Demonstrative Speech," It’s important to choose a topic that is not too broad or narrow. When choosing a topic, think about how long you will have to present the speech. This should determine how narrow your focus is.For example, to give a speech about how to perform general car maintenance, you might need an hour for your presentation. That’s because it’s a broad topic. If you only have 15 minutes, you should narrow your speech to something like how to change a car’s oil.
If you don’t have control over the length of time or the topic, you’ll need to adjust your speech accordingly. If you have too much information for a short amount of time, don’t go into much detail. If you have a long time for a simple topic, you can expand your speech with some history or related facts.;
, When giving a speech, your audience should influence the way you choose your topic. Think about what kinds of things will interest them.For example, if you’re giving a speech to professional bakers, it might not be appropriate to choose the topic, “How to Bake a Cake.” You’d probably want to make your topic more interesting to them with something like, “How to Bake Authentic French Style Pastries.”
The age of your audience matters, too. For example, if your audience is young children, you might choose the topic, “How to Take Care of a Plant” instead of, “How to Grow Perennials.”

, Do you already know enough to write the speech? If so, that’s great. If not, make sure there is information available to you. If you can’t find reliable sources, you may need to pick another topic.Look up your topic online. Other people may have made instructional videos that you can get tips from.
If you know any experts on your topic, ask them for advice.
Visit your local library and checkout books on your topic. Books are excellent sources of information, and are considered reliable sources when doing research.

, Not everything makes an ideal topic for a speech. Your topic should be something that you can reasonably explain in the context of a classroom or lecture hall.You should be able to use useful visual aids via a PowerPoint presentation or manageable props and examples. So a topic like, “How to replace your car’s transmission” is probably not a great topic. However, something like, “How to make a spinach salad” would be easy to do.

, An outline is a way to organize the information that you want to convey. The outline should mirror the order of steps that you will use in your speech.The outline should contain three sections: the introduction, the body, and the conclusion.
The body should be broken up into the various steps of the process.

, The body of the speech contains the actual steps of the process. Break the process down into manageable steps that can be explained one at a time. Try to put yourself in the audience’s shoes to imagine what information they might need.When writing a speech, you want to simply write notes. You don’t need to write out the speech word for word. Write enough to make you comfortable with the material, but not so much that you’ll be reading off of your paper.Try to remember what it was like when you learned how to do this thing. What steps required more explanation than others?
Consider which steps need to be broken down into smaller steps. For example, it might not be enough to say, “Remove the saw blade.” You might need to break that step up, so that you have smaller steps such as:

Unplug the saw.
Locate the screw under the blade.
Turn the screw enough to loosen the blade.
Remove the blade.


To keep the audience engaged, think of how you can involve them. Will you include audience participation? Will the demonstration be hands-on? Will you tell jokes or ask the audience questions? These can all be great strategies for keeping people engaged.

, Your conclusion sums up the process and why it’s valuable. It’s also good to include a “call to action” in your conclusion. This means something that inspires the audience to go home and try this themselves.Your call to action could be something like, “By learning to change your own motor oil, you’ll be able to save money and feel the empowerment of taking care of your own car!” or, “French style pastries are a welcome addition to any gathering, as you’ll see when you bring them to your next party.”
Avoid introducing new information in the conclusion. That will leave the audience confused and with unanswered questions.

, Now that you’ve written most of your speech, you can go back and write the introduction. The introduction should get people excited about your topic and tell them what they can expect to learn.Writing the introduction last is a good idea, because then you’ll have already thought hard about your speech. By now, you know everything you want to say about the speech, so you can determine what is most essential to get people excited about it.
To get people excited, use inspiring language such as, “You may have never thought you’d be able to change a flat tire yourself, but actually, it’s remarkably simple!” or, “French pastries are one of the treasures of European cuisine.”
Engaging introductions might include a joke, a funny story from your life, or an amazing fact. For example, you might say something like, ""How many people in this room does it take to change a lightbulb? I don't know, but I do know that after this speech, it'll only take one to change a tire,"" or, ""My grandmother actually won my grandfather's heart by baking him croissants that were tastier than his own French mother's!""
Even though you write the introduction last, it is always the beginning of the speech.

, Look back over your speech. What kinds of visual aids will you need? Will you need props? Do you plan to simply use a PowerPoint presentation? Add this information to your outline, so that you know when each visual aid will be used during the speech.Take note of anything you’ll want to add to the speech to explain the visual aids. For example, do you want to say something like, “I’m using unbleached white flour, but you can also used bleached flour if you prefer.”

, You might think that the process of writing the speech is over once it’s written. However, until you’ve practiced saying the speech out loud, you can’t be sure if it will work.Review your notes as you would before giving the speech in front of people.
Try performing the speech in front of a mirror. You should be able to look yourself in the eye much of the time, instead of always having to look at your notes.
Go through the complete demonstration, along with your visual aids. If you don’t, you might not realize that parts of the demonstration don’t work as you’ve written them.

, When giving the speech to yourself, did you realize you forgot a step? Did the entire thing roll of your tongue smoothly? If there were problems you noticed, make the changes in your writing.Once you’ve made the changes, practice and try performing the speech for yourself again.
Always use the visual aids, even if you’ve already used them once.

, Now that you’ve done the speech for yourself, invite a small group of friends to be your test audience. This is a good way to see if there’s anything you may have missed when you were practicing.You may want to invite some friends who know nothing about the topic and some who are experts in the topic. That way, you can get different perspectives on how useful your speech was.

, It may be scary to ask for feedback, but it’s the only way you’ll be able to make your speech better. Ask questions about the visual aids, as well. Make sure that they worked with your speech in a productive way.Ask specific questions of your test audience. You can ask them if they understood the different steps, or if there was anything they felt you missed.
You may want to write down the feedback you get, or ask your friends to write it down so you can look at it later.

, On your own, spend some time making the necessary adjustments to your written speech. Practice these changes in front of a mirror, or in front of a small test audience if you need to.You don’t always need to incorporate others’ feedback. Sometimes it won’t be useful or accurate. However, if you got the same feedback from more than one person, chances are that it would be worthwhile to consider.

"
Decide on the tone.,
Consider the audience.,
Briefly introduce yourself.,
State the basic information about the deceased.,
Use specific examples to describe the deceased.,
Be concise and well-organized.,
Get feedback.",How to Write a Eulogy2," How serious or lighthearted do you want the eulogy to be? A good eulogy need not be uniformly somber, just appropriate. Some eulogy-writers take a serious approach, others are bold enough to add humor. Used cautiously, humor can help convey the personality of the deceased and illustrate some of his or her endearing qualities.


The tone can also be partially determined by the way the deceased passed away. If you're giving a eulogy about a teenager who met an untimely death, then your tone would be more serious than it would if you were giving a eulogy about a grandparent who happily lived to see his ninetieth birthday.

, Write the eulogy with the deceased's family and loved ones in mind. Dwell on the positive, but be honest. If the person was difficult or inordinately negative, avoid talking about that or allude to it gently, as in ""He had his demons, which were a constant battle."" Make sure you don't say anything that would offend, shock, or confuse the audience.


For example, don't make any jokes or comments about the deceased that would be a mystery to the majority of the crowd.

, Even if most people in the audience know you, just state your name and give a few words that describe your relationship to the deceased. If it's a really small crowd, you can start with, ""For anybody who doesn't know me..."" or something that shows that while most people do know you, it's still important to introduce yourself. If you're related to the deceased, describe how; if not, say a few words about how and when you met.

, Though your eulogy doesn't have to read like an obituary or give all of the basic information about the life of the deceased, you should touch on a few key points, such as what his family life was like, what his career achievements were, and what hobbies and interests mattered the most to him. You can find a way of mentioning this information while praising or remembering the deceased.


Write down the names of the family members especially closed to the deceased. You may forget their names on the big day because you're overwhelmed by sadness, so it's advisable to have them on hand.
Make sure you say something specific about the family life of the deceased -- this would be very important to his family.

, Avoid reciting a list of qualities that the person possesses. Instead, mention a quality and then illustrate it with a story. It is the stories that bring the person--and that quality--to life. Talk to as many people as you can to get their impressions, memories, and thoughts about the deceased, and then write down as many memories of your own as you can. Look for a common theme that unites your ideas, and try to illustrate this theme through specific examples.


If the deceased is remembered for being kind, talk about the time he helped a homeless man get back on his feet.
If the deceased is known for being a prankster, mention his famous April Fool's prank.
Pretend that a stranger is listening to your eulogy. Would he get a good sense of the person you're describing without ever meeting him just from your words?

, Outline the eulogy before you start writing. Brainstorm all the possible areas (personality traits, interests, biographical info) to talk about and write them down. When you're ready to write, cover each area in a logical order. Give the eulogy a beginning, middle, and end. Avoid rambling or, conversely, speaking down to people. You may have a sterling vocabulary, but dumb it down for the masses just this once.


The average eulogy is about 3-5 minutes long. That should be enough for you to give a meaningful speech about the deceased. Remember that less is more; you don't want to try the patience of the audience during such a sad occasion.

, Once you're written the eulogy and feel fairly confident in what you've written, have some close friends or family members who know the deceased well read it to make sure that it's not only accurate, but that it does well with capturing the essence of the deceased. They'll also be able to see if you've said anything inappropriate, forgotten something important, or wrote anything that was confusing or difficult to understand.You can also ask your friends or family members to edit your eulogy. Though it doesn't need to have perfect grammar since no one else will be reading it, your friends or family members can help you add smoother transitions or remove repetitive phrasing.

"
"
Rehearse the eulogy before the big day.,
Have a standby.,
Relax.,
Use a conversational tone.",How to Write a Eulogy3," Read the draft of your eulogy aloud. If you have time and the inclination, read it to someone as practice. Words sound differently when read aloud than on paper. If you have inserted humor, get feedback from someone about its appropriateness and effectiveness. Remember, writing is 90% rewriting, so expect to revise your work several times before it shines.


Rehearsing the eulogy will also help you learn to control your emotions and not get choked up over the speech.
Try memorizing as much of the speech as you can, or even just reading from notes. Though you should have something to fall back on if you forgot what you were going to say, your words will sound more heartfelt if you're not reading every sentence right off the page.

, Though you should hope that you're emotionally prepared to give the speech on the big day, you should have a close friend or family member who has read the eulogy be prepared to read it for you in case you're too choked up to read it. Though you probably won't need one, you'll feel more relaxed just knowing that you have a backup if you need one.

, Before you speak, calm yourself by realizing everyone in attendance is there to support you. It may help to have a glass of water with you on the podium to help you maintain your composure. Just know that everyone will appreciate your efforts and admire you for having written and given a eulogy. You can't fail.


Tell yourself you're not there to win a speech-giving contest or to impress anyone. You're there to convey your heartfelt feelings about the deceased and that's it.

, Talk or read your eulogy to the audience as if you are talking to friends. Make eye contact. Pause. Go slowly if you want. Connect with your audience and share the moment with them; after all, you're not an entertainer, you're one of them. There's no need to be formal when you're surrounded by loved ones who share your grief.


Remember to sound like yourself, not some formal version of yourself. You can use a conversational tone as long as you don't use inappropriate language or too much slang that might confuse the older members of the audience.

Don't insult or offend anyone.",How to Make a Good Speech for School," Most of your speech should explore one topic, or several related topics that follow a theme. What this theme is depends on the nature of the speech. Graduation speeches often have a theme about memories or the future, school election speeches convince people you'll make good decisions if elected, and class assignment speeches usually argue a controversial point.


If you're not sure which theme to choose, write down or summarize a few stories and statements you could include in your speech. Pick the ones you like best and see if there's a unifying theme to tie them together.
See What to Do and What Not to Do for more advice on themes.

, If you enjoy making people laugh, write a funny speech. If you are a serious person, create moments that will cause reflection. Remember to end on an inspirational and uplifting note, especially for commencement speeches.

, Avoid long, meandering sentences and overcomplicated arguments. Unlike when writing an essay, you'll have difficulty explaining technical terms or referring back to your earlier points. Keep each sentence easy to follow. If younger kids will be present, make sure to use words and concepts they can understand.


Don't interrupt one point with a clause, or section set aside by commas or parentheses. Instead of saying ""Our tennis and basketball teams, which we all know won the regional championships two years ago, need increased funding to compete,"" say ""Our tennis and basketball teams both won the regional championships two years ago. Now we need to increase their funding to compete with other schools.""
You can reference your school's slang once or twice to get a laugh, but don't overdo it, especially if there are parents in the audience.

, You can write a whole rough draft, or come up with several separate stories and inspirational statements that fit your theme. Stick to your own ideas and specific detail. People will enjoy and remember original and detailed sentiments more than generic phrases such as ""I will make our school proud"" or ""Our class will go on to do great things.""


Find a broad message that your whole audience can connect to their own life, but still deals with a specific idea. For instance: ""Become an even better version of the hero who inspired you."" (But don't steal your ""original"" idea from this website!)
Your stories can be specific incidents in your life or from history, but you should connect them to a more general idea. For instance, you could tell a story about your sibling's hospital visit, then go on to talk about overcoming fear and hardship in general.
If you like what you're writing but it doesn't fit the theme you had planned, it's fine to adjust your topic or switch it entirely. Switch back and forth between writing stories and brainstorming a theme if you keep getting stuck.

, Pick an engaging and on-theme story to lead with, one that will grab your audience's attention and prepare it for the overall tone and message. Pay extra attention to the first sentence:Surprise your audience by diving right into a tough story. ""When I was ten years old, I lost my father.""
Make your audience laugh by telling a joke, especially one that everyone in the room will get. ""Hello everyone. Let's have a round of applause for the guy who installed air conditioning.""
Start with a grand, thought-provoking statement. ""Our galaxy contains billions of earth-like planets, and we're only just beginning to discover them.""
Most likely, someone else will introduce you, and many of your classmates know you already. Unless you're asked specifically to introduce yourself, you can get right to the good stuff.

, Your audience should know what your overarching theme is before you've finished your first few sentences. State exactly what you're talking about or at least suggest it strongly right at the beginning.


To use an example from earlier, if your theme is ""Become an even better version of the hero who inspired you,"" you could begin your speech with two or three sentence about your hero, then say ""You all have heroes who inspire you, but you don't have to just follow them. You can become even greater than the people you look up to.""

, Don't jump straight from a joke to a story about surviving a car crash. Think about what the audience is feeling and expecting after each section. It's good to surprise them, but do it with your ideas, not by confusing them with a completely different topic.


Include phrases such as ""Now I'd like to talk about..."" and ""But we should also remember..."" when moving on to your next idea., A good joke or an idea that makes people think are two good ways to end a speech, depending on the overall mood. If you're arguing a point, summarize it briefly and end by restating your position firmly.


Build up to a big ending, then crack a joke to wrap up a funny speech. ""And I know when you walk to the ballot box tomorrow, you'll be ready to do the right thing. Protect the interests of yourself and your school by washing your hands afterward. Do you know how many people touch that thing?""
If you're giving a commencement speech, leave people feeling excited or awed about the future. This is a big moment and you have the power to help them realize it. ""Years from now, you will be the father or mother your kid looks up to. The writer who changes the way we think. The inventor who creates new ways to live. Come up to the stage and start becoming heroes!""

, Congratulations, you've finished your first draft. Wait, the work isn't over yet! To write a good speech, you will need to work on it, think about it, and maybe even rewrite the whole thing.


Have a teacher, family member, or trusted friend check it over for grammar mistakes and offer feedback. Spelling isn't as important, since you'll be speaking out loud.

, Bringing in maps, pictures, or other materials is most practical and useful for speeches given as class assignments, since you'll have something to write on and don't need to transport your materials outside the classroom. You won't need anything like this for a graduation speech.


If your topic involves a lot of numbers, plan to write them on the board so your audience can remember them., No one wants to listen to you read an essay out loud. You'll need to become familiar enough with what you wrote to deliver it confidently while looking at your audience. It is a good idea to write down notes on small index cards to jog your memory.


Your notes are there to remind you what to say next and of important facts. ""Move on to bear wrestling story (guy's name is Paul Bunyan)"" is the level of detail you need.

, Will you be standing or sitting? Do you have room to move around a little, or will you stand in place? Where will you keep your note cards, visual aids, or other materials? What will you do with them once you're done?Practice giving your speech in as situation as similar to your actual speech as possible.
In general, you should stay fairly still while giving a speech. Small hand gestures and occasionally moving to a new spot are fine, especially if they help you feel and appear confident., If you're going to speak to a roomful of people or more, learn to project your voice, not mumble or scream. Stand with your legs shoulder width apart and your back straight. Try to speak using your diaphragm, pushing the air out from low in your chest., Use the stance and techniques described above. If you have already memorized your speech, use your index cards. Otherwise, that's okay — just read it from the page.


If you speech is too long, you absolutely need to cut some material out of it or shorten the longer stories or ideas. If you're giving a commencement speech, aim for a 10 or 15 minute maximum. An election speech should be no more than a few minutes, and your teacher should be able to tell you the time limit for a class assignment speech.

, It's easy to rush when you're nervous. Pause at the end of each sentence. At the end of a section, before you move on to the next idea, make a longer pause and pretend you're looking across your audience making eye contact with a few people.


If you can't stop rushing, work out how long you should spend on each section and write the number of minutes at the top of each index card or paragraph. Practice near a clock so you can check whether you're on pace., Start by reading your speech out loud, then try to look down at the page less and less and make eye contact with your reflection instead. Eventually, you should be able to make your speech while only referring to notes written on index cards.


Use slightly different words each time once you have the main ideas down. Try not to get caught up on exact memorization; using a new phrase to communicate the written idea makes your speech sound more natural.

, Once you can remember each idea and connect them together smoothly, watch the mirror more closely and correct any issues you see.


Practice varying your facial expression if your face looks fixed and mechanical.Try to vary the tone of your voice as well. Don't make it sound like you're reciting every word from memory; pretend you're speaking in ordinary conversation.

, Gather together your family members or friends and ask them to listen to your practice. You'll probably feel nervous, but the practice will make you more confident for the actual speech.


Try to make eye contact with different members of your audience throughout the speech. Don't stare at any one person for too long.
Resist the temptation to hide by standing near a corner or large object.
Don't fidget, tap your foot, or make other nervous gestures. Try slowly walking back and forth across the stage to get rid of your nervous energy.

, The members of the audience may pick up on problems you didn't even consider, whether with the statements you make or your delivery style. Take their advice gracefully; they're doing you a favor by letting you know what you need to improve.

, Get to bed early the night before and eat full, comforting meals that won't upset your stomach. Take your mind off the event with other activities in the hours before the speech.


Dressing nicely will increase your confidence and gain respect and attention from your audience.

, You should spend a short amount of time covering your qualifications, but most of your speech should focus on what you plan to change or accomplish if you get elected. If you can, try to group these together into a memorable category or snappy message.

, Here are a few examples of common themes, although you should try your best to turn one of these into a more specific, original topic:Memories your class shares and personal memories that many people will connect to, such as your first day at the school.
Overcoming obstacles. Talk about how your classmates overcame problems related to academics, finances, and health, and how proud everyone is that they're standing here.
The diversity of your classmates and celebrating the rich variety of experiences, personalities, and interests at your school. Describe some of the many ways people will go on to do good in the world.

, You may not consider yourself a great writer, but there are some decisions you can make that will make any speech more engaging:Address your audience directly. Ask them questions to get them thinking, although you shouldn't expect an answer.
Use groups of three. The human brain loves repetition, and especially trios. Start three sentences with the same phrase, speaking louder each sentence.
Use emotive language. Try to provoke a strong emotional response in your audience, not present a list of facts to them.

, If it's relevant to your topic, you should thank your teachers, parents, or other influences on your life. But don't go into a lot of detail unless it's part of an engaging story; you could easily bore or confuse the audience.

, Including a quote from a popular movie or a reference to a famous event at your school will keep your audience excited, as long as you only use this technique a few times.



Don't tell stories that only a few friends will understand. Even references that your whole class will get should be used sparingly if there are parents in the room as well.

, The same old sayings crop up in every speech, especially graduation speeches. If you can keep them to a minimum, you'll stand out from the crowd. Here are a few phrases that are overused in graduation and election speeches:Go change the world!
Today is not the last day of your education, but the first.
The future belongs to you.
If elected, I will be the voice of the students.
It's time for change!

, A speech is not an opportunity to trash talk another student, even jokingly. Even in an election, you'll earn more respect by focusing on your own attributes than attacking your opponent.


If you're giving a high school commencement speech, remember that not everyone in your class will be attending college. Don't joke about your education letting you avoid a ""bad"" profession; chances are good there's a parent who has that job out in the audience."
"
Have an idea for your topic.,
Research it!,
Practice, practice, practice!,
While presenting in class, be sure to have picked out a few friends, or at least nice people, to look at.,
Be calm and confident.,when presenting from time to time look over your Q-Cards so you can see the audience, it will improve your grade ( if nervous about looking at them look at the wall behind them)

",How to Successfully Write and Present a Speech in School," Don't choose something someone in your class is already doing, or something that was presented last year. People will compare you. Also make it something your audience can relate to.;
, Know it off by heart. Don't choose complex facts, simplify them so they're easier to remember. Difficult things to memorize will make you mess up.

, Practice in front of your cat, dog, Mom, Dad, or even your neighbor! Have them comment so you know what to work on.

, This way you can't be accused of just reading your speech. Try to look at different angles of the class, but be sure to look at students! If someone in your class is sleeping, that may help to look at them too.

, If you're nervous, people will sense that and tease you about it.

Begin with a joke.,
Make a startling statement.,
Make a bold declarative statement.,
Evoke a sense of suspense or curiosity.,
Introduce a startling fact or statistic.,
Offer surprising statistics and other evidence.,
Tell a story or an anecdote.,
Offer an appropriate quotation.,
State an expert's opinion.,
Use a striking visual aid.,
Give a testimonial.",How to Start a Speech1," As long as the occasion is a fairly lighthearted one, a joke or a bit of humor can be a great way to start an entertainment or occasion speech. Just make sure that your use of humor does not offend anyone in the audience.At an event held in honor of a particular person, you might tell a humorous story involving you and the person being honored. Just make sure that the story or joke is not embarrassing or potentially offensive.
Try out your joke on a few different people before delivering it in your speech. If the joke falls flat or is offensive, cut it from your speech.;
, A startling statement shocks or startles an audience into paying attention. Since these statements often evoke a strong emotional reaction, making one at the start of your speech can engage the audience quickly.


Try something simple that cuts to the chase, like “Seat belts save lives.”

, A daring declarative statement can shock or stun the audience into paying attention to a seemingly important topic.You might also say, in no uncertain terms, that the audience needs to learn the information you intend to deliver to them.


If your speech is about mood disorders, you might make a statement along the lines of, “Depression, manic depression, and mood disorders of a similar strain can have deadly side effects.”
If you are giving a speech on self-defense, you could say something like, “If you're out alone and suddenly assaulted, your reaction in the first few seconds can be the difference between survival and death.”

, Describe something before revealing what that something is. By describing the characteristics of something, you invite the audience to try to unravel the mystery before you reveal the answer, forcing them to become active listeners.


For a speech about dogs, you could describe the standard characteristics or daily life of a dog using a first person point of view, and end with the statement, “I am a dog.”

, A startling statistic can alert your audience to the importance of your chosen topic. As a result, the audience is more likely to pay attention to what you have to say about the topic.A statistic about declining or increasing birthrates in a specific region or country could alert people to population issues.

, Evidence should be an essential element throughout your entire persuasive speech, but if you want to make a strong case for yourself at the very beginning of your speech, a good way to do so is to provide the audience with a statistic or other similar evidence that demonstrates the importance of your claim. The statistic will be more effective if it will likely surprise your audience.For a speech in which you are trying to persuade the audience to take protective measures against the sun, you can bring up a statistic relating to the number of people who die from skin cancer on an annual year.

, Stories connect to an audience by combining information with entertainment. The story you choose for the start of your speech can be real or fictional, but either way, it should have a clear connection to the topic of your speech.


For a speech about maternity care in the United States, you could tell a story about an experience related to maternity care that you or someone you know went through.
If you were delivering a speech about how to bake a cake to kids or teens, you might describe a situation in which a child made a cake for a parent or loved one for a special occasion. Include details about how the recipient appreciated the gesture.

, A pithy or witty quotation that relates to the topic of your speech can present a strong statement for you to build the rest of your speech's content. For an inspirational or entertaining speech about a particular occasion, use a quotation that applies to the occasion or appeals to the audience's interests.Try to choose a quote from a well-known source, since more people will likely respond to it if they recognize who spoke it.
Inspirational quotes are a popular way to open a graduation speech. Usually, the speaker would choose a quote that talks about dreams, education, looking toward the future, or building character.
Quotations are not often used to start demonstrative speeches.

, If you can find an expert on the topic who agrees with your stance, quote or paraphrase that expert's opinion to provide your speech and position with a strong foundation from the start.


If you are trying to persuade an audience about the importance of forming healthy eating and exercising habits, you might start with a statement made by a well-known expert on the matter to engage the audience.

, When your intention is to deliver a speech that instructs audiences about how to produce some sort of tangible product or result, showing off a “finished work” at the start of your speech can intrigue the audience and make them want to learn how to accomplish the same results.


For a speech about how to lose weight, you could begin by showing before and after pictures of people who used the method you are about to describe.

, If you are trying to sell a product or idea, or if you are trying to explain why a certain course of action is beneficial, a testimonial can engage the audience by introducing a story to them while simultaneously convincing them of the beneficial element of whatever you are trying to pitch.


If you are trying to persuade an audience to buy a specific language learning program, you could give an example of someone who used that program and who now lives in a country that speaks the language learned.

Ask a survey question.,
Pose a rhetorical question.,
Ask the audience to visualize something.,
Get suggestions from the audience.,
Ask the audience to talk to each other.,
Describe a relatable scenario.",How to Start a Speech2," Ask the audience’s position on a particular topic to get a sense of where your audience is coming from. This helps the audience get invested in the information you’re sharing and makes it relevant for them. For a speech about how to winterize your car, you could ask the audience something like, “How many of you have ever felt your car slipping on an icy street? Or who here has had their car stall on the side of the road during freezing temperatures?”

, By asking the audience a question about your topic, you engage them almost instantly. The audience members will hear the question and begin to ponder their own answers, thereby becoming involved in the topic of your speech.


If you are giving a speech about holiday traditions, you could ask, “What was your favorite holiday tradition growing up?”

, Lead your audience through a very brief visualization exercise to inspire their imagination as it pertains to your topic. They may not remember your words as much as the images that were evoked in their minds during this part of the speech.For example, if you’re giving a speech about booking a dream vacation, you might start with: “Imagine you are on a tropical beach. Feel the sand under your feet and the sun beating down on your shoulders. You can hear the ocean waves and wind swishing through the palm trees.”

, When people listen to a speech, they often are looking for answers to questions that they have. Giving your audience the opportunity to ask questions up front can help shape your speech and make sure you’re addressing their specific concerns.


If you’re giving a speech about teaching online classes versus in-person classes, you might ask, “What’s your biggest concern about teaching an online class?” Call on a few people to hear their concerns. Chances are, you’ll be addressing their concerns in your speech already., Start off your speech by asking your audience to share something with their neighbor. This breaks the ice, making a more friendly and communal learning environment.You might say to the audience, “Turn to your neighbor and tell them your favorite kind of exercise.”

, If you need to persuade an audience to buy into an idea or to purchase a product, explaining to that audience why that idea or product relates to their own lives can be an effective way of getting them interested in what you have to say.


If you are trying to explain why the audience should buy a certain kitchen utensil, open by describing a common scenario that might happen in the kitchen for which that utensil could be used.

"
"
Extend a personal greeting.,
Recount your connection to the subject.,
Tell a personal story.,
Refer to a current event.,
Refer to a historical event or person.,
Connect to the conference theme.,
Refer to the occasion.",How to Start a Speech3," In most entertaining speeches, you can take a fairly lighthearted and personal tone. Speakers often introduce themselves to the audience. Within the introduction, the speaker should explain the connection he or she has to the matter at hand and use that explanation to bridge into the speech.This is most often seen at eulogies and weddings. The speaker introduces himself or herself and begins to explain who they are in connection to the subject being addressed. If you are delivering a wedding toast, you might begin by talking about your connection to the bride, groom, or couple getting married.
It can also be used at an event being held by an organization. In that case, the speaker might explain her position within the organization.

, Speakers often begin a speech by referring directly to the topic at hand. This makes an immediate connection to the audience, whose members are all there for the sake of the same subject.

, When you have a personal connection to the subject of your speech, a common way to start your speech would be to share a personal story that demonstrates that connection.

, Incorporating current news stories is a good strategy because it confirms to the audience that your speech is relevant. Make a link between your speech topic and a current event by referring to something that has happened recently in the news.,For example, if your speech is about the lack of women working in technology, you might find a recent story about how girls are being discouraged from pursuing science in high school.

, Start your speech by mentioning a relevant historical event in order to give your audience a common reference point.For example, if your speech is about overcoming challenges, you could talk about a historical figure who did just that, such as Helen Keller.

, Many speeches are given at professional or academic conferences. These events often have a theme that provides a sense of coherence to the overall purpose of the conference. Connect the beginning of your speech to this theme., For a speech delivered at a particular occasion or event, speakers often begin their presentation by talking directly about that occasion or event. Since everyone in the audience is presumably there to acknowledge the same occasion, immediately talking about that occasion is a good way to make an instant connection to the audience.


If you were giving a speech at a Christmas party or fundraiser, you could talk about your Christmas memories or something you love about the season.

"
"
Give an informative speech to deliver information.,
Use a demonstrative speech to explain a process.,
Give a persuasive speech to convince your audience of something.,
Commemorate an event with a speech.,
Know your audience.",How to Start a Speech4," Informative speeches are very basic and only provide factual, useful information to an audience without making judgments on that information.The tone of an informative speech is usually fairly flexible and often dependent on the topic of the speech. For instance, a speech about cancer would demand a serious start and serious tone, while one about the history of the yo-yo would be very lighthearted.

, Demonstrative speeches are generally designed to teach an audience how to do something instead of teaching them about something.Demonstrative speeches are often on the lighthearted and non-academic side, so the openings of such speeches tend to be more relaxed. That said, if you do end up dealing with a serious topic, such as how to stay safe in a hurricane or tornado, make your introduction and overall speech fairly serious.

, Persuasive speeches strive to convince the audience to change their ideas or behaviors about a topic and should use an appropriate tone to communicate that persuasion.These types of speeches can be the most difficult to deliver because, as the speaker, you have to be engaging enough to ""sell"" your opinion to those listening in.
Persuasive speeches are often serious and may use a serious opening, especially if the speaker is trying to persuade an audience to take a certain beneficial action or to adopt a new perspective about a topic. The only time that a persuasive speech might take on a more casual, lighthearted tone is when the speaker is trying to sell an actual product.

, This category of speeches covers a wide range of tones and purposes; these include speeches for weddings, funerals, graduations, and other events. These speeches focus on values and qualities about particular people that you highlight in the speech. Tailor-fit your introduction to match the tone of the occasion in question. A serious or sorrowful occasion will usually call for a somber or nostalgic tone, but a celebratory occasion demands an opening and a speech that is entertaining or uplifting. For instance, a speech delivered at someone's wedding should be a lot more lighthearted than one delivered as a eulogy, and both will be very personal. A graduation speech must be general enough to relate to a wide audience.

, Getting a sense of who will be in your audience before writing your speech will help you tailor your speech in the right direction. For example, if your audience is a group of community business leaders, you will address them differently than you would address a group of teenagers.

"
"
Rehearse your speech beforehand.,
Test your technology beforehand.,
Have a glass of water nearby.,
Start with a confident voice and body language.,
Don’t start off with apologies.,
Maintain eye contact with the audience.,
Don’t just read from your paper.",How to Start a Speech5," Take some time to run through your speech a few times. Check it for timing and trim if necessary. Ask for feedback from a friend.


This will ensure that you’re comfortable with the speech and you’ll be able to relax a bit.
Memorize the first sentence of your speech. This will help you overcome anxiety of starting out the speech strongly. Bring a hard copy of your speech with you as well., If you are using any visual aids such as PowerPoint, test your technology to make sure everything is hooked up correctly and is working.

, Many people get a dry mouth when they are speaking, so be sure to bring some water with you. Take a small sip just before you start speaking.


If you are giving a brief speech, you likely won’t need to drink any water in the middle of your speech. If your speech is longer, then you might want to find a good moment to pause and take a small sip. Don’t gulp the water down; you will risk spilling it on your shirt or making yourself cough.

, Start your speech with a strong voice. Make sure your body language projects confidence. Stand tall with your shoulders back and your head high. Take some deep breaths before the speech starts in order to calm your body and mind.

, Don’t start your speech with a comment such as, “I’m sorry if this speech seems disorganized,” or “I apologize for my nervousness.” The audience will only know it if you tell them. If you act prepared and organized, your audience will assume that you are., Look out into the audience while you’re speaking. If you feel shy or embarrassed about looking at people, choose a spot just above the audience’s heads or a point on the back wall.

, It is more difficult for the audience to pay attention when you are only reading directly from your paper. Instead, look up frequently to assess the audience’s engagement with your material.

Think: What is the chain mail?,
Usually at the top there is something such as, ""Don't read this"" or ""Stop"".,
Often the email or comment will be some story, commonly about some monster or fictional dead kid attacking people.,
After you read the story, it will say something like, ""If you do not send this to ten more people, you will die in two days."",
Don't send it to anyone else.,
Even if it is absolutely creepy, keep the mail and smash it.,
If you know the person who sent you the email, tell them that it is really bad manners for them to send you nonsensical curse emails and they should stop and think, because they're either panicking over nothing, or else they sent it on as a joke and it just isn't funny, and makes them look like a gullible schmuck for panicking and forwarding something that is 100% rubbish.,
If they send you another email, follow steps 1-7 again.

,
If the person sends you 3 or more emails, tell someone else.,
Also, if an email ever says something like, ""I will break into your house myself and (enter bad event) you!",How to Not Get Creeped out by a Chain Letter," Is it, ""BBQ at my house! I won't like if you don't come!""? If it is, you're fine (it's not really an alarming thing, just a friend who expects you to show up and might be sore at you if you don't). If not, continue on.

, If there is, you should stop and delete it. Chain letters often tell you to ""read"" or ""don't read"" as a ploy, playing on your initial curiosity so if you read them, they'll eventually hit you with a bunch of baloney designed to push your panic button or use any other emotion you have against you for one purpose only: to get you spreading it further. However, if you are curious, or a rebel or just want to read it, continue. It's just a piece of text with maybe some graphics and animations. It can't actually do anything to you.

, Don't lose your head and get scared. There's no such thing as monsters, you've known that since you were small. No chain letter is going to cause one to blip into existence to kill you or anyone else. You know dead people are dead, and can't go around attacking you, pulling you down some nonexistent well or do any of the things these supposedly creepy chain letters claim. None of these creepy story forwards can actually cause that to happen, either. If you choose to read it, keep in mind the fact that every one of these scary chain email stories are absolutely untrue. Keep thinking this as you read it.

, Think again: Will this really happen to you? Will you actually die because you didn't send an email? How is it even possible that a made up story and text and pixels created by some anonymous hoaxer actually kill you. It can't, any more than your computer monitor and keyboard. There's no more chance of a piece of made-up email tracking you down and killing you than there is of your computer suddenly coming to life and giving you a hug or a slap. Chain letter emails are not living beings and they are not magic. They can't physically do any more harm to anyone than an email you personally write.

, Doing this stops other people getting it and passing it on and it getting worse.

, Write out all of the things wrong with it and make yourself laugh at the utter ridiculousness of the story and the threat attached. Keeping the message is also a good way of stopping a troublesome emailer: you tell someone (teacher, parent, friend, etc.) you have proof of getting this unwanted email. If convenient, ask anyone else who is definitely not creeped out by the chain letter for their ideas. If you get them to dissect and ridicule the story for the fake-creepy, absurd junk it is, you and probably them will end up having a good laugh over it. This completely turns the tables on whoever actually started the chain letter that creeped out the unthinking, easily scared people who got it before you did and passed it on. Being a chain-breaker is good and never killed anyone.

, (Hopefully they'll take the hint and the situation ends here).

,, You can even report them to their internet service provider if they keep sending you unwanted email. The situation is getting out of hand. Tell the person you will block their address if they keep sending you this junk. Chain letters are against the terms of service of many ISPs - they are a type of spam.

,"", you may need to tell an authority (police, principal, etc) but only under dire circumstances such as when it isn't a mere hoax chain letter, but a real threat from an actual person who you know is capable of real violence. (see Warnings).

Choose an envelope.,
Enclose the letter and seal the envelope.,
Address the envelope.,
Write your return address.",How to Mail a Letter1," It's important to find an envelope of the right type for your letter. If you choose an envelope that's too light, for example, your heavy stationery might break through the envelope while it's in transit. Take the following factors into consideration as you decide what kind of envelope you need for your letter:


The weight of the paper. The weight of the envelope should match the weight of the paper and any other contents you may be mailing with it. If your letter is written on heavy cardstock, or you're including something else like photos inside, choose a sturdy envelope that can handle the contents.
The size of the paper. The size of the envelope should be appropriate for the size of the paper. Letters written on standard sized 8 1/2 by 11-inch paper are typically folded into thirds, then mailed in a business-sized envelope. Letters written on notecards may be mailed in smaller envelopes.
The intent of the letter. If you're mailing a cover letter, you'll want to choose a professional-looking business-sized envelope. A personal note may be sent in a decorative, colorful envelope if you wish.
The letter's destination. If you're mailing the letter overseas, you may want to use a sturdy envelope, since there is a greater chance it could get damaged along the way.;
, Once you've chosen the right envelope for your letter, place the letter inside and lick the edge of the envelope to moisten the glue, then press it shut to seal the letter.


You can wet a sponge with a little water to moisten the envelope glue if you don't want to lick it.
Place a bit of clear tape along the edge of the seal if you are afraid the letter might open on its journey.

, Write the address of the recipient in the middle of the front of the envelope. Include the recipient's name, apartment or house number, street name, city, state or province, and zip or postal code. Use clear, printed letters written in dark ink so that the post office knows just where to send it.


If you are writing to someone outside your country, make sure you include the country name as well.
Some people have their mail sent to a post office box, rather than a street address. If this is the case for your recipient, write the correct post office box number followed by the city, state and country if applicable.
Write each part of the address on a different line to make it more legible. For example:

Skyler White
2004 Rosethorn Court, Apt. 4
Albuquerque, New Mexico 87041
United States



, In the top left corner of the envelope, write your name and address. You may also choose to write it on the back of the sealed envelope or use a printed return address label. Including your address will ensure that the letter comes back to you if for some reason it doesn't make it to the recipient.

"
"
Use a first class letter stamp.,
Buy extra postage.",How to Mail a Letter2," If you're mailing a letter of standard size and weight within the same country, place a first class letter stamp in the top right corner of the letter. Stamps are available for purchase at the post office, online at usps.com, and at some convenience stores.


Stamps come with either standard or special designs. If you want to purchase a decorative stamp, go to the post office and ask to see their selection.
Stamps rise in price every few years. If you have old postage stamps, check usps.com to make sure they're still valuable enough to use. You may have to use two.

, Letters that are heavy or oversized and letters that are being mailed overseas require extra postage to reach their destination.


If you have a scale at home, you can weigh and measure your letter to determine how much postage you'll need to pay. Record the measurements, then check usps.com for rates. Affix as many stamps as you need to the top right corner of your letter.
If you don't have a scale, take your letter to the post office to have it weighed. The postal worker will be able to calculate exactly how much postage you'll need to buy.

Place the letter in a blue mailbox.,
Place the letter in your own mailbox.,
Take the letter to the post office.",How to Mail a Letter3," If you live in the United States, you'll notice blue USPS mailboxes bolted to the sidewalk in cities and suburbs. Walk to one of the boxes, open it with the handle, place your letter in the slot, and close it. A postal worker will collect your letter and start the delivery process.


Every mailbox has a notice detailing when the mail gets picked up. If you place your letter in the box after the scheduled pick up time, your letter will get picked up the next day instead.
Be careful not to place your letter in a brown mailbox. Brown mailboxes are for residential or commercial use.

, If you have a mailbox on your house, you can place your letter there and alert your mail carrier of its presence by lifting the red metal flag affixed to the side of the box. When the flag is raised, the mail carrier knows that there's a letter that needs to be mailed.

, If you need to buy postage at the post office, you can leave your letter with the post office worker and he or she will mail it for you. Even if you don't need to buy postage, you can still take your letter to the post office to be mailed.


The post office is a good place to mail your letter if you want to make sure it gets to its destination as quickly as possible. Taking your letter directly to the post office can cut down on the transit time by a day or so.
See www.usps.com for information on where to find the closest post office.

Open a word processing document.,
Use a sheet of company letterhead if it is available.,
Start your letter with your address, if you don’t have letterhead.,
Include the date.,
Type the recipient’s address two lines below the date on the left side of the page.,
Press “Enter” twice.,
Continue with the body of your letter.",How to Head a Letter1," You can use an open source processor on Google Drive or a fresh piece of paper in a typewriter; however, formal business letters should always be typed and printed, with a signature in pen.;
, At minimum, formal letterhead includes the person’s name, the name of the business, the address of the business, phone number and usually a company logo. This information takes the place of a sender’s address in the body of the letter.

, Only include your street address, city, state and zip code on the first two lines in the upper right hand side of the page. You don’t need to put your name or title, since it will be included in the closing at the bottom of the letter.


You may also choose to include your email address or phone number, if your letter suggests contacting you by one of those methods.

, Use a month, day and year format, such as “May 4, 2014.” You can include it two spaces below your address on the right or on the left.


There is a lot of variation on which side the date is written, so look for another piece of correspondence from your company to use as an example.
Dates in the UK may be written with the day, month and year. For example, “4 May 2014.”, This is also called the “inside address” and it should include the name of the person with title, the address in US Post Office or Royal Mail format. Include the name of the company, if applicable, on a line between the person’s name and the address.


Don’t indent the address, date, salutation or paragraphs. The paragraphs in a business letter are separated by spaces and begin flush with the left hand side.
If you are writing to a foreign country, type the country in all capital letters on the last line.
The inside address should be approximately one inch (2.5 cm) below the date if the date is on the left hand side, or it should be one space below the date if it is on the right hand side.

, Then, begin your salutation with “Dear” and the person’s title and name. For example, “Dear Mr. Reading” or “Dear President Reading.” Include a colon after the salutation.

, Finish it with a formal salutation, a signature and your name and title."

Write the date that you are writing and sending the letter two lines below your address on the left or right.,
Don’t include the recipient’s address in informal letters.,
Write your salutation beginning with “Dear.” The formality of the address will depend upon how well you know the person to whom you are writing.",How to Head a Letter2," Unlike business headers, many personal letters are handwritten on stationery that says the person’s initials or full name at the top.

, Envelopes may get thrown away and including a sender’s address is the best way to encourage a reply. Move on to the date if you are on friendly terms with the recipient.The sender’s address should include two lines, the street and the city, state and zip code. A name is not necessary.

, Format it using the month, day and year. For example, “September 15, 2014.”


Personal letters should be sent immediately after the are written to expedite time-sensitive information.

, If you are writing a formal complaint or letter that will go on record with an organization, you should use the etiquette rules governing a business letter.

, Always include a colon after the salutation.

Consider the occasion.,
Consider your purpose.,
Know which topics to avoid.",How to Select a Topic for a Speech1," The occasion for the speech can go a long way in helping you determine the topic. Your speech topic will vary depending on whether the occasion is celebratory, just plain fun, solemn, or professional. Here are a few ways that the occasion can help influence your speech topic:If the occasion is solemn, such as a funeral or memorial service, then your topic should be serious and relevant to the occasion.
If the occasion is fun, such as a toast at a bachelor party, then it's time to bring out the fun anecdotes and stories and to make people laugh -- not to share your passion for coin collecting.
If the occasion is celebratory, like a wedding, then you need to provide some light-hearted humor as well as some serious and sentimental points.
If the occasion is professional, then you need to stick to a professional topic, such as website design, and not focus on your personal experiences.;
, Your purpose is related to the occasion and is the goal you want to achieve through your speech. Your purpose can be to inform, persuade, or just to entertain your audience. A speech can have a variety of purposes, but it's important to be acquainted with the most common purposes:To inform. To inform your audience, you'll need to provide relevant facts and details about a subject that reveals information that allows your audience to see an ordinary subject in a more complicated light, or to learn about a completely foreign subject.
To persuade. To persuade your audience, you'll need to use rhetorical techniques, metaphors, and convincing evidence from experts to show them that they should do something, whether it's to elect you for office, recycle more, or take the time to volunteer in their communities.
To entertain. To entertain your audience, you'll need to draw on personal or anecdotal examples, tell funny stories, show off your wit, and make your audience crack up, even if you're communicating an underlying serious message.
To celebrate. If you're celebrating a specific person or event, you'll need to show your audience what makes that person or thing so special, and to garner enthusiasm for your subject.

, If you want to select a topic that suits your purpose and is relevant to the occasion, then you should eliminate a variety of topics before you even start brainstorming ideas. This will make it easier for you not to offend or just bore your audience as you move forward with your ideas. Here are a few things to consider as you cross those potential topics off your list:


Don't pick anything so complicated that it would be impossible to inform your audience. If you pick something so complex that it can't be explained in a short amount of time or without pages of charts or diagrams, then you will lose your audience.
Don't pick something that's so simple that your audience could understand it in just a minute or two. If your topic is so basic that you'll only be repeating yourself after you've said just a few sentences, then you'll lose your audience's interests as well. You want to keep your audience members on their toes, not knowing what to expect next.
Don't pick anything that's too controversial. Unless you're at a convention for controversial speeches, it's best to avoid topics that are too controversial, like abortion or gun control. Of course, if your goal is to persuade your audience to agree with one side of these issues, then you should go ahead with your speech, but know that you may lose many people before you begin.
Don't pick anything that doesn't fit the mood of the audience. If it's a celebratory occasion, don't give a dry speech about irrigation; if it's a professional occasion, don't give an emotional speech about how much you love your mother.

Choose a wooden letter (or letters).,
Add a finish to the sides of the letter first.,
Glue the sequins onto the wooden letter.,
Repeat with any remaining letters.,
Create a hanging loop.,
Hang the sequin letter (or series of letters that form a word).",How to Make a Sequin Letter," If you're using a single letter, a large wooden letter is a good pick. If making a name or word, a large capital letter with smaller letters is one possibility. Or, keep all the letters the same size.;
, To make the letters look better and to remove the rough side edges, measure a piece of ribbon or braid around the letter edge. Glue in place. Allow to dry before proceeding.


Repeat with any other letters being used.

, Glue the sequins in one of the following ways:


Make a border of large sequins around the edge. Fill in to the middle with small sequins.

Consider the knowledge of your audience.,
Consider the level of education of your audience.,
Consider the needs and interests of your audience.,
Consider the demographics of your audience.,
Consider the audience's relationship to you.",How to Select a Topic for a Speech2," If you want to connect to your audience, then you should consider its knowledge before you select a topic. If you're giving a speech to a group of aspiring writers, then you can comfortably reference other writers and literary terms; if you're speaking to a group that knows very little about writing, be careful when you make more obscure literary references.


If you're speaking to a group that is knowledgeable about a topic, then you don't have to waste their time by discussing the most basic aspects of that topic.

, If you're speaking at a conference for young professionals, you can use more complicated terms and elaborate phrases, but if you're delivering a speech to middle school students, you'll have to change your terms and phrasing to connect to your audience.


You don't want to lose your audience by speaking about something that is completely over their heads, or by delivering content in such a basic way that it sounds condescending.

, What would your audience need to know, and what would interest your audience? Put yourself in your audience's shoes and make a list of all of the things the audience would care about; an audience of teenagers would care about very different things from an audience of middle-aged adults.


Imagine yourself as one of the audience members. If they're teenagers, pretend you're a teenager. Try seeing your topic choice from their perspective. If it bores or overwhelms you, then it won't be the right choice.

, Knowing the age, gender, and race of the members in your audience can help influence your topic. If most of your audience is over the age of 65, then you probably wouldn't talk about current fashion trends on the runway; if most of your audience is under the age of 20, then you wouldn't talk about saving for retirement.


If there are many more males than females in your audience, for example, then it may be best to pick a gender neutral or male-geared topic.
Knowing the race of your audience can help pick a topic. If you have a diverse audience, then something about race relations or diversity can interest your audience, but if you're talking about diversity, interracial marriage, or discrimination against one specific race of people that is not in the audience to an audience that is predominantly of one race, then your discussion may fall flat.
You should also consider where your audience is from. A certain topic may be more interesting to a person from California than a person from Idaho and vice versa.

, If you're giving a speech to friends or family, then you can be more personal than you would if you were giving a speech to an audience of strangers. If you're giving a speech to your employees, your tone would be different than it would be if you were giving a speech to your superiors. Adjust the tone and content of your speech accordingly.

Pick a topic that you're passionate about.,
Pick a topic that you're knowledgeable about.,
Pick something that relates to your interests.,
Choose something timely.,
Choose something that relates to your personal experience.,
Pick a topic that you have the ability to speak about.",How to Select a Topic for a Speech3," If you pick something that you're passionate about, then your audience will be able to see and feel your passion. This will also make you much more excited to generate ideas for the speech and to deliver the speech.


If you only have a limited amount of options and can't pick anything you're truly passionate about, you should at least pick something that you like or are interested in to make it easier and more enjoyable for you to write and deliver the speech., If you're giving a speech at a professional conference, then it's logical that you would pick a topic that you're an expert on so you can give credibility to your speech. But even if you're not delivering a speech in a professional setting or on a particularly complicated topic, you should still pick something you know a lot about, whether it's baseball or your neighborhood. You can even start by making a list of the things you're knowledgeable about, whether it's your family, career, politics, gardening, pets, or travel.


You don't have to know every single thing about a topic to deliver a great speech. You can pick something that you're knowledgeable about, and can supplement that job with some careful research.
If you're picking a subject you're knowledgeable about but know you'll need to research further, make sure the topic is easy to research. If you pick something fairly obscure, then it may be difficult to find more information about it.

, It could have to do with literature, movies, sports, foreign languages, or even gender relations. Whatever it is, you may even be able to find a theme that carries through a variety of categories, such as ""loss of innocence."" Make a list of all of your hobbies and interests and see what would make for an engaging speech topic.You may find a large overlap between the things you're interested in and the things you know.

, If there has been a topic that has been in the news again and again, you can use it as an occasion for a speech. It may be something controversial like gay marriage or gun control, but if the occasion is appropriate, you can give a speech about this current event, offering a nuanced perspective of the situation.


Read through popular national and local papers, listen to the radio, and watch the news to see what people are talking about and how the public is reacting to these events.
You can also pick something that is particularly timely for your community. If there has been controversy over a new policy regarding public schools in your neighborhood, you could use it as an occasion for a speech.
You can pick something that is timely for your audience. If you're addressing high school seniors, you can talk about the next stage of life after graduation, and can bring in any relevant current information from the news.

, If the occasion calls for it, you can give a speech about something personal in your life. It could relate to your experiences with your parents, siblings, or friends, to a personal struggle, or a formative episode in your life. Just make sure the information isn't so personal that it makes the audience uncomfortable, or that the subject is so close to you that you can't talk about it without getting emotional.Remember that you can add personal information to a topic that doesn't feel so personal; you can discuss an aspect of your career, for example, while throwing in a personal anecdote.

, You should be able to deliver a speech about the topic with clarity and conviction. This means that you should feel strongly enough about the topic to inform, persuade, or entertain your audience. It also means that your audience should trust you as an authority on the subject; if you're an only child, you should avoid giving a speech on the importance of having a sibling; if you haven't entered college yet, it may be difficult for you to give a speech on the importance of choosing a major.Whatever the topic, you should be able to connect with your audience through the speech. At the end or even during the speech, a little light bulb should go off in your audience's heads, and they should reach a new understanding of your topic. If you don't have the ability to truly connect with your audience about this topic, then pick another one.

Tell the sender you aren’t interested.,
Let them know that the letters are fake.,
Help the senders recognize scam emails.,
Ask them to use BCC.",How to Get People to Stop Sending You Chain Letters1," A polite request is always a good place to start. Try one of these responses:


""Hi John, I only use this account for work. Could you take me off this list?""
""Hello Rosemary, I'm not a big fan of chain letters. I'd much rather talk to you in person sometime soon!""
""Unfortunately, I never forward these chain letters, so they give me terrible curses. Please don't send me another or all my teeth will fall out. :)"";
, Most chain letters prey on people's feelings with heart-wrenching stories, or with paranoid instructions about politics or social media privacy. Search for proof that the story is fake on sites like Snopes or Hoax-Slayer and send it back to your contact with a polite message like ""Hey, it turns out this isn't real. This site is a good place to check before sending.""


If they continue to send you fake stories, say ""This is another hoax. Please don't send me any more.""

, People who are not used to technology may fall for malicious chain emails that try to steal personal information or spread computer viruses. If someone is forwarding you these scams, warn them of the danger:


Help them block spam or switch to an email provider with better spam detection.
Warn them never to open an attachment from a sender they don't recognize, or to give any personal information.The safest response is to delete the message without replying.
If they fall for emails that promise money for forwarding, teach them to recognize a pyramid scheme.

, If you are plagued with long ""reply all"" conversations, ask the person who starts them to us the private ""BCC"" field instead of the public ""CC"" or ""To:"" fields. You'll still receive the original email, but you can quickly delete it and avoid the next two hundred notifications.

Make your own filter.,
Create a new email address.",How to Get People to Stop Sending You Chain Letters2," A couple email providers allow you to ""mute"" or ""ignore"" a conversation. This will archive or delete all replies to that email without notifying you:


Gmail: open the email thread. Click More above the thread, then select ""Mute"" from the drop-down menu.Outlook (feature only in Windows version 2010 or later): Use the Ignore button. This is located in the Home tab when a conversation is selected, or in the Message tab when a message is open., It's not as easy to stop chain letter notifications on Facebook, unless you're willing to block someone. But depending on the type of chain letters you receive, you might be able to make them more bearable:


Go to Settings → Notifications → On Facebook → Tags. Set this to ""Friends of Friends"" or ""Friends"" to reduce the number of people who can tag you.
Return to Notifications and alter your Email, Mobile, and Text settings to reduce the number of notifications that get passed on.
If you are tagged in a post, use the ""Unfollow Post"" to stop getting notifications.
To disable all app notifications, go to Settings → Apps → Game and App Notifications.

, Consider using the ""report as spam"" button when you receive a chain letter. This helps your email client identify which messages you want to receive, and which should go straight to your spam folder.


If you use this often, there is a risk that all messages from that contact will be marked as spam.

, Many email providers allow you to set your own ""rules"" or ""filters"" to automatically handle incoming mail. For example, you can put all mail from your email-spamming relative into a separate folder. This is possible on Yahoo mail, Outlook, and Gmail, among others.

Use your closing to say thanks.,
Sign your letter with love.,
Remind the reader of your friendship.,
Use the closing to make the purpose of the letter clear.,
End the letter based on how well you know the reader.",How to End a Letter Sincerely," A basic closing with the word ""Sincerely"" can be safely used with almost any kind of letter. When you're done writing the letter, the basic closing is appropriate for almost all kinds of letters. Similar basic closings that do the same work as ""Sincerely"" include:


Sincerely
Yours
Truly
Warm regards
With appreciation
Thoughts and prayers;
, Closings are usually sentence fragments, not full sentences. If you're writing a formal letter, it's good to use a shorter construction. In other words, use ""Looking forward"" instead of ""I am looking forward,"" or your closing will sound awkward.

, The only time it's inappropriate to sign off with ""sincerely"" would be if you're writing to a lover, a very close family member, or a very close friend. For personal letter endings with other options for sincerely, you may create your own closing. Use an inside joke or just write your name to finish off a letter or a card with sincerity.

, Whether you are asking a favor, applying for a job, or writing a Thank You note, elaborate a little more into why you are grateful. With personal letters, don't be afraid to go into detail on your feelings. Here are some examples:


""Thank you in advance for taking my dietary restrictions into consideration. I understand the extra effort it takes to provide alternative options at such a large public function, and it makes a huge difference for myself and for other attendees that may have a gluten intolerance.""
""Thank you for taking the time to consider me for this position. I know there are many applicants, and I hope that you agree that I am a highly qualified candidate.""
""Thank you for being so thoughtful and visiting me during my recovery. I feel very cared for and loved, and it meant all the world to me that I have your support during these difficult times...""

, Everyone wants to know why they are loved. Remind them what you value about your relationship. This goes for family, friends, or romantic partners. Here are some examples below:


""Our bond as mother and son has provided me with the support I needed to forge my path in life. I value all that you have done to raise me and shape me into the man I am today. I love you very much. Happy Mother's Day.""
""My life would be incomplete if I didn't have you to share it with. You are the best companion I could have ever asked for, and through the ups and downs, I am eternally grateful to have you by my side. Happy Birthday. With all of my love...""

, In general notes, a good closing can remind someone of your relationship or your feelings:


Instead of ""Your friend,"" you can elaborate on exactly the nature of your friendship: ""Your companion in bookstore hauls,"" or ""Your confidant and biggest supporter.""
You can close with the exact emotion you mean to express: ""With my deepest admiration,"" ""With my most sincere apologies,"" ""With a heavy heart and a shoulder to cry on...""

, Even in a less sentimental letter, you can make your intentions seem genuine and clear with the correct closing. If you want to make sure that your message has gotten across, here are a few possibilities:


When trying to assist someone, let them know exactly how much you are able to help. ""Please don't hesitate to contact me on my business line if you have any more questions or concerns. I'm here to help. You can reach me at (855) 736-9257 ext. 3514 during normal business hours.""
When writing a resignation letter, you can still maintain rapport with your soon to be ex-employer. ""I have valued my time at Hancock Conglomerates, and I will continue to speak of your company's work with acclaim. I hope that in the future, you will recommend me and the skills I have show during the past 3 years in your employment.""

, There are a variety of appropriate closings, depending on who you're writing to and how well you know them. Here are a few general rules of thumb to follow in letter-writing:


If you know the name of the person you are addressing, or if you started the letter ""Dear Mr./Ms."" then you should end the letter ""Yours sincerely...""
If you do not know the letter of the person you are addressing, or if you started the letter ""Dear Sir/Madam"" or ""To Whom It May Concern,"" you should end the letter ""Sincerely...""

Address the letter to a specific recipient whenever possible. Avoid sending the letter to unnamed recipients. Only use ""To Whom it May Concern"" as a last resort.
Strictly speaking, the most proper punctuation to use after the salutation is still a colon. That said, nowadays, most people use a comma after the salutation of a formal e-mail letter.

Use the sauna at the first sign of a cold.",How to Intensify the Benefits of a Sauna," Since the sauna promotes circulation of the flow of blood through the body, this will help you recover from joint and muscle soreness from your workout.;
, While beneficial in conjunction with exercise, it is claimed that a session of 15-20 minutes will give you a workout equivalent to a brisk walk of 1-2 hours. This is due to an increase in your heart rate which is similar to that which occurs during a brisk walk.

, Even if you plan to exercise prior to using the sauna, it may still be helpful to use it before as well. A short stay will help warm up the muscles helping to prevent injury and it will help ease the strain of exercise on your heart. Your heart will pump properly since your blood vessels are dilated.

, Stretching before exercise also helps circulate blood while sending nutrients to the muscles. Stretching after a workout helps sore muscles recover and helps the muscles flush out waste product. Massaging your muscles may also produce the same effect.

, When you use a sauna your body temperature raises, simulating a fever. Fevers are known to occur when your immune system is fighting an illness and is part of your natural healing process. When fighting a cold, a steam sauna is preferable to a dry sauna in impacting the onset of the cold. Adding eucalyptus to the sauna may help loosen up the congestion associated with the cold.

",How to Format a Letter to a Newspaper," It is easy to go off on tangents if you do not clearly state the reason you are writing the letter. Be sure to note this reason in the very first line of your letter.;
, Many times, a letter to the editor is written in response to other letters or news stories that have been published in the paper. If this is the case, make reference to the item to which you are responding. If your item is not a response to another piece the paper published, find a current national, international or local news story from another media outlet to which you can refer. This will help your letter to not appear outdated or baseless.

, It is important to know how many readers your letter will reach, as well as what types of people will read it. Find out if the paper to which you are writing has a political affiliation, and if your letter is at odds with that affiliation, be prepared for backlash.

, If you see a certain style of letter is printed often, emulate those.

Establish clear boundaries from the outset: From the first contact via telephone, interview the client.,
Once the client is with you, you can maintain your professional demeanor by having other professional procedures in place like an intake form that clearly articulates the professional standards of your practice.

,
In your intake form, be sure to establish appropriate and inappropriate actions that a client may and may not take.,
Make your intake form based on your personality.,
Learn to identify the signals and clues that a client is looking for sexual services.,
Don't let anything slide.,
It isn't just about sexual boundaries.,
Boundaries also include things like active listening rather than always giving advice and how much you talk during a session -It is the client's session.,
Boundaries also include things like having dual relationships with clients, having clients as friends, doing trades with clients for other services such as bookkeeping or legal advice.,
Keep your opinions to yourself about personal issues, religion, politics and the like.,
Transference and Counter transference happen.",How to Maintain Healthy Boundaries As a Massage Therapist," Ask about their familiarity with massage, how often do they get it, what style they like, why they need one today. If you are getting a weird vibe simply state "" I just want to be clear that this is a strictly therapeutic massage and that is what you are looking for."" Be conscious of your own tone of voice, be firm and professional. Also, where are you advertising? make sure it is in a place and in a manner that cannot be misconstrued.;
,, For instance: a client should tell the therapist if the pressure is too much or too little, a client should not say or do anything that is sexually suggestive. Additionally, consider this: because the pressure of the massage can turn on the parasympathetic nervous system and cause dilation of the blood vessels, it is common for a man's penis to become erect. This is perfectly natural and involuntary. While it is natural many men do have control over it. Learning to deal with these situations can also give men a chance to resolve any issues they might have about confusing touch with sex.

, If you might have hesitation asking a client not to do or say something, putting it in your intake form can empower you. Later, if you need to ask a client not to do or say something, you can refer back to the intake form and remind the client of your policies.

, Address them directly if they arise. One example is the question, ""Do you accept tips?"" While this question rarely implies that they are only looking for sex, each situation needs to be looked at individually. For example, if the client asked ""Do you accept tips?"" after being touched near an erogenous zone, don't scream or run out of the room. Let them know that sometimes being touched results in sexual arousal but that you won't be participating in that with them. Too many massage therapists make the mistake of making the client feel guilty about what can be an innocent action. This does not, of course, mean they can touch you or say suggestive things to you.

, Clients can feign innocence when you say something about it. A questionable comment or touch should be addressed as soon as it happens. One phrase would be, ""This massage is strictly about me touching you, not the other way around. I will not continue if you do that again.""

, Setting boundaries also includes your policies and procedures around your business like cancellation policies, late fees/charges, no show policies which teach clients how you want to be treated.

, Reassure the client that you have a non-disclosure policy.

, Keeping the roles separate is often the best for preserving the massage relationship although there have been successful friendships that originated in a therapist/client relationship.

, You are not there to judge a client's body, nor offer diet advice or smoking advice.

, All relationships actually start with transference. What we are paid for as massage professionals is to be aware of our roles in these dynamics so that we can learn to not get hooked into crossing boundaries and preserving the therapeutic relationship.

Eat a well-balanced diet.,
Remain hydrated throughout the day.,
Avoid smoking and limit your alcohol.",How to Have Younger Looking Skin1," Exercise doesn’t just trim your waistline and tone your muscles, it also promotes healthier skin. Physical activity increases your blood flow. Blood cells bring vital nutrients and oxygen to working cells and remove waste. Skin cells benefit from the exchange. Blood cells bring oxygen and nutrients necessary for collagen production to skin cells and carry away free radicals.Working out firms and cleanses your skin from the inside., When you feel stressed or anxious, it ages your skin. Experiencing persistent stress and anxiety leads to the production of cortisol, an inflammatory hormone that breaks down collagen. Cortisol also causes redness, irritation, and breakouts.


To combat stress, set aside time to relax. Yoga, progressive relaxation, and deep breathing exercises are excellent ways to quell your nerves and lower your stress levels.
To combat the negative side effects of stress on your skin, increase your consumption of antioxidants. Eat blueberries, oranges, and leafy greens., In order for your body to function at its optimal level, you must get enough sleep. When you deprive yourself of sleep, your body prioritizes the functions it performs in an effort to conserve energy. Maintaining healthy, vibrant skin is not an essential function. An adequate night’s sleep consists of between 6 to 10 hours of slumber.


If you struggle to fall asleep, put away your phone, increase your exercise, and or add relaxing elements, such as a hot bath, to your nightly routine., The food you eat impacts the health of your skin. Sweet, salty, fatty, and processed foods break down collagen and elastin, which causes skin to sag, wrinkle, and dry.Increase your consumption of vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats to reduce swelling, decrease your risk of breakouts, and increase your skin’s vibrance and elasticity.


Eat whole grains instead of processed grains.Instead of candy, eat sweet in-season berries that are rich in antioxidants.Replace fatty cuts of meat with salmon, which is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids.Opt for handful of almonds, which are rich in vitamin E and monounsaturated fats, instead of a bag of chips., When you fail to consume an adequate amount of water throughout the day, your organs can not function properly. Skin is the body’s largest organ, but it is often the last organ to receive water. If your skin does not remain hydrated, it will become dry, flaky, irritated, and tight.Medical professionals that the amount of water people need to consume is not universal. Instead of 8 glasses of water per day, doctors now recommend drinking between ½ to 1 ounce of water per pound each day., Smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol ages the skin. #*As a result of smoking, the collagen in your skin breaks down and overtime the amount of collagen you produce significantly decreases. When collagen breaks down and is not replaced, wrinkles form. Smoking also restricts circulation, which prevents your skin cells from receiving adequate oxygen and nutrients.


Alcohol dehydrates the skin. When you drink an alcoholic beverage, drink plenty of water along with it."

When you are outside for extended periods of time, reapply your sun tan lotion.Consider wearing protective clothing when you are outdoors.

As you age your oil production decreases. As a result, washing your face twice a day may dry out your skin. Instead, cleanse with warm water in the morning and wash your face thoroughly with a gentle cleanser before bed., In addition to hydrating your skin, moisturizers also serve as a layer of protection. Lotions replenish dry, flaky skin. They seal in your skin’s natural moisture and provide an additional layer of protection from the elements. Moisturize in the morning, evening, after washing your face, and after showering.Instead of a lotion or cream, try coconut oil.
Don’t forget to moisturize your neck.If you have dry skin, avoid products that contain alcohol.
If you have oily skin, avoid oil based products., Removing the top layers of skin with an exfoliant promotes cell renewal and collagen production. Exfoliate your skin once or twice a week—during the spring and summer you may wish to increase the number of times you exfoliate each week.There are several types of exfoliants to choose from:


Rotating brushes deeply cleanse your face, while removing layers of dead skin and unclogging pores.Damp washcloths gently exfoliate the skin and can be used daily.Chemical exfoliants rely on acids, such as salicylic acid, and enzymes to remove dead layers of skin. Use once per week., You can increase or decrease the pressure as your see fit., Retinoids, a derivative of vitamin A, help to reduce the visible effects of aging. These products increase the speed at which cells turn over and stimulate the increased production of collagen.

When administering a chemical peel, dermatologists will apply an acid solution to your face. The process takes 15 minutes. Following the treatment, the top layers of your skin will peel off, leaving you with fresh, healthy looking skin.Microdermabrasion, also known as the “power peel,” exfoliates the skin with small crystals. This non-surgical treatment can reduce the appearance of brown spots, scars, and fine lines, as well as treat damaged caused by the sun., If you have creepy, saggy skin, consider undergoing a thermage treatment. Your dermatologist will use a device that emits radio-frequency energy to stimulate collagen production, which in turn firms your skin.


This is a painful treatment, but you usually only need to undergo one to see results., Instead of exfoliating the top layers of your skin, consult with your dermatologist about targeting the lower layers of skin. You may choose from two treatments: a nonablative laser or an Intense Pulse Light (IPL).


An IPL emits short pulses of light into your dermis, the lowest layer of skin. As it heats the dermis, it produces collagen. It also destroys cells and promotes cell renewal. This treatment also reduces the appearance of blemishes.Nonablative lasers treat the lower layers of skin, which significantly reduces your recovery time. This treatment stimulates collagen production, which helps to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.It also evens out your skin tone."

, You don't want to be interrupted during your evening.

, If you enjoy music, you may like to create a relaxing playlist of music to listen to. Light some scented tea lights. Prepare your towels and pajamas. This will prevent running around to find a clean pair of jammies after relaxing.


If you want wine, chocolates or anything else while in the bath, organize these too.

, Wash your hair and shave. Wash your face, too. By getting these basics out of the way, you're free to relax rather than focusing on cleaning yourself.

, Adjust the temperature to your liking. Add bath salts and essential oils and maybe even bubble bath. Get a bath pillow or a rolled-up towel and prop your head on it. The bath is not meant to cleanse, but mostly to relieve tension, so if you need to wash your hair, shave, etc. It's better to do this before you begin. If you don't, you'll feel stressful throughout the spa.


Put on a face mask. If you want, put some teabags on your eyes to reduce under-eye swelling.
Put on lip balm.
Get a deep-conditioning hair mask and let it sit for the remainder of the bath.

Whilst in the bath, use a bar of soap or sugar scrub on your entire body, concentrating on areas that really need some work, such as tops of arms, your buttocks, elbows, knees and feet. Wash it off and get out of the bath.

, Warm water is best for opening up pores and giving a deep cleanse, while cold water is used for closing pores after cleansing, so keep this in mind.

, Give your face a really good scrub and don't worry about hurting yourself as the more it does, the better. This doesn't mean you have to scrub your face raw; it wouldn't work like that. It just needs a bit of elbow grease to really get it going. Take care to not get the sugar scrub in your eyes, nose or mouth and wash it off in the sink.

, Rub it in and wash it off, like in step 4. Pat your face dry.

, For dry skin, use a face mask for dry skin and a thick, rich moisturiser like Nivea.

, These brushes are specially designed to get your blood going and can also prevent and reduce stretchmarks and cellulite by stimulating your body, blood and circulation. Whether you buy or have a handled or hand held body brush is up to you. Start body brushing your arms or legs in circular motions leading up to your heart. Don't rush it, spend some time on it. If you body brush every day, you should notice some amazingly soft skin, good circulation, exfoliation and a nice glow to your skin in no time. From arms or legs, do the latter, then your stomach, breasts (take care around the nipples), chest, bum and back.

, Make sure you rub it in very nicely, as your skin should feel soft but not wet, sticky or damp.

,, For stubborn skin, do this once a week, but for gentler skin, try it once a fortnight to a month.

Run a warm bath.,
Add something fun or soothing to your bath water.,
Turn on some music.,
Turn down the lights and light some candles.,
Put on a soothing face mask.,
Try playing in the bath.,
Lie back and relax.,
Moisturize your skin when you’re done.,
Get into some comfy clothes.",How to Have a Relaxing Self Pampering Night1," Before you start your bath, make sure you have fresh towels, soap, comfy pajamas to change into, and anything else you may wish to have with you during or after the bath. Put everything you’ll need during the bath within easy reach of the tub, so you don’t have to keep getting out of the water.;
, Soaking in warm water can help reduce anxiety, relieve uncomfortable skin conditions, and soothe aching muscles.Make your water comfortably warm, but not extremely hot. Excessively hot baths can leave you feeling wound up rather than rested, and can even put strain on your heart.It’s okay to take hot baths while you’re pregnant, as long as the bath is not so hot that it raises your core body temperature to 101° F (38.33° C) or higher. The water should feel comfortably warm, but not hot.If you’re worried, use a thermometer to test the temperature of your water, and make sure it is no hotter than about 100° F (37° C).
If start to you feel sweaty or uncomfortably hot, get out of the bath or add some cold water to cool it down.

, You can enhance your bath with bubbles, bath oils or crystals, or a soothing soak.


If you have dry or itchy skin, a colloidal oatmeal soak (like Aveeno Soothing Bath Treatment) can moisturize your skin and relieve inflammation.The aroma of lavender may help with relaxation and improve your mood.Try using a lavender bath oil or other bath products that contain essential oil of lavender.
Fizzy bath bombs are fun to watch, and can add pretty colors, pleasant aromas, and skin-soothing ingredients to your bath.

, Soothing music can improve your mood and help you feel more relaxed.Set up your phone, mp3 player, or a portable speaker somewhere near the tub and put on a relaxing album or playlist.

, Dim lighting can help create a soothing atmosphere and calm you before bed. Candles are great for providing warm, dim light. Pick candles with scents you find relaxing.

, Before you get into the bath, slather on one of your favorite facial masks or lotions. Keep your head out of the water so that the mask doesn’t rinse away before you’re ready. Put on your mask before washing your face to prevent excessive drying.

, This may sound silly, but play is therapeutic and relaxing for adults as well as children.It’s not only fun, but can help you stay engaged and in the moment, so you aren’t thinking about things that stress you out. Give yourself goofy “hairstyles” with your bubbles, or even bring a few bath toys into the tub with you.

, If you’re not feeling playful, you may wish to just close your eyes and quietly enjoy the moment. If you find your mind dwelling on stressful things, try meditating and concentrating on your breathing.

, While a bath can help soothe dry skin, it can also aggravate skin irritation and dryness if you don’t moisturize immediately after your bath. As soon as you step out of the bath, gently pat yourself dry with a towel and apply a moisturizing lotion to any areas that tend to get dry., If you’re ready for bed, put on some cozy pajamas. If you’re still feeling really warm after your bath, take a few minutes to cool down first.

Pick a project.,
Gather your supplies.,
Prepare your space.,
Turn on some music.,
Get up and stretch from time to time.,
Don’t worry about finishing your project.",How to Have a Relaxing Self Pampering Night2," Doing arts and crafts can be incredibly relaxing and therapeutic. It engages the senses and helps shift attention away from whatever you might be worrying about.If you regularly do arts and crafts, pick something that you enjoy doing and that you know will help you feel relaxed. This isn’t the time to try and learn a new skill.
Projects that involve repetitive actions, like knitting, are particularly helpful for reducing stress and calming both the body and the mind.Even if you’re not the artistic or crafty type, something as simple as doodling or coloring can help you relax. Coloring books for adults are a great stress-relief tool that just about anyone can use., Make sure you have whatever you need for your project before you start. For a coloring or sketching project, this could include paper, pencils, and pens. If you’re doing something like knitting or crochet, make sure you have the yarn and needles you need.

, Pick a quiet, comfortable area where you know you will have enough space and light to work. Organize your materials the way you want them. If you’d like, prepare yourself a light, healthy snack and a relaxing beverage (like herbal tea) to have on hand while you work.

, Pick something soothing that won’t distract you too much while you work on your project.

, If you’re feeling cramped or stiff from sitting too long, it may be time to take a break. Walk around and do some light stretches.


Gently shake your wrists and ankles to loosen them up.
Shrug your shoulders up and down a few times, and gently roll them forward and backward.
Stretch your arms up above your head and then very slowly bend over until you are touching or almost touching your toes. Let your arms hang loose in front of you for a moment, and then slowly straighten up again.

, The goal is to relax, not stress yourself out. You don’t have to finish or even get a certain amount done. If you start to feel tired, put your project away for the night.

Plan a routine.,
Create a relaxing environment.,
Dress comfortably.,
Breathe slowly and deeply.,
Add some simple meditation to your routine.,
Don’t push yourself too hard.",How to Have a Relaxing Self Pampering Night3," Stretching and meditating for even a few minutes in the evening can reduce stress and help you sleep better. Some types of yoga, which often combines stretching with meditation, can be particularly beneficial.Plan a simple stretching routine, or try some yoga poses that are known to be particularly helpful for relaxing and easing tension, like one of the following:


Forward bend: Sit on the floor and cross your legs. Lowly bend your torso forward until your chest is resting on your knees and your forehead is touching the floor. Stretch your arms out in front of you.
Standing forward bend: Stand with your feet a few inches apart and your knees slightly bent (don’t lock your knees!), and slowly bend down until you are touching the floor. If you have trouble reaching the floor, try holding the elbow of one arm with your opposite hand instead. Sway gently from side to side.
Child’s Pose: Kneel on the floor and slowly bend forward until your torso is resting on your thighs and your forehead is touching the floor. Stretch your arms out in front of you and let them rest on either side of your head.

, Choose a quiet, comfortable part of your home where you have plenty of room to stretch out. Clear some space if you have to. Put down a yoga mat, especially if you have hard floors. Dim the lights and put on some soothing music.

, Put on a comfortable t-shirt and some soft, loose-fitting yoga or pajama pants. Don’t wear anything that will restrict your movements or make you too hot.

, It’s especially important to be mindful of breathing when you are exercising, even during light exercise like stretching or yoga. Controlled breathing can help you reduce stress and reduce your blood pressure.Try regulating your breathing by counting to four while you inhale, and again while you exhale. Breathe in and out through your nose.
Do some abdominal breathing. Place a hand on your belly while you breathe to make sure that it is your abdomen expanding with each breath, rather than your chest. Focusing on abdominal breathing helps you expand your diaphragm fully and get more air into your lungs.
If you’re trying to get ready for bed, avoid breathing exercises that are designed to wake you up, like Nadi Shodhana (“Alternate Nostril Breathing”).

, Meditating for even a few minutes can help rewire your brain and reduce feelings of stress and anxiety. Take a few minutes to meditate before or after your stretching routine, or meditate while you do your stretches.Pick a mantra (either a short, calming phrase or a simple sound, like a hum) to repeat silently or out loud. If you feel your thoughts drifting, take a moment to find your focus again.

, If you find a particular stretch too painful or uncomfortable, move on to something else. The goal is to relax and destress, not hurt yourself.

Prepare your mind to focus on her.This massage is to relax her.,
Find a room or area with ample privacy.,
Locate a proper surface for the massage to take place.Although you may not have a massage table you will likely have plenty of places to lie down.,

Start by massaging her shoulders.,
Knead the sides of the back with your thumbs and fingers.After massaging her shoulders, move to her back.,
Slide your hand up and down the sides of her back.After kneading the back and sides you can use a hand slide.,
Use your body's weight for pressure.As the massage progresses you may notice your hands getting fatigued.",How to Give Your Wife a Backrub," Your goal is to make her time with you better through this intimate connection. Prepare to focus entirely on her for at least 30 minutes if not longer. Think about what she likes when she relaxes and use those insights to create the perfect environment for a backrub.;
, For the massage to work best her back will need to be completely exposed. This means she will probably be topless. You need to make sure the area you choose has plenty of privacy from neighbors and kids. If you have kids in the home, you may consider locking the door.


The bedroom can be a great place for a massage. However, be ready to stay on your knees most of the time. You will probably need lots of towels to ensure the oils do not get on the sheets, pillows, or comforter.
Avoid giving a massage on the couch. Although convenient it provides little room to maneuver for applying pressure.

, You need a surface where she can lie comfortably without being cold. Somewhere with plenty of support. You will be pushing down on her back so avoid the waterbed.

, If she has a favorite album or band that she likes to listen to when relaxing, go with that. Otherwise find something relaxing. Your local music store will likely have plenty to choose from if you feel stuck. Try to avoid the radio since you can't control what might come on or what commentators might say between songs or commercials.


In a pinch you may be able to find some relaxing playlists online or using a smartphone app. Some premium streaming music services provide highly customizable playlists with no commercials.

, Essential oils used in aromatherapy can provide just the right touch to a room. If you know that your room has unwanted odors or scents you definitely want something that smells good. Orange blossom oil, for example, has a fragrance that can produce a calming sensation.Some essential oils can be incorporated into your massage oil. Lavender oil is particularly relaxing when used this way.

, Electric lighting is usually not intended to calm. Most electric lighting can be pretty harsh on the eyes. Natural lighting from candles will produce enough light to perform the massage but is not so bright as to upset the mood. The room should be calm and inviting. Candle light creates a very warm environment.


If you are using heated essential oils you will want to find non-scented candles to avoid mixing smells. You may chose to go with a scented candle in lieu of essential oils altogether.

, Oil reduces friction on the skin. This allows you to press without dragging or pulling the skin with your fingers or hands. Have plenty of massage oil ready to use on both your hands and on her back.


Massage oil bottles will get very messy if you need to add additional oil. Consider wrapping your massage oil bottle with a small washcloth and rubber band or putting your massage oil in a liquid pourer such as a small liquid measuring cup.

, Cloth towels, especially cotton towels, can be used for numerous tasks. You can use them to wipe off excess oil. They can also be used to cover body parts when needed. If your wife is lying face down, she may like a towel under her knees or rolled up to relax her feet on.


If your wife wants to completely undress for the massage, use a towel to cover her buttocks and upper thighs if she feels too exposed.

, You want to stretch the muscles in your hands and wrists before you begin the massage. Do this by putting your open hands together in front of you with fingers extended. With one hand, push the other with your fingertips. Repeat for both hands.


Another stretch is to squeeze a stress ball. This can strengthen your fingers for a harder massage.

, While she is decompressing go ahead and put the finishing touches on the setup. Light the candles and turn on the music. Wait until she is ready to do any of this. If you do this before she has arrived she may not feel she can de-stress. Furthermore you don't want to leave the candles unattended since they can catch other items on fire.

, When she is ready for the massage she will likely do this naturally. If she is uncomfortable with taking off her bra for this you may allow her to lie down before unfastening the strap. Let her know that oil may get on her bra if she does not remove it after lying down.

, Then rub your hands on her back. If you seem to need more, put more on your hands and repeat. Do this until your hands slide effortlessly up and down her back. Be sure to get her shoulders, neck, and sides.

, Herein lies much of her stress. Start by cupping your hands over her shoulders. Gently squeeze your hands to put pressure on the muscles in her shoulders. Apply pressure evenly with your fingers as you massage the muscles. Avoid the collar bone and move left and right from neck to arms and back.


One technique is to place your thumb on the back of her shoulder for pressure. While keeping the fingers in the same place, move the thumb across her back and toward her neck with each squeeze. Reposition your fingers and hand periodically to ensure a complete massage.
Don't forget the neck and the upper arms. With the neck, simply massage the back and sides gently with your fingertips and thumbs. With the upper arms you will come almost entirely off the shoulder and knead the upper arm. Apply equal pressure with your fingers and thumb and allow your hand to slip away from the arm with each squeeze.

, Place your open hands on each side of her back. with the tips of your fingers and thumbs, begin making small circular movements while slightly opening and closing your hand. As you move down the back, massage with your thumbs the muscles beside the spine while your fingers massage her sides.


Avoid the spine or anything that might tickle or cause pain.The spine and muscles do not massage well. You can cause a lot of unwanted pain (or injury) by pressing too hard on them. Furthermore, any tickling, punching, poking, slapping, or scratching should be avoided unless requested. Typically this upsets a calm mood.
If you were not making circular movements, your fingers would be moving in and out from your palm about and inch or two.
Keep your fingers spread apart during this exercise. This provides more coverage and pressure is distributed more evenly. Try to apply pressure evenly throughout the bottom of the finger rather than focused on the tips.

, Slide your open hand, palm down, up her back from the lower back to her shoulders and arms. Then slide your hands back to her lower back. Repeat this motion several times remembering to provide even pressure throughout the hand. If you feel a lot of friction, add more oil promptly.

, Position yourself so that you can use your body weight to apply pressure. Not too much pressure--you don't want to hurt her. But use your body's weight instead of constant squeezing to give your hands a break. This technique is especially useful when sliding up and down her back.

Give yourself a massage.",How to Have a Home Pampering Day," You may not think a tidy space is essential to having a home pampering day, but having a clean and orderly home will actually make you feel much more calm and relaxed. Take at least fifteen minutes to throw out any trash, tidy up your desk, kitchen, and bedroom, and to make sure everything is in its place. You don’t want to do a lick of work during your home pampering day, so you should make sure your home is in order when you wake up and prepare to spoil yourself.


Get rid of any sign of your work from your bedroom or whatever room you’ll be staying in. You want this day to be about you, not about finishing that report you’ve been stressing about.
Empty your dishwasher, water your plants, and do any household chores you can in the evening so you don’t have to think about a single one when you wake up.;
, You don’t want to be answering emails from work or helping your friends deal with drama during your home pampering day. This day will be all about you, and you can try to forget everyone else as much as you can. Make it clear that you’re taking the day off work and tell any friends who are used to hearing from you that you won’t be using your phone, either. If you’re active on social media, then you can even post about the fact that you’re taking a day off, so no one wants anything from you that day.


If you want to leave your phone on for emergencies or check it every few hours because you simply can’t live without it, then you can do that.

, If you want to have the most successful home pampering day possible, then you don’t want to spend a minute going to the store, checking items off a list, or gathering anything you need, unless that makes you feel more relaxed. While making too much of a plan can be stressful and can counteract the idea of a home pampering day, you should plan to have a few things ready so you can start making yourself feel relaxed the moment you wake up. Here are some things you may need:


Relaxing herbal teas
A face mask
Bubbles for a bubble bath
Scented candles
Cucumbers for your eyes
Your favorite foods
Fruit for a smoothie
Nail polish
Your favorite classic movie
Some iced tea or cucumber water

, The whole point of a home pampering day is that you relax and take care of your body. So, if you wanted to do a manicure and pedicure, take a warm bath, exfoliate your skin, and make a smoothie, along with doing a million other things to make yourself feel relaxed, you may actually be overwhelming yourself by trying to do too much. Instead, just do what you feel like doing when you wake up, and don’t feel pressured to stick to any schedule. If you feel too obligated to do too much, you won’t be able to relax.


Do what you feel like doing. If putting on a face mask feels like too much of an effort and you’d rather just lie in bed, then you should feel free to do that. Remember that this day is all about relaxing in the best way possible for yourself.

, Okay, so you probably don’t want to sleep in past noon and miss half of your home pampering day. That said, you should make sure that you get plenty of rest so that you wake up feeling healthy and refreshed. You don’t have to oversleep, but you should make sure you get between 7-9 hours of sleep, or whatever it is you normally get when you feel well-rested. This will help you start the day off on the right foot and will help you feel refreshed instead of groggy.


Sleeping in will make you feel instantly refreshed, but you should try to avoid hitting that snooze button too many times. The sleep that you fall into between snoozes actually won’t be deep enough to make you feel better, and you should work on waking up after a solid, relaxing sleep instead of forcing yourself to get up after a disturbed one.
Stretch your arms over your head, drink a full glass of room temperature water, and step outside for a few breaths of fresh air if you want to wake up on the right foot.

, Light some candles that are scented with either rose, jasmine, lavender, or another one of your favorite smells. Though you may think that lighting candles is for the nighttime, there’s nothing stopping you from lighting a scented candle the moment you wake up. The smell can make you feel soothed and refreshed, and there’s something naturally calming about candlelight that can make you feel at peace.


If you’re not gung-ho about lighting candles, opt for some incense instead. And if you’ve never been into candles or incense, don’t feel the pressure to light them just because you think it will make you feel more relaxed.

, Putting on some music in the background can also help you feel relaxed as you go about pampering yourself. Try to avoid talk radio, or loud Top 40 hits, and stick to music that will make you feel calm and relaxed. If you like Miles Davis, Enya, or any form of classical music, then you should softly play it throughout your day so you feel calmed and centered. You can also just set Pandora to your favorite relaxing station so you don’t have to worry about choosing anything.


That said, if you’re the kind of person who gets distracted by music, you can leave it off. Sometimes, there’s nothing more soothing than silence.

, Though letting in some natural light can help you feel rejuvenated and refreshed, you can also consider keeping the room darker than normal, so you don’t have too many lights distracting you or hurting your eyes. Soft, natural light, whether it’s from dim lamps or candles can be soothing, while bright lights can make you feel too alert to really be relaxed. Work on having enough light to see, but not so much that it makes you feel overstimulated.


You can stick to sunlight during the day and candlelight at night. Try to avoid using lamps or overhead lights as much as you can.
You can also try to remove any very brightly-colored items, such as bright yellow pillows, and stick to softer colors such as greens, browns, and deep blues so you feel more relaxed.

, It’s important to stay hydrated throughout your home pampering day. If you prepared a jug of ice water similar to the ones you find in a spa, then you’ll feel like even having a glass of water is a treat. You can add some slices of cucumbers, oranges, or limes to add an extra flavor to the water and make hydration feel like a special occasion. Make sure to drink at least 8-10 glasses of water a day so you feel healthy and refreshed.


If you don’t like citrus, you can try some sprigs of mint or even some sliced strawberries instead.

, When you get up, work on cleansing your face with your favorite facial cleanser. Just massage it into your skin for 15-30 seconds using the pads of your fingers. Then, rinse it off thoroughly. After that, you can exfoliate your skin with a gentle facial exfoliator; if you don’t have one, use a mixture of sugar and olive oil instead. Again, massage your skin for 15-30 seconds with the exfoliator, and then rinse it off.


You can even consider boiling water and then steaming your face to open up your pores afterward. To do this, just make a tent with a towel over your face, placing your face above the steaming water, and breathe it in for five minutes.

, Making your own hair mask can help strengthen and moisturize your hair while letting you stick to your budget. All you have to do is stir the ingredients together to make the mask, massage it into your damp hair and let it sit for 30 minutes, and then take a shower and shampoo and condition your hair as usual. Taking the time to really care for your hair is a great way to pamper yourself. Here are all the ingredients you need to make the hair mask right at home:½ cup honey
2 tbsp. olive oil
1 egg yolk
1 whole avocado

, Before your body gets wet, use a pumice stone to remove dead skin from your feet. Then, wash out your hair mask if you chose to apply one. After that, you can just shampoo and condition your hair as you normally would. You can take a bit more time with it this time, making an effort to really massage that shampoo and conditioner in and out of your hair. If you want to kick things up a notch, sing “Natural Woman” as you shampoo those locks!


Use your favorite soap or body wash to fully cleanse your skin. Take your time.

, If you prefer a bubble bath instead of a shower, you can skip on the shower, or even shower and then take a warm bath. Just fill the bathtub with warm water, adding bath crystals, bubble bath mix, or a bath bomb to make the water to your liking. Then, lower yourself into the bath one foot at a time, until you’re fully immersed, with just your head rising above the water. Make sure the water is warm enough to make you comfortable and relaxed, but not so hot that you’re getting overheated.


Once you’re in the bath, you can scrub yourself with a loofah to get rid of dead skin cells.
You can also light some candles and play some soft music for an added effect.
If you want to shave your legs, then make sure you apply body exfoliator to your legs and to massage them with flannel—this will open up the hair follicles and will make for a cleaner shave. Rinse the exfoliator off before you shave. You can use shaving cream, or even try olive oil, which some say will make for a closer shave.

, First, just towel yourself dry and then rub moisturizer or lotion all over your body. Then, wrap a nice, clean, fluffy robe around your body and splash your face with cold water to close your pores. Then, you can moisturize your face and put on the comfiest clothes you own; there’s no need to worry about looking good, as long as you feel good. This day is all about making yourself feel clean, healthy, beautiful, and relaxed, not about wearing cute clothes to impress all the people out there.


You can hang out in your comfortable robe for a little while, if it feels good. How often do you get to do that?

, A face mask can help treat dry or oily skin, reduce puffiness in the face, and can make your face look and feel better. All you have to do to use one is to gently massage it into your skin, so you increase the circulation in your face, and then let it sit for 10-15 minutes or however long the instructions say you should use the mask for. Whether you make a mask at home or buy a mask, it’s important you have the right mask for your skin type. Here are some ideas for different face masks you can make right at home:For dry skin, make a milk and honey face mask. Simply stir 4 tablespoons of powdered milk together along with 2 tablespoons of honey and 2 tablespoons of warm water. Then, apply it to your face, taking care to keep it away from your eyes and mouth, and place a damp washcloth over it for 10 minutes. Then, use the cloth to wipe your face.
For oily skin, you can try an egg mask. Just whip the whites of two eggs until they turn into a light foam. Spread the thin layer on your face and let it sit until it becomes firm. Then, rinse the mask away.
Use a green tea mask to counteract aging. Just dissolve one teaspoon of green tea powder into half a teaspoon of water and spread the paste across your face, letting it sit for 10 minutes.
Make a tomato face mask to exfoliate your skin. Just puree one ripe tomato along with a teaspoon of oatmeal and another teaspoon of lemon juice. Spread the mixture across your face and let it set for 20 minutes before rinsing it away.

, Cucumbers have a natural anti-inflammatory effect that will help reduce puffiness around your eyes. They also have a high water content, so they act as natural moisturizers. Just make sure you have a cucumber that you’ve kept in the fridge so that it feels nice and cool around your eyes and decreases the flow of blood to the space around your eyes, and cut two thin slices that you will place directly over your eyelids. Lie down for 10-15 minutes and wait for the cucumbers to work their magic.You can also use these cucumbers while you’re applying the face mask.

, One great way to pamper yourself is to give yourself an amazing manicure or pedicure. First, soak your fingertips and toes in a warm bath for a few minutes to let them relax. You can just use an ordinary warm bath, or mix in half a cup of lavender oil or honey to make your digits feel extra cared for. After that, work to remove any extra skin around your cuticles, file your nails down, and then paint them whatever color you’d like.


You can do the whole deal: file your nails, apply base coat, two coats of polish, and top coat for that long-lasting effect. Or you can just paint on your favorite color and not worry too much about having that perfect look.
A lot of girls don’t have a lot of time to paint or care for their nails, and taking time out of your day to pamper yourself can help you feel at ease.
Give yourself a nice hand and foot massage before you take out the nail polish. Your feet are probably sore from being on your feet all day and your hands may be sore from typing or just because. Take the time to really massage your palms, the pads of your feet, and the joints of your fingers and toes.
If you’re not real careful about painting outside your nails, then you can cover the outsides with Vaseline before you begin painting, so any excess paint comes off your skin more easily.
Give your nails at least ten minutes to dry and just lie down or listen to some relaxing music while you wait. A lot of girls don’t normally have the luxury of just sitting around and waiting for their nails to dry, so make the most of it on your home pampering day.

, Though you can have a treat or two during your home pampering day, you should also make an effort to have some healthy foods so your mind and body is feeling its best. Make sure you have some ripe fruit, such as mangoes, strawberries, or peaches around so you can make a tasty fruit salad or a fruit smoothie, and have a healthy breakfast of oatmeal or eggs and lean proteins to start the day off right. Make a healthy salad for lunch, and have a hearty dinner that isn’t too rich in fats or too spicy, and you’ll be feeling more at ease in no time.


Having some healthy snacks throughout the day will also make you feel great. Have some almonds, yogurt, celery and peanut butter, or grapes whenever you get a craving.
If you want to relax at the end of your home pampering day and enjoy a glass or two of red wine, then no one’s stopping you. Just make sure you stop drinking alcohol about 2-3 hours before your bedtime so you can have a restful sleep and wake up feeling refreshed.

, One thing you should do on your home pampering day is to drink a nice cup or two of herbal tea. Herbal tea generally does not contain caffeine so it won’t make you anxious and it has many restorative and soothing properties. Peppermint tea has been said to ease stomach aches, chamomile tea has been said to ease anxiety, and ginger tea has been said to improve your circulation.Have a cup in the morning and a cup in the evening, or even make iced tea out of it if it’s a warm day.


Though you shouldn’t completely quit your caffeine habit just for a day or you’ll suffer from withdrawal, you should try to have a little bit less caffeine than usual if it’s possible.

, Yoga can work wonders on your mind as well as your body. If you’re familiar with yoga or have even taken just a few beginner classes, then you should try to carve out at least 30 minutes out of your day to practice some yoga. You’ll be able to do some stretches that open up your body and to find some positions that strengthen your body and mind. Yoga makes you feel more self-possessed and can help you be grateful for the world around you.


You can even do yoga to a video if you feel lost on your own, though you should avoid watching too much television throughout your day.
Even a few poses, such as Child’s Pose, Crow Pose, or the Crescent Lunge can help you feel more in control of your mind and body.
When you do yoga, it’s important to focus on your breath. This can make you feel even more relaxed and like you’re truly taking care of yourself.

, Meditation is another great way to relax and take care of your mind and body. If you want to pamper yourself, then one of the best things you can do is to take some time out of your day to focus on your breathing and let stillness fall over you. Just have a comfortable seat and work on relaxing your body, one part at a time, while focusing on the breath rising in and out of your body. Work on trying not to think about anything else and pushing away any anxious or worried thoughts.


It can take practice to focus on your breath and to truly push away those negative thoughts, so don’t get frustrated with yourself if you can’t do it on the first attempt. Just try it for 10-15 minutes and see how much better you feel.

, Though you don’t want to commit to any heavy exercise on your home pampering day, just taking a walk for half an hour can make your mind and body feel more energized, happy, and relaxed. Being outside, getting some fresh air and sunshine, and feeling your body moving can help you feel more centered and more at one with your body. Plus, you don’t want to be cooped up in your house for the entire day, and if you get moving, you’ll feel like you’re doing your body justice.


Try not to think or worry about anything you have coming up. Instead, focus on being present and in the moment, and enjoy every tree you pass and every breath you take.

, A self-massage can be one of the best ways to pamper yourself and to make yourself feel better. Use your hands to ease the aches in your body, to improve your circulation, and to help push the tension out of your muscles and joints. You can do this when you get out of the shower or during any time of the day when you’re feeling a little sore and achy. Here are some great ways to give yourself a massage:


Use the thumb and fingers of one hand to gently massage the palm, forearm, and biceps of the other, and then switch and do the same for the other arm.
Use the fingers of both hands to massage circles into your upper back and your neck, and then use just the tips of your fingers to massage circles into the back and top of your head.
Sit down with your legs stretched out and massage your legs from the groin all the way down to your toes.

Remove all jewelry.,
Moisturize your hands.,
Loosen your hands up.,
Pinch the tips of each finger and thumb on both hands.",How to Give Yourself a Hand Massage1," Before you begin massaging your hands and fingers, be sure to take off any rings or bracelets that may get in the way.;
, For a smooth massage, it is best to first apply lotion or oil to your hand before, and during the massage, to keep your skin slick. This will allow your thumb and fingers to more easily slide across your skin so it won't become irritated by too much friction.However, some people would recommend not putting lotion on straight away, because some 'drag' is important for releasing fascia.

, Shake them out and wiggle your fingers about. Stretch your hands by flexing them as wide as you can, and then make a fist. Bend your wrists with your hands points down, and then flex your hand up and down several times. Continue to use these techniques for about one minute before you begin to massage your hands.







, The pressure applied to your fingers should be firm, but not painful. A few seconds for each fingertip will do. After pinching the tops and bottoms of your finger and thumb tips, go back to each tip and pinch them again, this time squeezing from side to side.

"
Remember to breathe.,
Use your thumb to do most of the work.,
Move your thumb along the edges of your palm.,
Locate the bones in the hand.,
Include your fingers.",How to Give Yourself a Hand Massage2," As you do all these techniques, breathe in through your nose while expanding your diaphragm (belly-breathing), and out through the mouth. Breathing is as important as the massage itself, and it may be wise to take ten of these deep breaths prior to and after the massage., Start by holding out one of your hands, keeping your fingers straight. Then, wrap your opposite hand's fingers around the back of your hand with your fingers facing straight up. Your thumb should be laying on your palm, and pointing towards you.

, This technique is most effective at massaging the pads of your palms just under your fingers and thumb, and the entire edge of your hand. Compress your palm with your thumb, using short, caterpillar-like movements, going up and down, and working your way from the inside to the outside of your palm.








Apply the amount of pressure you are comfortable with. Start off using light pressure, and then work your way towards a deeper massage.
This will help you find tender, sore, or tight spots.

, They will be long, like a continuation of the fingers through the palm. Pinch the base of the hand, in between the bones, and glide upwards. Continue using short strokes when rubbing.








, When you reach the finger, continue to pinch up the finger with a firm pressure. Inch your thumb up and down each finger, starting at the balls, and working your way up slowly to the tip of your finger.









Squeeze along the sides of your fingers, too. Repeat this for every finger.

"
"
Reverse your hand placement.,
Go to the space between the thumb and the index finger.,
Apply pressure to the webbed area.,
Massage your forearm.,
Shake it out.",How to Give Yourself a Hand Massage3," Switch your massaging hand so that your hand is wrapped over the top with your fingers facing down. Your thumb should still be laying on your palm. Now, you can work on the pressure point area of your palm, between your thumb and index finger, which is a very sensitive area.

, There is a muscle here that holds most of the tension in the hand. Here, you will do some deep compressions, kneading, or gliding. You can do this by either pinching with the thumb and index finger or using your knuckles., Use your thumb and index finger to make small, circular motions that will facilitate tension release. Hold pressure as long as it feels comfortable. It should result in a dull ache that is not unpleasant, but may take some getting used to over time.








Keep a firm hold and tug at the skin gently until the fleshy web snaps away from your grasp. Repeat this process on the skin between all of your fingers., If you find that most of your hand pain stems from the thumb, you can continue this work down your forearm on the side the thumb is on. One of the thumb muscles connects near the elbow, so it's important not to overlook this as a potential cause of pain., After you are finished with your very relaxing hand massage open and close your hand and wiggle your fingers. You can now repeat this massage on your opposite hand.

The first 2 most important steps in a facial, is to


Disinfect your hands, and
Gather some info from your client about themselves.,
Have your client lie down on a clean bed with clean sheets and pillow.,
If your client happens to be wearing any makeup when they come in for their facial, then you must cleanse away the makeup.,
Apply two moistened cotton pads to your client's eyes, while you are taking a close look at their skin.,
Once you have a pretty good idea as to your client's skin type, you may be able to continue your regime.

,
Begin with an exfoliating cleanser for the face.,
Massage your client's face: Take some massage cream or oil, and apply it freely to your client's skin.,
Steam the pores on your client's face: The best way to steam pores from scratch, salons and spas usually have steamers for their aestheticians to use on their clients, is to take a warm towel and wrap it around your client's face for about two minutes.,
Take a paint brush or a spatula and apply a mineral-rich mud or clay, and smooth it all over your client's face.,
Leave beauty mask on for approximately 20 min.,
Apply skin toner or astringent once mud mask is washed off.,
Apply moisturizer to skin.

,
Give a light spray of water to the skin(to hydrate skin).

,
Facial is complete.",How to Give Someone a Facial," E.g: Do they have any allergies or sensitivities to any certain ingredients, which are often used in cosmetics or applied directly to the skin during aesthetic treatments. This is very important to know, as if these are applied, they will definitely produce the opposite results in which you are trying to achieve with your facial application.;
, Wrap a clean towel around your client's head.

, If she happens to be wearing eye makeup, apply eye makeup remover to a cotton pad, to gently cleanse the eye area. Always cleanse the eye area in counter clock wise to avoid wrinkling the eye area.

, Have a lamp right over your client's face, hence the need for the cotton pads on the eyes, and take notice of any flaws or blemishes, for example: comedones, pimples, etc size of pores, fine lines, dehydration, etc. These will determine the type of skin your client has. There are four main skin types:


Normal: This is considered the best skin type. It is has a good oil/water balance, with no impurities, or fine lines.
Dry: This skin type has very tight pores, due to lack of oil. While it will not have any impurities, it tends to mature faster, and develop fine lines faster.
Combination: Parts of the face are oily, while other parts are dry(usually the T Zone((the forehead, nose, and chin area))is the oily part, while the cheeks are the dry part).
Oily: this skin type, has an overabundance of oil. Although this skin type matures the slowest, it usually has a shiny surface and multiple impurities.

,, Exfoliating is good for the skin as it sloughs away dead cells from the skin which accumulate, and prevents newer cells from growing. Once this is done, you may pat the skin dry.

, Once this is done, you may start doing upward strokes on the skin. Don't use downward strokes on the skin, as gravity will pull the skin down, apparently. Do a little ""tap dance"" with your finger tips on your client's skin; use your index finger and your middle finger in a ""scissors"" like motion along the jaw line. Massaging the skin will increase the blood flow in your client's face.

, This will open the pores on the face. It is best to have open pores when applying a beauty mask.

, Mud masks clean out the pores and strengthen them. Leave only the eye area, you may want to put some more cotton pads onto the eyes to avoid getting the mud into eye area.

, Then gently wash off.

, This will close pores, as well as remove excess oil and impurities, which were not washed away with cleanser.

,,, Give your client a mirror to view his/herself, and humbly accept their happy cries as they see how beautiful they are.

Find a journal.,
Gather your items.,
Look through your items.,
Cut out the pictures.,
Look at where you want to place your things.,
Glue in your items.,
Add in the final touches after everything is glued in.,
Continue making pages and finding things to put into your journal/notebook.",How to Make an Anything Journal," Find a journal that you like, or you can even use a composition book if you want. The choice is yours. It is your journal after all. Make sure that the journal has enough pages, and that the pages are large enough to hold more than one photo or item.;
, Find anything that you saw that you might like. That might include a magazine, photos, poems, music, or anything you like!

, Look through the magazine and other things that you have gathered and find what you would like to put into your journal.

, Cut out all the things that you liked. Make sure to cut them a little larger that needed so that you have room for editing and trimming if you need.

, Try different spots on the page(s) for where you can place the things. If you think there's too much available space, spruce up your page with embellishments or ribbon. Even try tape! Don't glue your things down until your sure that there isn't a better spot or place to put that in.

, After taking a final placement check, glue in your things one at a time. Don't put too much glue, as the pages will get very stiff and your pictures will have very many creases due to the glue. This is especially important with magazine clippings, because they are so thin. Try spreading out the glue to avoid that problem.

, Maybe you want to trim the edges, or write something in describing what that item is.

, Then when its done, you can enjoy all the memories and thoughts that you had.

Clean and groom yourself.,
Make the massage space comfortable and inviting.,
Use an appropriate variety of massage oil.,

Use firm and even pressure with the palms of your hands.,
Use your thumbs for areas of tension.,
Focus on neglected areas of the body.,
Use other parts of your body.,

Don't forget the feet.,
Do the slow slip-n-slide.,
Ask your partner for guidance.",How to Give a Sensual Massage," To make the experience as sensual as possible, both of you should feel comfortable, clean, and fresh. Bathe and groom yourself, paying particular attention to your hands and fingernails. Your fingers should be clean and clipped before you give a sensual massage.


If you're giving your partner a massage, consider bathing together to initiate the intimacy. Bathing or showering at the same time can be a great way to get the massage time started.
It can also be fun to start with a massage and then, after things get oily, to hop in the tub afterward and clean off some of that oil.;
, Whether you're massaging someone on a professional massage table or on a bed or other surface, it's important to make the person getting the massage as comfortable as possible. Make sure the room is warm enough to be undressed in, if clothes are coming off, and make sure the sheets are clean and fresh. Light some candles and incense to make the room feel special.



It's sometimes common to use hot stones, blindfolds, rolling pins, and a variety of other implements in the massage, but sometimes it's also best to keep it as simple as possible. You don't need to prepare an elaborate display of tools to make the massage sensual and enjoyable for your partner.
Some gentle music can be a welcome addition to a sensual massage, or a corny and uncomfortable mistake. Ask your partner what they would prefer, and avoid the Barry White cliches.

, While it's possible to give a halfway decent massage without any oil, your partner will be missing out big time. It's much more comfortable and sensual to use a natural massage oil to give a massage.



Commercial massage oils are often scented in a variety of fragrances, which can offer an intense sensual experience for a massage. Some people might prefer unscented oils, but try out a few to see what works best.
You don't have to buy oil specifically made for massage. While it may sound weird, cooking oils like olive, coconut, or cocoa butter can make excellent massage oils. Many masseurs prefer using a basic cooking oil on the skin.
You can also make your own massage oil by submerging lavender, calendula, rosemary, or other fragrant herbs or essential oils in a natural oil yourself. You can save money by mixing up batches of your own and saving it in jars.

, The most important part of a sensual massage has nothing to do with where to put your hands. A massage won't be sensual if it doesn't involve trust and emotional intimacy. Both before and during the massage, it's important to talk and listen.



When you're massaging, ask questions like, ""Is that too firm?"" or ""Does that feel good?"" when you move to a new area of the body. Listen and adjust your massage accordingly.
It's also good to avoid turning the massage into an interview. Use your judgment and listen to the sounds your partner makes. Moans of pleasure are good signs, so keep doing what you're doing.

, Take a generous portion of oil into your hands and rub it in to warm it up, then gently spread the oil onto the part of your partner that you're massaging. It's generally typical to start with the back and shoulders.









Never pour oil directly onto the back of your partner if it's cold. This can be startling and uncomfortable, and it can make your partner feel tense. Warm the oil up yourself and periodically add more, if the skin starts to dry out, or the oil gets worked in.
If you want to heat massage oil, do so only very gently, and always test it on your own skin before applying it directly onto your partner.

, Massage techniques can vary widely, but there's no big secret to making your partner feel good. Use and firm, but gentle touch, rubbing long strokes along your partners muscles. Use the base of your palm to do the bulk of the pushing, and use other parts of your hand to get at the sensitive spots.










Remember that it's important to massage along muscles, not pushing on bones. It doesn't really feel good to push hard onto the point of someone's elbow, but it does feel good to massage the inside of the forearm.
Try an experiment if you've never given a massage before, rubbing your own shoulders and seeing where it feels good. Find these same spots on your partner, and remember how firmly you touched your own shoulder. It should translate.

, In general, you want to start the massage by using long, even strokes, then go back to problematic or sore spots to work more with your thumbs. If you find a spot that feels very good to your partner, or that your partner wants you to work harder, switch to your thumbs for extra support and pressure.










Always be gentle, rubbing your thumbs in circular motions along the back of your partner's calves, just above the buttocks, and the lower back area.

, Everyone knows that it feels good to touch genitals and other erogenous zones. But diving straight to these areas can make for a somewhat crude or hurried massage.Take your time and, as long as your partner is comfortable (communicate!), explore the neglected areas of the body for the most sensual and careful massage you can give. Don't forget about:










The wrists
The arch of the foot
The fingers and palms
The back of the neck
The ears
The back of the knees

, Forearms, elbows, knuckles, and even your oiled chest and torso can be effective ways of massaging away tension and creating intimate touches with your partner. As long as your partner is ok with full-body contact as part of the massage, take advantage of all your body has to offer to make your partner feel good.



It's also sometimes popular to use other objects to help in the massage process. Rolling pins, or even the massage oil bottle itself, can be used to roll across sore muscles and ease tension, when used properly. This can be somewhat less sensual (not to mention cold) than your own hands, though, so keep that in mind and keep it simple.

, A massage isn't a quick prologue to sex. Let the massage linger on for a while, spending your time treating your partner to these sensual touches for their own sake, because they feel good, not because they might lead to more.










It's also good to avoid distractions during a sensual massage. A massage is a lot less sensual if you're not watching Sportscenter at the same time. Switch off the TV and devote your attention to your partner's body.

, One of the best areas to start is always the shoulders and the neck, working slowly and gently with your thumbs down the side of the spine on the back of the neck. Work down the back of the neck in little circles, paying close attention to your partner's response.










The spot where your neck meets your shoulder is another great area to hit, paying particular attention to the point at which the shoulder blade starts. Always work along the bone, not running across it.

, As you work your hands down the back, the muscle that runs along both sides of the spine feels excellent to massage slowly. Use your thumbs in small little circles and long strokes, using even pressure. Don't pressure the spine directly, but along both sides. It'll feel great.


, Paying close attention to the calves, massaging both big muscles in the back of the leg separately. This can be the difference between a good massage and a great one. Work your thumbs up and along both tendons in the back of the thigh, as well, to work the parts that can get sore.









, Running a thumb along the arch of the foot can feel amazing. Work each toe individually, using the oil liberally, and use both thumbs in small circles along the ball of the foot. It's good to use firm pressure on the foot, or it can feel somewhat tickly.










If you always give your massages from the heat to the toe, vary it up sometimes. Start with the feet and work your way up. Slowly., Once you've worked your way down your partner's body and added a lot of oil, do some long, full-body strokes with the palms of your hands, going extremely slowly and revising all the spots you've just massaged. This can be a very nice way to end the massage. It can also feel good to use your forearm, or your knuckles, to vary the sensation from the last time those areas were massaged.









, Always defer to what feels good for your partner. If you want to do the front of the body next, or other areas more specifically, talk about it and decide together. Good communication is the most important part of the massage.



Giving a massage isn't code for ""consenting to sex."" Never touch your partner anywhere intimate without discussing it first.

Choose a book that’s large enough to hold regular 5x7 inch postcards too.Opt for a journal that’s small enough that it’s easy to carry in your bag wherever you go.
A journal with acid-free paper is usually a good investment because it will ensure that your writing and sketches will hold up for years.;
, You’ll want to have pens that you’re comfortable actually writing with, but you should also have tools for sketching sights that you see and embellishing other materials that you’re adding to the journal.Gel pens are a good option because they can write over most materials with ease and come in a wide variety of colors.
Using watercolors directly in your journal can get messy, so you may prefer painting on postcards or other scraps of paper and then adding them to the notebook.

, When it comes time to adhering photos, postcards, and other materials in your journal, you’ll need some type of adhesive to attach them. Glue sticks work well because they’re not messy and are easy to throw in your travel bag. However, you can also use decorative tape to fix your travel mementos to the journal pages.Washi tape works well for travel journals because it comes in a variety of colors and patterns. You can find it at your local craft store.

, You may want to trim some of the materials that you place in your journal, so it’s a good idea to have scissors with you. A ruler can help you cut a straight edge or write in a straight line if your journal is unlined.


Consider bringing two pairs of scissors with you: one regular and one craft. Craft scissors have a decorative edge, such as scalloped or zig zag, that can help give your journal a more distinctive look.
If you’re flying, don’t put scissors in your carry-on bag. You’ll have to surrender them to security.

, You’ll be collecting various materials to add to your journal throughout your trip, and you may not want to take the time to attach them all right away. To stay organized and prevent any of the items from being lost, it helps to have a clear, expandable envelope-style folder to gather all of your mementos in.A folder is especially important if you don’t want to compile your journal while you’re actually traveling. You can just write in the journal as you go, and add the mementos after you’ve returned home because the folder will keep them all organized.

, You can find a variety of cool vintage maps online, so choose a favorite to paste on the cover of your journal. You may need to shrink the map to get it to fit, especially if you’re taking a trip to multiple countries.If you’re visiting multiple cities or locations on your trip, you may want to print out a black and white map and then use a marker, highlighter, or pen to indicate where you are going., For your journal to really capture the mood and tone of your trip, it’s best to jot down notes while you’re traveling because it can be difficult to remember key details after the trip is over. That doesn’t mean you have to write diary-style entries that cover everything you did on a given day, though. Aim to take your journal out a couple of times a day and write down the activities, sights, and experiences that immediately come to mind.Remember to date each entry, so you can remember the timeline of your trip. You may want to include the time that you wrote each as well.
It helps to set aside a specific time to write in journal. For example, you might do your entries at breakfast or just before bed. If you’re taking a plane, train, bus, or car to another location, the ride is a great time to work on journal entries.
If you’re in a hurry, jot down notes about your day on a scrap of paper that you can copy into the journal when you have more time. You may forget some details if you don’t write things down as you go, so a rough draft can come in handy.

, In most cases, a travel journal serves as a personal memento of an interesting and exciting experience in your life. However, you may plan to show yours to your family and friends, so they can share in the experience or get ideas if they decide to take a similar trip in the future. Knowing who the intended audience for your journal is can help you come up with the right style and tone.If you plan to share your journal with others, consider the details that you plan to include -- or leave out. You may not think it's necessary to write down the address of a restaurant that you enjoyed to preserve the memory, but a friend may find the information helpful. On the other hand, there may be personal details of your trip that you don't want to share with family and friends, so it's best to leave omit them.

, It's often easier to write journal entries if you have a central idea or mood that you're focusing on. Think about all of the things that you saw and did on a given day, and see if there's a recurring theme that can help shape your entry.If you’re having trouble identifying a theme for an entry, start by asking yourself a few basic questions, such as “What made me smile today?”; “What surprised me today?”; or ""What did I learn today?"" Write down the answers, and you may see a theme start to emerge.

, Don’t just focus on the things that you see in your journal. A compelling entry will also capture what you heard, smelled, tasted, and felt during your travels.No details are too small because they'll all help you recall the trip years down the road, so describe the scent of the flowers on the table in the cafe where you have lunch or the feel of the breeze when you're relaxing on the beach., You're probably going to meet plenty of interesting people on your trip, so be sure to include them in your journal entries. It doesn't matter if it's a fellow traveler from your tour group that you wind up spending an entire afternoon with or a cab driver who takes you for a quick ride -- think about how they looked, spoke, and, most importantly, how they made you feel, and include it in your entry., From the moment that your trip starts, begin gathering together materials that will help chronicle your journey. Airplane boarding passes, postcards, tickets to local attractions, business cards from restaurants and hotels, paper menus and logo napkins from restaurants, clippings from local newspapers, labels from regional food and beverage products, and receipts from your purchases can all help the memories come to life in your journal.You don’t necessarily have to glue or tape the mementos in your journal as you’re traveling. Just set them aside in your folder, so you can add them when you return home. However, make sure to leave space among your written entries to add the materials that match up with them.

, No trip is complete without photos that help you remember what you saw and did, and your journal will benefit from visual reminders of your trip. Digital cameras make it easier to ensure that you wind up with high quality photos because you can just delete the ones that you don’t like. Go for a combination of landmark shots and informal portraits to give your journal variety.You likely won’t stop to have photos developed while you’re on the road, so make sure to leave room in the journal to add photos after you’ve returned home.

, While photos are ideal for capturing the things you’ve seen or done on your trip, drawing some of the sights can actually help you focus on details that you’d otherwise miss. Use colored pencils, pens or watercolors to include some personal artwork amid your entries.It doesn’t matter if you’re not a great artist -- sketch a simple map of the neighborhood that you’re staying in or a pretty bunch of flowers that you saw. As long as the drawing helps you remember details of your trip later, it’s worth it.

, This may not seem important, but actually it is. This helps you remember the pages certain things are on.

, Do this on the very first page. On the top margin, write 'Table of Contents'. Then, create a column for the section, and create a column for the page numbers. In these next steps you will find out the names of the sections you will need to write down.

, Here you will write down all of your achievements. Continue adding to this every time you have a new achievement. It doesn't matter if they are big or small. An achievement is an achievement no matter what.

, This section is for future jobs you are interested in. Whenever a job you possibly would want to do pops in your head, write it down there. Whenever you decide you don't like one of the jobs on the list, mark it out. This will help you decide your career later on.

, I know, you thinking, ""Colleges? This has nothing to do with my schooling right now."" Think again. It does more than you think... This section is for, obviously, colleges you are interested in. The first and second page is for just simply writing the college name. But, the other 20 pages or so are for listing the college name in the top margin, and writing down the requirements to get into it. This encourages you to reach the requirements of the college, so you can get into that college you dream of.

, You may be confused, but don't be. Community service is an essential part of graduating. Some schools actually require community service to be done, while some don't. Also, community service helps you get into a better college. Make a goal of how many hours you wish to do. Then, every time you do community service, write down what you did, and how many hours you worked. Those hours of community service really help. Trust me, they do.

, This section is for your test scores (e.g. Quizzes, ACT, SAT, Test, Exams, State Tests, etc...). Every time you get a test back with a score on it, write down the name of the test, and its score. Later, you can look back upon them and see how you've improved your test grades, or brought down your test grades.

, The other steps are necessary for the journal, but if you want to add any more, feel free to do so!

, What's the point in making a journal if you don't enjoy it? There isn't one. So make sure you take care of it and enjoy it!

Get a digital camera with video recording capabilities, a digital video camera, or even just a web cam.,
Set up an account on YouTube or a similar video hosting site.,
Decide on a topic.,
Decide how often you want to update your video journal.,
Get recording!,
Be consistent!,
Edit, edit, edit!,
Upload your video.",How to Make a Video Journal," This will be your main instrument, since it will be how you record your video journal in the first place. A digital camera or digital video camera is best if you plan on being mobile while recording, while a decent web-cam will do the job if you plan on making it more of a monologue than anything. You can also combine these resources.;
, This is essential to getting your videos out to the masses. Pick a user name that represents you, but is also easy to remember. YouTube allows you to limit your videos to friends only (up to twenty-five people), in case you only want certain people to view your videos, or you can make them public (viewable to anyone). You can also make them completely private, so that only you will be able to view them.

, Your topic can be very specific, or it can be very general. You may make a video journal about living in a certain area, or you may just make a video journal about the goings-on of your everyday life. It's your video journal, so the choice is up to you! Be creative!

, You may wish to put up a new video every couple of days, or only update once a week. The choice is up to you. Keep in mind that if you choose to update every couple of days, it's probably best to keep the videos as concise as possible. If you update less often, then it's OK to make them longer and more detailed.

, Now you're set to record your video journal, so get out there and do it!

, Don't just record one video then give up. Make sure you leave some time to do it. Try to set yourself a goal to do it at least once a week, because you may find, after the first few weeks, you don't want to do it anymore.

, The key to a good video is not only your personality and ability to talk to the camera and make the viewer feel engaged, but also editing. You can use Windows Movie Maker or some other video editing software for this step. Editing can make or break a video. Add titles, photos, music, cut out long pauses or parts that you don't want in the video - the possibilities with editing are numerous.

, Once you have your video just the way you want it, it's time to put it online. Upload it to YouTube or your site of choice, add a title for it, a description, and set your preferences for the video. Voila! You now have a video journal.

Cover or decorate the new journal's cover.,
Begin writing or drawing in your journal.",How to Make a Stapled Journal," This might be lined notepad paper, printer paper, scrap paper, and so forth.;
, How large or small do you want it? A journal made from 10 to 50 pages is usually a good size for all sorts of things.

, This must be different from the inner pages, and stronger too. A piece of thin card or thick paper is ideal. It can be plain, as you can color or cover it if wished.

, Align them so that they fit together nicely. Then find the center of the pages, using a ruler to help you, if needed. This will be the fold line that forms the middle of the journal. Fold the pages down this line.


If using many pages, you'll need to do this in smaller stacks until all of the pages are folded, then bring them all together.

, The crease line must be firmly bent in place.

, Staple as closely as you can next to the fold line. Keep the staples in line, as neatly as possible.


The more staples added, the more stable the journal will be. However, a minimum would be about four staples in evenly spaced places along the spine of the journal.

, You might like to write the purpose of the journal on the cover or on the first inside page.

, It's all ready now.

Cut out a piece of fabric that's 2"" larger than your journal on every side.,
Start gluing the top and bottom edges.,
Glue the left and right edges, too.,
Start covering the raw edges of the inside covers.,
Glue the fabric to the cardboard.,
Apply plenty of glue to the back side of each piece of cardboard and put them into place.,
Decorate your fabric cover.",How to Make a Journal Cover1," Open your notebook so the front and back are next to each other. Set it in the middle of your piece of fabric and grab your ruler, measuring 2"" (5cm) more on each side.


Make a line all around your journal, forming a large rectangle that's 2"" wider than your notebook. Then, cut along this line.;
, With your notebook still centered on the piece of fabric and 2"" sticking out on either side, apply glue to the top and bottom flaps (the exposed 2 inches). Fold the top in first, and then fold in the bottom. Use plenty of glue; you don't want it coming up later.


If you have one handy, use a foam paintbrush to spread the glue evenly over the fabric. That way it won't clump and be visible from the outside.

, With more glue placed on the left and right edges, fold up the flaps and attach them to the inside of the notebook cover. Do this for both the front and back covers.


You may want to crease triangles into the corners much like you're gift wrapping a present to give it a professional touch.
You'll notice that where the binding is looks a little weird. To remedy this, cut two slits in the fabric where the spine is and get rid of this small square of fabric.

, Right now the inside of your journal probably looks less than perfect – it's just the exposed, raw edges of fabric and nothing else. To get rid of this, we'll cover it with cardboard and fabric. To get started:


Cut out two pieces of lightweight cardboard or heavy cardstock that's about 1"" (2.5cm) smaller than the front and back cover.
Cut out two pieces of fabric (a different fabric) that's 1-2"" (2.5-5cm) larger than the cardboard you just cut out.

, Center the cardboard on the fabric and follow much the same method you did with your journal. Apply glue to the edges and fold in. In this case, it doesn't matter if you turn the corners into triangles or not – they won't be seen anyway. You'll only see the side of cardboard that's completely covered.


Do this for both pieces of cardboard – one for the front and one for the back.

, The side covered in fabric will go face up on your inside cover; the side that has the edges of the fabric will be glued down on to your journal, covering the original edges of fabric you first glued.


Then, place the covered cardboard into the inside of both the front and back covers. Make sure they're centered and covering the raw edges of the fabric evenly. Now it has a much more finished look to it than before.

, At this point, technically your journal is done. However, you can now truly make it yours by adding more embellishments like fabric letters, stickers, textured paint, glitter glue, buttons – anything. Decorating your journal can be the funnest part.


You could even use iron-ons, ribbon, stencils, feathers, or scrapbook additions. The only limit is your imagination.

Brush on pure white ""chalk paint"" to the cover and let it dry.,
Gather together a bunch of paper embellishments.,
Glue the pieces down with Mod Podge, starting with the front cover.,
After the first layer is dry, use stamps and paint to add depth and texture.,
Add two more coats of Mod Podge.",How to Make a Journal Cover2," ""Chalk paint"" is going to give your cover a vintage-y, worn feel. Consider it the journal equivalent of distressed cabinets or jeans. Even though it's only on the bottom layer, it's vintage powers will seep through in places just enough to give it that touch.


To do this, open the journal up. This way you can paint both sides at the same time and they can dry simultaneously.
Make sure it's dry before you continue any more decorating. It should take roughly 2-3 hours to dry. Alternatively, you could leave it overnight and come back to it in the morning.

, What would you like on your journal cover? Maybe some old postcards, some sheet music, a pretty paper pattern? This part is all up to you. The pieces can be as small or as large as you'd like them, too.


Take a minute to arrange them until they're perfect. If you feel like something is missing, don't settle – think of another piece you could add to bring it all together. Once it's glued down, there's no going back.
Make sure you have enough embellishments for the spine and back, too. These bits are just as important.

, Holding the pieces in place with your non-dominant hand, spread the glue evenly and thinly over the entire front of the journal with a foam paintbrush. Leave it for a couple of hours to dry before you flip it over and do the back (you don't want the first side to end up glued onto the table). Make sure both sides are dry before you continue.


Ah, Mod Podge. The crafty crafter's reason for existence. This stuff is like a miracle all wrapped up in a container. If you don't have any laying around, splurge for your first jar – it's useful in so many projects you'll surely be able to find something else to do with it in no time.

, You now have a journal that's covered in paper and glue. Hmm. Probably needs a bit more, right? At this stage, add a few more small embellishments that can stick out. It'll give your journal that pop that most don't have.


As for ink stamps, an easy way to add them is to put them onto white tissue paper. Stamp the page, dip a paintbrush in water, and draw a watery circle around it so it easily tears out. Then place it however you like on your journal., Even if you didn't add a second layer of embellishments, your journal needs at least two more coats of glue to make sure it's sturdy and ready for everyday use. Make sure the second layer dries before you put on the third. And then voila! Your vintage-y, decoupaged journal is ready for compliments.

Plan out your design.,
Cut out a piece of felt just larger than the book is when it's open.,
Cut out two pieces of felt for the inside front and back covers, too.,
Decorate your front.,
Lay the inside pieces over the larger cover piece.,
Sew all the way around the edges.,
Slide your journal in.",How to Make a Journal Cover3," What kind of look do you want your journal to have? Lots of this will be determined by what you have laying around. Here are some ideas:


You could take extra felt bits and make a pretty design that's sewed or glued on
You could use buttons or other small decorative items for flair
You could use glitter, ribbon, or other shiny, eye-catching additions

, Spread your journal out so that you're looking at the front and back covers at the same time. Put it face down on the table in front of you over your piece of felt. Start measuring, leaving 1/4"" (.6cm) on all sides. Once you have a piece that's measured and just slightly bigger, cut 'er out.

, Now you need felt for the inside covers – you need something pretty on the inside, too, in addition to the front needing something to attach to. To figure out how big these should be, look at the flexibility of your journal:If your journal is super flexible (as in the two covers can practically touch when bent back), measure out a piece of felt that's the same height as the first piece, but that's about 1 or 2"" (2.5-5cm) shorter than half of the original piece.
If your journal is not very flexible (the two covers aren't close to being about to touch when bent), measure out a piece of felt that's the same height as the first piece, but that's 2 -4"" (5-9cm) shorter than half of the original piece.
These measurements are also determined by the size of your journal. A smaller or larger journal will require smaller or larger panels. In looking at your journal, you should be able to tell how large an inside panel your book could feasibly fit into.

, You didn't do all that planning for nothing. Now's the time to decorate your front (before you attach it to anything else). So get to sewing, gluing, taping, whatever you see fit. And if you're decorating the back, do that side, too.


If you're using anything that needs to dry, make sure you give it adequate time to do so before you continue on. If it's not, you could wind up with a mess on your hands while finishing up.

, With the pretty side of your cover piece facing down, lay on your inside cover pieces (the two smaller pieces that'll be the flaps). They should be touching the outside edges, leaving a gap in the middle.


Make sure to line their edges up perfectly, one directly on top of the other. The good side of the flaps should be facing up, while the good side of the cover should be facing down.

, Starting in one corner, sew with the blanket stitch around the edges of your entire journal. It's easiest to do with a machine, but you could get away with doing it by hand, too. It's just the same basic stitch over and over and over.


The beauty of the felt journal is that it has a cozy unrefined-ness to it. If you don't have amazing sewing skills, don't fret. Do your best and if it's loose in places, there's always super glue to the rescue!

, Your journal cover is officially done. Now all you have to do is slide your journal in and enjoy. If you made it for a gift and now you want to keep it for yourself, just call it your ""practice round.""

Get the journal you are going to decorate.,
Open the notebook in the middle, and lay the book down flat so that the cover is facing up and the pages are facing down and are touching the surface you are working on.

,
Get some aluminum/tin foil and cover your notebook with it, leaving a couple extra inches on the sides of the notebook so that you will be able to tape it later.

,
Carefully flip the notebook around and fold the edges of the foil (the extra inches) around the cover and tape them.,
Take your magazines and cut out letters that spell out your name, pictures you like, words you like, quotes you like, flowers, clothes, etc.,
Take a clear packing tape and line the whole book with it.,
Enjoy your personalized journal - no one has a journal exactly like yours!",How to Make a Personalized Journal," A composition notebook works the best, but you can use another kind if you would like.;
,,, (Now your outside cover should be completely covered by foil. The inside of the cover should have a couple inches over it that are taped down.)

, Then you can tape all these words and images (and your name!) onto the journal. You can decorate both the front and back cover with these words and pictures.

, This is so that the pictures you have taped on will not fall off or get ruined. (Make sure you let a couple inches of the tape overlap the cover like you did with the foil so that the tape will wrap around to the inside.)

, Write your dreams, hopes, fears, wishes, and feelings into this journal.

Use a simple paper-bound notebook that you can carry around with you. Try to find something that fits into your bag or pocket.
Use a nicer leather-bound notebook if you want to give weight to your thoughts. This can be a great way to make your journal feel special.
Keep a text document on your computer, or make a folder for individual entry documents. Consider keeping your journal online as a private or public blog.;
, Some people keep a detailed log of everything that happens over the course of each day. Other people record their thoughts and visions in the form of sporadic notes and poetry. Still others prefer to draw their experiences, or to make ""mind maps,"" or to keep dream journals. Think about why you're doing this.


There is no right or wrong way to keep a journal of your life. It is your life, and it is your journal! It may help to take tips from other journal-keepers, but ultimately, you will develop your own style through practice.

, Find a quiet, peaceful place to sit and focus on your journal. Give yourself 10-15 minutes to write freely, uninhibited, without thinking too much about why you're writing what you're writing. Let the words flow from the top of your head, and do not read over what you've just written.Write about what you did today or what you plan to do tomorrow. Mention the places you went, the conversations you had, the things you learned, and the things that occupied your mind. This is a space to set down any practical details or information that you want to remember.Write about someone that's on your mind. Write about the things that are stressing you out or making you excited. Write about your dreams, your plans, your fears, your insecurities.
Try acknowledging the fact that you are starting your journal. If you can't think of anything else to write about, then write about the fact that this is your first journal entry. Write a page about why you've decided to keep this journal, what you hope to learn about yourself, and what it feels like to set your thoughts down on paper.

, Some people keep a daily journal, while others prefer to write once a week or even once a month. Start by giving yourself a schedule to get in the habit of writing.Commit to spending ten minutes writing in your journal every morning or every evening.Try writing ""Morning Pages,"" the creativity tool that Julia Cameron popularized in her book The Artist's Way. Each morning, before you do anything else, write three full pages, longhand, in a notebook. Don't check your work or think too much about what you're writing – just get it out.Try keeping a monthly check-in journal. At the end of each month, write an entry about the main events that happened. Explain what happened, what you loved, and what you learned. Track how you grow and develop each month.

, If you are pouring your deepest, most vulnerable thoughts into this book, then you probably don't want anyone else to pick it up and start reading. Carry the journal around with you for safety and convenience. Alternately, hide the book in your home or office: under your mattress, or behind other books in your bookshelf, or in a safe or lock-box. If you're keeping a digital journal, make sure to protect your documents with a password or save them to a hidden folder.

, Every once in a while, read over what you have written in your journal over the past few weeks or months. Flip through the journal entries that you wrote years ago. Compare the way that you thought about things then to the way that you think about things now. Remember the past so that you are better prepared for the future.


Notice how your journal entries sounded at a time when you felt sad, stuck, or frustrated in life. Try to catch yourself when you are writing like this so that you can do something about it.
Notice how you were writing at a time when you were happy and excited about the future. Think about how you can channel this feeling.

, Use your journal to explore the things that you would never tell another person. Be utterly honest with yourself, and don't hold anything back.Try not to correct yourself as you write. Don't sugarcoat anything. Write as though no one will ever read these words.

, Studies have indicated that writing in a journal can be a powerful way to process grief, trauma, and other emotional pains.Let your writing habit hold you up when you feel that everything is falling apart., Look for journal prompts on the Internet, ask a friend or a therapist for ideas, or try to come up with a few solid themes that you want to explore. Having a different question or journal prompt to answer each day can be a great way to keep up with writing. When you write to a prompt, you may feel more like you're writing to someone instead of just writing for yourself, and you may feel accountable to the journal structure. Consider these questions:


How would you like to be remembered? Are you proud of who you are?
What is a personality trait that you admire or seek in others – and why?
Think about something you feel obligated to do, daily or regularly. Why?
What is the best advice that you've ever received?

If your pens are different sizes, use the longest pen for you measurement.;
, This will leave room for the ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowances on all four sides., This will make the body of your pocket. You can use any type of fabric you want, but canvas, linen, or cotton will work the best., It needs to be the same width as the first two pieces of fabric, but about ⅔ of the height.This fabric can be the same color and pattern as the first two, or a coordinating one. Make sure that you use the same type of fabric, however., You want the excess elastic for extra support.The strap will wrap around the front and back covers of the journal. If you want a tighter fit, or if you want the strap to wrap around just the front cover, cut the elastic 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) shorter than your body pieces.The elastic can be any width you want, but it should be flat. Something around 5/8 inch (15.8 millimeters) would be ideal.
If you can, try to find a colored elastic that matches your fabric.

, Take the third, shortest piece of fabric. Turn it so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold one of the narrow ends down by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters). Press it flat with an iron.For a neater finish, and to reduce fraying, repeat this step., Sew as close to the top edge as you can. Snip the thread close to the side edges. You can use a matching thread color, or a contrasting one for a hint of design., Set one of the larger body pieces down, right-side-up. Place the pocket on top, also right-side-up. Make sure that the bottom and side edges are aligned. There will be a gap between the pocket's hemmed edge and the body's aw, top edge., Sew from the top, hemmed edge of the front pocket, all the way down to the bottom edge.How many slots you make is up to you, but make sure that the pens can fit. Remember to leave a ¼-inch gap on the left and right sides.

You can use a matching thread color or a contrasting one.
Skip this step if you want a simpler pen pouch with one pocket., Set the remaining body piece of down, right-side-up. Place the elastic on top. Make sure that it is centered and going lengthwise. You'll have about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) of excess elastic sticking up over the top and bottom of the fabric.

If you cut your elastic shorter, skip this step. You will be inserting the elastic a different way.

, Take the assembled front pocket. Place it down on top of the elastic, wrong-side-up. The front pouch should now be sandwiched between the two body pieces. Pin everything into place., Sew around both of the top, bottom, and one of the side edges. Sew around half of the other side edge. This will be your gap for turning. Use a matching thread color and ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowances.Snip the thread close to the edges when you are down sewing.

If you cut your elastic shorter, sew up the side edges instead. Leave the top and bottom edges open., Use a slender pair of scissors or a knitting needle to push out the corners. For a neater finish, clip the corners before turning the fabric., When you reach the gap, fold the raw edges inside so that they match up with the rest of the pocket. Press them flat with an iron.

Pull the elastic out of the way as you iron. Avoid ironing over the elastic.
If you cut you elastic shorter, tuck the ends of the elastic into the top and bottom openings by about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Pin them in place., Pin the gap shut, then top stitch around all four edges of the pen pocket, as close to the edges as you can. Pull the elastic out of the way as you sew so that the top stitching goes under it rather than over it.Snip the thread when you are done sewing.

Use a matching or contrasting thread color.
Backstitch a few times at the start and end of your sewing.

Be Ready.,

Tell what the inspiration was for this idea.,
Make it much more complex by adding things like observations, evidence, conclusion, etc.,
Use Them!",How to Keep an Idea Journal," Great ideas will come at any and all times, and you must be ready for them. Always walk around with a notebook and a pen in your pocket  so you can record it at a moments notice. When you get home, or whenever you have access to your computer, transfer the information onto a Word® Document. This Must be done in a specific order.;
, The theme is what the idea is about. The definition of theme is:  the subject of a talk, a person's thoughts . To properly show this, you must summarize the idea in one sentence; two at most. It's not easy to do, and it still sometimes causes trouble for experienced writers.

, If you forget what the inspiration was, the concept will no longer have the desired meaning it had to you. The definition of inspiration is: the process of being mentally stimulated to do or feel something . Your inspiration could be something as simple as a funny thing your friend said, or as complicated as an alien conspiracy theory that you read about.

, but I think that just makes it worse. If you are able to think of that much based off of one little moment, then you are way over thinking it. Keeping it short and sweet will ensure that you didn't add things later that you didn't experience in the moment. All that this will do, is give you a headache. And if you have a headache you won't be able to think straight, and that will screw up your thought process.
, Every twenty or so ideas, print the paper out and put it in a binder. Next time you have writer's block or just feel the urge to write something, just go back through and pick the idea that you want. When you use one of the ideas, don't rip it out! Simply put a check mark next to it, because you never know when you might need to use it again.

Use your own feelings and thoughts to interpret the dream.",How to Make a Dream Journal," If you already have a dream journal that you haven’t used recently, you can use it if there are enough pages left. You can also use any old notebook you have laying around. For some, picking out a new, fancy notebook can be exciting. A new notebook might also encourage you to actually use the notebook.If you have a notebook laying around that has been used for something else, but has lots of blank pages left, consider tearing the used pages out so you have a completely blank notebook.
It is important that your dream journal is only used for recording dreams and thoughts related to your dreams. It should not serve as a diary of to-do lists and life goals.;
, If you can’t afford a new notebook or don’t want to buy one, and you don’t have an extra one laying around, you can also use any old paper you have. If you have an old spiral notebook, a legal pad, or even just a few sheets of printer paper, these can all work.


The point is to have somewhere that you can quickly and easily record what you were dreaming about. You can staple the pages together or use a paper clip so that none of them get lost.
There are also smart phone apps that are dedicated to recording dreams that you can use.

, If you have purchased a plain notebook that you find a bit boring, or if you’re re-purposing an old notebook, you can decorate it to suit your tastes. You can use stickers, cut out pictures you like and glue them to the journal, decorate the journal using Washi tape, or even just doodle on the journal using markers. Decorate it however you like best.


If you’re happy with the appearance of your notebook, or if you simply don’t want to spend time decorating it then you don’t have to. This step is entirely optional.

, A dream journal won’t be useful if you wake up in the middle of the night and there is no pen handy. If you get up to find a pen, you may forget the dream in the few minutes it takes you to fine one. Make sure that you can easily attach a pen to the notebook. If the cover of the notebook is thin enough you can attach a pen using the clip that is on the lid of most pens.


If your dream journal has a thicker cover, you can also wrap a rubber band around the notebook to secure the pen on the edge between the front and back binding.
If your notebook comes with an elastic that keeps the notebook shut, then you can attach your pen using that. Instead of wrapping the elastic from top to bottom, stretch the elastic a bit more so that it is wrapped length-wise around the journal. You can then use the pen’s clip to secure it to the elastic. Placing the pen so it is between the front and back edges of the journal will keep it from sliding around.If you are purchasing a notebook, you can look for one that comes with a built-in elastic that is especially for a pen.

, If your pen and journal are not by the bed, the odds that you will record your dreams are small. Even if you are diligent about recording your dream later in the day, you are less likely to remember the details of the dream, if you remember it at all. Keep your journal and pen on the nightstand ready to go so that it will be the last thing you see before you fall asleep, and the first thing you see when you wake up.You could also keep a dim light on the nightstand, or get a pen with a light built-in so that you can see what you’re writing when you wake up to record a dream in the middle of the night.

, When you first wake, keep your eyes closed. Think about the last things you remember before you woke up, and try to follow what you remember backwards as far back in the dream as you can. Then, as soon as you’ve gotten as far back as you remember, open your eyes and start writing.If you do wake up in the middle of the night after a really interesting, good, or crazy dream, write it down right away. You may be certain you’ll remember it in the morning, but you’ll be sorry you didn’t if you wake up in the morning and have forgotten everything.
Your memories of your dream can fade quickly, so try not to let anything distract you. Get the main things you remember out quickly, and then try to remember more minute details.

, Writing dreams in the present tense may be helpful for remembering a few extra details that you had forgotten. If you are writing things in present tense (e.g. “I am feeling…,” “I am walking…,” “I am scared…”), you’re replaying the events of the dream in your head, kind of like a movie. You never know what new memories might pop up.If someone else in the dream is doing something, keep that in present tense as well, but stay in the first person. For example, if your significant other is in the dream, and he is running towards you, write down, “(Name of your significant other) is running towards me. He seems excited about something.”

, If you end up going back through your dreams to look for patterns, knowing exactly when you had the dream might be helpful. Years down the road, when you think back on what was going on in your life at a certain time, you may notice that your dreams coincided with how you were feeling, even if it wasn’t obvious at the time.You should also give your dream a title. The title should be a short summary of the whole dream. This will also help you find the dream later on. For example, if you had a dream about flying, and you were on a magic carpet, you could title the dream, “Flying Like Aladdin.”

, You should write down any little detail that you can think of, even if it isn’t a fully-formed thought.Writing it down might help you remember a few more details. If you consistently write it down, you might notice that this small glimpse is something you commonly see.


For example, perhaps in your dream you remember seeing a small rainbow beach ball, but cannot remember where you are, where you saw the ball, or where the ball came from. Just make a bullet point in your journal that says, “I am seeing a small rainbow beach ball.” If you want, you can make a note that you don’t remember anything more about the context of the dream. You can even just write the words “rainbow beach ball,” if you want.

, Although you may not be able to remember your dreams every single day, you should still try to be as consistent as possible. If you can’t remember anything about your dreams of the night before, then maybe just spend a few minutes writing down any thoughts and feelings that you woke up with.Being consistent will help your mind understand that this is a habit, and may make it easier to remember your dreams over time.

, Before you go to sleep, it can be helpful to write a few lines in your dream journal about what you did that day, the thoughts that are going through your mind, etc. This can help you make sense of your dreams later on. Often, if you spend time comparing your dream to what you were thinking about before bed time, you may notice that similar themes appear. For example, if you were worrying about a big exam, and then you have a dream where you show up naked for class one day then you can see that your dream might have been influenced by your exam stress.

, Think about all the activities you took part in, the people you saw, and any television shows you might have watched. Your subconscious sometimes takes things that have gone on recently, and links them to other things in your subconscious. If someone you saw recently showed up in your dreams, write down the last time you saw them. It may not be immediately helpful, but writing down this information might help you identify patterns and themes over time.

, There are lots of theories about why we dream, but scientists aren’t really sure what the purpose of dreaming is.Although many scientists say that dreaming serves no real purpose, it can still be fun and interesting to look into what your dreams are trying to tell you. Many people believe that interpreting dreams can provide a glimpse into what is going on in your unconscious mind.You can do an internet search for, “what does my dream mean?” and find lots of websites that offer free dream dictionaries. You can also look for books that offer interpretations of dreams. If you are using a website, try to compare the meanings you find among several dream dictionaries to see if they are similar.

, If, in your internet search, you find something that you think is really interesting, and that makes sense to you, write it down in your journal.


Writing everything you find interesting can be very helpful when looking for themes and patterns.

, While you can use a dream dictionary to find out what your dreams mean, it is also a good idea to spend time reflecting on what it means to you. You may associate a certain action with a traumatizing memory, or an object with a very good memory. It is important to remember that dreams are not objective.For example, think of things you saw in the dream. This could be places, objects, people, or anything that you could see in your dream. How do the things that you saw in your dream make you feel? Is there any special meaning attached to something in your dream?
For example, if, in your dream, you saw your deceased grandmother holding a necklace that was passed down to you, you can think about how you feel about this necklace. Maybe you feel sad when you see it because it makes you miss your grandmother, or maybe you feel happy when you see it because you have many good memories with her. Perhaps you are missing your grandma more than usual, and this is your brain’s way of reminding you that you have something left of her in your possession.

Consider a regular notebook for use as a wine journal.,
Purchase a ringed binder for increased organization.,

, Another option is to purchase a ringed binder with a set of dividers. This will allow you to group wines by style or region; for example, you could have separate tabs for reds, whites, and rosé.

, These are more expensive than blank notebooks, but include pre-printed spaces for recording information about each wine. A popular and widely available wine journal is available from Moleskin in their ""Passions"" series of notebooks.

Add a summer bucket list at the front of the journal.,
Use the journal as a writing prompt.,
Keep a note of your travels.,
Draw in your summer journal.,
Finish the summer journal at the end of summer.",How to Keep a Summer Journal," It should be light, sturdy and have sufficient pages for your writing style. There are plenty of journals available in stores or you could even salvage something from your home among the notebooks you already have.

If you want to decorate the journal, do so either at the start or as an ongoing project.
Ensure that the journal is ready for summertime. This means getting started in spring, sourcing and preparing it for use.;
, Be sure to have it whenever you go away for a weekend or for extended vacations, as it is easier to write up the day's events on the same day or weekend than ages after it has happened. You don't have to write enormous amounts, just as much or as little as you'd like., You can even record the temperature if you like but at least mention whether it's sunny, cool, warm, hot, raining, windy, etc., as the weather can impact how you're feeling and be behind the activities you do and events that you experience.

Some people like to draw an image as well, such as of the sun, sun with cloud, sun with rain, just rain, just clouds, etc. This can add to the fun of putting the summer journal together each day, as you can see at a glance what the weather was like for each entry.

, Keep the memories alive by taking photos of the things you're doing to include the best ones in your journal. They only need to be printed off, you don't need photo quality paper unless you'd like this. Use your phone or a camera for the photos and if you're doing water-related activities so common to summertime, ensure that the item used for photos is waterproof., You can include stamps from theme/national/water park, etc. visits, ticket stubs, pieces of wrapping paper from food/gifts/purchases, etc. and any other small, fine memento items that can fit into the journal without making it too bulky. These can be nice ways to recall fun things you did, ate, bought or saw.

Postcards can be fun to include, especially since they are often taken by professional photographers and put together by designers with added features such as location, phrases and explanations.
Add some maps if you traveled anywhere. These can help you to see where you went and as time goes on, they become vintage and fun to look at.

, Add in words for the things you've experienced, along with such words as Sun, sunny, month names, emotional descriptions, people's names, etc., They can write a page or two of their own experience of a visit or trip you've done together, or even just of days spent together lazing around the house, garden, park or pool. In years to come, their impressions will be enjoyable to read too., You can spend all of summer aiming to achieve everything on that bucket list. Check it off as you do each thing and set a reward if you manage the whole list by the end of summer.

Another nice idea for a list is a summer gratitude list. What things are you grateful for each day of summer? Try to write out three things a day!

, Summer is a great time to improve your writing skills and to practice grammar, creative writing and other writing related skills you need to improve upon. You can add writing prompts, ideas and exercises to the summer journal as a form of inspiration to help you to keep improving. Perhaps you'll become inspired enough to write a poem, short story or even a novel about your summer experiences., If you're going on a trip during summer, keep a note of each day's date and what you did that day. Even if you're too tired to write out your feelings of each experience, at least document what you did so that you remember and can come back to it later to write about the experiences more fully. After many days of summer begin to melt into each other, this can be a really helpful exercise to get used to., If you enjoy drawing, draw the things you see during summer that represent summer the best for you. This might include the ocean, the sunshine, the trees in full leaves, the animals, the happy faces of people, etc. Or, it could be abstract or anything else you prefer.

If you don't like drawing much, consider doing some coloring-in sheets that reflect the theme of summer, cutting them down to size and gluing them into your summer journal.

, Consider using the last entry to outline the ""Highlights of Summer "" and list out what you consider were the standout happenings, experiences and feelings of your summer. Ensure that the date year is added to the front of the journal, along with ""My Summer"" or something similar, so that you know what it is when searching for it later. Place it on your bookshelf or some other safe place, where it can be easily retrieved for reliving the memories at will."

Paste the wine label into the wine journal.,
Record each wine's basic information.,
Record the circumstances in which you tasted the wine.,
Make tasting notes on each wine.",How to Keep a Wine Journal2," One of the most enjoyable aspects of keeping a wine journal is being able to save the label from each bottle. Wine labels can usually be removed by baking the bottle in the oven for a bit and then peeling the label away with a razor blade.

, At the top of each page, you'll want to record the wine's vineyard, vintage, and grape varieties. These are the most important pieces of information if you'll want to hunt the same wine down later for a second tasting.

, You may also want to record the date that you sampled the wine and with whom you tasted it. This will allow you to organize the wine journal chronologically and can help you remember a certain wine based on where and when you consumed it.

, Of course, this is the chief reason to keep a wine journal. Record any thoughts on the wine's bouquet, mouthfeel, taste, finish, and appearance. If the flavor reminds you of another wine, make a note of that association. Most importantly, take notes on whether or not you enjoyed the wine.

Write about something that freaks you out.,
Use an interesting setting as inspiration.,
Explore a hidden or forgotten moment in history.,
Put a new spin on a classic theme.,
Do a writing challenge.",How to Be Creative in Your Writing1," You can be creative with your writing by choosing topics that will inspire you and motivate you. Writing about a topic that scares you or freaks you out can infuse your prose with passion, humor, and tension. Maybe you choose to write about your worst fear or about your biggest moment of anxiety in your life. Focusing on a subject that makes you uncomfortable can force you to get creative and write through your fears on the page.For example, maybe you have a fear of heights and decide to explore this topic in your writing. You can try to channel your fear and anxiety into a non-fiction piece about how you have been challenged by your fear of heights in your life and how you have managed to overcome it or work around it.;
, You can also get inspired to be creative in your writing by choose an interesting setting and sitting down to write in this setting. Bring your pen and paper with you so you can take notes as you observe what is going on around you. Use the setting as inspiration and get creative as you take notes.For example, you may choose a unique setting like your local zoo or the arrivals area of the airport. You may then write down your observations and pay attention to how people interact with each other and the setting. You may then use some of your observations or even the conversations you overhear as raw material you can use creatively in your writing.

, You can also look to history for ways to get creative in your writing. You may do research at your local library or online to find forgotten moments in history. You may narrow down your research to a particular group of people in history or a particular time period and dig around for events or figures in history that have been forgotten or ignored.For example, maybe you feel inspired to research the role of Native Americans in United States history. You may then use resources at your local library and online to look for stories of Native American historical figures that you can explore in your writing.

, You should be creative with how you choose the themes you write about in your work. Though there are many classic themes out there that appear in writing all the time, you should try to put a new spin on familiar themes so your writing feels unique and creative. You may use a classic theme as a jumping off point and see how you can approach it from a new or different angle.For example, you may decide to write about the classic theme: “love and friendship.” You may then consider how you can approach this classic theme in a way that feels unique to you. Perhaps you recall a childhood moment where you betrayed a best friend and explore this classic theme in a darker, more cynical way.

, You can push yourself to being more creative by setting up a writing challenge for yourself. You may make your own writing challenge or do a writing challenge with other writers. This could force you to get creative at least once a day or for a set period of time.


For example, you may challenge yourself to write 500 words of creative writing a day. This could be adding words to an existing story you are writing or writing short stories or scenes.
You could also do at least one creative writing prompt a day, devoting 30 minutes to one prompt or to multiple prompts. You may then challenge yourself to turn the prompts into stories or longer form pieces.
A fun challenge could also be to write a story and then destroy it. Doing this could help you let go of your ideas and force you to come up with new, creative ideas on a consistent basis.

"
Make your character’s backstory distinct.,
Give your characters unique physical markers.,
Have your characters use specialized language.,
Give your main character a unique narrative voice.",How to Be Creative in Your Writing2," You should try to create a history, or backstory, for a character that is distinct and detailed. Characters with detailed backstories are often more interesting to read about and come across more developed. Creating interesting backstories for your characters will also require you to get creative.You may decide to do character profiles of each character that includes the major details of their lives, from their profession to their favorite color to their favorite food. Though you likely will not use all of the details in the profiles in your writing, knowing more about your characters than the reader does will make them feel well-rounded and detailed.You may also create backstories for characters that focus on distinct traits, such as a preference for a particular music star or a fear of caterpillars that stems back to childhood. Adding distinct traits to your character’s backstories will allow you to get creative and think of interesting details you can give your characters.

, You should strive to create characters who feel unique and distinct on the page, as this is how your writing will stand out and feel creative. Whether you are writing fiction, non-fiction, memoir, or poetry, you should have characters who are going to be memorable to your readers. One way of doing this to give your character physical markers that are unique and make them stand out.For example, maybe you have a character who has a distinct scar on her neck. This scar may be a symbol of trauma she experienced as a child and make her stand out in group settings around other characters. You should describe your character’s scar to the reader so they know it is important to the story and so they remember the character’s physical marker.

, You can also create strong characters that are interesting and unique by giving them specialized language. This could be slang, a regional vernacular, or a distinct way of combining English with other languages. Having your characters express themselves in a certain language or style can really deepen their character and allow you to get creative.For example, maybe you have a character who grew up in a household where Spanish and English were spoken by her parents. She may then speak a mixture of Spanish and English when she is with her friends and try to use “proper” English when she is in school. Having these different languages for her character can give her more depth and range as a character in your story.

, You can also get creative with your characters by considering how they might describe an object or an event from their point of view. You could then create a voice for your character that feels distinct on the page and use this voice when your character is narrating the story. Giving your main character a unique narrative voice will add depth and creativity to your writing, especially if your story is in the first person.You may consider how you can make the main character’s narrative voice distinct using punctuation, such as a character who uses question marks a lot. Or you have use certain words or terms when you are writing in the voice of the character.

"
"
Avoid cliches.,
Use metaphors and similes.,
Create unique imagery.,
Play with the way words sound on the page.",How to Be Creative in Your Writing3," One of the golden rules of writing creatively is to always avoid using cliches. Cliches are phrases that have been used so often they have lost their meaning. Using cliches in your writing will leave your reader feeling bored, disinterested, and generally unimpressed with your ability to stick to the familiar. Try to banish cliches from your writing and focus instead on creating unique, unfamiliar descriptions in your work.There are many cliches out there and often it can be hard to avoid using them. A good rule of thumb is if you feel you have heard or read a phrase before, it may be a cliche. You can find a list of common cliches on Be a Better Writer.com.

, Two of the more common literary devices used in writing are metaphors and similes. These two literary devices can help you go for strong word choice and come up with creative descriptions. You should try to use these devices in your writing to add depth and meaning.A metaphor is the comparison of one thing to another. In a metaphor, the two things appear unrelated, but in fact, they share common characteristics that only make sense once they are placed side by side.For example, “The new girl is a fierce tiger.”
A simile makes a comparison between two objects or subjects using “like “or “as”. In a simile, the comparison is direct, unlike the more hidden comparison in a metaphor.For example, “The new girl is as fierce as a tiger.”

, You can also use strong, unique imagery in your writing to make it more creative. Imagery uses sensory detail, such as how things sound, feel, taste, feel, and look, to add depth and meaning. You should try to include imagery in your writing to push yourself to be more creative.Consider how you can describe a scene using the senses. Try to have your characters experience a scene based on how it smells, feels, tastes, sounds, and looks.
You should also try to use contrasting images to create interesting imagery in your writing. For example, you may describe a character as appearing ""bright in the cold moonlight"" or an object that appears ""shiny in the darkness of the night.""

, You should consider how you can use certain words together on the page to make your writing appealing orally. Use your creativity to play with how words sound on the page in your writing. Consider how certain words might create a certain rhythm or cadence to your writing.You may decide to use alliteration in your writing to play with the way words sound. Alliteration is the repetition of consonant sounds at the beginning of words placed close together. For example, “Don’t drive drunk” or “The crazy cat crouched over the crib.”
You could also use onomatopoeia in your writing. Onomatopoeia refers to words that sound like the object or subject that the word is describing. For example, “The skateboard whizzed by”, or “The rain dripped down the window.”

"
Listen to music.,
Do meditation.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Be Creative in Your Writing4," You can get your creativity flowing by putting on a piece of music that you find inspiring and engaging. You may listen to this music before you sit down to write or have it playing in the background as you are writing. You could also draw inspiration from the music for your writing and use it to be more creative in your work.Music genres like classical and jazz are popular choices for sparking creativity. Classical music and jazz music often do not have words or lyrics, making them more open to interpretation. You may find that certain classical or jazz compositions help you tap into your creativity and feel inspired.

, You may also find it easier to tap into your creativity if you do meditation. Meditation can help you relax and focus. Guided meditation can also allow you to tap into certain subject matter or certain ideas you may have about your writing.You may decide to do concentration mediation, where you focus your thoughts on a specific topic or idea. Or, you may decide to try mindful meditation, where you calm your nerves and relax to prepare for a creative writing session.

, You should also ensure that you get enough sleep, at least eight hours every night, to help you focus and be creative. Studies have shown the first few moments of waking up can actually be some of the most creative moments of your day.You should be well rested to ensure your brain is ready to get creative every day.


You can get enough sleep by sticking to a consistent sleep schedule everyday, even on weekends. You should also maintain a healthy diet and do exercise to ensure your body gets tired when it is supposed to.

Choose a topic that you're knowledgeable about.,
Decide on a call to action.,
Make sure you answer the question.,
Think about length.,
Give examples.,
Consider all the question words.,
Avoid generalizations.,
Use adjectives and adverbs.,
Use proper nouns.,
Use time-sensitive words.,
Show, don't tell.,
Know when to paraphrase.,
Expand your vocabulary.,
Avoid over-complicated syntax.",How to Be Specific," The more you know about something, the easier it will be to conjure up specific images and facts.If you're not knowledgeable about your topic, do some research so you can talk or write about it with more detail. If you are trying to be specific for an assignment, you'll probably need to do research.
If you're still not feeling confident in your abilities, look for ways that you can connect the topic to something you are more familiar with, or try to think of a sub-topic that you are more comfortable with. For example, if you have been assigned to talk about climate change, you could choose to talk about a particular aspect that you can connect with on a personal level, such as your love of polar bears and the danger that climate change will threaten their habitats.;
, This may sound complicated, but all it means is narrowing the focus of your argument and clearly stating what action you want people to take -- in other words, the purpose for your writing or speech. Whether you're telling a fictional story or making a philosophical argument, think about how you want people to feel and react. Don't lose sight of this objective as you continue to write or speak.""Call to action"" is a term typically used in marketing, but it can be used to apply to any kind of speaking or writing. No matter what the topic, think about your essay or speech as a marketing tool meant to convey a specific message and get people to react in a specific way.
Common purposes include: informing, persuading, recommending, arguing, advocating, explaining, instructing, and defending.
For example, if you have chosen to write about polar bears and climate change, your call to action might be related to the actions your audience can take to reduce the effects of climate change.

, If you are responding to a question, rebutting someone else's argument, or completing an assignment, think carefully about the specifics of the question you need to answer. It's okay to add some additional information on top of what was asked of you, but first you need to make sure your response thoroughly answers the specific question.Think about which question word or words were used in the question. For example, if you were asked to describe what you do at work, it can be very easy to get sidetracked by talking about related topics, such as how you perform your job or why you chose your career path. This information might be interesting or important to your audience, but don't forget to answer the question first.

, If you have to write a certain number of words or speak for a certain amount of time, make sure you are able to fit all of the most important information into your argument. If length is not dictated, think carefully about your message, your topic, and your audience to determine the appropriate length. You should aim to provide all the information your audience needs without challenging their attention spans.Consider using the inverted pyramid style, which prioritizes the most essential information, and leaves less important details for the end, if you are concerned about your audience's attention span. This is not appropriate for every style of writing or speaking, but if you need to communicate a few key points, it can be a helpful tool.
If you have extra time or space that you need to fill, don't just add in extra words that don't provide any additional detail or insight. Instead, look for places where your audience would benefit from more detail, or try thinking of another connection you can make or another example you can cite.
Provide background information only if it's relevant. Irrelevant details will make your whole argument seem less directed., Whether you are speaking or writing, your purpose will usually be to make an argument, and you will need examples to support that argument in order to make your audience believe it. Evidence is crucial to being specific.Examples are explicitly stated in some formats, like political debates and research papers, and can be introduced directly by saying something such as, ""For example."" In other genres, such as creative writing, examples are more implicit. You may, for example, need to describe what a character is wearing and where she likes to shop for clothing, in order to communicate to your audience that she is fashionable.
While examples are essential, be careful not to overwhelm your audience. If you provide too many unrelated examples, your audience might lose track of your main point. You can avoid this by carefully evaluating all of the details you plan on using for each example and making sure there is always a direct connection back to your main argument.

, Unless the topic of your message is very narrow, you will usually want to answer who, what, when, and where. This is especially important in business communications. If you need something from someone, you will need to communicate what you need, who needs to do it, when it needs to be done, and where it needs to be done.How and why may or may not be important, depending on your message. Think carefully about how your audience will interpret your message, and never assume that they will know what you mean unless you tell them.

, Generalizations often end up in writing when you aren't sure what else to say. Common examples include ""Since the beginning of time"" or ""People think..."" These statements are usually too abstract and general to be helpful, and because they make such sweeping statements, they're also likely to be untrue.For example, instead of beginning an essay by saying ""Modern life has deteriorated because of technology,"" you might say ""According to some experts, technology has caused communication problems between people and increased loneliness.""

, Descriptive words will help your audience understand exactly what it is you are talking about and make it more interesting for them to continue reading or listening. However, you don't want to go overboard with these, as they may be redundant or lack impact.Think about how others might visualize the words you are using. If your words do not create a clear picture in your audience's head, chances are your language is too vague. For example, if you just say, ""The man went to his house,"" your audience will not know what to imagine. If you say, ""The tired old man went to his dark, empty house,"" your reader will be better able to imagine the scene. However, the sentence ""She stuttered haltingly as she spoke"" uses an adverb inappropriately. ""Stuttered"" already includes the idea of halting speech, so the adverb is redundant -- or ""fluff,"" in creative writing lingo.If you're not sure whether or not your language is descriptive enough, read it to some of your peers and ask them to judge you on how you've done. Ask them where you were lacking in detail or where your language was not clear.
Instead of describing every single object you mention, focus on the ones that are most important to your message.

, Leave no room for confusion in your message by referencing names, titles, and places whenever possible., Make sure your audience understands exactly when something needs to be done by using specific terms like ""on Monday"" or ""before 4:30 EST"" instead of more vague terms like ""next week"" or ""soon."", For creative writing, use descriptive words and phrases based on all five senses: sight, smell, taste, hearing, and touch. This can also be useful for other types of writing and speaking because it will allow your audience to experience the situation themselves and draw their own conclusions.For example, the sentence ""Deshawn was very happy"" is not very detailed. It does not give the reader any idea of what Deshawn's happiness feels like. Instead, try something like ""Deshawn felt his heart hammer in his chest as he rushed down the street to find his friend. He couldn't wait to share his good news."" This concrete, specific detail about how Deshawn feels allows the reader to understand those emotions better.
In order to describe things in detail, you need to learn to observe them in detail. If this is difficult for you, practice paying attention to the tiny details involved in an everyday task, keeping all five senses in mind.

, If you are referencing someone else, consider using an exact quote. This works best when the quote is clear and succinct. If your source is difficult to understand or unnecessarily complicated, consider paraphrasing in order to better communicate the specific relevancy to the point you are trying to make.Dialogue is essential to plot development and characterization in creative writing, so write it out instead of paraphrasing the conversation., A broad vocabulary will help you communicate better because it will give you access to more words, allowing you to choose the one that conveys the exact details you were looking for.


Complex words are the right choice for some situations, but you should avoid using language that your audience will not understand. Remember, the main point is to effectively communicate your message, not to flaunt your vocabulary. You should also be cautious about using technical jargon if your audience is not likely to be familiar with it.Dictionaries and thesauruses are very helpful tools if you are looking for the right word to describe something. If you are not sure if you are using a word correctly, always use a dictionary to check.

, Make sure to place words in the correct order and use proper sentence structure so that your words will flow together. This will make things seem more clear and concise.For example, compare the following sentences:


""Industrial spying, because of the growing use of computers to store and process corporate information, is increasing rapidly."" This is not clear, because the subordinate clause interrupts the main idea.
""Industrial spying is increasing rapidly because of the growing use of computers to store and process corporate information."" This is clear, because the main idea is presented first.

Avoid chit-chat.,
Avoid clunkers.,
Avoid accents.,
Avoid internal dialogue.,
Avoid mimicking real conversations.",How to Avoid Common Mistakes when Writing Dialogue," When readers are skimming along through a novel, the word ""said"" is just like a punctuation mark. Usually, this tag is easier to use, because it doesn't require you to have a long list of vocabulary words, so-to-speak.
, Having a large vocabulary is a good thing, especially when writing fiction. But when it comes to dialogue tags, this is not always recommended.

For example: ""Maddie,"" he opined, ""I love you."" The previous statement made by the fictitious character is completely fine, but many readers would be most interested by the word ""opined."" That's not a good thing. Your reader must be focused on the dialogue that moves the story forward, not the tags used in the dialogue.

, When it is necessary to use different words as tags, that is fine. But instead, if you need an attribution, use said. If you must use something different for the occasional question, you could toss in asked"".
, In dialogue, you will probably be most likely to have two characters repeat each other's names over and over, just so that you can help the reader identify who's talking. Stop right there. It might be problematic if you are trying to give hints to the reader to let him know who is talking in the story through dialogue., What this means is that you should make a character do something, and immediately after that, make the character say something. It will give the reader an idea about who's talking. For example: Jack trailed his finger along the railing. ""I'm sorry.""  Sally nodded. ""I accept your apology."", We get plenty of this in real life, but in fiction? This is a no-no. Shorten your character's sentences to avoid him/her sounding like a know-it-all.

If you don't like the way your character is speaking, review your character notes. The way the character speaks depends on the character's personality.

, The worst offender here is dialogue with backstory or exposition. For example: ""Do you remember when I had to pay my bill on time?"" Why is this character saying this? Why is it relevant to the story? Most of the time, backstory should be eased into the story as time goes forward, not through dialogue., While great dialogue is great when it is diversified with the characters, too much of this is as bad as a football player playing soccer. When in doubt, tell the reader that the character had a ""a lovely Scottish burr,"" or ""a British accent with a flourish."" This makes the reader develop their own sense of this., Remember, giving a character the quality of thinking is a good thing, but don't overdo it.  Too much thinking can slow the story's pace, particularly when the character thinks and thinks and just keeps thinking about the same thing throughout the story. What's the point? We want answers! Not thinking., Yes, making dialogue sound real is awesome! But at times, it isn't. Real people stutter, burp, sniffle, and more throughout their sentences. Don't add all of this into your dialogue. It's just distracting and choppy. It even makes the character sound like he's lying."

Figure out if you have time to keep a journal.,
Decide on a file format.,
Decide where and how you will store it.,
Once a file type and method of storage is decided on, outline how it will be organised.,
Start writing!

,
Add your own personality!",How to Keep a Cyber Journal," If not, make time, it can be very rewarding. Decide when you intend to write in it, morning, during the day, or at night.;
, Everything stored on a computer has its own file format, or the type of information and how it is stored. The most open format that will work on nearly anything is .txt (plain text) but doesn't allow for any formatting and some computers don't show it well. HTML is a form of the plain text format that can be shown in a web browser (it's used for coding web pages) and allows nearly endless formatting opportunities, but requires a little knowledge in HTML code, but will work on nearly any device. Other formats are .odt, .doc, .docx, .xhtml, and others. Research them to find out what will best fit your needs.

, Some people simply save their entries to a computer or a flash drive. Burning a CD is inefficient as each file will be very small, so it's better to wait until you have many entries before considering that. Some people choose to encrypt their journal in order to keep it private.

, This can seem like a tedious and pointless step, but after a few years of entries a way of organising is required and it is far easier to make one beforehand.

,, You don't have to do all of these!

They cut to the chase and make their point in the simplest language possible. Sometimes it's best to break longer sentences into 2-3 smaller ones.



Original Sentence: ""The philosophy of Existentialism resists descending into the lofty, theoretical arguments that plagued many early philosophies, and thus gains it’s power.""

""Existentialism became powerful because, unlike earlier, more theoretical philosophies, it is grounded and practical.""



Original Sentence: ""Was the bomb not to ever come to being, America might never have overcome the long, drawn out war in the Pacific.""

""Who knows how long the US would have had to fight in the Pacific without the bomb.""



Original Sentence: ""Wandering in the desolate wilderness, Dave sat on a dusty, crepuscular rock and thought about his past while drinking from his almost empty canteen.""

""Tired of aimless wandering, Dave sat on a dusty boulder to rest. He opened his canteen, but there were only a few drops left. Tired and thirsty, his mind drifted to his past.""



, People are visual animals - we see things when we read and orient ourselves with images. Give your reader enough specifics to visualize your writing whether you're writing stories, scripts, or speeches. Use 1-2 powerful images or senses to put the reader in your scene, paragraph, or shoes.


I felt tired → ""My arms and muscles trembled, and my eyelids fluttered shut no matter how hard I tried to stay awake.""Gina is a nice woman. → ""Gina was the kind of woman who baked you a plate of cookies (hot, gooey, smelling like home), just because you said you had a rough day.""
To him, the city was terrible. → ""He couldn't stand the city - the endless lights, the clatter of cars and pavement, the way all eyes turned downward when you looked at them as if you were the ugliest man in Manhattan and not just another stranger.""

, Comparing two things, either with a metaphor, simile, or direct comparison, helps your reader make connections and deepens your writing. It gives them something to hold onto that they already understand, which helps them understand your writing. You can even make connections to your own stories, like in the third example here:""In many ways he was like America itself, big and strong, full of good intentions, a roll of fat jiggling at his belly, slow of foot but always plodding along, always there when you needed him, a believer in the virtues of simplicity and directness and hard labor"" (The Things They Carried, Tim O'Brien).
""Like the waters of the river, like the motorists on the highway, and like the yellow trains streaking down the Santa Fe tracks, drama, in the shape of exceptional happenings, had never stopped there"" (In Cold Blood, Truman Capote).
""Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice"" (One-Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez).
“For poems are like rainbows; they escape you quickly"" (The Big Sea, Langston Hughes).

, Adverbs, the words that end in -ly and modify actions, are the bane of many great writers. They give a sing-song feel to writing and bog down the meaning of a sentence in useless little modifications. Notice how, in most cases, the adverbs and filler words (like ""really"" or ""very"") don't add a lot to the sentences.


""Jaime was really sorry, and ran quickly over to his friend's house just to apologize.""
""What's up?"" She asked, happily. ""Nothing much,"" he answered tiredly.She picked her face absently and said, ""I wanted to talk about something."" ""I don't have time,"" he responded curtly.


, Great paragraphs should be self-contained. They have a beginning, middle, and end. Otherwise, they don't actually move the story or essay along. Thought of another way, every paragraph and scene should end in a different place than where it started.Ernest Hemingway was the master of economy. It is hard to find an extra paragraph or scene in any of his short stories or books. Everything adds up.

Great journalism is a good way to see how each smaller part pushes the story forward. Read your favorite newspaper, but stop after every paragraph -- what did it accomplish?
Though not strictly a paragraph, Shakespearean monologues are a masterclass in growth and power in a short span. Listen to Hamlet's famous first monologue -- note how different he is in beginning and end.

, Sometimes, the best way to get your point across is a long, winding sentence that packs in a multitude of meaning. Occasionally, you really do need adverbs and silly filler words to make a point perfectly. A direct point can be better than an indirect comparison. Sometimes a paragraph is there to provide tone, to slow down the pacing, or pause on a beautiful description, even if it ""accomplishes"" nothing., You may prefer to write a new short scene every day, or work on a long-term, writing project. You might have a daily minimum of one paragraph, or an entire page. But if you take any advice from this page, stick to one important habit: write every single day.


If you can't find room in your schedule, try getting up early or going to bed late, even if you can only spare fifteen minutes.

, Don't be so afraid to write something ""bad"" that you end up staring at a blank document.Getting anything on the page at all can help you get started. Write about how you're stuck and can't think of something to write, or describe an object in the room in painfully exhaustive detail, or rant about something that irritates you. A few minutes of this will often put you in ""writing mode"" and lead you to another idea.


Look online, in bookstores, or in libraries for collections of writing prompts. These are designed to give you a starting point to work from, and are often ridiculous to spark your imagination and get you started.

, If you've been writing for a while, chances are good that you keep getting drawn back to a particular style, topic, or format. Practicing a favorite type of writing is a great way to keep yourself motivated, but make an effort to vary your writing exercises once in a while. Deliberately tackling new and difficult challenges is vital for improvement in any field.Try these challenges as exercises, whether or not you're interested in polishing the end result:


If your writing projects or your narrators all sound similar, try a different style. Imitate another author, or combine the styles of two authors.If most of your writing is for a blog, or for one long project, take a break from it. Think of a topic that could never fit into your usual writing project, and write about it. (For a followup challenge, rewrite the piece so it could fit into your project.)

, Invite feedback on your writing, and offer to read other writers' drafts. Welcome honest criticism offered as advice for improvement, but keep your writing away from friends who act dismissive or negative.There's a big difference between useful critique, and disheartening negativity.


Look for online communities such as Scribophile or WritersCafe, or search for a more niche community on a specific type of writing.
Check your local library and community centers for information on local writing clubs.
You could even practice writing on a wiki, such as wikiHow or Wikipedia. This lets you help people as you practice, and might be one of the largest communal writing projects you ever undertake.

, If you have trouble getting around to your writing projects, make a commitment to other people to give yourself external motivation. Get a pen pal to write letters to on a regular schedule, or start a blog with weekly updates. Find a writing contest a few weeks in the future, and promise to submit an entry. Join a writing challenge, whether that's a single writing session with a group of friends, or NaNoWriMo's annual ""novel in a month"" extravaganza.

, The first draft of a story always has room for improvement, and often ends up looking quite different after a few revisions.Once you've written a piece that attracts your attention, go through the ""finished"" piece of writing and find sentences, paragraphs, or whole pages you're dissatisfied with. Rewrite a scene from a different character's perspective, try out alternative plot developments, or change the order of events. If you're not sure why you dislike a passage, rewrite it without referring to the original, then see what you like best in each version.


Scrapping a beloved passage and starting again can be incredibly tough, so much so that writers have been phrasing this advice as ""murder your darlings"" for over a century., Writers have a passion for the written word, and there's no better way to stoke that passion than to read. Read as widely as possible, from magazines to young adult novels to history dissertations, although you don't need to feel pressure to finish everything you pick up.Reading builds vocabulary, teaches grammar, provides inspiration, and shows you what can be done with language. For the beginning writer, reading may be just as important as the actual writing.If you're not sure what to read, ask for recommendations from friends, or visit a library and pick a couple books from each section.

, While you're reading, keep a dictionary and thesaurus on hand, or write down unfamiliar words to look up later. World class writers have argued over whether to use simple words, or employ sesquipedalian verbiage. That's something for you to decide in your own writing, but not before you learn which tools are available.


Dictionary definitions often don't provide an intuitive sense of how to use a word. Search for the word online and read it in context to get a better understanding.

, Sure, there are plenty of famous, excellent books written in non-standard grammar, but learning grammar isn't just about memorizing a set of rules. Studying how a sentence is put together, and how punctuation is used to structure it, gives you the knowledge you need to express yourself the way you intend. If you think this may be a weak point for you, study an English textbook, or find a writing tutor.



Learn how to write without informal grammar if you are not used to formal, written English.
If you have a question about grammar, refer to a grammar book, such as The American Heritage Book of English Usage.

, Just as you change your clothing for the weather and the occasion, you should also change your writing for your audience and your message. Flowery writing, for example, might fit better in a poem than in a status report. Make sure that your word choice and sentence length is not too difficult (or too simplistic) for your audience, if you are addressing a specific group. Avoid specialized jargon when speaking to someone unfamiliar with the topic.

, While thinking about what to write, put down any idea that comes to you, even if it seems far-fetched or unlikely to be successful. One mediocre idea may lead to a better one.

, Find a topic that grabs your attention and thrills you. Your excitement and interest will make it easier for you to keep the project going and keep it to a high standard, and hopefully it will rub off on the reader as well.

, A serious writing project doesn't need to be a full-length book. Crafting a short story can be a difficult and rewarding challenge, and may be a more time-effective way to practice your skills.

, Keep a notebook for writing down observations, overheard conversations, and sudden ideas encountered in your daily life. When you read or hear something that makes you laugh, think, or want to repeat it to someone else, write it down and think about what makes it effective.


You may use this notebook to write down unfamiliar words as well.

, Use whatever technique works best for you, or try out several if you don't have an established process yet. You can make an outline, put a collection of notes on cards and arrange them until they are in order, or draw a tree or map. Your outline may have nothing but a rough order of the events or topics covered, or it may be a more detailed scene-by-scene summary. Building some kind of structure in advance can help keep you going on days when you're feeling low on creativity.There are many types of organizational software for writers, such as Scrivener or TheSage.
It's fine to deviate from your plan, but if you abandon it entirely, stop and consider the reasons behind the chance. Build a new plan to guide you through the altered work, and keep you thinking consciously about how you want to get through it.

, While a work of nonfiction requires you to know your subject, even a fiction book will benefit from research. If your main character is a glassblower, read a book on glassblowing and use the right terminology. If you are writing a book set before you were born, interview people who lived during that time, or who spoke to parents and grandparents who did.


In the case of fiction writing, you may be able to dive in to the first draft before you start your research.

, Try writing without pause for as long as you can. Do not stop to change your word choice or correct your grammar, spelling, or punctuation. This is one of the most common recommendations for making sure that you actually finish what you start.

, Once you have a first draft, reread it and rewrite it. You are looking for errors in grammar and spelling as well as style, content, organization, and coherence. If there are any passages you dislike, get rid of them and write them again from scratch. Critiquing your own work is an important skill, and it takes plenty of practice, just like writing itself..


Give yourself time between writing and editing, if at all possible. It is better to wait a good length of time, but even a short break can give you some of the necessary distance and detachment to edit well.

, Get feedback on your work in progress from interested readers, whether they are friends, fellow writers, or readers of your writing blog. Try to accept criticism without getting angry or upset; even if you don't agree with the specifics, knowing what parts of your work people dislike can be valuable for focusing your editing.

, Don't be afraid to make drastic changes, even cutting whole sections of the project or rewriting it from a different character's perspective. Continue the cycle of feedback and editing as you explore how to perfect your work. If it feels like running in place, remember you are practicing skills that will help you in all your future writing. You can always take a break to write something fun and ridiculous, just to remind yourself that writing can be a blast.

, It can sometimes be difficult to get ideas. But really, ideas are everywhere- even in our dreams. Look around, but also look inside yourself, for inspiration. Read other well written books, and even a funny happening in life could give you an idea. Listen to music, watch a movie, or play a video game. The best way for ideas to come to you is to relax your mind and let brains come naturally to you.

, Past, present, or future? Will you be telling it, or the person in the book. (For example, you: Katie opened the large metal door, hoping to find her dreams. For example: The character: I opened the large metal door hoping to find my dreams.) Learn about the different point of views out there such as first, second, and third. Learning them and understanding them will help when you sit down to write.

, Broadening your reality will improve your ability to share an alternate reality- your story!

, Every book has to have some big words in it. Read books, newspapers and do well in English at school. It is a good idea to keep a dictionary and a thesaurus near you when you are writing. They come in handy when you want to simplify or elevate your vocabulary.

, When you know what your story is about think carefully about your main characters. Get to know them. Not just their age and clothes and hairstyle but every aspect of their personality. The more real they are to you, the easier it will be to predict their actions in the circumstances you put them in. They might even surprise you! Try to find pictures on the internet similar to what your character will look like.Or even draw him/her/it out. Use a sim program to create a more sturdy picture of human characters. Go over every detail about your character like their race, likes/ dislikes, family, personality, and much more.

, We all like happy things to happen but sometimes stories are less interesting if it's happy all the time. Tragedy is how characters grow- think about how you've handled things when you had problems, and how you could have handled them better. Give your characters a chance to grow, too.

, Leave your story for a couple of days to see if you can get new ideas, but if you don't get any, don't give up! Look to your plan, and ask yourself what the characters need to do to go from where they are to where they need to be. Ideas will come!

, For virtually every published author, there are hundreds of rejection notices that they have accrued over the years of writing. Don't give up! Keep writing, and eventually, you'll find a publisher willing to publish your story. Or you can start a website, and share your work with others that way. Having people you don't know enjoying your stories can be a great feeling! You might even meet other aspiring authors. In any case, keep your old stories for more ideas and to show you how much you've grown!

Just try not to have way too many clichés, or no one will want to read your story and you'll eventually forget about it.;
, As a general ""rule"", female characters will only have a father and male characters will only have a mother. Try to make things a little bit different. If you do so, your characters will have more interesting backgrounds.

, Many female characters will be bossy, rude, know-it-alls; this should be avoided. Another stereotypical female character, typically the main character, is the useless wallflower. Often this type of character will have a perfect, attractive best friend to serve as a foil to them, which doesn't really work. Create likeable, realistic characters that people will like. You should also avoid damsels in distress: You want to create independent yet likable female characters who are good role models and don't have to rely on a guy to save/help them. ""Mary Sues"" are very annoying: give your characters some flaws and don't make them happy even though their lives are miserable. Try your best with male characters too: Don't make them fall in love with the heroine ""at first sight"" or be an orphan with a miserable life going to a private school where he is bullied and has no friends until something unexpected happens and he discovers he's a hero. When writing descriptions, avoid using sentences like ""the heroine had silky and sparkly onyx hair that bounced perfectly"", those can be really annoying to read.

, This might seem like the exact opposite of what you should do, but it will teach you what common set-ups to avoid. Make a list of your most disliked cliches if it helps.

, Fairies, goblins, dwarves, elves in medieval-like worlds are very overused, and so are main boy characters who come from Earth and end up on a fantasy world for no apparent reason. If you are making a story about a normal person ending up in a fantasy world, try to make it more realistic. Don't just make him/her ""just appear there"" or ""fall through a portal"".

, Most fantasy characters are around 11-16 years old. It's okay to make them young teens, but try to make supporting characters who have different ages.

, Swords, guns, and rods are common in fantasy. Designing your own weapons should be fun and different.

, Once again, you want realistic, exciting, and three-dimensional characters. The more interesting your characters are, the more they will be liked. ""The chosen one"" can make a story boring because you know that only one hero will save the world from evil and nothing else change it.

, If you're going to include romance, there are some things you should avoid. Stay away from the male character saving the heroine and doing anything for her after only knowing her for five seconds. Make it cute and realistic. The two characters who are in love should get to know each other before anything happens and they shouldn't fall in love just because you wanted them to. For example, you can't have them arguing nonstop for three chapters and then just make them kiss out of nowhere because you wanted your story to have romance. You want it to seem like it's happening in real life, even if it's fantasy, and creating boring and one-dimensional romances will make things worse.

,, Most stories have either extremely good looking or bad looking villains. Try to mix things up a little bit.

, Don't, just don't create an annoying little kid who is always chasing the main characters around, asking to ""join their group"", challenging them to battles, and beating the main hero in nearly every one of them. Those types of characters will be disliked and will make your story annoying.

, There will always be a goth/depressed character who has no friends but learns how to interact with people in the end of the story. Will usually be a guy with dark, long hair and no friends or a 18-year-old girl with a miserable life who is a leader of a group as is trying to act ""tough"".

, The ""damsel in distress"" thing is old. Really old. Thousands of years old. Naturally, it's become a little stale, and progressive types will not appreciate it, either. Damsels in distress are useless, unhelpful, and flat. And they often get on readers' nerves.

, In fantasy stories, prophecies always come true, and every myth and urban legend is grounded in reality. Just as this is not true of real life, it should not be true of your fantasy world. Let people make up campfire stories about werecats without suddenly being attacked by a werecat.

, This is extremely common: a main character, usually the main heroine who the hero is in love with, will appear to be dead but then turn out to be alive but very hurt.

, The main villain is finally dead! Oh... never mind. Another death cliché: The main character seems to finally kill the villain/a monster, and when all the characters are happy and celebrating, the villain/monster comes back to life.

, The villain or monster will always be ""sealed away"" by a hero, then reemerge a hundred or, more often, a thousand years later. A second hero will need to defeat the villain or seal them away again. Often the second hero is a descendent or reincarnation of the first.

, Many books and shows aimed at kids will include adults who are foolish and/or totally useless, usually as an authority figure or villain. One problem with this is that the writer is limiting their potential audience - flat and shallow older characters are unappealing to adult and teen readers. The other issue is that it makes a villain far less threatening. To be a convincing threat, the villain should have no qualms about harming or killing anyone, even children, and he/she certainly shouldn't get outsmarted by a kid who isn't out of middle school. If older, experienced adults could be outsmarted by kids, they probably would have failed on their own.


On a related note, you should avoid your kid protagonists instantly coming up with all of the right answers and solutions while the ""good"" adults, despite being older, more educated, and experienced, always arrive at the wrong conclusions, especially if these adults are in positions of leadership and responsibility where they should not need the help of children (no matter how smart) to solve problems.

, Know the structure/style of the format you are writing in.

, Keep them in mind at all times.

, Commas are those little things that imply that there should be a pause taken between words. They may seem insignificant, but they're actually quite important.



After an introductory element: There should always be a comma between an introductory word or phrase and the rest of the sentence. For example, In the novel Twilight, Bella lives in Forks.

In a compound sentence: A compound sentence has two or more parts that could each be a single sentence, joined by a conjunction. Before the conjunction, insert a comma. For example, The recipe sounded simple, but Julie burnt the cookies.

With a non-restrictive element: If there is a part in the sentence that could be removed, and the sentence would still make sense, use commas before and after to separate it from the rest of the sentence. For example: On wikiHow, the world's largest how-to manual, there are over 100,000 how-to articles.

In a series: When making a list, it's best to have a comma after each noun, unless you're a journalist. For example: Jane needed to buy milk, eggs, cheese, and butter.

, Make sure to end all of your verbs properly. For example, She drop the rock on my toe is missing the ending for the verb 'drop'. The correct sentence is, She dropped the rock on my toe.

, I was standing in the middle of the street and I was standing on the middle of the street mean two different things. Remember to use the right preposition at the right time.

, Comma splices occur when you try to connect two clauses that could stand alone as a sentence. I hated the sweaters, my grandma bought them every year is an example of a comma splice. Fix the sentence by adding a semicolon or period, connecting the clauses with a word such as and or because, or re-writing the sentence. For example, I hated the sweaters that my grandma bought every year. We took out the comma, replaced it with the word ""that"", and removed the word ""them""., When writing, it's best to avoid starting a sentence with a conjunction (words like 'and', 'but', etc.). It is permissible, but if you’re going to start a sentence with a conjunction, be sure that you’ve written a complete sentence.

, In the sentence, ""The Lifeguard Station posted warnings around the beach regarding jellyfish in the area. However, they were not heeded"", they is the vague pronoun reference. The correct sentence would be, ""The Lifeguard Station posted warnings around the beach regarding jellyfish in the area. However, those warnings were not heeded"".

, While it's considered informal, and some instructors are picky about this, it is really up to you and your style. Or, if you are being tutored, the use of contractions tends to be up to your instructor, so you may want to ask your instructor what his/her preference is., Remember that when something's possessive, you'll need an apostrophe. For example, Candice's book or The Girls' Bathroom.

,


Verb Tense Shifts: Remember to keep the tense of the verbs in accordance. For example, When Bob died, it affects his whole family should be When Bob died, it affected his whole family.

Pronoun Shifts: Remember not to randomly change pronouns when referring to something or someone. For example, When you taste the chocolate, one's taste buds will rejoice should be When you taste the chocolate, your taste buds will rejoice. It could also be When one tastes the chocolate, one's taste buds will rejoice.

, Make sure to write in complete sentences (with subjects, verbs, etc.). For example, a sentence fragment that is missing its subject would be, Waited for the bus to come, because we don't know who waited for the bus.

, Avoid using a verb that doesn't indicate when an action is, was, or will be completed. For example, By the time Iris arrived, the accident happened should be By the time Iris arrived, the accident had happened. Also avoid confusing irregular verbs. For example, Jim has went home should be Jim has gone home.

, The verb has to agree with the subject in number and in person. If the subject is singular, the verb should be singular. If the subject is plural, the verb should be plural. For example, The girls were happy when they saw the puppy, but The girl was happy when she saw the puppy.

, A run-on sentence is a sentence that is made of 2 sentences that could stand alone. Add words or punctuation to separate run-on sentences. For example, The wind howled he began to cry, could be fixed by adding the word 'as' and a comma: As the wind howled, he began to cry., Use a dictionary to make sure that your words convey the intended meaning. Words that sound the same or are spelled similar do not always mean the same thing, so be sure to check when you're picking out a word. For example, In the short story The Veldt, there is an illusion to Peter Pan. The correct word is allusion, meaning a reference. Illusion means a false appearance/idea.



Than vs. Then: When making any sort of time reference you should use, “then.” ex, I brushed my teeth, then went to bed. “Than” is simply a comparison, ex, James is taller than Danica.

It’s vs. Its: The word “it’s” is actually a contraction of the phrase “it is”, so anytime you would say “it is”, substitute it with the contracted form, “it’s.” “Its” is the possessive form of the word, “it.” So if “It has finished”, the correct usage would be, “Its finished.”

Rather than introducing your topic, it will be an overview of everything you write about in your paper. Save writing your abstract for last, after you have already finished your paper.


A thesis and an abstract are entirely different things. The thesis in a paper introduces the main idea or question, while an abstract works to review the entirety of the paper, including the methods and results.
Even if you think that you know what your paper is going to be about, always save the abstract for last. You will be able to give a much more accurate summary if you do just that - summarize what you've already written.;
, The paper you’re writing probably has specific guidelines and requirements, whether it’s for publication in a journal, submission in a class, or part of a work project. Before you start writing, refer to the rubric or guidelines you were presented with to identify important issues to keep in mind.


Is there a maximum or minimum length?
Are there style requirements?
Are you writing for an instructor or a publication?

, Abstracts are written to help readers find your work. For example, in scientific journals, abstracts allow readers to quickly decide whether the research discussed is relevant to their own interests. Abstracts also help your readers get at your main argument quickly. Keep the needs of your readers in mind as you write the abstract.Will other academics in your field read this abstract?
Should it be accessible to a lay reader or somebody from another field?

, Although all abstracts accomplish essentially the same goal, there are two primary styles of abstract: descriptive and informative. You may have been assigned a specific style, but if you weren’t, you will have to determine which is right for you. Typically, informative abstracts are used for much longer and technical research while descriptive abstracts are best for shorter papers.Descriptive abstracts explain the purpose, goal, and methods of your research but leave out the results section. These are typically only 100-200 words.
Informative abstracts are like a condensed version of your paper, giving an overview of everything in your research including the results. These are much longer than descriptive abstracts, and can be anywhere from a single paragraph to a whole page long.The basic information included in both styles of abstract are the same, with the main difference being that the results are only included in an informative abstract, and an informative abstract is much longer than a descriptive one.
A critical abstract is not often used, but it may be required in some courses. A critical abstract accomplishes the same goals as the other types of abstract, but will also relate the study or work being discussed to the writer’s own research. It may critique the research design or methods., You're writing about a correlation between lack of lunches in schools and poor grades. So what? Why does this matter? The reader wants to know why your research is important, and what the purpose of it is. Start off your descriptive abstract by considering the following questions:


Why did you decide to do this study or project?
How did you conduct your research?
What did you find?
Why is this research and your findings important?
Why should someone read your entire essay?

, Abstracts state the “problem” behind your work. Think of this as the specific issue that your research or project addresses. You can sometimes combine the problem with your motivation, but it is best to be clear and separate the two.What problem is your research trying to better understand or solve?
What is the scope of your study - a general problem, or something specific?
What is your main claim or argument?

, Motivation - check. Problem - check. Methods? Now is the part where you give an overview of how you accomplished your study. If you did your own work, include a description of it here. If you reviewed the work of others, it can be briefly explained.Discuss your own research including the variables and your approach.
Describe the evidence you have to support your claim
Give an overview of your most important sources.

, This is where you begin to differentiate your abstract between a descriptive and an informative abstract. In an informative abstract, you will be asked to provide the results of your study. What is it that you found?What answer did you reach from your research or study?
Was your hypothesis or argument supported?
What are the general findings?

, This should finish up your summary and give closure to your abstract. In it, address the meaning of your findings as well as the importance of your overall paper. This format of having a conclusion can be used in both descriptive and informative abstracts, but you will only address the following questions in an informative abstract.What are the implications of your work?
Are your results general or very specific?

, There are specific questions your abstract must provide answers for, but the answers must be kept in order as well. Ideally it should mimic the overall format of your essay, with a general ‘introduction, ‘body,’ and ‘conclusion.’


Many journals have specific style guides for abstracts. If you’ve been given a set of rules or guidelines, follow them to the letter., Unlike a topic paragraph, which may be intentionally vague, an abstract should provide a helpful explanation of your paper and your research. Word your abstract so that the reader knows exactly what you’re talking about, and isn’t left hanging with ambiguous references or phrases.


Avoid using direct acronyms or abbreviations in the abstract, as these will need to be explained in order to make sense to the reader. That uses up precious writing room, and should generally be avoided.
If your topic is about something well-known enough, you can reference the names of people or places that your paper focuses on.
Don’t include tables, figures, sources, or long quotations in your abstract. These take up too much room and usually aren’t what your readers want from an abstract anyway., Your abstract is a summary, yes, but it should be written completely separate from your paper. Don't copy and paste direct quotes from yourself, and avoid simply paraphrasing your own sentences from elsewhere in your writing. Write your abstract using completely new vocabulary and phrases to keep it interesting and redundancy-free.

, If your abstract is to be published in a journal, you want people to be able to find it easily. In order to do so, readers will search for certain queries on online databases in hopes that papers, like yours, will show up. Try to use 5-10 important words or phrases key to your research in your abstract.For example, if you’re writing a paper on the cultural differences in perceptions of schizophrenia, be sure to use words like “schizophrenia,” “cross-cultural,” “culture-bound,” “mental illness,” and “societal acceptance.” These might be search terms people use when looking for a paper on your subject.

, You want to draw people in with your abstract; it is the hook that will encourage them to continue reading your paper. However, do not reference ideas or studies that you don’t include in your paper in order to do this. Citing material that you don’t use in your work will mislead readers and ultimately lower your viewership.

, An abstract is a summary, and as such should not refer to specific points of your research other than possibly names or locations. You should not need to explain or define any terms in your abstract, a reference is all that is needed. Avoid being too explicit in your summary and stick to a very broad overview of your work.Make sure to avoid jargon. This specialized vocabulary may not be understood by general readers in your area and can cause confusion., The abstract is a piece of writing that, like any other, should be revised before being completed. Check it over for grammatical and spelling errors and make sure it is formatted properly.

, Having someone else read your abstract is a great way for you to know whether you’ve summarized your research well. Try to find someone who doesn’t know everything about your project. Ask him or her to read your abstract and then tell you what s/he understood from it. This will let you know whether you’ve adequately communicated your key points in a clear manner.Consulting with your professor, a colleague in your field, or a tutor or writing center consultant can be very helpful. If you have these resources available to you, use them!
Asking for assistance can also let you know about any conventions in your field. For example, it is very common to use the passive voice (“experiments were performed”) in the sciences. However, in the humanities active voice is usually preferred.

Know your characters!,

Don't fill pages!,
Don't write outside your ability!,

Don't try to write in scenes!,
Don't drown in your notes!",How to Avoid Basic Mistakes when Writing," If you don't know your main characters inside out, and if you don't keep them consistent, it makes for pretty awful reading.;
, You need to know what the basis of your story is - is it a romance? Is it an escape story? An adventure? Exploration? A mystery solved? If you don't know where you're aiming to take your story, it can seem very flimsy when you come to read it.

, Don't waffle on or make scenes last longer than they need to. You'll just irritate your readers and you'll end up losing your audience. If you have a short story, don't try to pad it out with lots of tit-for-tat conversation.

, Don't try to write an historical novel if you don't know any history. Don't try to write science fiction if you aren't relatively adept with computers, and don't have the background. Some safe themes include modern-day life, fantasy and children's stories.

, Don't change the narrator's voice mid-story unless it's part of the bigger picture. If you make a narrator start on an impersonal basis and become more engaging to the reader, it may put them off, as they don't know if the story's meant to be serious or light-hearted.

, If you've got a really cool scene which you want to incorporate, don't bend the story to make it fit in. If it doesn't contribute anything to the story it's probably best just to keep it among your notes.

, Some people make copious amounts of notes, but if you make too many, you'll never get round to writing the story, and you'll never be sure if you've mentioned everything you wanted to mention. Also, you could end up not using lots of the notes if your story finds its own focus which you didn't expect.

Overwrite, and then edit down.",How to Write Fight Scenes," Think about a fight scene in a novel or short story that you found effective and full of action. You also want to read other examples such as:


The fight between Hector and Achilles in Homer’s The Iliad. The fight between Hector and Achilles has become a classic model for fight scenes in literature.The fight between The Man in Black and Inigo Montoya in William Goldman’s The Princess Bride. This is a great example of a sword fight, full of action and dialogue packed with wit and humor.The duel between Macbeth and Macduff in William Shakespeare’s Macbeth. This pivotal fight scene has been reinterpreted as a fist fight and a gunfight in modern productions. But the original set up for the duel is a sword fight, the final showdown between the play’s protagonist MacDuff and the play’s antagonist, Macbeth.;
, Fights naturally bring drama and excitement to a work. However, everything you add to a story should actually add something to the story. This includes fight scenes, too.



A fight scene should always advance the plot of the story or reveal character. It should provide crucial information to the reader about the characters involved in the fight.
In general, choose one to two example fight scenes and think about how they fit into the story as a whole.How is the fight scene situated within the overall plot or story? The fight scene should fulfill the promise of your book and feel like it fits seamlessly into the action of the previous chapters.

If you are writing a historical fiction novel, for example, the weapons and fighting styles of your characters should match the historical setting of the novel. For example: A samurai in feudal Japan will be taught from an early age to use multiple weapons forms.
A fight scene in a fantasy book may be filled with fantastical weapons or fighting abilities. For example, the world of ""Harry Potter"" includes spells and magical objects.
Consider how the writer builds up to the fight scene and how the weapons and fighting styles of the characters matches the tone and setting of the rest of the book.



, To build drama, care about the characters, and the outcome of the fight, you need to consider why the character is involved with this fight.



What does this character hope to gain? What does the character stand to lose?
What sort of ability does he or she have?
What type of training does he or she have?
Does this character have cultural beliefs about fighting?
Why does the reader care about the character? How can he or she likely relate to the character?



, Consider how the writer positions the characters in the scene and describes their actions and movements as they fight. Is there a lot of description of each punch and kick? Do you have a clear sense of the movements of each character in the scene? Some fight scenes may use dialogue to alter the pace of the scene and keep the reader engaged.


For example, in The Princess Bride fight scene, Inigo Montoya is given snappy lines of dialogue between each swish of his rapier to vary the pace and demonstrate his character in the scene.

, A good fight scene will dramatically shift the stakes of the overall story. Your protagonist may end up wounded, she may lose a limb that then limits her fighting ability, or she may be fatally injured. Or your antagonist may be defeated in the fight and your protagonist may come out on top.


A fight scene may also create a conflict for your protagonist, as a close ally, friend, or family member may end up being collateral damage in the fight, motivating the protagonist to fight back.

, ""You can't write about what you don't know"", goes a maxim of writing. If you have never been in a physical altercation, you do not have any real experience to draw from. It may be useful to do some hands on research and try a basic martial arts or contact fighting class. This will give you a better sense of what a fight might feel like in real time, and the real life impact of a blow on the body. If you are writing a fight scene involving an inexperienced or first time fighter, going to a fight class will also give you a sense of how a fight feels to a non-fighter.Ask the fight instructor about common responses between fighters during a physical encounter. If you have no experience being in a fight, you will react differently from a seasoned fighter. Consider how a professional fighter might approach a fight, as they will likely be very relaxed and focused. Good fighters can see a punch or kick coming. They have had constant training and have been taught to focus on how the body moves in a fight.

, Have you built up enough suspense and action in the previous pages of the story to prepare the reader for a big fight scene? Your protagonist and your antagonist may play cat and mouse throughout the novel, leading to a showdown fight at the end of the novel. Or your protagonist may be trying to save a key character by fighting the antagonist. There may be multiple characters involved in the fight, or just two characters. Think about what purpose the fight scene will serve in your story and how it will advance the plot.Note how many characters are going to be in the fight scene, and where the fight scene is going to take place. Consider the time of day, the mindsets of the characters involved in the fight, and the stakes of the fight. Will it be a fight to the death or a fight with minor injuries?

, The fighting style of your protagonist will give the reader a sense of their character. Your hero may be an amateur fighter with street smarts and motivation, or she may be a more seasoned fighter with great technical skill and a taste for blood. Your hero’s opponents may also be out for blood, with equal skill to your hero or a higher level of skill. Revealing character through a fight scene is smart writing. By showing your character in a violent situation, you avoid telling your reader how to feel.Avoid a blow by blow description of each character action, as this will feel too technical and dry. The scene should feel chaotic, much like a real fight. Keep the character actions simple, clear, and to the point.Avoid long sentences and don’t use adverbs or too many adjectives in the scene. This will only confuse and distract the reader.
For example, short sentences like “I aimed for his nose and connected. Blood splattered on the ground” are more effective than longer, more detailed sentences such as: “I curled my hand into a fist and aimed for the front of his nose. My fist hit the bridge of his nose. His blood splattered all over the ground of the warehouse.”

, A real life fight involves very little spoken dialogue between the fighters. The characters will be responding to each other through action, rather than speech. However, you can show interior character thoughts to give your reader context for the fight and to show the character’s mindset during the fight. This will give the fight a clear perspective and make it easier for the reader to follow the action.For example, your hero may be facing a challenging adversary and start to feel she is losing the fight. She may have interior character thoughts as she struggles to gain the upper hand. “She hits me again and I taste blood. Come on, Buffy, get up. Find the stake. Get up. She grabs my head, her fingers digging into my scalp, and lifts me until I’m dangling on the tips of my toes. She slams her hand into my ribs and I wince. The pain ripples across my chest. Come on, Buffy. Focus. I lock my eyes on the dead, black holes in her head and jab my palm under her chin. She reels back, releasing her grip.”

, Give the fight scene a sense of urgency by including dialogue between characters around the fight itself. This will help move the scene forward and lead in to the actual fight in the scene. Use short bursts of dialogue, and avoid using too many dialogue tags, as this can slow down the action.For example: “Go now, Buffy! Save the others.” “Are you sure, Giles?” Giles sprayed silver bullets into a wall of vampires. I watched a few slam against the concrete, splattering guts and blood. The rest of the pack moved closer. Giles glanced at me over his shoulder. “Go Buffy, now!” I run.

, In the aftermath of a real fight, you bruise, you ache, you hurt. Consider how your characters will feel after the fight. Give your character a realistic recovery period, and think about how the adrenalin rush of the fight will help them recover or get away from the scene of the fight.If your character suffers a cut or stab wound, for example, you will have to show her recovery or if you are jumping ahead in time, her scar from the wound. If a character has bruises and cuts to the face, this might limit her ability to eat or chew. If a character is in a fight for the first time, she may feel shock and anxiety from the fight. Or she may feel hardened and ready for more.

, For your first draft of the scene, you may end up including more detail than necessary. It can be difficult to plot out the action of a fight scene without overwriting it. Focus more on getting a sense of the movements, actions, and reactions of each character in the scene. Read over your first draft and pare down the language so it is concise and to the point.For example, you may start with a first draft a scene that has sentences like: “Buffy counted ten vamps in the room, though it was dark, so there could be more than ten. She had two stakes in either hand and two more tucked in her back pocket. And the knife strapped to her ankle, which could do some damage if needed. The vampires locked eyes on her, blood thirsty, and ready to kill. She sized up the room and her weapons. “Ready?,” she said calmly. Not waiting for an answer, she arches her arm back to throw a stake into the heart of the nearest vampire.”
Your edited version may appear as: “Ten vamps in the sealed off room. Dark in here though, so there could be more than ten. Two stakes in either of her hands, two more in her back pocket. And the knife strapped to her ankle, which could do some damage if needed. She feels their eyes on her, blood thirsty, dead, focused on their kill. “Ready?”, she says. She arches her arm back and throws a stake right into the heart of the nearest vampire.”

If you're undisturbed by noise, you'll be able to get yourself comfortable and in the mindset of accomplishing the writing that you need to get done. Even setting an iPod or MP3 player on low while listening through headphones can block out most surrounding distractions. Also play some soothing ocean sounds (which you can easily find on YouTube by searching for ""ocean sounds"").;
, Take up a weekly yoga class, take a walk, or even try creating a zen garden. These techniques will help you to become more relaxed and will therefore help you in the process of writing in a quiet environment, by getting rid of external noises or other disturbances.


On the same theme, you could pick a martial art to practise; it also helps you to learn to focus on concentrating in a more disciplined way on what you're doing.

, Using Feng Shui might help you to make your room a more pleasant and quiet place to write. You will feel more at ease about relaxing in an organized room and it's possible that it will spark the inspiration you're seeking.


Consider decorating and personalizing your writing area to make it more pleasant and relaxing. Add candles, incense, and unique decorative items to bring about a relaxing and peaceful atmosphere that will help you to forget your worries and focus on writing, even though you're under stress.

, When stress has got you so worked up that you just cannot focus, it's a wise choice to walk away from your work for awhile and take a break. Have a nice cup of hot tea or get some fresh air. Don't think about the writing that you must get done or any other task that is hanging over your head. Focus on relieving yourself of the stress that you feel. Once you can let some of it go, you'll be able to get back to business and write more stably.

, It will really help you focusing and remembering the main ideas you are going to write about. This can also stop you from forgetting ideas you had earlier in the day.

, A great way to approach the idea of writing under stress is to look back to your previous work and take steps to further it. If you have been working on a novel or a series of short stories in the past, you can go back and continue on these creative pieces as a means of managing your stress. That way, you don't have to think of a brand new idea and instead you can focus your mind on completing something. Make it a goal and give yourself deadlines. You'll find that your mind focuses more on completing instead of creating, thus allowing you to write while under stress.

, A writer shouldn't shy away from using little tricks to galvanize you into writing. When writing under stress, you can sometimes be aided by certain minor mental boosters such as low music, a mini fountain, or having the television on low volume.

, If you find yourself writing again after a lengthy absence, then allow yourself the space to be able to ease back into your work and don't be hard on yourself. You need to get back into the flow and that can take time and finding your sense of creativity is not something to be rushed. Failing to achieve a difficult writing task can result in feeling down and even more stressed, which will halt your progression, so remain calm and take it slowly.

, Even the colour on your walls can change how you feel in your room, so get painting! Paint colors can boost or inhibit your mood overall. Here are some suggestions:

If you're wanting to feel happy, consider going for a pale yellow colour. The radiant golden glow of yellow lifts your mood instantly – it's like filling your room with sunshine!






If you're looking to feel creative, go for a plum or burgundy colour. This is perfect for artists and writers and the complex colour can inspire new ideas.
Wanting to feel energised? Go for green. It will remind you of the bright fresh outdoors and can get you in an active and energetic mood.
If you're edging to a more calm feeling, try blue. It's the best colour for studying. The cool undertones help you focus and concentrate.
If you're in a dark and soulless room, consider adding a bright painting or poster of an outdoor scene with lots of color, sunshine, and natural scenes. It can be your ""window"" to a more inspirational view.

, Writing can be therapeutic and if you use your stress to your advantage, you will see it disappear on your paper/computer screen. You might even be amazed at how well you can write when you thought you were too stressed to do so. It takes distracting yourself from the cause of your stress and learning how to turn that negative energy into something more positive. It takes practice, but it can be done.

, They won't help you to concentrate on what you're doing and will probably make you more aware of the distractions.

, Food impacts your ability to focus better on your writing tasks.Eat foods such as blueberries, yogurt, and oatmeal. Coffee or tea in small doses can help as well, even though these drinks contain caffeine and can make you hyped if you drink too much. Choose herbal and non-caffeinated varieties if you plan on drinking them through the day or night.

, Perhaps move to another place like a library or cafe that embraces long-sitting customers. You can go to an external place to keep yourself away from household disturbances and also to instill you with the inspiration of being around others performing all sorts of daily activities.


The library is perhaps the best place to go and write for long periods of time. There is also inspiration to be found in many other people doing the same thing as you! Use the library to get useful information and references directly, something you're not able to do from home as easily.
Consider setting up outdoors if the weather is great. Somewhere like at a park, public garden, lake, etc. can be very inspiring, especially if you can find the quietness you need in your chosen spot.

Choose a topic.,
Decide on your main goal.,
Gather supporting materials.,
Choose a type of outline.,
Order your main subtopics.,
Think of at least two points for each category.,
Expand upon your points with sub-points if necessary.,
Add layers if necessary.,
Think about your conclusion.",How to Write an Outline," Outlines help you organize your thoughts before you start writing. But what is the topic of your paper or writing project? It's all right to pick a broad topic at this point. Writing your outline might help you narrow it down to a specific argument.


For example, your history paper topic could be French life during German occupation in World War II. As you write your outline, you might narrow this down to the resistance fighters called maquisards.
When outlining a creative project, such as a novel, you don't need a thesis or subject area. Instead, your outline will help you plan the structure of your work.

, A paper can try to persuade the reader of your argument, inform the reader about a topic, or reflect on your personal experience. Choose one of these goals, along with the specific argument, topic, or experience the paper will be about. If you are writing a persuasive, analytic paper, write a thesis statement to structure your work. Here are three example approaches:


Compare and contrast two books, events, or people. This takes strong critical analysis skills.Present cause and effect for a historical event. Describe how a historical event came to happen the way it did, either the mainstream informative account or a new persuasive argument. You'll need plenty of research.
Describe how an experience changed you, practicing your communication skills.

, Most of these will make it into your final paper, not your outline. However, reviewing your materials will help you plan out your essay. Write down subtopics that have a big pile of related quotes, statistics, or ideas. These will be the major parts of your outline. If you have other subtopics that you don't know much about, list them in a separate section for minor subtopics.


Skip this step if you're outlining a creative project. Research will be useful to add believable details, but these won't be in the outline.
Note down the page number where you found each piece of information.

, You're almost ready to begin writing. Just choose one of these two outline structures:


A topic outline uses short phrases with a few words each. When in doubt, start here.
A sentence outline uses complete sentences. Use this if your paper relies on many details that would take pages to list as separate bullet points.

, If you're writing a story or presenting a historical argument, a chronological order makes sense. Otherwise, pick the subtopic with the most supporting materials, and lead with this argument. From there, order your major subtopics so each one naturally flows into the next.Label each subtopic with a Roman numeral. Here's an example for a short paper:


Topic: History of the Automobile
I. Early Years: Pre-20th Century
II. Vintage and Classic Cars: 1900 to World War II
III. Modern Cars: After World War II

, Select these sub-points based on both the purpose of your paper and the list of supporting materials you gathered earlier. These will form the second level of your outline, which is traditionally indented and labeled in letters of the English alphabet (A, B, C, D, etc.).


I. Early Years: Pre-20th Century
   A. Early Steam Power
   B. The Combustion Engine
II. Vintage and Classic Cars: 1900 to World War II
   A. The Model T
   B. Standardization of Technology
(continue for each section)

, If one of your lettered sub-points is still a big topic or needs extra details explained, add another nested layer underneath. Put these in the third level of your outline, indented again and labeled in ordinary numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.).


I. Early Years: Pre-20th Century
   A. Early Steam Power
      1. Invention of steam engine
      2. 19th century developments
   B. The Combustion Engine
      1. Early Benz automobiles
      2. Cars as a luxury item
(etc.)

, If you need to add additional sub-layers, use lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, iv, etc.), then lowercase letters (a, b, c, d, etc.) and then finally switch to numbers again (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). In most cases, three or four layers will be enough. Try to combine points first before you add a fifth.

, You don't have to write it yet, but look over your outline and think about whether it matches your chosen goal. If you don't have enough evidence to support your conclusion, add more subtopics. If one of the subtopics is not relevant to your conclusion, delete it from your outline.

Ask yourself if you responded to the assignment adequately.",How to Write a Reaction Paper," Reaction or response papers are assigned so that after reading a text, you will think carefully about what you feel or think about the text.When you write a response paper, you need to evaluate the text's strengths and weaknesses, along with if and how well the text accomplishes its objective. A reaction paper is not just a paper where you express your opinion.These papers require a close reading of the text that goes beyond the surface meaning. You must respond to implied ideas, and elaborate, evaluate, and analyze the author's purpose and main points. In many cases, you can use the first-person ""I"" while writing reaction papers.When you respond to the text, back up your ideas with evidence from the text along with your own connection of ideas, texts, and overarching concepts. If you are asked to agree or disagree, you have to provide convincing evidence about why you feel this way.If responding to multiple texts, you must analyze how the texts relate. If responding to one text, you probably should connect the text to overarching concepts and themes you have discussed in the class.
The same assignment may also be given to films, lectures, field trips, labs, or even class discussions.A reaction paper is not a summary of the text. It also does not state, ""I liked this book because it was interesting"" or ""I hated this because it was boring."";
, Before beginning your paper, you must figure out exactly what your teacher or professor is looking for. Some teachers want you to react by analyzing or evaluating the reading. Other teachers want a personal response. Make sure you understand which kind of reaction the assignment calls for.


If you are unsure, ask the teacher to clarify what they expect from the assignment.
You may be asked to react to the text in light of another text. If this is the case, you will want to use quotations from both texts in your writing.
You may be asked to react to the text in the light of the class themes. For example, if you read a book in a Sociology of Gender Roles class, you will want to read, annotate, and react based on how gender roles are described in the book.
You may be asked to react personally to the text. This is less common, but occasionally the teacher simply wants to know if you have read the text and thought about it. In this case, you should focus on your opinions of the book.

, To complete a reaction paper, you don't just read, give your opinion, and turn in the paper. A reaction paper synthesizes the texts, which means you take the information you read and bring it together so you can analyze and evaluate. You have to give yourself time to do the readings, but more importantly, to digest what you've read so you can put the ideas together.One of the biggest mistakes that students make is waiting until the last minute to read and react. A reaction is a thoughtful consideration after reading and rereading several times.
You may need to reread the text multiple times. First, to read and familiarize yourself with the text, then again to start thinking about the assignment and your reactions.

, After you read through the first time, jot down your initial reactions to the text. Do the same thing on any subsequent readings.


Try completing some of the following sentences after you read: I think that..., I see that..., I feel that..., It seems that..., or In my opinion..., As you read through the text again, annotate it. Annotating in the margins of the text allows you to easily locate quotations, plot lines, character development, or reactions to the text. If you fail to annotate thoroughly, it will be more difficult to create a cohesive reaction paper.

, As you read the text, you have to start questioning the text. This is where your evaluation of the material and your reaction begins. Some questions to consider include:


What issues or problems does the author address?
What is the author's main point?
What points or assumptions does the author make, and how does she back that up?
What are strengths and weaknesses? Where are problems with the argument?
How do the texts relate? (if multiple texts)
How do these ideas connect to the overall ideas of the class/unit/etc?, Start by freewriting your reactions and evaluations of the author's ideas. Try to put into words what you think the author is trying to do and whether you agree or disagree. Then ask yourself why, and explain why you think these things. Freewriting is a great way to start getting your ideas on paper and getting past that initial writer's block.When you finish, read back over what you've just written. Determine what your strongest and most convincing reactions are. Prioritize your points.

, Reaction papers have to be critical and have some evaluation of the text. Otherwise, you are just summarizing what you read. After freewriting, decide what your angle is. Keep asking yourself the same questions as you craft a coherent reaction.


Think about why the author has written the article or story as they have. Why did he structure things in this particular way? How does this relate to the outside world?, Now that you have completed your freewriting and found your angle, you can now shape this into an argument. What interesting thing do you have to say about what you just read? Start to state why what you said is interesting and important. This is the core of your reaction paper. Take all your points, opinions, and observations, and combine them into one claim that you will prove. This is your thesis.


Your thesis will be one statement that explains what you will analyze, criticize, or try to prove about the text. It will force your reaction paper to remain focused.

, Your paper should follow basic essay format. It needs an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Each body paragraph should directly support your thesis. In each body paragraph, you should be reacting to a different portion of the text. Organize your reactions together into a few common topics so you can write them into paragraphs.


For example, if you are reacting to a theme in a book, you can split the paragraphs into how the setting, antagonist, and figurative imagery communicate the themes successfully or unsuccessfully.

, After you organize your ideas into paragraphs, you need to find quotations that will support your points. You must back up your claims with evidence from the text. Look at your annotations for quotations that support your thesis.


Draft paragraphs that introduce quotations, analyze them, and comment on them., Your paragraphs should always start with a topic sentence. Then you have to decide how to structure your paragraph. You can start with what the author says and follow that with your reaction. Or you can start with the author and then follow with how your reaction contrasts. You generally want to start with what the author says first and follow it with your reaction.A good way to think about structuring your paragraph is: detail, example/quotation, commentary/evaluation, repeat.

, Make sure your introductory paragraph states the name of the text, the author, and the focus of your paper. You may also want to include the year of publication and the publication it was taken from if relevant. It is also good to include the topic of the text and the author's purpose.


The last sentence of your introduction should be your thesis.

, Although most reaction papers don't ask specifically for your personal opinion, you should be critiquing, analyzing, and evaluating the text, rather than just sticking to the facts.


Look for places where you simply report what the texts says instead of providing a critique or evaluation of what the text says.

, One good way to analyze and evaluate the text is to connect it to other ideas you've discussed in the class. How does this text compare to other texts, authors, themes, or time periods?


If you have been asked to give a statement about your personal opinion, the conclusion may be the best place to insert it. Some teachers may allow you to state the personal opinions in the body paragraphs. Make sure to double check with the teacher first.

, Since reaction papers are usually short, you don't want them to be long. They can range from 500 words to 5 pages. Make sure to read your assignment carefully to make sure you follow directions.


Read through for clarity. Are your sentences clear? Have you supported and fully argued your points? Is there any place where you're confusing?

, Proof by reading for grammar errors. Look for run ons, fragments, verb tense issues, and punctuation errors. Check for spelling.

, Double check your assignment guidelines. Make sure you have followed your teacher's directions. If you did, it is ready to submit.

Decide if your paragraph is complete.",How to Write a Paragraph," Before you begin writing your paragraph, you must have a clear idea of what the paragraph is going to be about. This is because a paragraph is essentially a collection of sentences that all relate to one central topic.Without a definite idea of what the main topic is, your paragraph will lack focus and unity. In order to pin down the exact topic of your paragraph, you should ask yourself a number of questions:



What is the prompt I have been given? If you are writing a paragraph as a response or answer to a particular prompt, such as ""You have decided to donate money to charity. Which charity do you choose and why?"" or ""Describe your favorite day of the week,"" you will need to think carefully about that prompt and make sure you are directly addressing it, rather than going off topic.

What are the main ideas or issues that I need to address? Think about the topic you are being asked or have decided to write about and consider what the most relevant ideas or issues relating to that topic are. As paragraphs are usually relatively short, it is important that you try to hit on all of the main ideas, without going off topic.

Who am I writing for? Think about who the intended readership of this paragraph or paper is going to be. What is their prior knowledge? Are they familiar with the topic at hand, or will it require a number of explanatory sentences?
If your paragraphs are part of a larger essay, writing an essay outline can help you define the major ideas or goals of each paragraph.

, Once you have a clearer idea of what you want to address in your paragraph, you can start organizing your thoughts by writing down your ideas on a notepad or word document. There's no need to write out full sentences just yet, just jot down some key words and phrases. Once you see everything on paper, you may get a clearer idea of which points are essential to include in your paragraph, and which points are superfluous.


At this point, you may realize that there's a gap in your knowledge and that it will be necessary to look up some facts and figures to support your argument.
It's a good idea to do this research now, so you will have all the relevant information easily at hand when it comes to the writing stage.

, Now that all of your thoughts, ideas, facts and figures are laid out clearly in front of you, you can start to think about how you want to structure your paragraph. Consider each of the points you wish to address and try to arrange them in a logical order - this will make your paragraph more coherent and easier to read.This new order may be chronological, may put the most important information first, or may just make the paragraph easier and more interesting to read - it all depends on the topic and style of the paragraph you wish to write.Once you have decided where you want everything to go, you can rewrite your points according to this new structure - this will help to make the writing process a lot faster and more straightforward.

, The first sentence of your paragraph needs to be the topic sentence. A topic sentence is an introductory line that addresses what the main idea or thesis of the paragraph is going to be. It should contain the most important and relevant point you wish to make regarding your topic, thus summarizing the paragraph as a whole.Don't: use an obvious fact as your topic sentence.Do: feel free to start with a vague idea if you feel stuck, and improve it once you've finished the paragraph.


Every other sentence you write should support the topic sentence and provide further detail and discussion of the issues or ideas it raises. If any sentence you write cannot be directly related to the topic sentence, it should not be included in this particular paragraph.
More experienced writers can include their topic sentence at any point in the paragraph; it doesn't necessarily need to be the first line. However, writers who are new or less comfortable with paragraph writing should stick with having the topic sentence first, as it will help to guide you throughout the rest of the paragraph.Your topic sentence should not be too broad or too narrow. If your topic sentence is too broad you will not be able to discuss its ideas adequately in your paragraph. If it’s too narrow, you won’t have enough to discuss., Once you have written and are happy with your topic sentence, you can start to fill in the rest of your paragraph. This is where the detailed, well-structured notes you wrote earlier will come in handy. Make sure that your paragraph is coherent, which means that it is easy to read and understand, that each sentence connects with the next and that everything flows nicely as a whole. To achieve this, try to write clear, simple sentences that express exactly what you want to say.Link each sentence with transition words which form a bridge between one sentence and the next. Transition words can help you compare and contrast, show sequence, show cause and effect, highlight important ideas, and progress smoothly from one idea to the next. Such transition words include ""furthermore"", ""in fact"" and ""in addition to"". You can also use chronological transitions, such as ""firstly"", ""secondly"" and ""thirdly"".The supporting sentences are the meat of your paragraph, so you should fill them with as much evidence to support your topic sentence as possible. Depending on the topic, you can use facts, figures, statistics and examples or you can use stories, anecdotes and quotes. Anything goes, as long as it is relevant.In terms of length, three to five sentences will usually be enough to cover your main points and adequately support your topic sentence, but this will vary greatly depending on the topic and the length of the paper you are writing. There is no set length for a paragraph. It should be as long as it needs to be to adequately cover the main idea., The concluding sentence of your paragraph should tie everything together. A good concluding sentence will reinforce the idea outlined in your topic sentence, but now it has all the weight of the evidence or arguments contained in your supporting sentences behind it. After reading the concluding sentence, the reader should have no doubt as to the accuracy or relevance of the paragraph as a whole.

Don't disagree with your own evidence: Despite these comments, the report was a failure.Do qualify the conclusion if it transitions to the next paragraph: These quotes prove the report had major support, but this does not mean it led to major change.



Don’t just reword the topic sentence. Your concluding sentence should acknowledge the discussion that has come before it and remind your reader of the relevance of this discussion.For example, in a paragraph dealing with the topic ""Why is Canada a great place to live?"" The concluding sentence might look something like ""From all the evidence provided above, such as Canada's fantastic health care provisions, its top-notch education system and its clean, safe cities, we can conclude that Canada is indeed a great place to live.""

, Sometimes it can be difficult to tell where one paragraph should end and another begin. Luckily, there are a number of guidelines you can follow which can make the decision to move on to a new paragraph an obvious one. The most basic guideline to follow is that every time you start to discuss a new idea, you should move on to a new paragraph. Paragraphs should never contain more than one central idea. If a given idea has multiple points or facets, then each individual aspect of the idea should be given its own paragraph.A new paragraph is also used each time you are contrasting two points or presenting each side of an argument. For example, if your topic is ""should civil servants receive lower salaries?"" one paragraph would deal with the arguments supporting lower pay for civil servants, while the other paragraph would provide arguments against it.Paragraphs make a piece of writing easier to comprehend and give readers a ""break"" between new ideas in order to digest what they have just read. If you feel that the paragraph you are writing is becoming too complex, or contains a series of complex points, you may want to think about splitting it up into individual paragraphs.When writing a paper, the introduction and conclusion should always be given their own paragraphs. The introductory paragraph should define the aim of the paper and what it hopes to achieve, while also giving a brief outline of the ideas and issues it will go on to discuss. The concluding paragraph provides a summary of the information and arguments contained in the paper and states in clear terms what the paper has shown and/or proven. It may also introduce a new idea, one that opens the reader's mind to the questions raised by the paper.If you’re writing fiction, you need to start a new paragraph in dialogue to show a new speaker., Once you have finished writing, it is essential that you re-read your paragraph two or three times to check it for misspelled words and poor grammar. Spelling mistakes and bad grammar can significantly impact the perceived quality of your paragraph, even if the ideas and arguments it contains are of a high quality. It is very easy to overlook small mistakes when writing, so don't skip this step, even if you're in a rush.

Ensure that each sentence has a subject and that all proper nouns are capitalized. Also make sure that all of the subjects and verbs agree with each other and that you use the same tense across the entire paragraph.
Use a dictionary to double-check the spelling of words that you are unsure about, don't just assume that they are correct.
Check your paragraph for the proper use of punctuation, making sure that you use marks such as commas, colons, semicolons and ellipses in the correct context.

, Not only should the technical aspects of your writing be spot on, but you should also try to achieve clarity in your writing, as well as stylistic flow. You can do this by varying the length and format of your sentences and by using transitional words and a varied vocabulary.Don't: use long words or ""thesaurus finds"" for their own sake.Do: use well-known synonyms to vary your writing rather than repeat the same word many times.


The point of view of your writing should remain consistent throughout the paragraph, and indeed, the entire paper. For example, if you are writing in the first person (e.g., ""I believe that..."") you should not switch to a passive voice (""it is believed that"") halfway through.
However, you should also try to avoid beginning every sentence with ""I think..."" or ""I contend that..."" Try to vary the format of your sentences, as this will make the paragraph more interesting for the reader and help it to flow more naturally.
For beginner writers, it is better to stick to short, to-the-point sentences which clearly express your point. Long, rambling sentences can very quickly become incoherent or fall victim to grammatical errors, so try to avoid them until you gain more experience as a writer.

, Once you have re-read the paragraph and fixed any grammatical or stylistic errors, you should have one more glance over it to determine whether it is complete. Try to look at the paragraph objectively and decide whether it sufficiently supports and develops your topic sentence, or whether it needs a few more details or additional evidence to back up your claims.Don't: get bogged down in minor edits before you've finished your essay.Do: make sure your point is crystal clear before you move on.


If you feel that the main claim of your topic sentence is sufficiently supported and well-developed by the contents of the rest of your paragraph, then your paragraph is probably complete. However, if any important aspect of the topic remains unexplored or unexplained or if the paragraph is shorter than three sentences, it probably needs a little more work.On the other hand, you may decide that your paragraph is too long and contains superfluous or tangential content. If this is the case, you should edit the paragraph so it contains only the most relevant information.
If you feel that all of the content is necessary to your point, but the paragraph is still too long, you should think about breaking it up into several smaller, more specific paragraphs.

Stretch your ideas.",How to Write a Metaphor," The word “metaphor” derives from the ancient Greek word metapherein, which meant “to carry over” or “to transfer.”A metaphor “carries” meaning from one concept to another by stating or implying that one of them is the other (whereas a simile compares two things by saying one is “like” or “as” the other). To know what to aim for, it may help to look at a few famous examples.


The last line of The Great Gatsby contains a very famous metaphor: “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”
The poet Khalil Gibran used many metaphors in his poetry, including this one: “All our words are but crumbs that fall down from the feast of the mind.”William Gibson’s cyberpunk novel Neuromancer opens with the line: “The sky above the port was the color of television, turned to a dead channel.” Sylvia Plath’s poem “Cut” uses metaphor to convey a painful experience in a curious tone:
What a thrill—
My thumb instead of an onion.
The top quite gone
Except for a sort of hinge
Of skin....
A celebration this is. Out of a gap
A million soldiers run,
Redcoats every one.;
, There are many other figures of speech that create associations of meaning between two concepts, including simile, metonymy, and synecdoche.However, while these are similar to metaphor, they work a little differently.


A simile has two parts: the “tenor” (the thing being described) and the “vehicle” (the thing/s used to describe it). In the simile “the brownie was so overcooked that it tasted like charcoal,” the brownie is the tenor and the charcoal is the vehicle. Unlike metaphors, similes use “as” or “like” to signal their comparisons, and thus they’re usually considered a little weaker in effect.
A metonymy substitutes the name of one thing for the idea of another that is closely related to it. For example, in many countries the system of royal power invested in a monarch is simply called “the crown,” and in the United States the presidential administration and its authority are often just called “the White House.”
A synecdoche refers to a larger concept by using a part of that concept, as in the use of the phrase “hired hands” for “laborers” or referring to one’s car as “my wheels.”

, While the basic idea of a metaphor is quite simple, metaphors can operate on a variety of levels from very simple to very complex. Simple metaphors may state the comparison between two things outright, as in the example “He may seem mean, but he’s really a cupcake.” In literature, however, metaphors are often extended across sentences or even scenes.Sustained, or extended/telescoping metaphors span across several phrases or sentences. Their accumulative nature makes them very forceful and vivid. The narrator of Dean Koontz’s novel Seize the Night uses a sustained metaphor to describe his wild imagination:
“Bobby Halloway says my imagination is a three-hundred-ring circus. Currently, I was in ring two hundred and ninety-nine, with elephants dancing and clowns cartwheeling and tigers leaping through rings of fire. The time had come to step back, leave the main tent, go buy some popcorn and a Coke, bliss out, cool down.”Implied metaphors are more subtle than simple metaphors. Whereas a simple metaphor might say that a person seems mean, but is really “a cupcake,” an implied metaphor would attribute cupcake-like characteristics to the person: “He can seem mean until you get to know him, and then you find out he’s all gooey and fluffy inside.”

Dead metaphors are metaphors that have become so common in everyday speech that they’ve lost the power they once had because they’re too familiar to us: “raining cats and dogs,” “heart of stone,” “tie up loose ends,” “red tape.” Clichés, on the other hand, are phrases often used to convey significant meanings. In the case of “red tape,” legal documents used to be bundled with red tape (or ribbon) before being sent away to various offices, so a process getting caught up in “red tape” referred to a document that was still waiting to be examined.

, A “mixed” metaphor combines elements of multiple metaphors into a single unit, often with awkward or hilarious results.The example, “Wake up and smell the coffee on the wall,” mixes two familiar metaphorical sayings that contain similar commands to pay attention to something: “Wake up and smell the coffee” and “Read the writing on the wall.”Catachresis is the formal term for mixed metaphors, and some writers use them intentionally to create confusion, impart a sense of the absurd, or express a powerful or inexpressible emotion. The poem somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond by e.e. cummings uses catachresis to express how it’s impossible to put his love for his beloved into words that make sense: “The voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses -- / nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands….”Catachresis can also be used to demonstrate a character’s confused or contradictory state of mind, as in the famous “To be or not to be” soliloquy from William Shakespeare’s Hamlet: Hamlet wonders “Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer / The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, / Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, / And by opposing end them?”Obviously, you can’t really take up arms to fight against a sea, but the mixed-up metaphor helps communicate how troubled Hamlet feels.

, Used wisely, metaphors can enrich your language and enhance your meaning. They can communicate a world of meaning in just a few words (like this sentence just did with “world of meaning”). They also encourage active reading and ask your reader to interpret your writing in his or her own way.Metaphors can communicate emotion behind actions. For example, the phrase “Julio’s eyes blazed” is more vivid and intense than “Julio’s eyes looked angry.”
Metaphors can convey immense, complex ideas in a few words. In one version of his long poem Leaves of Grass, Walt Whitman tells his readers that they are actually the greatest poetry: “your very flesh shall be a great poem and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in the silent lines of its lips and face.”Metaphors can encourage originality. It’s easy to rely on everyday language to convey ideas: a body is a body, an ocean is an ocean. But metaphors allow you to convey a simple idea with creativity and expressiveness, something that the ancient Germanic people known as Anglo-Saxons were very fond of: “body” becomes “bone-house” and “ocean” becomes “whale-road”.Metaphors show off your genius. Or at least, Aristotle says so (and who are we to argue?) in his Poetics: “But the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor. It is the one thing that cannot be learnt from others; and it is also a sign of genius, since a good metaphor implies an intuitive perception of the similarity in dissimilars.”, There’s no better way to understand how metaphors work, and decide what metaphors make the strongest connection with you, than to read works that use them well. Many authors use metaphors, so no matter what your literary tastes are, you can probably find some excellent examples.


If you don’t mind difficult reading, very few writers in English used metaphor as well as the 16th-century poet John Donne: poems like “The Flea” and his Holy Sonnets employ intricate metaphors to describe experiences like love, religious faith, and death.The speeches of Martin Luther King, Jr., are also famous for their skillful use of metaphor and other rhetorical devices. King’s “I have a dream” speech uses metaphor extensively, such as the idea of Black Americans living on “a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.”, What characteristics does it have? What does it do? How does it make you feel? Does it have a smell or taste? Brainstorm by writing down whatever descriptions come to mind. Don’t get bogged down by obvious details; metaphor is all about thinking outside the box.For example, if you want to write a metaphor about ""time,"" try writing down as many characteristics as possible: slow, fast, dark, space, relativity, heavy, elastic, progress, change, man-made, evolution, time-out, timer, race, run.
Don't self-edit too heavily in this step; your goal is to generate a bunch of information for yourself to use. You can always scrap ideas that don't work later.

, Jot down lots of other things that share some of these qualities, but again, don't be too linear; the less obvious the association, the more interesting the metaphor. If you’re writing a metaphor about a concept, flex your brain by trying to equate it with an object. For example, if your topic is justice, ask yourself what kind of animal it would be.Avoid clichés. As Salvador Dalí said, “The first man to compare the cheeks of a young woman to a rose was obviously a poet; the first to repeat it was possibly an idiot.”The goal of metaphors should be to convey your meaning with impact and originality in a compact package: the single intense bite of sea-salted caramel chocolate gelato vs. a whole bowl of bland vanilla froyo.
This is a brainstorming activity, so let your imagination run wild! For the ""time"" example, free-associations could be ideas like: rubber band, space, 2001, abyss, enemy, ticking clock, weight, wait, loss, adaptation, changes, stretching, returning.

, Is there a particular tone you’d like to set or maintain? Does your metaphor need to suit the larger context of whatever it is you’re writing? Use this to weed associations out of your list.


For the ""time"" example, let's go with ""celestial/spiritual"" for the mood. Eliminate ideas that don't fit with that mood as you develop your ideas: for the ""time"" example, you might scratch out enemy, 2001, weight, and ticking clock, as these are all fairly ""earthly"" ideas.
Try to keep the nuances of your chosen topic in mind. For example, if you’re comparing the concept of justice to an animal, a “prowling leopard” conveys a very different idea of what you mean by “justice” than an image like a “weary elephant.” Both of these are probably still more apt than using a “newborn kitten,” though.

, Write a few sentences, a paragraph, or a page comparing your original topic to some of the associations you came up with. Don’t worry about forming metaphors just yet; focus on the ideas and see where they take you.


For the ""time"" example, this step could generate a sentence like the following: ""Time is the rubber band, shooting me out into the unknown then bringing me back to center."" This sentence has taken one of the ideas from Step 2 and has started attributing concrete actions and characteristics to it -- the starting-place of a metaphor.

, Since metaphor draws attention to the mechanics of the language, it’s important that your phrasing literally sound right. A metaphor conveying softness shouldn’t have a lot of harsh consonants; one describing depth might include deeper vowel tones (ohh and umm); one conveying redundancy might include alliteration (i.e. repeated sounds); etc.


In the example sentence generated in Step 4, the basic idea is there, but the words don't have much power behind them. For example, there's very little alliteration, which might be useful to employ if you want to convey a sense of repetition. The idea of the ""rubber band"" also suggests something or someone firing the rubber band, which detracts from the metaphor's focus on Time performing the action.

, Write a metaphorical sentence equating your original topic with one of your other objects or concepts. Does it make sense? Is it original? Does the sound match the feeling? Will a different one sound better? Don’t accept the first thing that works; be willing to discard an idea if a better one comes to mind.


For example, adding in alliteration and providing an action for Time that is more independent could result in a sentence like this: ""Time is an endless rollercoaster ride; it stops for no one."" Now, the focus is entirely on time, and the alliteration of the repeated r sound adds to the sense of repetition that the metaphor's getting at.

, Metaphors are often used as nouns -- “her face was a picture,” “every word was a fist” -- but they can also be employed as other parts of speech, often with surprising and powerful effects.Using metaphors as verbs can give actions more punch (sometimes literally!): “The news clutched her throat in its iron fist” expresses a more intense feeling than “She felt like she couldn’t breathe.”
Using metaphors as adjectives and adverbs can vividly characterize objects, people, and concepts in just a few words: “The teacher’s carnivorous pen devoured the student essays and belched up the occasional bloodstained comment” conveys the idea that the teacher’s pen (itself a metonym for the teacher) is tearing these essays apart and eating them, leaving only a mess of blood and guts once it’s finished.
Using metaphors as prepositional phrases can describe the feel of actions as well the thoughts behind them: “Emily examined her sister’s outfit with a surgeon’s eye” suggests that Emily believes she’s a trained expert in fashion, that she has a meticulous eye for detail, and that she sees her sister’s outfit as a potential disease to be cut off if necessary (perhaps not something that makes her sister happy).
Using metaphors as appositives (nouns or noun phrases that rename a nearby noun)or modifiers can add literary polish and creativity to your work: “Homer Simpson sidled onward, a yellow-domed pear wearing pants.”

Think about how you scan Twitter.,
Keep the tweet short.,
Write well.,
Ask a question.,
Ask for help.,
Tell your followers something unique and interesting.,
Talk about social media content.,
Nix the punctuation.,
Build trust.",How to Write a Better Twitter Headline," Nobody opens every single link or even reads every single tweet; do you? What is it about the tweets you do read and follow through on that make you notice them? Basically, when there is a cacophony of headlines competing for attention, you're going to be looking for the tweets that reward your reading effort and that's precisely what your followers do too. The ""rewards"" focus on such things as the usefulness of the tweet, the sense of urgency compelling you to read it, and the unique nature of the tweet content.Summed up, aim to give the flavor and offer the temptation to learn more when preparing your Twitter headlines.;
, While Twitter is already short enough, keeping your headline shorter than the allotted 140 characters is alluring because it stands out and tells the follower ""hey, here's one that is easier to read""! Can you keep your tweet to just eight words and under? Eight words or less is apparently the optimal amount for gaining instant attention!While it may seem tempting to use text language to shorten words or to use abbreviations to cram in as much information as possible per tweet, that could simply create a crowding impression and send your followers off to a simpler tweet.


If you do have a lot to say, can you break it down and feed it through in a series of well-timed tweets instead of trying to be too clever with too many words at once?
Keep in mind that there needs to be space for retweeting your information. While some tweeters simply cut off anything superfluous when retweeting, it's best not to make your followers have to go to that effort where possible.
Don't mix up ideas, themes, news items, etc. Each tweet should focus only on one thing; plan how to feed unrelated information in at different intervals instead.

, You have very few words, so make them count. Why use plain words when you can find ones that are far more descriptive and therefore more powerful, moving, and appealing to the reader? Be sure to explain why your headline will give the reader the best, the worst, the most, the biggest, the strangest, etc., information possible. Make the most action words, especially verbs; saying less with more increases the impact of your tweet.


If you struggle with finding the apt word, make friends with the thesaurus. While they are online, it's a good idea to invest in a printed copy because it's a feel-thought connection that arises with flipping through a book; you can also page mark your favorite words.
Avoid being obscure, obtuse, or obstinately obfuscating. If your follower doesn't get what it is you're on about, they'll ignore your tweet for one that makes sense. It is as simply – and ruthless – at that. Leave out puns and inside jokes, and avoid being too clever by half. Stick with simple headlines that everyone will understand.

, This usually will cause a person to be engaged, (for at least a second or two), enough to either answer the question or follow the link referred to by the question. If your question is about content you're promoting, relate the question to the nub of the issue you're discussing in the content by identifying a good keyword or two that summarizes your query. Good question openers include:


""How would you...?""
""Do you know how many people...?""
""Are you struggling with/overwhelmed by/easily defeated by, etc..."" – this is a good one where you have the answers, especially answers to social media/networking problems, organizing digital life, fixing known technical hitches, etc. It's also good in relation to relationships, such as ""Are you hopeless with small talk?""
""Would you like to know an easy way to...?""
""How many times have you...?""

, Related to the previous step on asking a question but different in intent, asking for help can be another excellent way to engage your followers. Maybe you'd like someone's opinion, or their input on something. Whatever your need for an answer, a lot of people like to help others and by asking them, you've just made it easy for them. However, don't just gulp up the answer and leave it hanging; be sure to engage in a conversation with those who respond, and provide a round-up of how their answers led to your solution. This tells your followers that you listen, that you act on their replies, and that you honor them by demonstrating how they have helped. Some examples of asking for help include:


""How do you/I...?""
""What can I do about...?""
""Where can I find...?""
""Who is the author/singer/writer of...?""
""Can you recommend a good...?""

, Your reader will want to know how your information or observation will affect them in their world. Yes, even the most rampant philanthropists will want to know information like that (their world is helping others) and they want to know how you can help them with that.


Search Twitter before adding your tweet to make sure it hasn't already been added a lot that day or recently and therefore be at saturation point. Find a new angle or way of presenting information that is already bloated on Twitter.
Eyewitness accounts are really interesting. Are you somewhere where the news is breaking? If so, make it compelling by exploring how what you're witnessing is making you feel and how you see others responding.

, Headlines likely to pull interest from followers are those focused on Twitter itself and other social networking sites. After all, if you're on Twitter and someone suddenly states that ""Twitter users are more likely to have better friendships"" or such, that makes followers sit up and read! Think about how Twitter helps, revolutionizes, improves, changes, etc., people (aka ""tweeple"" or followers), businesses (from small to large), disaster relief, communities, and more. Or headlines about ways to improve your Twitter experience and strategies. These sorts of headlines will cause much interest.

, It's no longer a headline if you're adding punctuation and seeking to get your followers to keep on reading more. In conjunction with the recommendation above to keep it short, also keep the colons, semi-colons and tripled-up exclamation marks out of your tweet headlines. Too much punctuation marks out your headline as being complicated or, in the case of too many exclamation marks, not to be taken seriously.


Related to punctuation is the need some people seem to have to leave a reference trail to the original newspaper/news site on Twitter; it's so unwieldy! Leave out unnecessary info that clutters, such as the page number, date, name of newspaper, etc. The reader will find that information upon arrival, so why burden your tweet with such details? Remember, just get to the point and that you're micro-blogging, so shortcuts are expected.

, Crafting a brilliant headline each time is only part of the art of good tweeting. The main part is the rapport you have with your followers and the manner in which you've built trust with them. By interacting with them consistently, by answering their tweets and retweeting their information, and by providing reliable content through your tweets, trust is formed and maintained. This is a constant effort

Reading the paper several times will help you notice any glaring issues. It will also help you get into the mindset of editing the paper thoroughly and effectively.If you are writing the paper on a computer, you may print out a hard copy so you can mark it up as you edit it. It may also be easier for you to read the paper aloud if you have a hard copy.;
, Confirm the paper has an introduction, a conclusion, and body paragraphs. Make sure the paragraphs are arranged in a logical order, starting with the introduction, then body paragraphs, and then the conclusion.One way you can confirm the organization of the paper to make a reverse outline of the paper. Use your paper as a guide and write out an outline that notes the introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion sections in the paper.

, Most papers have a thesis statement in the introduction and again in the conclusion. You should restate the thesis statement in the conclusion with slightly different wording. The thesis statement should sum up the goal or purpose of the paper.

, Go through each section of the paper and confirm that the meaning of each section is clear. Ask yourself, does this section serve a purpose in the paper? Does it connect back to my thesis statement? Make sure the word choice and language is clear in each section. Read each section aloud and confirm the language is concise and easy to follow.If you find any sections that appear unclear, go through them and clarify them. Replace words that are obscure or hard to follow in the section.
You should also make sure each section begins with a transition sentence to signal to the reader you have moved on to a different point.

, The tone should match the intent of the paper. If you’re writing an academic paper, the tone should be formal. You may use specialized language or more complex words. If you’re writing an opinion paper, your tone may be more informal or persuasive. You may use more commonly used words or terms.No matter what type of paper you are writing, the tone should be active through the use of the active voice in the paper, rather than the passive voice. Read through each section of the paper and change any sentences from passive voice to active voice.

, Make sure you are using sentences that are different lengths in the paper. For example, you may have one long sentence that is ten words long, followed by a sentence that is only five words long. Having sentences of varying lengths will make the paper stronger.You should also try to use action verbs in the paper, rather than weak verbs. For example, rather than use a weak verb like “observe,” you may use an action verb like “claim.”

, Another good way to edit the paper is to show it to someone else for them to edit. Often, a fresh set of eyes on the paper will help to note any issues you missed during your editing session. Ask a peer, a friend, or a family member to read the paper for you and point out any mistakes.If you are working on a paper for a class, you may try to trade papers with a peer for review. You can then read your peer’s paper for spelling, grammar, and punctuation. They will then do the same for you.

, If you are writing your paper on a computer, you will have access to spellcheck, a program that checks spelling, grammar, and punctuation for you. You can use it on your paper but you should not just rely on spellcheck to edit the paper. Often, spellcheck will miss words that are spelled correctly, but used improperly.You may run the spellcheck as a first pass over your paper for spelling, grammar, and punctuation issues. Then, do your own proofreading for these issues to catch anything that may have been missed.

, Go through each line of text and look for any spelling or grammar mistakes. Hold a piece of blank paper over a hard copy of your paper and move it down line by line as you check the spelling and grammar of each line of text. Read each line aloud to help you catch any grammatical or spelling errors.Watch out for common spelling errors, such as “it’s” instead of “its,” “their” instead of “there,” and “compliment” instead of “complement.”

, Go through the paper and circle all the punctuation. Then, make sure you are using the right punctuation in each sentence or phrase. Proper punctuation will show the reader you have an eye for detail and ensure each sentence is clear.For example, check that you use a period instead of a comma at the end of each sentence. Confirm you use a comma between words in a sentence to break up separate ideas or objects.

, One of the best ways to review the spelling, grammar, and punctuation of the paper is to read it backwards aloud. Start at the end of the paper and read each word, moving backwards through each sentence. This allows you to focus on each word and confirm it appears correctly on the page., Most instructors will require page numbers at the bottom right hand corner of the page. If there are guidelines for the paper around page numbers, make sure you follow them. You may be required to put page numbers on each page as well as your last name. This will make it easier for the instructor to find a missing page when they grade the paper.If there is a required page or word count, check that you have the correct number of pages or words in the paper.

, Make sure the title page is formatted according to the requirements for the paper. Most title pages will have the title of the paper, followed by the author’s name, the date, and the title of the class. The title page format may also depend if you are following MLA, APA, or Chicago Style for the paper.If you are required to have a table of contents in the paper, make sure it is properly formatted. You should format the table of contents using a word processor so appears professional and clean in the paper.
Keep in mind you may not be required to have a title page or a table of contents for the paper. Check the guidelines for the paper given to you by your instructor for this information.

, Make sure you double space the paper, if required. Check that the margins follow the guidelines for the paper. 1 inch margins are the standard for most papers.You should also make sure the font is legible and use the font suggested by the instructor for the paper.


Look at the font size to make sure it is 12 point. This is the standard size for most papers.

, Make sure all references and sources are properly cited in the paper. Use the applicable citation style based on whether you are using MLA, APA, or Chicago Style for the paper. All references in the paper must be properly cited in the text, in footnotes, or in endnotes.You should also make sure there is a works cited or references page at the end of the paper. It should properly list all of your references or sources used in the paper.

,,, Take your time during this process to ensure that you are as thorough as possible. The editing process includes reviewing several different areas:


Content: review your essay for content completeness, making sure that you have fulfilled the assignment and that all of the information provided is accurate. Identify any areas that could benefit from additional details or examples. Try letting someone read the paper, focusing on any areas that are unclear or require more explanation or support.
Structure:

Try creating a brief outline of your paper to ensure the organization is logical.
Review your writing to ensure that your introduction contains a clear thesis that makes clear your purpose for writing. Try asking someone to read the first paragraph or two and tell you what he or she thinks the paper will discuss. Make sure that subsequent paragraphs relate to your thesis and are presented in a logical order.
Make sure each individual paragraph contains a topic sentence, and that each subsequent sentence in the paragraph relates to that topic.


Style: review your paper to ensure that your tone is appropriate for your audience and consistent throughout your paper. Edit any awkward or wordy sentences to maximize the clarity and effectiveness of your writing and to ensure that your language is clear and smooth. Try reading the paper aloud, listening for anything that sounds incorrect, unclear or awkward. You can also use text-to-speech software for this purpose.

It must include your topic and an opinion, or your controlling idea. Keep in mind that this is not an invitation to simply announce your topic. ""Today I'm going to discuss the benefits of gardening"" is not an effective topic sentence. You should be able to make your intentions clear without stating them explicitly.
The topic sentence in this example states a clear direction (“health benefits of gardening”) that you can then elaborate on in your paragraph.;
, The topic sentence needs to relate the paragraph to the thesis statement of the essay. However, you need to make sure that your topic sentence strikes a good balance between the broad and the narrow.Don't write too vague or general an idea or you will never be able to discuss it in a single paragraph. This is too general: ""The United States suffered a lot during the Civil War.""
Don't write too narrow of a statement. There's nothing much to talk about then, because it's probably a fact. This is too narrow: ""Christmas trees are either cedars or firs.""
Instead, aim for a good balance: “Sherman’s destruction in the South during the Civil War also caused incredible suffering.” This is big enough to relate to the broader idea of an essay, but not so narrow that there’s nothing left to discuss.

, One of the many important roles of a topic sentence is to draw the readers in.Bring up questions in their minds that you intend to answer. An effective way to do this is to drop them straight into the action. This is possible whether your paper is fiction or nonfiction, and can be done in a number of ways:Describe a character. This can be a physical or emotional description.
Use dialogue. If there is a relevant conversation that will attract your reader's attention, consider using part of it to start your paragraph.
Portray an emotion. Use the opening sentence to portray an emotion to your reader.
Use detail. While you don't want to write a run on sentence by creating too much detail, it's a good idea to create interest using sensory language in your topic sentence.
Avoid rhetorical questions. While you want your reader to formulate questions in his or her mind, you do not want to formulate the questions yourself.

, The topic sentence should put forward your intention without forcing your reader to hunt it down; keeping it short will help keep your intention clear. The topic sentence should act as a middle ground in your paragraph: it should be slightly more specific than your thesis, but it should not encompass the information from your entire paragraph.Keeping the sentence short will also help the flow of your paragraph., The body of your paragraph is meant to prove your topic sentence. Therefore, your topic sentence should state something that you think or believe that can be supported by concrete evidence. You can choose to state an opinion in your topic sentence, but do so only if you are able to back it up in the following paragraph. Take, for example, the topic sentence ""Growing herbs will further your appreciation for fresh cooking."" The phrase ""further your appreciation"" states something that you believe, and you can now spend the rest of the paragraph explaining why you believe what you believe.


Avoid presenting only facts in your topic sentence. While facts may be interesting, they do not introduce the reader to your paragraph nor do they draw the reader in. If you wish to include a fact, also include your own input. For example, instead of writing ""All dogs need food,"" try ""All dogs need regular care, including healthy food, and children are the best ones to do it."" Alternatively, save your facts to use as evidence in the body of your paragraph., Topic sentences that also work as transitions can help guide your readers through your argument, which can keep them from getting lost. Think of this sentence as a “bridge” between the main idea of the previous paragraph and the main idea of this next paragraph.Using transitional elements, such as “In addition” or “In contrast,” is a good way to show the relationship between your ideas.
For example: “Although gardening has many health benefits, people still need to exercise caution when outside.” This topic sentence establishes a connection to the main idea of the previous paragraph (“health benefits of gardening”) and points to the direction of the new paragraph (“things to be cautious of”).

, Every paragraph of your essay should have a main idea, point, or goal that you’re trying to get across. The topic sentence will identify that main idea. For you to write good topic sentences, you need to know what your paragraphs are going to be about. An outline will help you do that.


You don’t have to write a formal outline using Roman numerals and the like. Even a loose, idea-based outline can help you know what you want to discuss.

, A thesis statement presents the main idea, goal, or argument of your essay. It may be an analytical thesis, such as “In King Lear, William Shakespeare uses the theme of fate to critique the religious beliefs of his era.” Or, it may be a thesis that attempts to persuade the reader of something, such as “Public funding for education should be expanded.” Topic sentences are like the mini thesis statements of each paragraph.A topic sentence, unlike a thesis statement, doesn’t have to present an argument. It can present a “preview” of what the paragraph will argue or discuss.

, If you are new to writing topic sentences, it can help to look at some examples. The Purdue OWL has several pages with sample topic sentences.UNC Chapel Hill has a helpful online handout on paragraph development that includes a “model” paragraph and explains how to develop your own, from topic sentence to conclusion.For example, a topic sentence could look like this: “In addition, increasing funding for public roads in Jackson County will improve local residents’ quality of life.” The rest of the sentences in this paragraph would relate to the main idea of public roads and how they will help benefit local residents.
This is not as successful a topic sentence: “Increased funding for public roads in Jackson County has decreased traffic by 20%.” While this is probably an interesting fact for your argument, it’s too narrow for a topic sentence. The topic sentence has to direct the whole paragraph.

, Although topic sentences vary in structure and content from person to person, at least two things can be assumed about your paper: 1) that you have a title and entire paper to introduce a topic, and 2) your personal information is present somewhere on your essay. Therefore, never use statements such as “I am going to tell you…” or “My paper is about…” or “I studied which is important because of ”. The paragraphs/essay should tell me that information without an awkward topic sentence presentation.Unless it is an opinion piece, avoid using ‘I’ in your topic sentences.

, Although it may sound appealing to fill up your topic sentence with big, formidable vocabulary words, if your topic sentence isn’t clear your effort will simply sound forced and confused. Your reader should be able to tell right away what your paragraph is going to be about. Don’t muddle this by using vague opinions or confusing vocabulary. Keep your sentence clear and clean., Although you want to give your readers a taste of what they can expect in your upcoming paragraph, you don’t want to show all your cards right at the beginning. Don’t make a list of what you’re going to talk about, but instead give a small taste of what is to follow in your paragraph. You don’t need to explain everything in your topic sentence, just mention it so the reader knows what to expect.


Rather than stating something like “In the story, Amelia did many good things such as help out her friends, talk to her parents, and support her team at school” say something like “As a result of the many activities Amelia participated in, she was recognized for her positive influence on the community.”

, You may have a fantastic quote in mind that perfectly introduces your topic. The problem is...they’re not your words. The topic sentence should introduce the paragraph and hopefully include your opinion, not someone else’s. If the quote is opinion-based, substitute it for your own opinion. If the quote is fact-based, save it and introduce it later in your paragraph., If you make a statement in your topic sentence, you should be doing so because your paragraph will explain it. Whether you give facts, opinions, or both, you should be clearly analyzing them in the paragraph attached to the topic sentence. Don't fill up your topic sentence with filler material that you don't intend to explain further.

Come to the story with fresh eyes.,
Read the story out loud.,
Trim or remove any excess words.,
Replace cliche phrases with unique ones.,
Make sure your dialogue is clear and concise.,
Check that you are showing, not telling.",How to Edit a Short Story1," To edit the story effectively, you need to try to read it with a fresh perspective. You may need to take a break and put the story away for a few days so you can think about other things or other stories. Then, after a few days, pull it out again and read it to yourself with fresh eyes. You may be surprised at how different it reads to you after you have not been staring at it for several hours straight.You may also try working on another piece of writing or doing a relaxing activity to get your mind off of the short story. Once you feel you have almost forgotten about the short story entirely, pull it out again and read it. This will help you see it from a fresh perspective and edit it from a fresh point of view.;
, You should read the short story aloud to hear how it sounds on the page. This can help you identify basic issues like misspelled words or grammatical errors. It can also allow you to listen to the story and make sure you are writing for the ear. A good story will sound as good when read out loud as it does on the page.You may read the story out loud several times to get a sense of how the voice and tone works in the piece. You may use a pen to mark down sections or moments that do not sound clear or strong when read out loud.

, Tighten up your language so it feels intentional and strong. Read each sentence in the short story and remove any words that seem unnecessary or excessive. Often, you can remove adverbs or more than one adjective in a sentence to make it stronger. You may also try trimming down the words in each sentence so they are clear and easy to read.For example, you may have the following sentence in your story: ""He raced through the crowded, bustling street to catch the smelly, congested number 1 bus."" This sentence may be more effective if you cut out one to two adjectives. You may edit it to read: ""He raced through the crowded street to catch the number 1 bus.""
You should also check for any sentences that are long winded or run on sentences. Often, if a sentence goes over three to four lines on a page, it is too long.
You may need to balance the narrative voice of the short story with your edits. This means perhaps leaving in longer sentences if this is the style and voice of the piece. If you do leave in longer sentences, make sure they feel intentional and purposeful.

, Check that your short story is not littered with cliches, as this is often a sign the writing is not as strong as it could be. A cliche is a phrase that has become so familiar, it has lost its meaning. You should replace cliche phrases in your short story with descriptions that feel specific to your characters and your setting. Make sure all the details in your short story are unique, as this will make it that much stronger.For example, you may have the phrase “She was as smart as a whip” in your short story. This is a cliche phrase that does not tell the reader much about the character.
You may replace the cliche phrase with a more unique phrase, such as, “She excelled in school and could size someone up right away.” The second phrase tells the reader that the character is smart by describing her specific qualities, rather than relying on a cliche.

, If your short story contains dialogue, you should read it over and make sure it comes across as clear and concise. Confusing dialogue or dialogue that is too vague can weaken your story overall. Try reading the dialogue in your story out loud. Ask yourself, Does this dialogue feel true to the characters? Can I make this dialogue stronger and more engaging for the reader?When you are reviewing the dialogue in your story, make sure you are using “said” as a tag in the dialogue. For example, you may write, “‘Where is he?’ she said” or “‘I’m out,’ he said.”
Avoid using verbs as dialogue tags in your story, as this can be confusing for the reader. For example, rather than write, “‘I hate this place,’ she scoffed”, you may write, “‘I hate this place,’ she said.”

, You should read over your short story to make sure you are always showing the reader what is happening in the scene or in the moment. Avoid explaining or telling the reader what is going on, as this can deaden the emotional impact of the story. Instead, always describe the movements of the characters and include details of the scene as the characters move around in a space. This ensure your writing is engaging and compelling for the reader.For example, rather than write, “She hated the house. She wanted to move to New York,” you may show this detail instead. You may write, “The house had bad plumbing and a wet, rotting smell. New York will be better than this place, she thought to herself as she close the door behind her.”

Show the story to a friend or colleague.,
Bring the story to a writing group.,
Hire a professional editor.",How to Edit a Short Story2," If you struggle to edit your writing on your own, you may try showing it to a friend or a colleague to get their feedback. Choose a friend who will be critical of your writing but also offer constructive feedback and useful notes. You may also show the story to a colleague at school or at work who is interested in writing and reading.You may try reading the short story out loud to a friend or colleague in addition to giving them a hard copy. You may get more detailed feedback if you read the short story out loud to them, as they can tell you right away when a section does not sound right or as strong as it could be.
Remember not to take any criticism you receive of your short story personally. You are getting your writing critiqued after all, and any feedback does not reflect on you as a person. Instead, try to view feedback as valuable and part of the revising process.

, You may also try bringing the story to a writing group in your local area or online. Submit the story to the writing group for critique. Then, sit back and listen to what the writers in the group have to say about the story. Take notes and try not to interrupt anyone when they are discussing your story. Listen and process the feedback you get from the group.You may also try taking a writing class where you can workshop your writing with other writers. You may find it useful to discuss the craft of writing and several different approaches to writing in the class, in addition to getting your short story edited by other writers.

, If you are still struggling to revise your short story, you may consider hiring a professional editor to help you tackle the issues in your story. You can hire a professional editor by searching for one online or by asking peers in your writing community for a reference to a good one.You may end up working with a professional editor if you submit the short story to a call for submissions at a literary magazine or a journal. The editor can help you adjust minor issues in the story so it is set for publication.

Define your thesis.,
Create an outline.,
Introduce your topic.,
Use specific examples to support your thesis.,
Connect your examples back to the theme.,
Write a strong conclusion.",How to Write a Commentary1," In many high school and college courses you will be asked to write a literary commentary. This assignment requires you to evaluate a piece of literature, most often a novel, poem, or play. The key part of a successful commentary is a strong, clear thesis statement.Your thesis is your argument or your point of view. This is where you take a stance, and spend the rest of the essay supporting your thesis.
Maybe you are writing a commentary on Great Expectations. Your thesis could be, “Not only is Dickens’ tale engaging, it is also an insightful commentary on the differences between social classes in industrial Britain.”;
, This will vary considerably depending on how long you want your commentary to be. At its briefest, say for a bulleted or single-paragraph commentary, make note of vital information to include. For longer commentaries, create a structure for your response.


You might write at the top of your outline, “Important Themes in Great Expectations”. You could then make bullet points such as “Setting”, “Ambition”, “Class”, etc.

, In your outline, you should also include an introductory paragraph. This will help you to remain focused on the key points as you write. For example, include an introduction where you provide the context for the work, followed by analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, themes, etc. Then wrap up with a short conclusion of the importance of the topic.You might start by saying, “Great Expectations is full of imagery that makes the reader feel as if they are in 19th century England with Pip. Dickens’ novel about class, ambition, and love sheds important light on the social divides of the time.”
You could then list the themes that you will discuss in the body of your commentary.

, State an issue or theme you've identified, show where you've found it in the work, then explain what effect the issue or theme has on the work. You might feel that Miss Havisham’s obsession with lost love is an important theme in Great Expectations.


An excellent specific example to illustrate this theme is pointing out that the character remains in her wedding dress, despite being jilted decades before.

, When you use specific examples, make sure that you clearly illustrate how it connects back to the larger theme. You are using Miss Havisham’s wedding dress as an example of the grief that comes with a lost love. Your reader will appreciate you clearly explaining why that is important.

You might write something like, “Miss Havisham is an example of the theme that love can sometimes go terribly wrong. This is also an important theme when examining the relationship between Pip and Estella.”
Make sure to use smooth transitions. When you move to a new example, use a good transition word or phrase. Some examples are “similarly”, “conversely”, and “again”.

, Your conclusion is the piece that will tie the rest of your commentary together. Make sure to include a summary of your argument. You should also indicate why the piece of text that you read is important. In your commentary on Great Expectations, you would want to make sure that you emphasize your summary again: this is a good example of class divisions and how ambition is not always the best quality.
You might also choose to compare it to another book from the same period to illustrate why the work by Dickens is significant.

"
"
Understand the guidelines.,
Present your summary.,
Emphasize key points.,
Provide a conclusion.,
Include your resources.",How to Write a Commentary2," A data commentary is similar to other types of commentaries in that it requires you to analyze an existing set of information. But instead of commenting on a book or film, you are writing about a set of data. A data commentary may occasionally be a stand-alone piece of writing, but it is typically found in the end of a report, generally called the Results or Discussion.You might also be asked by your boss or teacher to write a data commentary. Make sure to ask about their expectations, such as length.

, One of the key components of a data commentary is synopsis of the research. You need to concisely write about the results of the study and why it is important. Make sure to analyze and summarize the data.For example, if the research is about the graduation rate in the Chicago Public Schools, you need to explain the numbers and illustrate why the results are important.

, In a data commentary, you will likely want to use charts or graphs to help illustrate the results. You might include a table that shows how much American households pay for insurance. You will then want to comment on and analyze those visuals.You might say something like, “As shown in Figure 1.2, the costs of healthcare of risen at a steady rate since 2000.”

, In your conclusion, make sure to do more than just repeat what you’ve already said. Using different wording, you can reemphasize the significance of the results. You can also recommend further avenues for research.As in the rest of your data commentary, your conclusion should refer to specific pieces of data.

, A data commentary requires you to include not only facts and figures, but also where you found this information. You need to cite your resources according to accepted citation formats.You should include a specific section for resources at the end of your data commentary.
Any time you cite numbers or a quote, make sure to provide a reference.

"
"
Choose your topic.,
Do thorough research.,
Properly structure your commentary.,
Choose the right publication.",How to Write a Commentary3," Your goal might be to write a commentary for a newspaper or even a blog. When selecting your subject, there are several things to consider: Have you been assigned a specific article, such as a commentary on the best movies of 2016? This is an example of having your topic chosen for you.
Are you writing to make a point? Choose something that you are passionate about, such as freedom of speech.
Are you interested in writing about culture? Choose a book or movie that really made an impact on you.

, Whichever subject you choose, you’ll need to do some research. Even if you’re just writing a commentary for your own blog, it’s a good idea to make sure all of your information is accurate.

For example, if you are writing a commentary on a movie, make sure that you have all of the relevant names accurate.
If you are writing about politics, read several different sources to help give you a broad perspective on the issue.

, Any good piece of writing begins with a good introduction. In your first paragraph, make your topic and your argument clear. The body of your paper will include several paragraphs that expand on your ideas.Use the body to include specific examples, elaborate on your ideas, and explain your research.
Offer a strong conclusion. Reiterate your thesis, and offer new ways to continue thinking about your subject. For example, if you’re writing about women’s roles in filmmaking, suggest that this is a topic that needs continued analysis.

, If you want to publish your commentary, it is important to consider the best place to submit your writing. For instance, if your article is about the impact of the decreasing bee population, consider submitting it to an academic journal in a scientific field.If you have written a cultural commentary, consider submitting it to a popular blog or website. You might also try the Lifestyle section of a newspaper.
Check the submission guidelines. Each publication will provide guidelines about length, style, and references. Follow them closely.

Use level one headings for the title of your paper.,
Make the heading in bold type.,
Use level two headings to divide your paper into major sections.",How to Format Headings in APA Style1," Center level one headings in the middle of the paper.;
, Use title case capitalization, meaning that you capitalize the first and last word, as well as other important words. For example, you would center the following title on the middle of your title page:


How Cats Like to Sleep

, You also use bold type and title case capitalization for level two headings. However, you justify level two headings all the way to the left instead of centering them. For example:


Cats in Curled Positions

"
"
Divide your major sections into smaller sections with level three headings.,
Indent your level three headings.,
Use a period at the end of the heading.",How to Format Headings in APA Style2," Like level one and two, you use bold type for level three. Unlike the other two, you use sentence case capitalization, meaning you only capitalize the first word of the heading.

, For these headings, you don’t center the heading, but you don’t place it all the way over to the left, either. Instead, you indent a bit from the left.

, Start the text immediately afterwards. Look at the example below for help:



Cats sleeping while grabbing their back legs. Cats often like to sleep with their back legs tucked into their front ones…

"
"
Use level four headings for smaller divisions within your paper.,
Italicize your level four headings.,
Use level five headings for the smallest divisions in your paper.,
Do not use bold faced type when writing out level five headings.",How to Format Headings in APA Style3," Like the previous level, you should use bold typeface, and should indent from the left. You also use a period and start the body of the text immediately.

, Also remember to use sentence case capitalization. For example:



Cats with their noses tucked in. Some cats like to tuck their nose in for warmth…

, Like the previous level, use italicized typeface, and indent from the left. Use a period at the end of the heading before beginning the body text immediately.

, You do, however, use sentence-case capitalization. See the example below:



Cats with tails wrapped around their noses. One way for a cat to tuck its nose in is to wrap its tail around its nose…

Choose the right dictionary.,
Read the introduction.,
Learn the abbreviations.,
Learn the guide to pronunciation.,
Find the section of the dictionary with first letter of your word.,
Read the guide words.,
Scan down the page for your word.If you were looking for the word ""futile,"" for example, you would move past ""furry"" and ""fuse"" and ""fuss"".,
Read the definition.,
Alternately, you could use an online dictionary.,
Use the dictionary to find standard letter forms.,
Research various facts.,
Have fun!",How to Use a Dictionary," It's also a good idea to upgrade your dictionary every now and then so that you have access to the latest new words that are added to the dictionary every year.Consider purchasing specialist dictionaries if they'd be useful in your study or career. Some examples of specialist dictionaries include language dictionaries, technical dictionaries, rhymes, crossword, subject dictionaries (for example, for math, chemistry, biology, horticulture, etc.), illustrated dictionaries (excellent for learning another language or for technical knowledge), slang and idioms, etc.
Note that many countries have their own native dictionaries that might be more helpful than sourcing a dictionary from just anywhere, such as the Macquarie dictionary in Australia, Oxford dictionary in England, Webster's dictionary in the United States, etc.
Some schools, universities and workplaces prefer the use of one particular dictionary. This is for reasons of maintaining a consistent style and understanding among everyone using them; make sure you use the right one for your assignments, editing, and reports.

, The best way to learn how to use your particular dictionary effectively is to read its introductory section where you'll find out how the entries are arranged. The introductory section of your dictionary will explain important information such as the abbreviations and pronunciation symbols used throughout the entries.


Introductions to dictionaries explain things like how entries are arranged (they typically give the word, and the variations of the word; what part of speech the word is; pronunciation of the word; definition, etc.). Reading the introduction will give you a handle on how to find words and how to use the information that you do find.
There may also be information on pronunciation of words with similar spellings; this can be helpful if you have only heard a word and you're not sure of its spelling. For example, if you hear ""not"", it might also be ""knot"" but the ""k"" is silent, and this list can help you with suggestions.

, Dictionaries often have abbreviations in the definitions for a word. This can be confusing if you don't know what the abbreviations stand for. Typically a dictionary will have a list of abbreviations near the front of the book; either in the introduction, or after it.For example ""adj."" stands for ""adjective"" and will tell you what kind of word the word you're looking up is. ""Adv."" or ""advb."" can stand for ""adverb; adverbially.""
Something like ""n."" can stand for at least three different things: the most obvious and common is ""noun,"" but it can also stand for ""neuter"" or ""north"" depending on the context. So make sure that you check the context of the word when you're looking it up.

, If you immediately jump right into reading the dictionary without understanding the pronunciation guide, it can be difficult to figure it out. Having an idea about the symbols of pronunciation will make it a lot easier for you.The pronunciation of a word will be placed between two reversed virgules (\ \) and will typically be printed in italics.
A single stress mark (') precedes the strongest syllable in a word. A double mark precedes the syllable with a medium (or secondary stress) (""), and the third level of stress has no marker. For example: penmanship would look like this \'pen-m&n-""ship\.
The symbol \&\ indicates an unstressed vowel. This symbol often intrudes between a stressed vowel and a following \r\ or \l\, such as in sour \'sau(-&)r\.
The symbol \ä\ symbolizes the type of ""a"" sound that appears in words like ""caught,"" or ""fought."" Compare this to the symbol \a\ which designates the sound ""a"" in ""mat, map, snap,"" and so on. The word doesn't necessarily have to have the letter ""a"" to have a type of ""a"" sound.

, Dictionaries follow alphabetical order. For example, ""dog"" begins with ""d"" which means that it will be in the section after ""c"" and before ""e"".


Don't forget the possible spellings for trickier words, such as ""gnome"" begins with a ""g"", or ""psychology"" begins with a ""p"", or ""knock"" begins with a ""k"", etc.
If you're not entirely sure what the first letter is, start with the letter it sounds like. If you can't find the word under that section, then try other sections. For example if you didn't know that ""psychology"" begins with a ""p"" you might start looking in the ""s"" section. When you couldn't find it there, you might try looking in the ""p"" section next because you can think along the lines of ""psychic"" and ""psychosis.""
Also, keep in mind that certain words sound alike that are spelled very differently. For example, ""throne"" and ""thrown"" are spelled differently and mean very different things. So be careful that you end up with the correct word.

, These are the two words at the top of the page that tell you what types of words are on the page. These words will help you find the word you're looking for in the right letter section.For example if you're looking for the word ""bramble"" you would begin looking in the ""B"" section. You would look at the tops of the pages as you went through it until you came to the page with the guide words ""braid bread."" This tells you that all the words between braid and bread are on this page. Since ""bramble"" starts with ""b-r-a"" it will be in this section.
As always, the dictionary goes in alphabetical order, so bramble (b-r-a) will come before bread (b-r-e).

, Since the example word begins with ""f-u-t"", go past all the ""f-u-r"" and all the ""f-u-s"" words alphabetically until you reach the ""f-u-t"" area of the page. In this example, move right down through ""fut"" and ""Futhark"" and this is where you will find ""futile.""

, Once you've located the word it will tell you exactly what it means (and if it has more than one meaning, it will tell you the most common one first), how to pronounce it, how to capitalize it (if it's a proper noun), what part of speech it is and so on.


Quite a few people get daunted by the definitions themselves, because they can involve words that you have to then look up. Don't feel discouraged. See if you can figure out the meaning from the example sentences provided and if not, look up the words you aren't sure of.
Dictionaries can also sometimes give the synonyms (words that mean the same thing as your word) and the antonyms of a word (words that mean the opposite of your word). So, for example, if your word is futile some synonyms might be ""fruitless"" or ""unsuccessful"" and some antonyms might be ""effective"" or ""helpful."" You can also find near neighbor words such as ""futility"".
You might also find an etymology, derivation, or history of the word. Even if you don't know Latin or Ancient Greek, you may find that this information helps you to remember or understand the word.
Dictionaries also often provide spellings in other English derivations (US English, British English, Australian English, etc.).

, Online dictionaries are easy. Choose a suitable free online dictionary, or a subscription one if your place of work or study subscribes. Type in the word you're looking for. The search engine will return the word to you and the definition section should contain most of the elements discussed above.


Make use of the audio content provided with online dictionaries. This can help considerably when you're unsure how to pronounce the word.
To use Google to find online definitions, type: ""define: futile"". The search engine will only look for definitions.
Note that free services may not be as comprehensive as a subscription or book dictionary, so keep this in mind when you're not sure that you've found the right answer.

, Hard copy dictionaries (rather than online ones) often have standard letters for jobs, for RSVPs, for filing complaints, for various official writings.

, Dictionaries often have more than just words and their definitions. Some of them have lots of information about the world, usually in the form of various lists. These include geographical information (like maps, countries, cities, capitals, etc.)


Hard copy dictionaries often have different weights and volumes, as well as conversion tables. This can come in handy if you need to convert pounds to kilograms or vice versa.
You can also usually find statistics on population in various cities and countries, as well as lists of the flags of different countries, states, provinces, and regions around the world.
Many dictionaries also have lists of famous or historical people, which you can peruse.

, Simply browse a dictionary to enlighten yourself about new words now and then. Open the dictionary up to any page and scan the page for words that are unfamiliar or seem interesting. Pinpoint them, read the definition and try to add the new word to your thinking or talking during the next few days until it becomes a remembered part of your natural vocabulary.


Play the dictionary game with friends. This consists of getting some friends together and a dictionary. The first player looks up a challenging word and uses it in a sentence. The other players have to guess if the use of the word is accurate or an outright fabrication. If a player guesses correctly, it's their turn next.
Another dictionary game: Each player chooses a word which should be familiar to the other players, then reads out the dictionary definition. The other players compete to guess the word as quickly as possible - perhaps even shouting out while the definition is still being read.
Play Balderdash with a foreign language dictionary. Pick a random obscure word and then have people make up definitions along with having the real definition, having people guess which definition is the ""real"" one.

Fix obvious mistakes in grammar, syntax, perspective, tense, spelling, and punctuation immediately. When you see something you think needs to be re-written or fact-checked, mark it.


By the time you finish your first draft, it will already be in relatively tidy shape.
Going back and editing what you have written recently will help you avoid inconsistencies in storyline and style.
Don't re-write when you edit. Mark it so that you can return to it later. When you are trying to generate a first draft, it's important not to get bogged down second-guessing yourself.
If you can't proofread and make marks without also rewriting, skip the proofreading and marking.;
, Having written the whole first draft, break it into sections. These sections should not be your chapters, unless your chapters are especially long. Instead, divide your manuscript into quarters, fifty-page units, or 20,000 word units, whichever feels right to you.


Take the next several days to edit one section at a time.
Fact-check and rewrite the sections you have marked.
Revise for coherence and speed. Does each section of the book do the work you want it to do?

, Once you have the quarters edited, read the whole manuscript from beginning to end. Print it for a fresh perspective, and make notes on the printed manuscript. Ask yourself, does the story happen at the right pace? Does each section set up the next section?This is your chance to delete paragraphs or chapters that aren't contributing to the whole. Anything that feels repetitive or unnecessary should be cut.
Make the changes to your document. Keep the manuscript with your notes in case you want to revisit it later.
This is not the time to polish every sentence. You're trying to build the foundation at this point.

, Once you have this second draft written, let it sit. Try to not even think about it for a period of weeks or months. The amount of time is up to you. When the time feels right, return to it. If you aren't sure, look at the manuscript. If you immediately start to rewrite it, you aren't ready.Some authors take six months, and others only take a few weeks.
You should have some emotional distance by the time you return. This will allow you to spot and excise weaknesses in your prose, and to have a clearer vision of the work as a whole.
If you have people in your life who are willing to read early drafts, you can send them your draft while you wait. Be sure to explain exactly what kind of feedback you want.
Don't leave it for too long. While a few months is fine, a year or more might distance you too much from your original ideas.

, This edit should take place on your computer, and will probably involve serious changes. Read through the manuscript once, taking notes as you go. When you're done, organize these new notes alongside any other notes you have (notes you left yourself before the rest, notes you got from other readers, notes you jotted while you waited) so that they are in the chronological order of your manuscript.


Revise your manuscript according to the notes. After this initial read-through, make the changes your notes point to.
Go through again in sections, like you did for the first draft.
This stage can take weeks or months, depending on the level of change your book needs.

, When your manuscript is in reasonable, readable shape, having been edited twice and having been freed of typos and inconsistencies, get a few readers together. You can ask for friends, colleagues, and professional editors to read your manuscript. Ask them for specific feedback, and explain exactly what you are going to do with their feedback.For a first or second draft, you might ask for advice on plot, characters, research, or sequence.
For a later draft, you might ask more general questions, such as ""is this believable? Original? Does it make sense? Were you surprised by the ending?""
You can hire professional editors to give you feedback on your manuscript. Look online for ""manuscript editors"" or call up editing agencies and ask for someone who is experienced at editing your specific genre.
Even if you do have friends who are willing to look at your manuscript, professional readers and editors can make a huge difference.

, When your book is pretty polished, and you've edited it so many times you can't really hear it anymore, print it off and read it aloud from beginning to end. Reading it aloud will teach you what parts are still not quite working. It is natural, after this much editing, to hate your manuscript. If you get bored by any section, however, you may want to revise it or edit it out.After you have read the whole book, do a nonlinear read-through. Go through and read the first sentence in every chapter.
Read the first sentence and last sentence of each section, and of the book as a whole. If you find echoes, but not repetition, your book is exhibiting coherence.

, Look through your manuscript for sentences and paragraphs that are too long, too choppy, fragmented or run-on. Make sure your opening paragraph is elegantly written and contains action that will pull your reader in. If you wrote a book of poems, read each line separately and determine that it is worth attention on its own.


If you wrote a novel or a play, edit the dialogue for flow, characterization, and style.
Read the dialogue aloud to feel whether or not it sounds natural: do your characters all talk the same way? Do they use too much repetitive filler language? Is there vocabulary and syntax consistent with the time and station they live within?, Proofread and revise one final time. This is a good time to format your manuscript, and add footnotes, endnotes, or epigraphs, depending on the kind of book you are editing. Format your book according to the guidelines of your agent or the press (or presses) you are submitting to.


If you haven't yet titled your book, now is the time. Write a title that will catch your readers attention, and that is representative of the content and style of your book.
To brainstorm a title, pull language from the book that is representative of its main themes. This could be dialogue, description, a symbolic object, or even proper names, such as the name of a protagonist, a place, or a time/event.
The title you give to your draft is called your ""working title."" Your publishers or editors may want to see several working titles to determine the best one.

, When giving feedback to an author, it's important to know sort of information will be helpful. An author in the early stages of a project might need basic concerns about plot, characters, and concept, while an author in the later stages of a project might be more interested in line edits and proofreading.


Ask the author what kind of feedback he or she wants. Request a list of questions the author has, whether they are questions in general or specific questions for you.
Invite questions as specific as ""does the order of these essays communicate a larger message?"" and as broad as ""am I insane to have written this?""
If you are the editor who is publishing a work, you can also think about what you will need from this round of edits.
Write questions for yourself and make notes that will answer them.

, Before you start making notes and edits, read the whole book. Some things that may appear to be problematic at first might end up being important elements of the composition. You can take little notes in your first read, but address them to yourself, not the author.

, Go through and pick out the main themes. Highlight moments of striking parallelism, thematic development, or plot points. Make notes with your initial thoughts on the way the structure of the book works.


Depending on the amount of feedback you have, you can mark up the manuscript, or write a page of separate notes.
Be sure to include the page numbers if you write your notes on a separate page.

, Don't drive yourself crazy trying to attack every aspect of a manuscript. Unless you're a professional editor editing the very final draft, you should feel free to ignore small details. Concentrate on the elements of the manuscript that you think need the most work.


For instance, if you are reading a first or second draft, ignore spelling errors.
If you notice that some of the characters seem to disappear, that the main character never goes through any substantial change, and also that not all the jokes are that funny, just give feedback on the characters.
When you're finished with your notes, go back and look at the questions the author asked you. If you haven't answered them, do so now.

, Use spellcheck to fix your spelling mistakes, typos, and grammatical errors. For words in foreign languages and for slang, use a dictionary and the internet to make sure you are spelling correctly.


Edit each sentence so that there is only one space after the period. You can do a find-replace search to determine this.
Edit for consistency. Check for consistent tense and point of view, as well as consistent character voice. Make sure the timeline of events makes sense, and that no facts or plot points change without explanation across the manuscript. As a very basic example, a character who has died should not reappear casually.

, Use a website to conduct a word-search and learn which words you use the most frequently. Look for overused language as well as overused kinds of language. Do you use a lot of adverbs? A lot of abstract nouns? Search for the words you use frequently and see if they are applied too frequently to the same thing.


Review your descriptions especially. How do different characters get introduced? Check for bias. Are all your female characters described in terms of looks? Do you always describe eyes as ""glinting"" or ""bright""?
Edit repetitive language to keep your sentences fresh.

, You are ready to submit your manuscript, but to where? Make a list of the presses and agents you would like to read your book. If you already have an agent, your agent will look at presses for you, and will tell you how to format your manuscript. Otherwise, you should follow the guidelines of the presses you are interested in. This may mean you must format several versions of your manuscript differently.


Check the spacing each press requires. Some may prefer single-spaced manuscripts, while others ask for double or 1.5.
What sort of margins are allowed? How long should indentations be? Are there guidelines for section headings? Where should page numbers go?
Check that your font and font size are acceptable.
Format your citations according to the publisher's preference for an academic manuscript.
If you are submitting to a contest, check to see if your manuscript must be anonymous. If so, edit your name out of the text.
Proofread the format. Are all the titles in the right place? Is dialogue indicated with appropriate and consistent formatting? Are the page numbers in place?
If you are submitting online, should your document be a word document? A pdf?
Submit according to guidelines. This may be via mail, or over a press's website.

Write the title about one third of the way down the page.,
Leave 2-3 lines, then write your name.,
Leave 2-3 lines.

,
Write the course or class information.,
Write the instructor's name on the next line.,
Write the date on the next line.",How to Do a Title Page in MLA Format," The title should follow normal title capitalization standards: the first letter of each word should be capitalized with the exception of very short words such as articles or prepositions (e.g. the, and, of, or, a, an, in, to, for). Note that the very first word of the title should be capitalized, regardless of what kind of word it is.


Do not punctuate your title. It does not need to have quotation marks around it, it should not be underlined, and it should not be in italics. If, however, there is a quotation or a reference to a longer work in your title, that should be punctuated accordingly.
For example, ""To Be or Not to Be:"" An Analysis of Hamlet's Soliloquy contains a quote, while An Analysis of Inaction in Shakespeare's Hamlet contains the title of the play, which should be italicized.

, Be sure to include your first and last name.

,, You may want to include the section number as well as the name of the course.

, Be sure to include the appropriate title, particularly if your instructor has a doctorate. For example, Dr. Sarah Smith or Dr. Smith.

, MLA format generally calls for a European style date, with the day, then the month, then the year. For example, 2 February 2014.

Use endnotes to cite sources.,
Keep track of your sources as you research your paper.,
Put endnotes at the end of your paper.,
Insert note numbers in the text to reference your endnotes.,
Create a separate endnotes page.,
Pick a word processor that inserts notes and creates an automatic link to the endnotes page.",How to Do Endnotes1," If the information or quote you are referencing in an academic paper or book comes from a source, you will need to give your reader the necessary information to look up the information in that source. This is done for a variety of reasons:To avoid plagiarism. You must correctly attribute ideas and quotations to avoid plagiarism, which is using someone else's ideas or material without acknowledgement (intentionally or unintentionally). If you are a student, plagiarism may result in disciplinary action. If you are an academic or professional, plagiarism will result in, at best, the rejection of your manuscript, and at worst disciplinary action.People have even their degrees revoked when plagiarism was discovered.To allow the reader to check your work. Proper citations allow readers to look up the quotes and ideas you used in context, to see if they agree with your interpretation.To allow interested readers to dig deeper. Endnotes allow readers interested in your topic to easily locate the sources that informed it so that they can read them as well.
To show that you have considered a variety of sources. Endnotes allow you to show the reader that you have considered all of the major arguments regarding your given topic, or if you have not, allows them to easily see which authors you have failed to consider.;
, Because you will need to correctly cite your sources, it is important to keep track of all the pertinent information when taking notes. This includes:Page number
Author name, as well as the name of any editors or translators
Book name, place of publishing, name of publisher, and year of publishing if a book
Article name, periodical name, volume and series number, and date of publication

, Other systems cite sources parenthetically within the text or in footnotes at the bottom of the page. Endnotes, on the other hand, are all collected in a separate section labeled “Notes” at the end of your paper. There are advantage and disadvantages to this:


Pushing citations to the end of a paper or work helps to create clean, uncluttered pages. This is why endnotes are often preferred in books.
Having all the citations in one place allows the reader to digest them as a whole.
On the other hand, not having citations on the page means the reader will have to flip to the back of your manuscript each time they want to look something up, which can be frustrating.
Endnotes can give the impression that you are trying to hide your citations.

, You should insert a superscript number in your text immediately after you reference someone else’s work. The same number will appear in the endnote section at the end of your manuscript, allowing your reader to look up the citation.Note numbers should follow punctuation. Never put a note number before a period, comma, or quotation mark.
Note numbers should be consecutive throughout an entire paper.
In a book, note numbers may restart with each chapter, in which case the endnotes should be divided by chapter.
Put the superscript number at the end of the clause or sentence in which you reference someone else's materials.For example: ""According to Hoskins and Garrett, IQ tests are often problematic,1 but I argue that it is still possible to implement them usefully in school settings.""

, Your endnotes should start on their own page, with “Notes” centered at the top. Each citation should start with a superscript number that matches the note number in the text where the material was cited.


Indent the first line of each endnote half an inch (or 5 spaces) from the left margin. Additional lines within a single endnote should be flush with the left hand margin.
Use the appropriate citation form per your style guide.

, While you can insert a superscript number yourself and then scroll to your endnotes page to write the note, it is much easier to use the Endnote Function in your word processor. In programs like Microsoft Word, you simply have to click Insert > Insert Endnote (or References > Insert Endnote, depending on your version).A number note will automatically be inserted into the text wherever your cursor is and you will be taken to the same note number on the endnotes page, where you can enter the citation information.

Use Chicago style mainly for history, but also sometimes for the literature and arts.,
Provide complete information the first time you cite a work.,
Use only the author’s name, the title, and the page number for previously cited sources.,
Write “ibid” if you are citing the same source in two or more consecutive endnotes.,
Place the Notes page just before the Bibliography.",How to Do Endnotes2," The Chicago Style is also named Turabian after Kate Turabian, who wrote a style manual based on the Chicago Style while working at the University of Chicago. It is the only style used by historians.


Chicago style uses endnotes (or footnotes) to cite sources, rather than providing inline citation.This is a key difference from MLA style, which uses inline citation.
In Chicago style, it is recommended to always write the author name and title, not just the author name, in subsequent citations after the first full one.
In Chicago style, a bibliography typically follows the endnotes. The bibliography lists all sources in alphabetical order by author’s last name. You should add entries to it every time you create a note. The format is slightly different from endnotes. See http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html for more information.

, The information required will vary depending on the type of source.Book (author) – Author’s First and Last Name, Title (Place of Publication: Publisher, Date of Publication), page number(s).

Book (editor) – Author’s First and Last Name, ed., Title (Place of Publication: Publisher, Date of Publication), page number(s).

Journal Article – Author’s First and Last Name, “Title of Article,” Title of Journal Volume (Year): page number(s).

Newspaper – Author’s First and Last Name, “Title of Article,” Title of Newspaper, date, page number(s).
For all source types, if there are two to three authors, list their names with commas between them. For more than three authors, write the first author's name, a comma, and “et al.” in place of any remaining authors.
For a complete list of source types and their appropriate formats, see http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html.

, If you have already cited a source once, you do not need to give full citation information for future citations of the sources. Simply write:Author’s last name, Title, page number(s). (If the title is not fiction or poetry, you can use a shortened form of the title if it is longer than four words.), In this case, there is no need to write even the author’s name. You can replace all reference information with “ibid.”, short for ibidem, Latin for “in the same place.”For example, if citing Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s Love in the Time of Cholera twice in a row, you would write:


1 Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Love in the Time of Cholera, trans. Edith Grossman (London: Cape, 1988), 27-28.
2 Ibid., 45.

, If you have any appendices, put the Notes page after those. Double-space the endnotes just as you double-space the manuscript.In some cases, your teacher may prefer you to single-space endnotes and leave a blank line between each entry. If you have questions, consult with your teacher."
"
Use MLA (Modern Language Association) style for work in the liberal arts and humanities.,
Create a bibliographic endnote.,
Create an explanatory endnote.,
Place the Notes page before the Works Cited.",How to Do Endnotes3," If you are going to use endnotes in a paper for a literature, philosophy, religion, art, or music class, you will usually need to follow the MLA style.


MLA style does not recommend using endnotes to cite works. You should use inline citation in MLA style unless specifically told otherwise.In most cases, you will still need to provide a Works Cited page in addition to your endnotes.

, This type of endnote in MLA style allows you to refer to other texts your readers may wish to reference. This can be helpful if you have several sources that offer further reading on the topic you are discussing, but do not have room in your paper to discuss them all there.For example, ""For further discussion of this phenomenon, see also King, 53; Norris, 175-185; and Kozinsky, 299-318.""
For example, ""Several other studies also reach similar conclusions. For examples, see also Brown and Spiers 24-50, Chappel 30-45, and Philips 50-57.""

, Explanatory endnotes offer additional explanatory information, especially if it seems tangential to the main idea discussed in the paper. MLA recommends that you use this type of endnote sparingly.For example, ""Although it is less commonly known than her major works, singer-songwriter Wendy's 1980 album Cookies also deals with the idea of ecofriendly agriculture.""
For example, ""Johnson reiterated this point in a conference talk in 2013, although she worded it less forcefully there.""

, In MLA style, place the Notes page immediately before the Works Cited page.Center the word Notes on the page. Do not use any formatting or quote marks. If you have only one endnote, use the word Note.
Double-space endnotes in MLA style.

Pay attention.,
Read the material.,
Think about the material.,
Prepare several observations about the piece.,
Be nice.,
Don't be too nice.,
Finally, keep in mind that the end goal is for you all to become better writers.",How to Critique in Fiction Writing Workshops," Whether your fellow workshopper is discussing their struggles in writing or actually reading their piece aloud, there is no way you can give thoughtful, helpful critique if you don't know what you're talking about. Often, the person seeking criticism will mention one or two key points they'd especially like to focus on in terms of critique; whether it's the dialogue or characterization, having a specific goal in mind gives you a clearer idea of where you can help.;
, Same goes for this as for the first step- you can't talk about something you've never read. Read slowly and carefully- taking notes can also be a helpful way to remember specifics about what you've read, especially if more than one piece is being workshopped on the same day.

, Consider specific aspects of writing, such as point of view or tone, as well as the impression of the piece as a whole.

, More often than not, the person being workshopped will have specific points or questions to discuss, but if they open it up for more general criticism, it can be helpful to have a few specific things to mention. These can be aspects you liked, such as an effective passage of description or a lifelike section of dialogue, as well as aspects you didn't feel worked in the story.

, Writing, like any other method of personal expression, is something that people may take very seriously, and careless comments such as, ""This paragraph sucked"" or ""this character is annoying"" can be rude and seriously disheartening. However...

, The entire point of critique is to improve and receive honest feedback, not to have an ego-boosting praise-fest about what everyone loves about the story. Rather than too nice or too mean, keep your comments balanced and specific. If a character is boring or flat, that's a critique you want to express, but say it in a way that the author knows you're speaking critically, not cruelly. Balancing critique about aspects you didn't feel were effective with aspects you did enjoy can convey your critique in a fair manner; for example, ""I really enjoyed the language you used to describe the castle, but a few paragraphs later when the prince is being introduced to the princess, I feel like we're being bogged down with TOO much description.""

, Through honesty and communication, everyone in the workshop can grow together.

Check that the story follows a logical progression.,
Pay attention to character consistency and character development.,
Read the dialogue aloud.,
Show instead of telling.,
Enjoy the editing.",How to Edit," It helps to have a hard copy and a red pen, but this is not necessary.;
, A misspelled word can change the entire meaning of the entire sentence. Don't rely on your spellchecker. If you aren't certain about a word look it up in the dictionary.


Commonly misspelled words are: misspelled, received, believe, a lot, their, occurred, definitely.

, Without the proper grammar the written piece can become confusing. Jumping between tenses and points-of-view is difficult for a reader to follow.Consistently remain in one point-of-view. These are first person (I/me), second person (you), and third person (he/she/they).
Make sure your tenses match. Example: They were playing outside and are hungry. ""Are"" should be ""were.""
Look closely at passive sentences. Passive sentences are sentences where the subject is receiving the action, rather than performing the action. A passive voice example: ""The ball was kicked by him."" vs. the active: ""He kicked the ball."" Not all passive voice sentences are wrong, but they should be used with care.

, Are you using commas, semicolons, periods correctly? Link Commas, in particular, are used incorrectly and people often avoid using semicolons altogether.


One common punctuation error is the comma splice. Example: ""The hike is hard, so bring some water."" The comma is unnecessary.
Do not use commas for periods. Example: ""The water is very blue, the ship is big.""
The Oxford Comma: this is an optional comma, but it often serves to make the listing of items in a sentence clearer. A well-known example: ""We invited the strippers, JFK, and Stalin."" The comma comes after ""JFK."" Without it that sentence reads: ""We invited the strippers, JFK and Stalin."" The lack of comma turns JFK and Stalin into the strippers.
Periods and commas always go inside quotations marks in the U.S. Example: ""There are many birds here,"" said Bill. For the U.K. and Canada, the rules are different., Ask yourself if the sentence makes sense independent of the surrounding sentences. Each sentence must act as a complete thought.


Avoid sentence fragments: ""The English Language is complicated. As it is a conglomeration of Latin, early French, and early German."" This should be one sentence.
Starting a sentence with ""because"" is only acceptable in a few instances. Example: ""Because the sentence was so difficult he could not complete it.""

, Alternate with long and short sentences. This will break the monotony of too many similar sounding sentences. Language should be lyrical and interesting, even in an essay.Long sentences tend to provide more information. They may have several clauses with various kinds of punctuation.
Short sentences are more likely used to make a point.

, These words are not intrinsically bad, but need to be used with care. A few examples are:


all
a lot
like
as if
due to the fact
Most adverbs like: slowly, really, very, suddenly, lovely, friendly.

, There are differences between writing an essay, an article, and a novel. If you are writing an essay tone, especially, can dock you points.


For an essay, avoid first person and phrases like ""I think."" It is best to remain in third person. An article or story can be laxer depending on its type and may use any of the three perspectives.
Unless specified by the teacher, and essay should not be informal.

, A second pair of eyes is always better. Make sure that this person knows their stuff and will be honest about it.

, Different disciplines have different ways of structuring their essays, but these steps are common among them.


The paragraphs should follow the structure laid out in the introduction.
The first sentence of each paragraph should sum up the paragraph's content. If you are writing a persuasive essay, this sentence should make an argument that supports your thesis, but also can be backed up with the evidence presented in that paragraph.
If you are including a quote in a persuasive essay do not simply restate what the quote says. Make sure you explain why you chose that quote and how it supports your thesis.

, There are small variations between the different styles so be careful.


MLA is most often used for literature essays.
Chicago is most often used for research essays.
APA is used most often for sociology essays.

, Your first draft will get all your ideas onto the page. The second draft serves polishes to the writing. This is when you should pay attention to structure and content of the piece. With your third and any subsequent drafts, you should make certain there are no grammatical errors.


Editing multiple times is important. You will have to read through the piece more than once to catch all the errors.

, Unless you're trying for a post-Modern twist you'll want to have a beginning, middle, and end.


Does each scene and each character serve the story? Cut excess material.

,


If your character acts loud and boisterous in one scene and suddenly shy in another, there had better be a good in-story reason for it.
A character who, for example, hates all elves won't simply fall in love with one just because she did one nice thing.
Consistency also means that a character who has brown hair in one scene shouldn't have red hair in the next unless it is explained.

, Does it make sense? Does it sound like something an actual person would say?


There is a fine line between mimicking human conversation which is full of ""ums"" and ""likes"" and creating something that sounds like human conversation, but is clearer.

, This is one of the two most important parts of editing a story. Examples:


Example of telling: ""George was angry.""
Same situation, but with showing instead: ""George gripped the wineglass so tightly it shattered. He paid no attention, his gaze focused on the television. His jaw clenched and a flush stained his cheeks.""
Telling is not always bad. Not every moment needs to be drawn out in detail, but the most important parts of the story or novel do.

, ""To write is human, to edit is divine.""

"
,How to Critique an Article1,
"
Read through the article once to get the main idea.,
Mark up the text as you read through it again.,
Create a legend for your markings.,
Take some longer notes during subsequent readings.,
Develop a preliminary concept for your critique.",How to Critique an Article2," The first time you read through an article, you should simply try to understand the overall argument that the author is making. Note the author's thesis., It is sometimes helpful to use a red pen to make your markings stand out. Ask yourself questions like these as you read through a second time:What is the author's thesis/argument?
What is the author's purpose in arguing said thesis?
Who is the intended audience? Does the article effectively reach this audience?
Does the author have ample and valid evidence?
Are there any holes in the author's argument?
Did the author misrepresent evidence or add bias to evidence?
Does the author reach a conclusive point?

, Create a unique symbol to differentiate between parts of the text that might be confusing, important, or inconsistent.


For example, you could underline important passages, circle confusing ones, and star inconsistencies.
Creating a legend with assigned symbols allows you to quickly mark up an article. Though it may take a little bit of time to recognize your own symbols, they will quickly become ingrained in your mind and allow you to breeze through an article much quicker than without a symbol legend.

, In addition to a legend, it is helpful to take notes when expanded thoughts come to you as you read. For instance, if you realize that an author's claim can be refuted by noting a scientific study that you previously read, make a note of it in the margins, on a separate piece of paper, or on a computer so that you can come back to your idea.Don't be foolish enough to think that you will remember your idea when it comes time to write your critique.
Spend the necessary time writing down your observations as you read. You will be glad you did when it comes time to put your observations into a complete analytical paper.

, Form a vague opinion of the piece in question. Evaluate the author's overall argument after you have read the article through two or three times. Record your initial reactions to the text.Make a list of possible sources of evidence for your critique. Jog your memory for any literature you've read or documentaries you've seen that might be useful for evaluating the article.

"
"
Question whether the writer's overall message is logical.,
Search the article for any biases, whether intentional or unintentional.,
Consider the author's interpretations of other texts.,
Notice if the author cites untrustworthy evidence.,
Don’t completely ignore stylistic elements.,
Question research methods in scientific articles.,
Dig deep.,
Remember that a critique doesn't have to be entirely positive or negative.",How to Critique an Article3," Test the hypothesis and compare it to other similar examples.Even if an author has done research and quoted respected experts, analyze the message for its practicality and real world application.
Examine the author's introduction and conclusion to make sure they match up as convincing and complementary elements.

, If the author has anything to gain from the conclusions demonstrated in the article, it's possible that some bias has been demonstrated.Bias includes ignoring contrary evidence, misappropriating evidence to make conclusions appear different than they are, and imparting one's own, unfounded opinions on a text. Well-sourced opinions are perfectly OK, but those without academic support deserve to be met with a skeptical eye.
Bias can also come from a place of prejudice. Note any biases related to race, ethnicity, gender, class, or politics.

, If the author makes a claim about another's work, read the original work and see if you agree with the analysis provided in the article. Complete agreement is obviously not necessary or even likely; but consider whether the author’s interpretation is defensible.Note any inconsistencies between your interpretation of a text and the author's interpretation of a text. Such conflict may bear fruit when it comes time to write your review.
See what other scholars have to say. If several scholars from diverse backgrounds have the same opinion about a text, that opinion should be given more weight than an argument with little support.

, Does the author cite an irrelevant text from fifty years ago that no longer holds weight in the discipline at hand? If the author cites unreliable sources, it greatly diminishes the credibility of the article., The content of the article is likely the most important aspect for your literary critique, but don't overlook the formal and/or literary techniques that the author might use. Pay attention to obscure word choices and the author's tone throughout the article. This is particularly helpful for non-scientific articles dealing with aspects of literature, for example.These aspects of an article can reveal deeper issues in the larger argument. For example, an article written in a heated, overzealous tone might be ignoring or refusing to engage with contradictory evidence in its analysis.
Always look up the definitions of unfamiliar words. A word's definition can completely change the meaning of a sentence, especially if a particular word has several definitions. Question why an author chose one particular word instead of another, and it might reveal something about their argument.

, If critiquing an article containing a scientific theory, be sure to evaluate the research methods behind the experiment. Ask yourself questions such as these:Does the author detail the methods thoroughly?
Is the study designed without major flaws?
Is there a problem with the sample size?
Was a control group created for comparison?
Are all of the statistical calculations correct?
Would another party be able to duplicate the experiment in question?
Is the experiment significant for that particular field of study?

, Use your existing knowledge, educated opinions, and any research you can gather to either support or disagree with the author's article. Provide empirical arguments to support your stance.While there is no such thing as too much good evidence, over-sourcing can also be a problem if your arguments become repetitive. Make sure each source provides something unique to your critique.
Additionally, don't allow your use of sources to crowd out your own opinions and arguments.

, In fact, the most interesting literary critiques often don’t vehemently disagree with the author; rather, they build upon or complicate the author's idea with additional evidence.If you do agree entirely with the author, therefore, make sure to build upon the argument either by providing additional evidence or complicating the author's idea.
You can provide contradictory evidence to an argument while still maintaining that a particular point of view is the correct one.
Don’t “take it easy” on the author due to misguided empathy; but neither should you be excessively negative in an attempt to prove your critical bona fides. Forcefully express your defensible points of agreement and disagreement.

"
"
Begin with an introduction that outlines your argument.,
Provide evidence for your argument in the body paragraphs of your critique.,
Complicate your argument near the end of the critique.,
Present your arguments in a well-reasoned, objective tone.,
Conclude your critique by summarizing your argument and suggesting potential implications.",How to Critique an Article4," The introduction should be no more than two paragraphs long and should lay out the basic framework for your critique. Start off by noting where the article in question fails or succeeds most dramatically and why.Be sure to include the name of the author, article title, the journal or publication the article appeared in, the publication date, and a statement about the focus and/or thesis of the article in your introductory paragraph(s).
The introduction is not the place to provide evidence for your opinions. Your evidence will go in the body paragraphs of your critique.
Be bold in your introductory assertions and make your purpose clear right off the bat. Skirting around or not fully committing to an argument lessens your credibility.

, Each body paragraph should detail a new idea or further expand your argument in a new direction.Begin each body paragraph with a topic sentence that summarizes the content of the paragraph to come. Don't feel like you have to condense the entire paragraph into the topic sentence, however. This is purely a place to transition into a new or somehow different idea.
End each body paragraph with a transitional sentence that hints at, though does not explicitly state, the content of the paragraph coming next. For example, you might write, ""While John Doe shows that the number of cases of childhood obesity is rising at a remarkable rate in the U.S., there are instances of dropping obesity rates in some American cities."" Your next paragraph would then provide specific examples of these anomalous cities that you just claimed exist.

, No matter how solid your argument is, there is always at least one dramatic way in which you can provide a final twist or take your argument one step further and suggest possible implications. Do this in the final body paragraph before your conclusion to leave the reader with a final, memorable argument.


You might, for instance, utilize a counterargument, in which you anticipate a critique of your critique and reaffirm your position. Use phrases like “Admittedly,” “It is true that,” or “One might object here” to identify the counterargument. Then, answer these possible counters and turn back to your strengthened argument with “but,” “yet,” or “nevertheless.”, Avoid writing in an overzealous or obnoxiously passionate tone, as doing so can be a turn-off to many readers. Let your passion shine through in your ability to do thorough research and articulate yourself effectively.While writing “This piece of garbage is an insult to historians everywhere” might garner attention, “This article falls short of the standards for scholarship in this area of historical study” is more likely to be taken seriously by readers.

, It is important to provide a recap of your main points throughout the article, but you also need to tell the reader what your critique means for the discipline at large.Are there broad implications for the field of study being assessed, or does your critique simply attempt to debunk the messy work of another scholar?
Do your best to make a lasting mark on the reader in the conclusion by using assertive language to demonstrate the importance of your work: “Challenging the claims of such a distinguished scholar is no easy or enjoyable task, but it is a task we all must agree to do for our generation and those to follow.”

Determine the level of copyediting.,
Read through the text without changing anything.,
Read through the text from beginning to end.,
Read the text sentence by sentence.,
Correct formatting and style.,
Do a final read-through.",How to Copyedit and Proofread Written Work1," There different levels (e.g. baseline, standard, and substantive) of copyediting. Lower levels of copyediting are not as thorough and take less time.Standard copyediting is customary unless you have received specific instructions to do more or less.If you are doing a baseline edit, you will correct errors in spelling, typing grammar, punctuation, and style. Also check that capitalization and spelling is consistent throughout the article.
If you are doing a standard edit, you will do all of the activities in a baseline edit, check for consistent style of writing and a logical relationship between the text and any graphics. You may also do some light rewriting and remove redundant and wordy text.
If you are doing a substantive copyedit, you will do all of the activities included in the baseline and standard edit with more rewriting. You rewrite the text to improve the consistency, style, and flow of the text. You may rearrange sentences or reorganize paragraphs. You may also change passive voice to active voice.;
, Each manuscript is different and authors have their own unique writing style. Reading before you begin to edit will give you an idea of what the author is trying to say, which will be helpful when you begin editing. As you read through the article you can note any areas that may need more attention.This initial reading can also help you plan how you would like to tackle the editing process and what the specific steps will be. For example, some edits may focus more on transitioning between paragraphs and ideas while another edit may focus more on grammar and punctuation.
Do not make any edits during your first reading. Only focus on becoming familiar with the text.
Keep in mind that for short pieces, such as an article or brochure, you will be able to read through the document multiple times. However, if you are editing a longer piece, such as a novel or dissertation, then it is better to plan on only doing one read-through.

, As you read the text this time, read with a critical eye. You are checking the overall flow and structure of the writing. Ask the following questions as you read:Is the information in a logical order?
Is it easy to understand the information that is being presented?
Are there topic specific terms and jargon?
Are there unanswered questions?
Are there run-on sentences or words that are used too much?
Are there smooth transitions between ideas?
Is the writing choppy?

, Go back to the beginning of the text and read each sentence independently. Fix any typos, punctuation, spelling, and grammatical errors that you see.Do not worry about the flow of the sentences or the text as a whole. You are editing one sentence at a time.


It may be helpful to use a hard copy of the text and cover up the other sentences using an index card or another piece of paper. This will keep your eyes focused on one sentence at a time.Pay attention to the correct usage of parentheses, quotation marks, commas, semicolons, and ellipses.
Also look for correct usage of ""their,"" they're,"" and ""there"" and other homonyms (i.e. words that sound the same but are spelled differently).
Keep a dictionary on hand when you are editing.

, The text may need to be written in a certain style (e.g. Chicago, AP, APA etc.) or a format depending on where it is being published. For example, if you are copyediting a manuscript for an academic journal, the journal may have specific formatting requirements. If the author is allowed to write in any style, make sure that the style is consistent throughout the text.Formatting and style affects many different things such as spelling (e.g. catalog vs. catalogue), margins, font, page number placement, headings and footers.
Style should be correctly used and consistent throughout the text.

, When all the sentences have been edited, return to the beginning of the text and give it a final reading. Double-check your work, correcting any errors you may have missed the first time. You also want to be sure that your edits have not created additional errors in the flow and readability of the text.


You may also ask another person to read the text and give you another set of eyes. When the other person reads, have them mark the errors instead of automatically changing them. It is important for you to see what you missed.
Remember that you will probably not have time to do more than one read-through on a longer piece, so plan on being thorough with your first read-through.

Print out the document if possible.,
Make a list of errors.,
Read the document backwards.,
Read the document multiple times if time allows.",How to Copyedit and Proofread Written Work2," You should try to proofread a paper copy of the document instead of proofreading on a computer screen. It is easier to catch errors on paper than on a computer screen.Print the paper using a larger font (e.g. 14 point) so that you can see the punctuation marks more clearly.Do not rely on your computer to catch all of your errors.You can use the spelling and grammar check on the computer before you proofread the document yourself.
You can proofread the document on your computer screen before you print it out as well.
For longer documents such as book-length manuscripts, you may want to ask to be provided with a paper copy or bill for the cost of printing

, Having a list of things to check for will help you stay organized.As a proofreader, you are checking for spelling errors, grammatical errors, punctuation errors, spacing, fonts, numbering, and margins.You can look for one error each time you go through the document or you may try to check for multiple errors at time.


For example, you may focus on punctuation as you read the text the first time and check spelling the next time you go through the text.
If you are proofreading your own work, write down the errors that you usually make and pay special attention to them.

, You probably won't have time to use this strategy with a long work, such as a novel or dissertation, but reading backwards might be helpful for shorter pieces. Start at the bottom of the page and read the text from right to left. Reading the paper out of context will help you identify errors. Take your time and read each word.Also read the paper out loud. This will force you the read more slowly and you may catch additional errors.
Focus on one sentence at a time. You can cover up the other sentences with a piece of paper or an index card to help you focus.Use a highlighter or colored pen to mark the errors that you find.

, Proofread the text at least twice. You can alternate reading it forwards and backwards. Also, set aside time (e.g. 20 minutes, 60 minutes, 24 hours) between each proofreading session. Viewing the text with fresh eyes will make you a more accurate proofreader.


Always proofread in a quiet environment when you are not distracted.
If there are a lot of errors, you will need to read the the text more.
Consider having another person proofread the text as well. If you are in school, ask a teacher or tutor proofread the text. If you are in college, your school probably has a writing center that can help you."

Use the ""SCOPE"" acronym.,
Remember the 5 ""C's"" of copyediting.,
Do not rush through the process.",How to Copyedit and Proofread Written Work3," There are so many things to look for when you proofread a text. It can be easy to correct some errors and forget to check for others.The SCOPE acronym highlights the steps involved in proofreading. You can also use this to have a systematic approach when you proofread different documents.""S"" stands for spelling. Always have a dictionary handy.
""C"" stands for capitalization.
""O"" stands for order of words.
""P"" stands for punctuation.
""E"" stands for express complete thought.

, When you are copyediting, you are checking the text to be sure that it is clear, correct, concise, comprehensible, and consistent.This is much more than proofreading text. Your edits should ensure that the reader understands the text as the author intended.


Clear/clarity- The reader should not be confused or misunderstand any of the text.
Correct- Spelling, grammar, and punctuation are correct.
Concise- The text is not filled with unnecessary words, phrases, or sentences that do not add to the content or quality of the text.
Comprehensible- The text is not filled with abbreviations and acronyms that may not be clear to the average reader.
Consistent- The same style and spelling is used throughout the text. For example, the text does not switch between ""five"" and ""5"" or ""color"" and ""colour.""

, Copyediting and proofreading take time. It typically takes a professional copyeditor an hour to edit six pages of double-spaced text.You will also need to take breaks and view the text with fresh eyes.


Copyediting is done before proofreading. If the text was thoroughly copyedited, proofreading should not take very long.
Keep the copyediting and proofreading processes separate. They have different purposes.If you are copyediting and proofreading your own work, finish the draft of your work early so you have plenty of time to edit. If you plan to edit someone else's work, ask them to get it to you well before their deadline so you can do a good job.

You may opt for a certification program in proofreading to improve your chances of finding employment.

, Most publications follow this sequence: a writer submits her work to a publication; an editor checks for word clarity and suggests changes; the writer then revises. The final step in the process is to proofread the text prior to publication. Your primary job as a proofreader will be to read through a text for accurate matching to the edited text.If you're a proofreader, you won't be making any editorial changes to the text.
The only queries you'll make regarding the text should be in response to inconsistencies that don't appear to have an immediate fix.

, A good proofreader must be able to work alone for long periods of time. You must be able to read quickly, recognizing mistakes as you read.

Write a draft of your essay.,
Identify major themes in your work.,
Determine your target audience.,
Think about the function of a title.,
Decide between a declarative, descriptive, or interrogative title.,
Avoid titles that are too long.,
Seek ideas from your own writing.,
Review your sources.,
Create a list of possible titles.,
Respect conventions.",How to Come up With a Good Title1," A title is the first thing your reader will see, but it is often the last thing a writer creates. You may not know what your essay will really be saying until after you've written part of it.


Essays often change during the drafting and revising process. A title you come up with at the beginning may not reflect your essay when you have finished it. Make sure to also revise your title after you finish your paper.;
, Typically, works of non-fiction have an argument. Create a list of two or three main points you're trying to make.


Look at your thesis statement. This sentence contains the major argument of your paper and can help you craft a title.
Look at your topic sentences. Reading these sentences together can help you pick out themes, symbols, or motifs in your paper that can be integrated into the title.
Consider asking a friend to read your work to help you identify themes.

, Write down a few groups of people who would be interested in your topic, and why they would be drawn to it.


If you are writing a school assignment, or your audience are academics and specialists in your topic, use formal language. Avoid using a playful tone or slang terms.
If you are trying to reach an online audience, think of what keywords a reader might use to find your article. For example, if you wrote a how-to article, include words like ""beginner"" or ""do it yourself"" that would identify your writing as appropriate for all levels of ability.
If your piece is a news story, consider who you are writing about. For example, if are writing about an athletic team write down terms like ""fan,"" ""coach,"" ""referee,"" or the team name. Readers with an interest in sports or that team can quickly identify your perspective and the topic of your story.

, Titles predict the content in the essay, reflect the tone or slant, include keywords, and catch interest. Your title should never mislead the reader. A title can also reflect the purpose of the article, such as historical context, theoretical approach, or argument., When you are choosing one of these titles, think about the kind of information you want to convey to your reader.


Declarative titles state the main findings or conclusions.
Descriptive titles describe the subject of the article but do not reveal the main conclusions.
Interrogative titles introduce the subject in the form of a question., For nonfiction, titles should convey the important information, keywords, and even methodologies. But a title that is too long can be cumbersome and get in the way. Try to keep it around 10 words or less.

, Reread your work to find sentences or phrases in which you refer to your main ideas. Often the introductory or concluding paragraphs of your work will have a phrase that would work well as a title. Highlight or make a note of any words or phrases that explain your ideas.


Look for attention-grabbing descriptions or phrases you're proud of. For example, in an essay on censorship choose a phrase like ""forbidden music"" that is descriptive but also intriguing.

, Search quotations from sources you've used to support your points for something that grabs a reader's attention.


For example, in an essay on religious persecution, a quote like ""God was silent"" is arresting and thought-provoking. Readers may immediately agree or disagree and will want to read your explanation.
If you use someone else's words, make sure to put them in quotation marks, even in the title.

, Using your lists of themes, possible audiences, phrases, and quotes created in the previous steps, brainstorm possible title words and phrases. Try combining two different elements, such as a quote and a theme. Often writers separate two elements with a colon. The parenthetical notes in the following examples indicate which elements the author chose.


The Negative Impact of Replacement Referees on Football Fans (Theme and Audience)
""A Crucible of Victory"": Understanding the Western Front in World War One (Quote and Theme)
The Queen of Diamonds: Marie-Antoinette and Revolutionary Propaganda (Phrase and Theme)

, Different disciplines, such as the sciences, the humanities, or the arts, may have different rules about what a title should look like. If you are aware of a specific expectation, you should conform to those guidelines. There are some general rules to remember:


Most words in your title should begin with a capital letter.
The first word and the first word after a colon should always be capitalized even if one of the ""short words.""
In general, do not capitalize the following words: and, a, an, the, or short prepositions if they are not the first letter in the title.If the title of a book or film is part of your essay title, it should be put in italics, e.g., Gender Relationships Between Vampires in Twilight. Short story titles are always in quotation marks.
Know if the paper follows MLA, APA, or another style. Websites like Purdue University's Online Writing Lab, APA Style, and MLA Handbook can help you with conventions for titles.

Brainstorm ideas.,
Study titles in your genre.,
Make the title exciting.,
Make the title easy to remember.,
Pay attention to the wording.,
Use strong, vivid language.,
Seek inspiration.,
Read your own work.,
Write down your inspirations when they come.",How to Come up With a Good Title2," Write down every word that comes to mind about your story. Include keywords about the topic, character names, phrases you love, and anything else that comes to mind. Arrange these in different combinations to see if anything speaks to you.

, Look for stories or books that are popular with your target audience. Readers may be drawn to your work because it reminds them of something they already like.


For example, many young adult fantasy novels hinge on one or two intriguing words: Twilight, Bitten, Cinder, The Selection.

, Dull or generic titles won't catch the reader's eye. Titles such as ""The Tree"" or ""The Train"" might name the subject or a symbol in the story, but it doesn't excite the reader.


Try adding a more descriptive word to the basic title. Successful titles using the above words include The Giving Tree, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, The Mystery of the Blue Train, and The Orphan Train.

, Titles are not only supposed to catch the reader's attention, but also spread the word about your work. Something too difficult to remember won't appeal to editors or agents, and your reader won't remember and be able to tell someone else the title. You want to come up with an exciting, yet catchy and easy to remember, title.Read your title out loud. Does it roll off the tongue? Is it exciting? Does it sound boring? Would you check out this title? The answers to these questions can help you revise the title.

, A title should be appropriate for the story, but it doesn't need to confuse your potential readers. Make sure that your wording doesn't depict the story as something it is not. Your title shouldn't sound like a science fiction story if it's a romance.

, A title needs to stand out. Strong action words, vivid adjectives, or intriguing nouns can all make your title compelling. Look at the words in your potential title. Are there synonyms that are more descriptive or unique? Can you choose a word that has a less general meaning? Some words are so common their meaning doesn't impact readers the same way.


For example, the use of the word desire in Eugene O'Neill's Desire Under the Elms is far more interesting than Love Under the Elms., Book titles often derive from established great works, such as the Bible, Shakespeare, song lyrics, or other sources. Write down phrases that are meaningful, beautiful, or intriguing to you.


Examples of this type of title include: The Grapes of Wrath; Absalom, Absalom; Gaudy Night and, The Fault in Our Stars.

, Titles are often memorable lines from the book or story itself. Readers may enjoy the moment when they realize why a story has a particular title.


Examples of this type of title include To Kill a Mockingbird, Catch-22, and Catcher in the Rye.


, Often, good writing ideas come to you when you least expect it. You may forget these, so keep a paper and pencil handy to jot down ideas that come to you whenever inspiration may strike."

Use third person for all academic writing.,
Use the correct pronouns.,
Avoid first person pronouns.,
Avoid second person pronouns.,
Refer to the subject in general terms.,
Watch out for singular and plural pronoun use.",How to Write in Third Person1," For formal writing, such as research and argumentative papers, use the third person. Third person makes your writing more objective and less personal. For academic and professional writing, this sense of objectivity allows the writer to seem less biased and, therefore, more credible.Third person helps the writing stay focused on facts and evidence instead of personal opinion.;
, Third person refers to people “on the outside.” You either write about someone by name or use third person pronouns.


Third person pronouns include: he, she, it; his, her, its; him, her, it; himself, herself, itself; they; them; their; themselves.
Names of other people are also considered appropriate for third person use.
Example: “Smith believes differently. According to his research, earlier claims on the subject are incorrect.”

, First person refers to a point of view in which the writer says things from his or her personal perspective. This point of view makes things too personal and opinionated. You should avoid first person in an academic essay.First person pronouns include: I, me, my, mine, myself, we, us, our, ours, ourselves.The problem with first person is that, academically speaking, it sounds too personalized and too subjective. In other words, it may be difficult to convince the reader that the views and ideas being expressed are unbiased and untainted by personal feelings. Many times, when using first person in academic writing, people use phrases like ""I think,"" ""I believe,"" or ""in my opinion.""
Incorrect example: “Even though Smith thinks this way, I think his argument is incorrect.”
Correct example: “Even though Smith thinks this way, others in the field disagree.”

, Second person refers to point of view that directly addresses the reader. This point of view shows too much familiarity with the reader since you speak to them directly like you know them. Second person should never be used in academic writing.Second person pronouns include: you, your, yours, yourself.One main problem with second person is that it can sound accusatory. It runs to risk of placing too much responsibility on the shoulders of the reader specifically and presently reading the work.
Incorrect example: “If you still disagree nowadays, then you must be ignorant of the facts.”
Correct example: “Someone who still disagrees nowadays must be ignorant of the facts.”

, Sometimes, a writer will need to refer to someone in indefinite terms. In other words, they may need to generally address or speak about a person. This is usually when the temptation to slip into the second person “you” comes into play. An indefinite third person pronoun or noun is appropriate here.


Indefinite third person nouns common to academic writing include: the writer, the reader, individuals, students, a student, an instructor, people, a person, a woman, a man, a child, researchers, scientists, writers, experts.
Example: “In spite of the challenges involved, researchers still persist in their claims.”
Indefinite third person pronouns include: one, anyone, everyone, someone, no one, another, any, each, either, everybody, neither, nobody, other, anybody, somebody, everything, someone.
Incorrect example: ""You might be tempted to agree without all the facts.""
Correct example: “One might be tempted to agree without all the facts.”, One mistake that writers often make when writing in third person is accidentally switching into a plural pronoun when the subject should be singular.


This is usually done in an attempt to avoid the gender-specific “he” and “she” pronouns. The mistake here would be to use the plural “they” pronoun in place.Incorrect example: “The witness wanted to offer anonymous testimony. They' were afraid of getting hurt if their name was spread.”

Correct example: “The witness wanted to offer anonymous testimony. He or she was afraid of getting hurt if his or her name was spread.”

"
Shift your focus from character to character.,
Reveal any information you want.,
Avoid use of the first person and second person pronouns.",How to Write in Third Person2," When using third person omniscient perspective, the narrative jumps around from person to person instead of following the thoughts, actions, and words of a single character. The narrator knows everything about each character and the world. The narrator can reveal or withhold any thoughts, feelings, or actions.For instance, a story may include four major characters: William, Bob, Erika, and Samantha. At various points throughout the story, the thoughts and actions of each character should be portrayed. These thoughts can occur within the same chapter or block of narration.
Example: “William thought that Erika was lying, but he still wanted to believe that she had a good reason for doing so. On the other hand, Samantha believed that Erika was lying and felt jealous about the fact that Tony wanted to think well of the other girl at all.”
Writers of omniscient narratives should be conscious of “head-hopping” — that is, shifting character perspectives within a scene. While this does not technically break the rules of Third Person Omniscience, it is widely considered a hallmark of narrative laziness.

, With third person omniscient view, the narration is not limited the inner thoughts and feelings of any character. Along with inner thoughts and feelings, third person omniscient point of view also permits the writer to reveal parts of the future or past within the story. The narrator can also hold an opinion, give a moral perspective, or discuss animals or nature scenes where the characters are not present.In a sense, the writer of a third person omniscient story is somewhat like the “god” of that story. The writer can observe the external actions of any character at any time, but unlike a limited human observer, the writer can also peek into the inner workings of that character at will, as well.
Know when to hold back. Even though a writer can reveal any information he or she chooses to reveal, it may be more beneficial to reveal some things gradually. For instance, if one character is supposed to have a mysterious aura, it would be wise to limit access to that character's inner feelings for a while before revealing his or her true motives.

, Active dialog should be the only time that first person pronouns like “I” and “we” should appear. The same goes for second person pronouns like “you.”


Do not use first person and second person points of view in the narrative or descriptive portions of the text.
Correct example: Bob said to Erika, “I think this is creepy. What do you think?”
Incorrect example: I thought this was creepy, and Bob and Erika thought so, too. What do you think?

"
"
Pick a single character to follow.,
Refer to the character's actions and thoughts from the outside.,
Focus on other characters' actions and words, not their thoughts or feelings.,
Do not reveal any information your main character would not know.",How to Write in Third Person3," When writing in third person limited perspective, a writer has complete access to the actions, thoughts, feelings, and belief of a single character. The writer can write as if the character is thinking and reacting, or the writer can step back and be more objective.The thoughts and feelings of other characters remain an unknown for the writer throughout the duration of the text. There should be no switching back and forth between characters for this specific type of narrative viewpoint.
Unlike first person, where the narrator and protagonist are the same, third person limited puts a critical sliver of distance between protagonist and narrator. The writer has the choice to describe one main character’s nasty habit — something she wouldn’t readily reveal if the narration were left entirely to her.

, Even though the focus remains on one character, the writer still needs to treat that character as a separate entity. If the narrator follows the character's thoughts, feelings, and internal dialogue, this still needs to be in third person.In other words, do not use first person pronouns like “I,” “me,” “my,” “we,” or “our” outside of dialog. The main character's thoughts and feelings are transparent to the writer, but that character should not double as a narrator.
Correct example: “Tiffany felt awful after the argument with her boyfriend.”
Correct example: “Tiffany thought, “I feel awful after that argument with my boyfriend.”
Incorrect example: “I felt awful after the argument with my boyfriend.”

, The writer is as limited to just the protagonist's thoughts and feelings with this point of view. However, with this point of view, other characters can be described without the protagonist noticing it. The narrator can anything the protagonist can; she just can't get into the other character's head.Note that the writer can offer insight or guesses regarding the thoughts of other characters, but those guesses must be presented through the perspective of the main character.
Correct example: “Tiffany felt awful, but judging by the expression on Carl's face, she imagined that he felt just as bad if not worse.”
Incorrect example: “Tiffany felt awful. What she didn't know was that Carl felt even worse.”

, Although the narrator can step back and describe the setting or other characters, it has to be anything the viewpoint character can see. Do not bounce around from one character to one character within one scene. The external actions of other characters can only be known when the main character is present to view those actions.


Correct example: “Tiffany watched from the window as Carl walked up to her house and rang the doorbell.”
Incorrect example: “As soon as Tiffany left the room, Carl let out a sigh of relief.”

"
"
Jump from character to character.,
Only focus on one character's thoughts and perspective at a time.,
Aim for smooth transitions.,
Understand who knows what.",How to Write in Third Person4," With episodically limited third person, also referred to as third person multiple vision, the writer may have a handful of main characters whose thoughts and perspectives take turns in the limelight. Use each perspective to reveal important information and move the story forward.Limit the amount of pov characters you include. You don't want to have too many characters that confuse your reader or serve no purpose. Each pov character should have a specific purpose for having a unique point of view. Ask yourself what each pov character contributes to the story.
For instance, in a romance story following two main characters, Kevin and Felicia, the writer may opt to explain the inner workings of both characters at different moments in the story.
One character may receive more attention than any other, but all main characters being followed should receive attention at some point in the story.

, Even though multiple perspectives are included in the overall story, the writer should focus on each character one at a time.


Multiple perspectives should not appear within the same narrative space. When one character's perspective ends, another character's can begin. The two perspectives should not be intermixed within the same space.Incorrect example: “Kevin felt completely enamored of Felicia from the moment he met her. Felicia, on the other hand, had difficulty trusting Kevin.”

, Even though the writer can switch back and forth between different character perspectives, doing so arbitrarily can cause the narrative to become confusing for the narrative.In a novel-length work, a good time to switch perspective is at the start of a new chapter or at a chapter break.
The writer should also identify the character whose perspective is being followed at the start of the section, preferably in the first sentence. Otherwise, the reader may waste too much energy guessing.Correct example: “Felicia hated to admit it, but the roses Kevin left on her doorstep were a pleasant surprise.”
Incorrect example: “The roses left on the doorstep seemed like a nice touch.”

, Even though the reader may have access to information viewed from the perspective of multiple characters, those characters do not have the same sort of access. Some characters have no way of knowing what other characters know.


For instance, if Kevin had a talk with Felicia's best friend about Felicia's feelings for him, Felicia herself would have no way of knowing what was said unless she witnessed the conversation or heard about it from either Kevin or her friend.

"
"
Follow the actions of many characters.,
Do not attempt to get into directly into a character's head.,
Show but don't tell.,
Avoid inserting your own thoughts.",How to Write in Third Person5," When using third person objective, the writer can describe the actions and words of any character at any time and place within the story.There does not need to be a single main character to focus on. The writer can switch between characters, following different characters throughout the course of the narrative, as often as needed.
Stay away from first person terms like “I” and second person terms like “you” in the narrative, though. Only use first and second person within dialog.

, Unlike omniscient pov where the narrator looks into everyone's head, objective pov doesn't look into anyone's head.Imagine that you are an invisible bystander observing the actions and dialog of the characters in your story. You are not omniscient, so you do not have access to any character's inner thoughts and feelings. You only have access to each character's actions.
Correct example: “After class, Graham hurriedly left the room and rushed back to his dorm room.”
Incorrect example: “After class, Graham raced from the room and rushed back to his dorm room. The lecture had made him so angry that he felt as though he might snap at the next person he met.”

, Even though a third person objective writer cannot share a character's inner thoughts, the writer can make external observations that suggest what those internal thoughts might be. Describe what is going on. Instead of telling the reader that a character is angry, describe his facial expression, body language, and tone of voice to show that he is mad.Correct example: “When no one else was watching her, Isabelle began to cry.”
Incorrect example: “Isabelle was too prideful to cry in front of other people, but she felt completely broken-hearted and began crying once she was alone.”

, The writer's purpose when using third person objective is to act as a reporter, not a commentator.Let the reader draw his or her own conclusions. Present the actions of the character without analyzing them or explaining how those actions should be viewed.
Correct example: “Yolanda looked over her shoulder three times before sitting down.”
Incorrect example: “It might seem like a strange action, but Yolanda looked over her shoulder three times before sitting down. This compulsive habit is an indication of her paranoid state of mind.”

Use the right paper.,
Find the right font.,
Make your margins the right size.,
Put your last name and page number flush to the right margin.,
See if you should skip the first page header.",How to Create a Header in MLA Format1," In general, you should use standard white 8.5"" x 11"" (or A4) paper when preparing a paper in MLA style. Make sure your word processor is set to this paper size before you format your header., The MLA does not specify a single font preference, although classic, simple, easy-to-read fonts are preferable. Times New Roman is probably the standard choice.Font size, however, is specified as 12-point.
The same font type and size should be used in both the header and the main body of the text.
MLA recommends that you choose a font that has clearly contrasting regular and italics fonts., MLA style specifies one-inch (2.54 cm) margins on all edges of the page.Since your page number should be aligned to the right margin, it should therefore be one inch from the right edge of the page. With the standard header and footer settings used with these margins, your header text will be one-half inch from the top of the page.

, If your last name is Smith, your header on page 3 will appear simply as ""Smith 3"".Consult with your instructor if there is another person with your last name in the class. He / she may want you to put ""J. Smith 3"".
MLA style also permits instructors to simply exclude the use of the last name in the header, leaving only the Arabic numeral page number.

, MLA style leaves it to the instructor / editor / author's discretion whether to include a first-page header or leave it blank.Title pages are not used in MLA format, so your full name will already appear on the first page of text.
Simply ask your instructor if he / she has a preference.

Work independently.,
Be clear on the type of editing you should do.,
Make sure you have enough time to edit.,
Put the work first.,
Communicate with your author.",How to Be a Good Editor1," Editing can be a lonely job. You spend a lot of time with a manuscript, especially if it’s a lengthy book, and being able to work independently is a valuable skill. Your author shouldn’t give you direction on how to complete the editing. In fact, the author is expecting the opposite: he is expecting you to give him direction on how to improve the writing., A good editor will have a conversation with the author to make sure she is completing the editing that the author is looking for. For example, your author may be looking for quick copyediting, but if you are rewriting large sections of the work and suggesting entirely new directions for the writing, you’re not on the same page. Some different types of editing include:


Developmental editing: This type of editor works with the author to develop ideas or to shape a manuscript into a publishable work.Line editing: This form of editing looks at language, creative content and style of writing. The line editor will not look for errors. Instead, the editor examines how the writer communicates with the reader.Copyediting: Copyediting involves correcting errors, looks for inconsistencies, and prepares a style sheet. Copyediting can be light, medium, or heavy, depending on how much work needs to be done on the manuscript. Most of the editing is cleanup work, although heavier copyediting may involve more substantial rewrites., When you take on a client, ensure that you can devote adequate time to editing the project. Editing can be a time-consuming process, and there may be several back-and-forth sessions with the author as you share your feedback. If you’re rushed or you can’t see a project through to the end, you won’t give your best effort to editing the manuscript.

, The manuscript is the most important part of the author-editor relationship. Being a good editor means that you will suppress your ego in favor of the manuscript. You don’t need to assert your authority over details and finely crafted sentences., Once you’ve edited a manuscript, return the manuscript to the author and then talk in person or over the phone with her. Give her your overall thoughts and impressions, and then spend time going through the full manuscript to explain your edits.


Give your author a chance to respond to your edits. Listen carefully to how she explains herself. This will give you a better sense of what she’s trying to accomplish in the manuscript.

, The header is not automatically visible in a blank document, unless it is in Print View mode.In Microsoft Word, the Header and Footer option is found under the View menu. While there are options for adding images, symbols, and the like, remember that for MLA formatting, you will only need to use text (your last name) and page numbers.

, Set the header to appear in the upper right hand corner, one-half inch (1.27 cm) from the top of the page and against the edge of the right margin.You can accomplish this by selecting from the pop up menu options or by using your alignment options to select right alignment.

Check spelling.,
Check grammar.,
Look for inconsistencies.,
Question facts and other information.",How to Be a Good Editor2," Make sure every word is spelled correctly. Don’t simply rely on spell-check to catch mistakes. Once you’re a good editor, most misspellings will jump out at you and you’ll be able to catch them more easily. Work at improving your spelling.


If you are editing a manuscript for British English, you’ll use different spellings than in American English. Differentiate between “colour” and “color,” for example, or “centre” versus “center.” Use consistent spelling throughout the manuscript.
If someone is mentioned in the text, verify the spelling of this person’s name.

, If you are copyediting a manuscript, be sure to pay special attention to the grammar. Balance your corrections with a respectful sense of collaboration. Suppress any inclination to act like the grammar police. You are helping the author improve his manuscript. You are not there to give him a grammar lesson or to teach him never to make a certain mistake again., As you read the writing, look for passages or instances where the information doesn’t match up. For example, you might read that a character’s hair is blond, but two chapters later, the character’s hair is black. Your job as editor is to catch these inconsistencies before the reader does.

, If the manuscript has facts that seem off, raise the question to the author. If there’s an obvious error that you know how to correct, you might be able to do that on your own. But if there are other errors that are specific to the subject at hand and you’re not sure, flag them for the author and allow him to verify.,If the manuscript is particularly sensitive, such as an investigative reporting piece on a controversial topic, you should definitely verify that the facts are correct. Work with the reporter to ensure accuracy.

Be brutally honest.,
Give positive feedback.,
Be professional.,
Be supportive.,
Make sure the author’s voice shines through.,
Be able to explain and defend your changes.,
Send proofs to the author.",How to Be a Good Editor3," In order to make the best possible manuscript, you need to be very honest with the author. Don’t coddle the author. Tell him what you really think about the manuscript. The point is to help the author make the best work possible. If you are not honest with critiquing the work, then you are shortchanging the author and the readers. , Even when you need to be brutally honest, a good editor will still give positive feedback. Tell the author what you love about his work. This will also work to soften the blow when you give feedback about things that need to be changed., Authors tend to be very connected personally with their works. It’s your job as an editor to maintain professionalism so that the author knows you’re not attacking him when you give feedback. For example, if you think the author runs on and on, you can tactfully comment on this. Don’t respond with a comment like, “Just shut up already!” Instead, write, “It’s time to move on to a new subject.”

, Your author is trusting you with helping to shape her work into something that represents her creative voice. Be supportive of what your author is trying to accomplish. And then it’s your job to bring that work to a publishable state.


If you get a work that is particularly rough, encourage the author by saying, “This is a good start. Let’s work with what you’ve given to expand it.”

, Your job as editor is not to leave your imprint on the work. You are a behind-the-scenes contributor. The author makes particular choices about how she writes, the words she uses, and the rhythm of the sentences. Your job is to make sure the author communicates effectively with the reader. Don’t apply your own preferences to the work.For example, you may detest certain words and try to avoid using them. But if your author is using one of these words, it should stay in the text. Your author chose it for a reason.

, A good editor will know exactly why a change or edit needs to be made. She will be able to explain in detail why the edit improves the text.Don’t hem and haw over your reasons for making certain edits. Be assertive with your author., When the manuscript is completed and the editing is finalized, send the manuscript back to the author. Then the author can review your changes to make sure her writing still says what she wants it to say."
"
Create simpler sentences.,
Make long sentences shorter.,
Use single words instead of 2-and 3-Word phrases.",How to Avoid Sentence Sprawl1," Don’t create long, drawn-out sentences. Although some variation in sentence length keeps your writing interesting, sentences that are too long can confuse the reader.


Over long sentences keep the reader on edge, delaying meaning and creating more points than can be comprehended in one go.
Instead, keep sentences shorter. Only have one or two main ideas in each sentence.
For example an overly long sentence could read: ""Learning to write better sentences can be a good way to make your writing crisper and snappier, without losing the central meaning of your sentence, and still including all the necessary details that support your thought."";
, Look at the long sentence above. How could it be rewritten into shorter, better sentences?


It has at least 3 main points, so you can divide it that way.
This could be a possible way to break that sentence up well. “Learning to write better sentences can be a good way to make your writing crisper and snappier. Additionally, you can do this without losing the central meaning of your sentence. All necessary details can still be included.”
You’ll need to add in transition words in places, such as “additionally,” to help the shorter sentences connect. Nonetheless, the shorter sentences help your reader grasp your meaning more easily.

, Use a single word in place of 2- and 3-word phrases if possible.


Like varying sentence length, varying word choice makes writing more interesting; however, choosing to use longer phrases makes the writing lengthier.
Look at this example: “It was not the same as eating pie with her.”
If you change the negative to a positive, the sentence becomes shorter: “It was different than eating pie with her.”
While 2 words might not seem like that much, they do add up over a long piece of writing.

"
"
Cut excess words to increase the impact of a sentence.,
Use commands.,
Avoid repetition to keep your prose fresh.",How to Avoid Sentence Sprawl2," Excess words add fluff to the text and fill up space, but they aren’t necessary to your sentence in any meaningful way.


Look at the following sentence: “Georgia went into the store to buy some ice cream.” What word could be eliminated in that sentence?
“Some” doesn’t really add much to the meaning, so it could go. “Georgia went into the store to buy ice cream.”
Look at a second example: “You should work to find the best possible solution.” What words could be eliminated?
“Work to” doesn’t really add much, and neither does “possible.” The sentence could easily be: “You should find the best solution.”

, Commands are often one of the best ways to express yourself concisely.


Commands are clear and to the point, and come with the added bonus of eliminating modifying and connecting verbs.
To continue with the example from the previous step, you could turn the sentence into a command: “Find the best solution.” In this instance, the “you” is implied.

, Avoiding repetition can be one of the best ways to breathe new life into your writing. You can do by following a few key rules, such as:


Avoid inherently repetitive phrases. For instance, phrases like “each and every,” “added bonus,” “direct confrontation,” “protest against,” and “written down” are all redundant, as they repeat the meaning.
Take this sentence: “It was a difficult dilemma, especially at 8 a.m. in the morning.” What phrases are redundant?
“Dilemma” already means something complicated, so “difficult” isn’t needed.
Similarly, “a.m.” tells the reader it is in the morning, so you should take out one or the other: “It was a dilemma, especially at 8 in the morning.”

Cite your sources.",How to Write a Progress Report," There are a variety of different reasons someone asks you to write a progress report. Obviously for any of them it's to show what kind of progress you've achieved on a specific project. However, there are some different types of proposals that you'll need to consider.


Progress report for a research program or project is going to be slightly different than for a project at work. In this case you are more likely to need to cite information and are less likely to need to consider things like cost (although not always).
A work report for a client is going to read somewhat differently than for a superior at work. You'll need to consider why you're writing this report for them.;
, When you've sorted out the purpose of writing your progress report, you need to consider the kinds of things that your audience is going to need to know in the report. While all progress reports have general things they tend to include, you'll need consider the specifics:


How are your readers connected to the project? How will the outcome of the project affect them? (The connection and how they're affected is going to be different for your superior than for the client, for example.)
Consider what decision your readers are going to need to make after reading the progress report (what support, money, time are they investing, for example.
Consider the information your reader is going to need to know to oversee and participate in the project effectively. What technical aspects of the project will they need to know. Are they comfortable with technical jargon?

, A progress report isn't only a written document that you send to your superior or your professor. It can take a number of forms depending on what is needed.


A progress report could be a brief oral report at weekly or monthly staff meetings.
It could be periodic emails to colleagues.
It could be formal or informal memos to supervisors.
It can also be formal reports for clients or government agencies.

, Unless you've written this specific type of progress report before (in which case, why are you on here?), you'll want to get as much guidance from your superiors. There may be a specific format that your company uses, in which case you'll want to be sure you follow the rules for that.

, Not all progress reports need to be formal. In fact, internal reports for colleagues or supervisors often tend to be more informal in tone. This is why it's so important to check with your supervisor for what they are likely looking for.


When it comes to information for a client or government agency, or thesis review board, you err on the side of formality.
No matter the formality or informality of your tone you want it to be clear, focused, and honest.

, By the time you start writing your report you'll already have figured out what the tone needs to be and the point of the report. Now you need to decide the best way or ways in which to present that information.You might choose to do a bulleted list. It's a very clear way to present the material and it's easy to skim and still get the needed information. However, it can be a slightly less formal way of writing a progress report so it might be better to use it for memos to supervisors and emails to colleagues.
You may also consider adding in graphs or tables. This might be especially good if you're writing a progress report for a project in which you're trying to get funding, or show why you deserve the funding you've been given.

, To write a successful progress report you want it to be as clear as possible. Splitting your report into subsections is a great way to cluster all relevant material together.


Adding subheadings to your can make this even clearer, because it lets your readers or audience know what to expect in each subsection. If there is material that they are particularly interested in they'll be able to jump right to that part.

, This typically goes across the top of the paper, if you're using a page format. Again, it will depend on what your company or university prefers, so make sure you check in with them.


The heading should include the date, when the report was submitted, the name and the position of the recipient, the writer’s name and position, and the subject of the report.

, The introductory section goes below the heading. It can often be set apart from the rest of the material through italics. It gives a brief overview of the project, and summarizes its status. You will be establishing what progress has been made, and whether certain goals have been achieved.


Make sure to include: the purpose of the report, introduce the project, remind that this is an update on the progress of the project.

, The body of proposal, whether it's broken into sections and subsections, is basically just a more detailed version of the introduction. Consider the information you've put into the introduction and make sure to expand on that information.


Specify tasks that have been accomplished since the last report and what tasks are ongoing.
Discuss problems that you’ve encountered, issues that need to be addressed, and potential solutions for those problems and issues.
Address changes that have happened and why they needed to be made.
You can also include things like personnel changes, difficulty in obtaining material, what cost overruns you may have encountered, any delays or problems with technology or security.

, While this is still basically part of the body of the report, you want to make sure that your audience understand where you're going with the project. Make sure that you state what problems might affect the deadline for completion, the budget, or the management structure.


You really do want to make sure say whether the deadline for the project has changed or not.
Avoid sugarcoating any problems for your audience, but don’t alarm them unnecessarily or promise anything you can’t deliver.

, You will need to show how much work you and your team (if you have one) have put into the project. This will show your audience (whether it's your supervisor, your clients, or a government agency who might give you money) that you've been working hard.

, As long as you stick the basic information outlined above, you should be fine. You really want to avoid wandering off into other areas only marginally related to the project, interesting though they may be.For example: if your project is about reigniting a local, nonprofit arts organization, it might be tempting to go off into a discussion of the deplorable state of arts funding, but it won't really help detail how your project is coming along.

, The point of a progress report is to get across the progress you're making, without overwhelming your audience with words and ideas. All you need to focus on are how a particular project is coming, what still needs to be worked on, and what changes made need to be made.


Depending on who you're writing the report for you might be cut down to a specific page limit. A good rule of thumb is to keep it as short as possible, while making sure that you fit in the appropriate information.

, You need to make sure that you give specific details on where you're at in your project. For example: you would want to avoid saying something like ""We're making good progress on getting our arts funding"" and instead say ""with the two $5,000 grants from these different foundations, we are just $2,000 short of our $12,000 goal.""

, Again, you want your report to be clear and concise. You don't want to overwhelm your audience with wording that doesn't add anything to the report. For example, phrases like “complete catastrophe” or “giddy success” are too emotional and too vague to be of use to clients or supervisors.

, Any information you use that comes from an outside source, any graphs or data, needs to be properly cited. You can add an additional sources cited page to your progress report.

Accumulate as much information about the company as possible.,
Gather information about the beginnings of the company.,
Find out the company’s plans for future growth and development.,
Cover key points.,
Organize the profile effectively.,
Write from an informal perspective.,
Keep the clients in mind.,
Focus on what’s unique about the company.,
Make the profile easy to find.,
Engage with your readers and future clients.,
Describe the company in specific language.,
Make the company profile engaging.,
Include links to other websites that support claims about the company.",How to Write a Company Profile for a Website," Begin by perusing the company website. From there, reach out to the company management, including the current CEO and board members.


It will be simple to gather this information if you have worked at the company for a substantial amount of time. If you’re less familiar with the company, you will need to research the company and its business goals.
In addition to managers, interview employees who have worked for the company. They may have some interesting information to include on the company profile. Although not everything you discover through these interviews will make it to the finished profile, providing human-oriented detail will grab your readers’ attention.Talk to the key people from the company’s management or heads of departments. These people may be able to share relevant facts on the company with you.;
, Most company profiles describe the company’s beginning. State who founded the company, what was the initial goal or intent, and how the company grew. Include a paragraph that describes:


Where and how the company was founded,
The company’s business model and practices.
The purpose, vision, and goals of the company.

, As interesting as the past of the company may be, its future will be of greater interest to prospective clients. In clear language (avoid business jargon), This should include:


The company’s business model and outlook.
How the company plans to expand its goods and services offered, or how it plans to increase the number of company store locations.

, Once you’ve done your research and have a thorough understanding of the company, you can begin to outline and assemble the company profile. The following key points are a summary of what should be included in company profile. Plan to devote at least a paragraph to each:Size of the company (big or small).
Location of the company.
Brief story of the company’s inception and history.
Who founded the company, who owns the company, and who currently directs the company.
Summary of the services or products that the company provides.
Summary of the company’s mission, values, and business model.

, Keep in mind that, although ideally everyone who opens the company profile will read the whole document, many readers will stop after the first couple of paragraphs. Put what you consider to be the most important information in those paragraphs, and then move on to secondary information.


Lead with your strongest points about the company.Whether that’s your company’s sales record, innovative practices, or ethical business practices, put the company’s best face forward.
Highlight the company’s services and products in the first paragraphs. Your readers can continue to peruse if they want to know specific details about business model, location, etc.

, “About Us” pages can be dull or off-putting if they’re written through a third-party lens. This provides objectivity, but can feel uninviting to readers. Instead, write from a first-person perspective to make readers feel welcome and to make your company profile feel friendly and personable.Use the pronouns “I” or “we,” rather than objectively describing “the company… .”
Write as if you’re speaking to website visitors and potential clients face-to-face. Write something like, “We’re thrilled that you’re taking the time to read our company profile. We hope this page tells you some useful things about us, and don’t hesitate to contact us with any questions about our product or company.”
Instead of writing, “employs 55 workers,” say, “I work at along with 55 friends and co-workers.”

, Most of the individuals who view your website company profile will be potential clients.These people will want to know about the history and business plan of the company, and will look for the company profile to serve as an introduction to the business overall.


Keep the profile tone conversational. Save the jargon for business meetings, and orient your company profile towards non-business-savvy clients.
Instead of writing, “seeks to increase production and expand its client base in coming years,” say, “We here at are looking forward to meeting new customers in new places this year.”

, Address ways in which your company is different from its competition, without mentioning any competitors by name.As businesses (and business websites) proliferate, it’s valuable to show how your company is unique. For example, include things like:


The education and personal history of company founders.
If the company has been given any special awards or accolades.
If the company reaches out to the community it’s located in.

, Since the profile will serve as the company’s introduction to new website visitors and potential clients, it’s important that it not be buried in an obscure corner of the website. Put a link to the profile at the top of the Home page (or wherever the navigation bar is located).


It would be appropriate to have a sentence on the Home page reading: “If you want to learn more about us, check out our company profile!”

, Clients who come to your company profile will expect to see honest claims about your company, and will feel confused or discouraged by opaque writing or a lack of information.


Individuals who may invest in your company will also begin by looking at the profile. For their sake, include information about the company’s funding model and finances., Generalities have their place, but you should not include them in your company profile. The profile should present a straightforward, fact-based description of company practices and their benefit.For example,


Rather than explaining that your company’s business model “increases productivity,” be specific and say that it “increases productivity by 18%.”
Clearly state what types of problems your business addresses or solves.
Explain your company’s management structure and plans for growth.

, Your profile should be intuitive to readers and they should feel drawn into the page. Avoid being overly technical in your business descriptions, and keep sentences short and written mostly in the active voice.


Include one or two interesting, personal, or slightly humorous anecdotes about the company from company founders or current leadership.If your company profile is more than a few paragraphs in length, consider adding graphics or images to generate visual interest., Readers will appreciate the transparency, and you’ll be able to put a positive spin on the profile without having to use self-flattering language.Include links to other websites that show:


Any press releases or recent news about the company.
Endorsement from current customers, celebrities, or industry experts.

",How to Write Social Media Content," Whether your business caters to doctors, wine enthusiasts, or local soccer teams, most people don’t log on to Facebook looking to buy something- they log on after a long day at work, beer in hand, to catch up with friends. Dinner’s cooking and the kids are playing tag in the den. Your tweet, ad, or blog post must compete with this ruckus. So keep it short and sweet. Run-on sentences, technical jargon, and bloated expositions have no place in this world. A catchy tweet or Facebook post can be achieved in under ten words.;
, Customer loyalty is created not by viewing ads, but by interacting with a business. A popular Florida restaurant began tweeting diners after the meal, asking how they could improve on the experience; not surprisingly, these customers were far more likely to return. A post as simple as “How’s our new Santa Fe chicken?” provides effective interaction. Just hope the chicken’s good!

, Write your tweets, blogs, and posts as if you were speaking to a client in the office whom you wanted to entertain and impress.

, Your company’s website caters to potential clients searching for your business through industry recommendations or search engines. These clients have the necessary time to read in-depth about your company. Your Facebook site, on the other hand, caters to the guy who just got home from work but saw your post about half-price.

, Social media provides a great outlet for informal, explanatory pieces which help establish your business as an expert in the field. Good examples of customer education are FAQs on a Facebook page or short, informative posts on Blogger about industry news. A successful Maryland medical technology firm distills long congressional bills into one-paragraph chunks on Blogger entitled “How This Actually Affects Your Practice.” Healthcare providers turn to this firm’s site for news- and increasingly, for new products.

, Social media’s people-centered environment lets you put a human face on your company. Many Twitter accounts use first names such as bill@washingtonelectronics, etc. If your company has a story, Facebook is the appropriate place to share it. Because people are the reason that social media sites were created in the first place.

, Using what you’ve already got by reviewing all possible sources such as blogs, photos, videos and anything on your native website as well what you’re sharing on other popular social sites like Pinterest, Tumblr and YouTube. Content is repackage-able. Not all of your fans or followers may have seen it when you posted it originally, so it’s okay to reframe it and re-publish it occasionally.

If you're new to writing how-to articles, it's a good idea to start with a topic you're comfortable discussing. For instance, if you're a computer engineer, you might try writing an article as simple as ""How to Build a Potato Clock"" or one as technical as ""How to Install a Motherboard."" Now's your chance to do some serious soul-searching. Is there a topic in your mind that feels great or ""perfect"" - something you already know how to do comfortably? If not, try brainstorming possible topics while asking yourself questions like:


""What special skills or training do I have?""
""Have I done something that most people haven't?""
""What do I receive compliments about (sense of humor, etc.)?"";
, You want to simply, clearly tell your reader what your article will tell them how to do. Readers are fickle and selfish with their time - most of the time, they'll pick the option that appears to be quickest and easiest. An easy-to-digest title will give your article an instant advantage over one with an overwritten title. A good title should:


Clearly state what is being taught. An article on how to play guitar like Jimi Hendrix shouldn't be titled simply ""Purple Haze."" The reader can't tell from the title what kind of article this is - is it a biographical piece? An in-depth look at the song?
Be written with good grammar (generally, capitalize every word except articles (words like ""a,"" ""an,"" ""the,"" etc.), making sure to capitalize the first and last words even if they're articles.)Convey the content of the article in as few words as possible. ""How to Play Guitar like Hendrix"" is much more attractive than ""How to Play the Electric Guitar Like Rock Star and 27 Club Member Jimi Hendrix.""
Avoid complex jargon (for more technical topics, this may be unavoidable.)

, How-to articles can be long or short, funny or serious, specific or general, technical or casual - there's no hard and fast rule. However, you'll want to tailor your article to be as legible as possible for the kinds of people who are most likely to read it. Change your writing style and even the content of your article to make it as useful as possible for your target audience without being boring.


Here's one example: An article on making paper spitballs is going to be read mostly by bored teenage students looking for laughs and people who, for whatever reason, want to vicariously experience that frame of mind. A lengthy section about the effects of air resistance on projectile motion will bore your audience to tears. In this case, keep the article short, sweet, and lighthearted.
An opposite example: An article on solving differential equations shouldn't have much in the way of jokes - people who read this article are likely trying to educate themselves or complete a homework assignment. They're definitely not reading this article for laughs. For this article, the tone should be academic and professional.

, Readers read an article's introduction to make sure it's right for their needs. Your readers are tantalizingly close to the body of the article, so don't lose them here! Be brief - you shouldn't need more than a paragraph for basic how-tos. Also be sure to include the purpose of the article (forgetting this is a common writing pitfall.) Background information and/or scene-setting is acceptable, but try to keep it to a sentence or two. Above all, don't meander! A directionless introduction can kill an otherwise informative article.


One well-worn trick is to include a question in the opening line to capture a reader's interest. For example: ""Have you ever wondered how to write an engaging introduction?""
It's also useful to phrase the last sentence so that it acts as a transition into the body of the article. For example: ""Here's how to do it in a few easy steps:""

, If you're writing a how-to article about a process that requires certain tools or supplies to complete, list them before you dive in to the main instructions. Be thorough, but use common sense - for instance, you don't need to list ""One oven"" in the ""Ingredients"" section of a recipe how-to.


Here's an example list of ingredients for an article on how to make a pesto sauce:

Two cups fresh basil, packed.
1/2 cup pecorino cheese, grated.
1/2 cup olive oil.
1/4 cup pine nuts.
One clove garlic.
Salt and pepper, to taste.


You shouldn't list these things:

One food processor (mention it in the actual instructions)
Pasta (you're not making a pasta dish, just the sauce)
A can-do attitude (things like this usually come across as cheesy)



, Organize your steps in chronological order. Whenever possible, try to limit each step to one idea. Use commanding action verbs, not vague phrases like ""Be prepared"" or ""Know what you want to do."" You can use sub-steps or bullet lists to add further explanation for complicated steps. As always, keep your sentences short and simple to make your instructions as easy to follow as possible.


A good step for an article about brewing your own wine: ""Pick high-quality grapes."" A bad step for the same article: ""Know what you're getting yourself in to.""

Avoid first person reference. Replace “I, me, my, mine, we, our or us” with ""you or your"" to address the reader directly.
If your article details a particularly long or complex process, you can divide your steps into two or more ""parts,"" each containing steps for a distinct part of the process. An article on farming corn, for instance, might have separate parts for the sowing process, caring for the corn as it grows, harvesting the corn, etc.
Alternatively, if your process can be done in more than one way, you may want to divide your steps into multiple ""methods,"" each explaining a specific way that the process can be done. For instance, an article on changing gears while driving might contain two methods - one for automatic transmissions and one for manual transmissions.

, When writing, you should always express ideas in your own words. However, even if you completely understand the process you're writing about, how-to articles will often require you to research outside sources for specific information. Always credit any sources you used to avoid plagiarism. If you must reprint copyrighted content verbatim, obtain explicit permission from the original author.


One general rule when researching for an article is to preferentially consult primary (rather than secondary or tertiary) sources. For a good guide on understanding primary sources, see our article on finding primary source documents.

Many publications have specific procedure for properly citing and attributing sources. See: How to Reference Sources on wikiHow


, After the main steps, you have an opportunity to add tidbits that didn't warrant a place in the body of the article. Provide alternative supplies or solutions to common problems with the process. Clarify common mistakes or misconceptions. Warn the reader about any potential danger involved with the process.


Tips and warnings should be as explicit as possible, especially if your process is potentially dangerous. You can even use bolded text to call extra attention to especially important warnings.
Here's an example warning for an article on how to install a fan in a computer: Caution. Turn the power off and disconnect the power cable before removing the exterior casing. Serious electric shock can result if the computer isn't completely powered down.

, Pictures in a how-to article can range from ""nice to have, but not essential"" to ""absolutely vital."" Many articles must use a visual reference to clarify certain concepts. An article on building a chair needs pictures - it's very difficult to convey the precise positions of the interlocking wood pieces through text.


If you have a good-quality camera or know how to draw, you can provide pictures for the article yourself. If you can't draw, don't have a good camera, or the process is too complicated to recreate for the purpose of obtaining pictures, you might want to hire a professional illustrator.

, Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis famously said, ""There is no great writing, only great rewriting."" No first draft has ever existed that didn't benefit from intelligent editing. Review your spelling, punctuation, grammar, and overall style. Omit any information that isn't necessary. Pare your article down to the bare minimum necessary to convey your information.


It can be difficult to see flaws in your work immediately after you've written it. Take a break for a few hours or go to sleep before editing. When you return to your work, you may find many improvements that can be made.
Get a friend whose opinion you respect to proofread your work. See if they can understand your instructions - a good how-to article should make sense to people besides its author.

, A well-written how-to will pique readers' interest in the article's subject, while a poorly-written one will send readers running for other sources of information. In either case, it can be useful to include links to other how-to articles that cover related topics. Generally, these links will be in the form of a short list at or near the end of the article. These articles should cover articles whose information overlaps with your own and/or articles about processes from the same general field. For instance, an article about how to ""perm"" hair might include links to articles on how to:


Care for permed hair
Get rid of a perm
Braid Hair
Give someone a Jeri Curl
Use a curling iron
Apply mousse

Are there more than one type of user? What sort of knowledge and experience will this user have about the topic? What will that user be using my document to do? How often will they need to refer back to my document? Will the user understand the jargon associated with the topic?Users of technical writing can fall into several different categories, each with their own specific needs: customers, end users, installers, developers, trainers and trainees, or tech support.
You will most likely not be able to write a separate document for each user, so you will need to take into consideration the needs of ALL potential users when writing.;
, Once you’ve figured out who your audience is, you need to figure out what how those users will be using the document. In general the document’s objective will fall into one of two categories: task-based or reference-based. Task-based documents are from the perspective of what the user is doing, whereas reference-based documents are from the perspective of what the product does.An example of a task-based document could be instructions on how to create a website in Wordpress. In this situation you’d walk the user through all the steps from start to finish, regardless of where those steps occur within the Wordpress software.
An example of a reference-based document could be a user’s manual for a Blu-Ray player. In this situation you’d explain each part of the machine separately - what each button, function, menu item, etc., does.

, Planning out your entire writing process is an efficient and effective way to approach your project. A good approach includes: gathering the information, planning and organizing the information, writing, verifying and testing, and redoing and revising. While this approach looks like it has 5 neat steps, it’s actually a circular process. At any point in this approach you may need to go back to a prior step.Gathering the information includes: reading all you can about the topic; using the product yourself; understanding what your user(s) will need to know about the item; interviewing the people who developed the item; attending meetings where the item is discussed in detail and listening to what is said; and allowing the item experts provide you feedback if you got something wrong.

Planning and organizing the information includes: figuring out exactly what it is you need to write about (i.e. what are your deliverables); developing a schedule for your work; and reviewing your plan with the necessary people to make sure it meets expectations.

Writing is most efficiently accomplished by: creating a complete outline of your document, including all the topics you plan to cover; actually writing out each chapter and section; and determining when you do not have enough information to finish a particular chapter or section and need to do more research.

Verifying and testing is where you make sure your document actually does what it was intended to do, accurately. Start by attempting to use your own document - do all the steps make sense, is anything missing, etc. Next read through the document for non-content items like grammar, spelling, format, etc. Finally you’ll need to give your document to one or more experts and ask them to review it.

Redoing and revising is where you take all the feedback you’ve received, including from yourself, and update your document with those items. And depending on how the document is going to be used, it can include constant reviews and updates over time, as the document is used and problems are found.

, Unfortunately, most technical writers are being paid to produce a document either within a set timeframe, or for a set price. Chances are you may find yourself needing to compromise on one thing in order to ensure something else can happen.This may seem like a harsh idea to get your head around, but it’s an unfortunate reality of a lot of work environments and situations.


The most important thing to remember is that a technical document should — first and foremost — be accurate.
The document should also be as complete as possible. There shouldn’t be any missing steps that could confuse a user.
Once you’ve accomplished the ‘accurate’ and ‘complete’ portions, then you can worry about typos, formatting, tables, lists, etc.

, At this point you should be fully aware of who your audience is, and if they already have the expertise to understand the technical jargon associated with your topic. If your entire audience consists of expert users, using jargon shouldn’t be a problem. But if your audience consists of anyone who is not an expert user, it is better to avoid the use of jargon as often as possible.Most, if not all, jargon has common words that can be used instead. Some examples of jargon include:


“Script” - in a technical sense this refers to computer code, but the average person might think this means a script for a play or movie.
“Unsub” - this term is used a lot in crime TV shows and movies. It means an “unknown/unidentified subject.” But to a lay person this term will probably not mean anything.
“Due diligence” - in a business sense, this means to do complete research on something in advance of making a decision. It may not mean anything to a lay person, or they may interpret the words individually.
“Left wing” or “right wing” - from a political perspective this refers to how liberal or conservative someone is, but a lot of lay people aren’t familiar with the terms. Instead, write out liberal or conservative.

, When using abbreviations, always spell out the full name first, and then put the abbreviation in brackets after the full description (e.g. American Library Association (ALA)). For the rest of the section or chapter you can use the abbreviation instead of the full name (e.g. ALA).Be aware that acronyms are not necessarily the same thing as abbreviations. Acronyms are letter-only short forms like abbreviations, but unlike abbreviations, the letters can be pronounced like a word. For example, ALA would have each letter pronounced separately when saying it, whereas LAN isn’t spelled out, it’s turned into a word.

, There are many scientific or technical terms that you will need to use in your writing, but may be unfamiliar to some or all of your audience. When using a word or term that is not part of everyday language, define it the first time you use it. You can define it by either putting the definition in a set of brackets after the term (e.g. put the definition here), or you can create a glossary that applies to the entire document. If you decide upon a glossary, highlight the word or term in such a way to alert the reader to refer to the glossary for its definition (e.g. bold, italic, underline, etc.).An alternative to a document-wide glossary is a table defining important words and terms at the beginning of each chapter. Users would read the definitions before reading the content. With the definitions fresh in their memory, the content will be more understandable.
Avoid using cliches, even if you think the majority of your audience may understand them., When trying to explain something technical to the average person, use as few words as possible to get your point across. It is not necessary to explain every last thing you say in immense detail. Remember who your audience is - if you’re writing a user’s manual for a DVD player, you don’t need to explain how the circuit boards inside the DVD player work. You just need to explain what happens when you press a certain button. This suggestion also includes choosing the least number of words necessary to make a point - avoid redundancy.An example of a redundant statement is: “Water quality in the Athabasca River declined in May. This decline occurred because of the heavy rainfall this month. All the extra water overloaded Yellowhead county’s water treatment plant.”
The same example written without redundancy is: “Water quality in the Athabasca River declined in March because heavy rainfalls overloaded the Yellowhead Country water treatment plant.""
Example statements (with needless words in parentheses) are as follows:

(already) existing
at (the) present (time)
(continue to) remain
(empty) space
mix (together)
never (before)
start (out)
none (at all)



, When making a point in technical writing, put the most important pieces of information first. Once the key information has been stated, then you can follow-up with an explanation of why it happened, or what caused it to happen.Don’t say “Despite five penalties in the first and second periods of the game, the Maple Leafs still managed to win,” when you can say “The Maple Leafs won, despite five penalties in the first and second periods.""

, Technical (and scientific) writing isn’t know for its humour, and that’s not necessarily a good thing. Adding a little humour, in just the right place, helps the reader pay attention. Dry, boring and repetitive technical writing tends to lose the reader’s attention rather quickly. One great place to put humour is in examples., Simple, straight-forward writing, especially in a technical document, helps ensure that the reader doesn’t misunderstand what is being said. This means keeping your explanations and intentions clear. Everything you write should only have one meaning or interpretation.Simple also means using smaller words when possible, rather than large, complex words that don’t help explain the point. Large, complex words can also make the writer seem arrogant and can cause your reader to lose interest.An example of an unclear instruction is: “The system shall free storage space as needed by first in, first out (FIFO) or some other defined priority schedule.”An example of a clear instruction is: “The system will delete oldest recordings first when making space for new recordings.""
Some examples of complex vs. simple words are as follows:

utilization vs. use
functionality vs. feature
facilitate vs. cause
finalize vs. end
aforementioned vs. mentioned
individualized vs. individual
heretofore vs. previous



, Using an active voice means that the subject of a sentence (i.e. the noun) performs some sort of action, as opposed to the action being performed on the subject (i.e. passive voice).Active voice also refers to what types of verbs are used. Active voice tends to be easier to understand when read, and sounds more confident.Another way to think about which verbs you use is to consider if they need to be preceded by “to be,” “is,” “was,” “were,” “has been,” and “have been.” If those extra words are required, the verb is probably written in a passive voice and should be rewritten.
Passive voice also tends to be written as something that happened in the past, whereas you should write as if everything is happening in the present, right now.An example of a statement with a passive voice: “The man was bitten by the dog.""
An example of a statement with an active voice: “The dog bit the man.""
If you’re unsure whether what you’ve written is straight-forward enough, read it out loud to yourself.

, Nouns come in two types - concrete and abstract. Concrete nouns are items you can actually experience with your five senses. For example, stone, DVD player, engine, blue wire, etc.Abstract nouns are items related to emotions, values, qualities, concepts, etc. For example, calm, evil, honesty, maturity, talent, disbelief, love, death, dreams, etc.A technical document should be trying to explain to a reader HOW to do something in a straight-forward and concrete manner. Abstract nouns can end up distracting the reader from the point you’re trying to make.


An example of where abstract nouns are used: “The existing nature of Mount St. Helens’ volcanic ash spewer was handled through the applied use of computer modelling capabilities.”An example of where concrete nouns are used: “With Cray computers, we modelled how much ash spewed from Mount St. Helens.""

, Pronouns like “it” and “this” can end up confusing readers as most statements you write will refer to multiple nouns.A pronoun, in general, has something called an antecedent. The antecedent is the noun that pronoun is referring to. For example: My dog chased the stick and brought it back. The word ‘stick’ is the noun, and ‘it’ is the pronoun. The pronoun ‘it’ is referring to the antecedent ‘sticks.’ Ideally, you should repeat the noun when possible (e.g. my dog chased the stick and brought the stick back), or reword the sentence such that pronoun is not required (e.g. my dog chased and brought back the stick).


An example of a statement where pronouns are used: “The monitor needs to be plugged into the computer, it should be close enough for a cable to reach.” What is “it” referring to? The monitor or the computer?
An example where pronouns are not used: “The monitor needs to be close enough to the computer so the cable can reach.""

, Technical writing can contain a lot of words that could potentially be written multiple ways. For example, email vs. e-mail. Or, login vs. log in vs. sign in. Which option you choose to use is up to you (or whomever is paying you), but once you pick an option, use it consistently throughout the entire document. Going back and forth between ‘sign in’ and ‘login’ will cause confusion for the reader.Other things to keep consistent are:


Starting bulleted lists in the same format every time, and using the same punctuation each time.
Capitalizing the same terms throughout the entire document, and deciding which items are to be capitalized.
Decide if you’ll use contractions or not, and then stick to it.
Decide if you’ll spell out numbers, or only use the actual number. In many technical documents the numbers zero through nine are usually spelled out, whereas any number that is a double digit or more is written as a number.
Decide how you’ll use formatting like BOLD, ITALICS and UNDERLINE, and keep it consistent.

, Being precise in technical writing means avoiding vague terms that are unnecessary to get your point across. Words like ‘countless', ‘some', ‘approximately', ‘huge', ‘tiny', etc., are unnecessary in most situations. Specific examples of how to alter your writing in order to be more precise are as follows:Don’t say “There are many replacement parts available out there” when you can just say “Replacement parts are available.""
Don’t say “A really strong odour was noticeable” when you can say “A pungent smell is noticeable.""
Don’t say “Using the diagnostic system installed on the main system …” when you can simply say “Using the diagnostic system…” or “Using the diagnostic system onboard the main system…""
If there are a specific number associated with what you talking about, use the number when referring to that item, not a high-level phrase. For example, use “There are 10 possible reasons this could happen:” rather than “There are a number of possible reasons this could happen:”.

Call to Write suggests that you write out a list of about 10 topics (people, places, or organizations) and rate what is interesting and what is not. Some possible topics include, but are not limited to, local celebrities, non-profit organizations, and even every day people.;
, At this point you want to choose your subject and do a little research to find out what you do not know. Another part of this step is determining feasibility. Writing about a subject that will be difficult creates an environment that hinders the fun of learning for both yourself and the readers.

, In this step you want to reach out to the subject you have selected to write about outlining your project, intent, and what you want from them. It is important to be very professional. Be very appreciative and make their experience with you a breeze. Call to Write reminds its readers to be prepared for the rare ""no"" answer. Thank the person for their time and move on the your second choice from your list in step one.

, Once you have locked down a subject you need to agree on a time and place to meet. Ask your subject what time works best for them so that you can accommodate their schedule. Important Tip: When scheduling an interview make sure to have it be in a public setting. I.e. - a cafe, a park, etc. While your subject is most likely trustworthy, they are not someone you know well and your safety as a young writer is a priority. Also, if meeting in person is difficult for your subject video calling is a great alternative.

, Now that your interview is scheduled, you need to write the questions you will ask. Call to Write states that a writer must remember their purpose and ask questions to get the information needed for a relevant, useful profile. The questions you ask leave an impression on your subject and should be to the point and not miscellaneous.

, When it comes time for your interview, dress presentably and show up early to get a feel for your location and not waste any time. Ask your questions, engage in the answers and get the information you want to write an amazing profile. Recording the interview, if okay with the subject, is advised as to not misquote anyone or anything.

, Though only a recommended step, some research after the interview can clear up discrepancies. It is likely you will need to look into some answers your subject gave in order to fully understand the information you have obtained. You are done with this step when you have completely comprehended everything you know about your subject.

, This step is very straight forward. By this point you have all your information so it is time to put fingers to keyboard. Make sure to have read examples acclaimed profiles to have an understanding of the genre. Genre-awareness is essential.

, Though peer review is the best way to spot errors in work, reading the profile aloud to yourself should help you work towards the final draft. If it sounds wrong or seems like it is missing anything then it probably is. Remember to make your points clear and give distinct insight and detail.

, You did it. With Call to Write as your Bible, you have successfully written a profile. Publish and share your work - be proud of your writing.

Teach students the importance of technical writing.,
Familiarize students with the various documents that technical writers produce.",How to Teach Technical Writing1," Students need to understand both how important writing will be in their careers and also how important it is that they write well.


Low-level employees can expect to spend up to 20 percent of their time writing, with the percentage of time spent writing increasing as they climb the corporate ladder.






As cited by Janet Van Wicklen in ""Why Dick and Jane Can't Write on the Job,"" American businesses lose more than $1 billion each year from poorly written communications.





;
, Technical writing can be broken down into several sub-types, as described below. Some documents may have elements of more than one sub-type within them, such as marketing-related topics within a help file.


Instructional writing: This includes textbooks, user and owner's manuals, software help files, procedure guides, and how-to articles. The purpose of instructional writing is to inform, explain, and educate.






Marketing writing: This includes fliers, brochures, external newsletters, social media posts, and white papers. While the purpose of marketing writing is to sell as much as it is to inform, the style of technical writing used for marketing purposes is one that informs, to sell by telling instead of overt persuasion.






Business communication: This includes internal newsletters, letters, reports, corporate memos, corporate intranets, and email. The purpose of business communication is to communicate company policies, plans, and progress to those who have a vested interest in the company's success, either as employees or investors.

Strive for clarity.,
Be brief.,
Lay out the document for easy reading.,
Know your audience.,
Be accurate.",How to Teach Technical Writing2," Technical writing content should be clearly understood by the person reading it. Poorly written content can lead to broken equipment, replacement costs, and possibly either the owner suffering injury or suing the company — all of which can damage public relations.


One way to ensure clarity is to use specific quantities instead of ambiguous terms: ""three"" instead of ""several,"" ""every four hours"" instead of ""frequently,"" ""a week ago"" instead of ""recently,"" and so forth.






Another way to ensure clarity is to use a given word to represent the same concept throughout the document. In a software help file, for example, ""screen"" should always refer to the computer screen, ""window"" should always refer to the main display of a software application, and ""dialog"" or ""dialog box"" should refer to any floating portion of the display that prompts the user for a response.







, Unlike other forms of writing, technical writing is intended to help the reader accomplish a purpose, often in a limited amount of time. For this reason, technical writing uses as few words as necessary to make its point.


Some technical documents are brief because of how they are designed. A car owner's manual is written concisely because it is designed to fit in the glove compartment, while the owner's manual for a watch is often designed to fit in the watch case.






Technical writing for the Internet needs to be brief because many readers find it harder to read text on a screen than in print. Also, the advent of tablet computers and smartphones means that many readers are reading with screens smaller than those used with a desktop or laptop computer.






One way to be brief is to use the shortest possible word that conveys the concept: ""use"" instead of ""utilize,"" ""try"" instead of ""endeavor,"" ""to"" instead of ""in order to."" Prepositional phrases can often be replaced with a single adjective in front of a noun or eliminated entirely.






A second way to be brief is to omit unnecessary words. Something is unique; it is not ""somewhat unique,"" ""rather unique,"" or ""very unique.""






A third way to be brief is to use the active voice instead of the passive voice whenever possible. Active voice uses action verbs without linking verbs (""Technical writing uses as few words as necessary""), while passive voice uses linking verbs such as ""is"" or ""was"" with participle forms of verbs (""A car's owner's manual is written concisely"").







, Technical writing puts more emphasis on how the content is arranged on the page or screen than do other forms of writing. The goal is to present information so it can be quickly read and understood. Technical documents may use any or all of the following aids:


Graphics such as illustrations, photographs, and tables.






White space in the form of generous margins and block indentations to identify important text.






Headings and subheadings to identify the concepts of the paragraphs that follow them.






Varying font sizes and types. Headings and subheadings usually use a larger point size than body text and may be a different font than the body text.






Font formatting such as boldface, underlining, and italics. These are often used in a consistent manner for emphasis, such as the names of virtual buttons on software user interfaces being written in boldface.






Bulleted and numbered lists. Bulleted lists often emphasize key points, while numbered lists often list the steps in following a procedure.







, Knowing who will read the document you're writing with affect which words you choose for clarity and succinctness and may also determine how you lay out the document. Audiences can be broadly described as one of three types:


High-tech peers/Subject matter experts. These readers generally know as much about the subject as the writer. Someone writing to this audience can use jargon related to that subject without explaining it.






Low-tech peers/Knowledgeable people. These readers know something about the subject but not as much as the writer does. Someone writing to this audience can use jargon related to the subject, if it is properly explained.






Lay readers/End users. These readers are customers, clients, patients, or anyone else outside the business. Someone writing to this audience should avoid jargon in favor of the words used to explain that jargon to low-tech peers and may also have to add a further explanation.







, Technical writing must provide the reader with correct information, written correctly. Facts presented must be correct, any math must be correct, and the grammar used must be correct so the reader focuses on the content without being distracted by mistakes.


Most technical writing has to be researched in the same way as college essays are researched, through examining data, interviewing experts, and finding anecdotes and examples.

Technical writing is not written to entertain or distract the reader. Instead, it should be informative and clear. Technical writers, also called technical communicators, will prepare documents like instruction manuals, journal articles, and design documents that contain information for customers, consumers, designers, and manufacturers.As a technical writer, you may also write assembly guides, user guides, scientific papers, medical papers, brochures, and employee and student handbooks.
You should also have a good eye for detail and be able to communicate in a clear and concise way. Most technical writers are good teachers, and can explain rules or guidelines in an educational way. You should also have extensive knowledge of punctuation, syntax, and style, and have a strong grasp on sentence structure and grammar.;
, Strong technical writers will plan their documents before writing them and state the information with clarity, brevity, and simplicity. They will also use the appropriate word choice, use the active voice as much as possible, and understand that technical writing is a process that may require editing or revising. Planning your written documents is one of the key steps to producing strong technical writing for a client. You should keep in mind the following elements during the planning stage:Identify your audience and their expectations.
Understand the purpose of the document.
Organize your supporting materials and outline the document.
Budget the necessary time to write, revise, and edit the document.

, Technical writing is a growing field, especially in the United States. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predict technical writing jobs will grow 15 percent faster than average for all occupations. In fact, technical writing is one of the most in demand skills by employers, especially as the technology sector continues to grow. Having the ability to communicate effectively and teach readers about a variety of subjects will make you a very desirable candidate in the job market.As of May 2012, the median annual wage for technical writers was $65,500. Most technical writers have a college degree in technical writing or a related field, as well as some experience in a technical subject like computer science, web design, or engineering. Many universities also offer certificate programs in technical writing.

, Beyond simply writing documents that explain a process or product, strong technical writers will also be skilled at rhetoric. This means you can write persuasively and eloquently about the process or product. Rather than reproduce templates or guidelines, you should consider the goals and situations around the document. This will allow you to communicate more effectively with the target audience and explain the process or product in a more user friendly way. No matter what type of technical document you are creating, you should always consider your intended audience and make the document user-centered. Doing this will make your document accessible and understandable to your reader. To write rhetorically, you must have a strong grasp on the rhetorical situation of a document:Determine the audience’s expectations. Ask yourself: what information are my readers expecting to get from this document? What information do I need to provide to readers?
Think about the characteristics of the audience. Consider who is reading the document. Is your audience part of the decision making process in terms of the style and organization of the documents, such as stakeholders and management? Is the audience the general public or the average reader? How do the characteristics of the audience affect the document expectations? Writing a document for an audience who is familiar with the information will create a different tone than writing a document for an audience who are non specialist or general users. You should also consider the reading level of your audience. Your client may specify the reading level and you should write to that reading level.
Consider the goals of the audience. What is your reader planning to accomplish? What should your reader learn from the document? You should ensure the document includes all the necessary information to allow your reader to achieve their goal or goals.

, Organization is a key element of being a strong technical writer and one of the simplest ways to organize raw information or data is to break it down into a number of tasks, followed by instructions for each task.Consider how many tasks there are in the procedure you are writing about. A task is a semi-independent group of actions within a procedure. For example, setting the clock on an oven is one task in the procedure of operating an oven. Some procedures do not contain more than one task, for example, changing a light bulb. But more complex procedures, like operating an oven or finding a light bulb for a certain light fixture contain several tasks.
To organize a long list of tasks, group similar or related tasks together into steps. Then, group these steps into phases or stages. Number each step in a phase or a stage. For example, for operating an oven, you may have one phase titled setting up the oven, with steps on plugging the oven into a power source, setting the clock, confirming the temperature settings, and checking that the fan and oven light work properly once the oven is plugged in.
You can also organize the information by tools, rather than by tasks. Consider the tools available to the user of the product, for example, the user of an oven. In a tools approach, you may create a section for the power source of the oven, the oven clock, the temperature setting, the fan, and the oven light. However, it can be difficult to use a tools approach for technical writing that does not involve a product or item. Often, you will use a tasks approach in technical writing, especially if you are writing about a process.

, Strengthen your language use in a document by using the active, rather than the passive, voice. Describing a process in the active voice, with action verbs, will give your writing immediacy and clarity.


For example, rather than start a document with about how to operate an oven with: “Stick the oven into the power source”, use a stronger verb like “plug” or “connect”. You can also use other action verbs in active sentences like “Set the oven clock”, “Determine your ideal temperature setting”, and “Confirm the fan and the oven light work properly.”
You should also ensure your sentences use the active voice as much as possible. You may have a sentence that uses the passive voice, such as: ""Light pressure should be applied on the oven door to ensure it is closed properly."" Adjust this to the active voice, where the sentence's subject does the action in the sentence: ""Apply light pressure on the oven door to ensure it is closed properly."", If you are using jargon or slang in your documents, you should consider if your audience will understand this jargon. If the jargon is unfamiliar to them, you must define these unfamiliar terms, or replace these terms with simplified language. A good rule of thumb is to never use two words when one word will do. Focus on paring down your language so the essential meaning is clear to your reader and the meaning is not cluttered by unnecessary information or terms.Avoid needless complexity, which occurs when you use formal terms that can confuse or throw off your reader. For example, rather than write “utilize”, you can write “use”, rather than write “finalize”, you can write “end”, rather than write “functionality”, you can write “feature”.
Often, technical terms will be abbreviated in documents. You should always spell out the abbreviations when they are first mentioned in a section and then use the abbreviation in the rest of the section to avoid redundancy.

, Many technical writing documents can be enhanced with the use of graphics or visual aids to keep your reader engaged and to provide a visual example of the process. It can be difficult to explain a complex process in words, and using an illustration can help your reader understand the process that much more.Your client may provide visual aids or graphics that need to be integrated into the technical writing document, or you may need to outsource these graphics to an illustrator. Suggest visual aids if your client is not already aware of their use. The white space provided by graphics can also break up the written descriptions and give your reader a chance to digest the information.

, Most clients will provide a style guide that outlines their expectations of the document in terms of language, grammar, punctuation, syntax, and style. You should always follow the client’s guidelines when formatting a technical writing document. Avoid submitting documents that have not been formatted properly or that do not adhere to the client’s style guide. This will appear unprofessional and sloppy.

, Technical writing documents often go through several revisions and rewrites before they are considered final by the client. You must maintain open communication with your clients to ensure they receive a final document they are happy with. Avoid taking any edits or revisions personal. You are working for a client and you are writing for a client’s needs.


Many technical writers create multiple versions of documents to keep track of any revisions or adjustments. You may be working on several projects at once, especially if you are a freelance technical writers, so keep your documents organized to make revisions easy and fast.

, Improve your writing skills in a continuing education course on technical writing and gain more insight into how to master technical writing. Many courses focus on specific elements of technical writing, such as audience awareness, organization of information, use of visual aids, and simplifying language according to the reading level of the audience.Consider which areas of technical writing you would like to improve on and which course would be most beneficial to help expand your skillset as a technical writer.

, Technical writing conferences can be good places to meet other writers in the industry, and find a possible mentor to guide you in your career. Be prepared to network at these conferences and don’t be shy around your peers. Many conferences also hold panels and seminars to help you improve your existing technical writing skills., A professional technical writing association, such as the Society for Technical Communication (STC), can help you meet other professionals and keep up to date on the latest developments in the technical writing industry. Many employers also consider membership in a professional association as asset, and an indication that you are connected and well versed on the current developments in the industry.

Develop a color scheme instead of choosing colors randomly.,
Be consistent in your use of color.,
Set off key points with color.,
Provide a reasonable degree of contrast.,
Use color sparingly.",How to Use Colors in Technical Writing1," Colors should be used to call attention to the text, not to the colors themselves. Choose a small number of colors that look good together and document your choices in your technical publications style guide.


If necessary, you should also devote an introductory paragraph on the way color is used in your publications in the publications themselves, if your colors have been chosen to serve particular purposes, such as providing tips or warnings.;
, While certain conventions have developed in the use of color in some technical writing, such as using green for help file hyperlinks and blue for Web text hyperlinks, you do not have to adhere to these conventions. You do, however, have to be consistent in which colors you use; your hyperlinks should all appear the same color, and if you use a different color to show the hyperlink has been clicked, use the same color each time.

, You can use colored bullets or numerals for bullet points and items in a list, while leaving the text itself normal. Colored text backgrounds are appropriate for call-outs, sidebars, and notes sections of help file topics, as long as the text in those sections is shorter than the main body of the text.

, Your colors should stand out enough from the text that the reader can see the colored text or background and know the emphasis is present. They should not, however, be so bold that the color distracts from the text they are emphasizing.


Color contrast can be particularly helpful in charts and graphs. The lines, bars, or pie sections that show the data should be a different color from the chart axes. Include a color key with the graph.
Avoid putting light-colored text on a dark-colored background; it's harder to read than dark-colored text on a light-colored background.

, Don't use large blocks of colored text, such as printing a long warning in red; instead, use a red text heading labeled ""Warning"" or put a bolded ""Warning"" heading in normal black on a red background.

"
"
Know the physical limitations of your audience.,
Know the cultural connotations of various colors.,
Consider whether and how the document will be printed.",How to Use Colors in Technical Writing2," Some colors are innately difficult for everyone to read, while some people have difficulty distinguishing certain colors.


Light shades of blue are hard to see because the human retina lacks sufficient blue cones in the center of the fovea, the part that provides maximum visual acuity, to detect blue. Also, lighter shades of blue are not picked up by photocopiers (""non-repro blue"") when copying in color.
About 10 percent of men suffer some form of color-blindness, either an ability to tell red from green or an inability to tell yellow from blue. If your target audience is largely male, don't use red and green together or yellow and blue together.

, Technical writing, like other forms of writing and commerce, is increasingly being targeted to an international audience. Because of this, it is important to be aware of some of the cultural connotations of certain colors.


Red, in Western culture, often signifies anger, danger, or warning (as used in Stop and Yield signs). In China, red symbolizes prosperity, while in Korea, red is used when recording the names of the dead.
Black is the color associated with death in the West, while white symbolizes cleanliness and purity. Asian cultures, however, use white to symbolize death and mourning.

, As noted above, technical writing for the Web is more likely to incorporate colors than technical writing that will be printed. (The most likely forms of technical writing to be printed are reports that incorporate charts and graphs.) If the document is going to be printed in black and white, there is little point in using color in writing it, as certain colors mute to indistinct shades of gray. If the document will be printed in color, make a test print of the intended color scheme, so you can see how the colors look in print as opposed to on the screen and make any necessary adjustments before committing to a set of colors.


If a piece of technical writing is to be used both for the Web and printed in hard copy, it is helpful to make a separate version for each medium, using conditional topics or conditional text or formatting, according to the capabilities of the software used to create it.

Use the source in the introductory phrase.,
Introduce the quote with a descriptive verb.,
Do not use a comma if the lead-in ends with “that” or “as.” If you use “that” or “as” in your introductory phrase, you do not need to use a comma afterwards.",How to Lead Into a Quote1," This is a useful option if you are quoting an academic source or a critic. In the introductory phrase, use the last name of the person who wrote the quote you are sourcing. Follow the introductory phrase by a comma and then the quote.For example, if you are using a quote from a text by John Smith, you may write:

According to Smith, “Life is beautiful.”
In Smith’s view, “Life is beautiful.”
In Smith’s words, “Life is beautiful.”

;
, Descriptive verbs are a good way to introduce a quote in the text in a brief and concise way. Use descriptive verbs like “states,” “remarks,” “notes,” “comments,” or “maintains.” Always use the last name of the author, followed by the descriptive verb. Then, use a comma and include the quote.Do not use “says” as a descriptive verb to introduce a quote, unless you are quoting from an interview.
For example, if you are using a quote from a text by Hannah Arendt, you may write:

Arendt remarks, “Even in the darkest of times, we have the right to expect some illumination.”
Arendt states, “Even in the darkest of times, we have the right to expect some illumination.”



, Instead, simply put the quote after the phrase.For example, you may write:

Arendt points out that “totalitarianism is to be feared.”
Arendt emphasizes that “totalitarianism is to be feared.”
Arendt describes her book as “an exploration of power.”



"
"
Write a short assertion about the quote.,
Place the quote after the assertion with a colon.,
Integrate the quote into your assertion.",How to Lead Into a Quote2," To create the assertion, try putting the quote in your own words. Relate it back to your thesis statement or to an overarching theme or idea in the paper. Write a short assertion that is no longer than one line or eight to ten words long. This will frame the quote for the reader.For example, you may write an assertion like, “Arendt does not see totalitarianism as a positive result of war.”
Or you may write an assertion like, “Hamlet argues against Rosencrantz’s claim that he lacks ambition.”

, Once you have written the assertion, place it in front of the quote and then use a colon. After the colon, write down the quote.For example, you may write:

Arendt does not see totalitarianism as a positive result of war: “Totalitarianism is to be feared and loathed.”
Hamlet argues against Rosencrantz’s claim that he lacks ambition: ""I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space.”



, This is a good option if you want to only quote a key part of the text, or several parts of different lines in the same passage. Integrating the quote will allow you to use it as evidence for your own thoughts.For example, you may write:

For Arendt, state sanctioned propaganda was essential totalitarian regimes, where “one could make people believe the most fantastic statements,” thereby confirming the state’s power over its citizens.
Hamlet is doubtful of Rosencrantz’s view, claiming he could be “bounded in a nutshell” and still feel powerful, “a king of infinite space.”



"
"
Review the flow and organization of the lead-in.,
Check for the proper punctuation.,
Make sure you cite quotes properly.",How to Lead Into a Quote3," Once you have introduced the quote in your paper properly, read it out loud to confirm it flows with the rest of the content. Check that the sentence fits within the rest of the paragraph. Make sure you include your own thoughts and ideas about the quote in the paragraph so it feels essential to what you are talking about.


You can also look at your use of quotes throughout the paper to confirm they flow well. Make sure you are consistent with how you introduce quotes in the paper. Use one to two different ways to introduce quotes and stick to them so the reader can follow your train of thought.

, Read over each lead-in to make sure you are using punctuation properly. Check that commas are placed in the lead-in. Make sure you do not use commas if the lead-in ends with “that” or “as.”


You should also check that you italicize any titles in the lead-in. Capitalize any author names or titles in the lead-in, as well.

, Whenever you use quotes in a paper or essay, you need to cite them properly so you are not liable for plagiarism. Always follow the citation style assigned by your instructor. They may prefer APA style, MLA style, or Chicago Style citations.


Place the citation at the end of the quote, if you are using in quote citations.
For example, you may write:

Arendt does not see totalitarianism as a positive result of war: “Totalitarianism is to be feared and loathed” (On Totalitarianism, 54).
Hamlet is doubtful of Rosencrantz’s view, claiming he could be “bounded in a nutshell” and still feel powerful, “a king of infinite space” (Hamlet, 2.2).

, Also one on which you can find enough information. For example, it will be easier to find out about houses in Ancient Greece than how the Ancient Greeks felt about bugs.

, Work backwards from the project due date to plan when you will work on each step: Your research, building your model, or writing your cue cards.

, Collect any information from the books, Websites, and encyclopedias, taking notes as you work. And stay focused on your topic. If you are researching Ancient Greek houses, don't spend time reading or making notes on Greek medicine.

, Make an outline. Divide your information on Greek houses into subtopics, such as building materials, room arrangements, roof design, and courtyard form and function.

, Write each main idea of your speech at the top of a cue card, then list the details below to support the idea.

, Your first card should contain something grabby. A wacky but true statistic is always a good lead-in.

, A speech is really a show that you put on. You have to hold your audience with your voice, you manner, and riveting content.

, Your parents, a friend, a sibling or in front of a mirror. Listen to their feedback and their questions. Do you know the answers? If not, go back and do a little more research.

, You want to know most of the content by heart so you're not reading off the cards. The cards are there just to jog your memory and keep your speech on track.

, Be heartfelt. Throw in some questions for them now and then. For example, ""Do you know how long it takes for a new layer of skin to form?"" Take guesses from the audience. Then tell them the correct answer.

, Stand straight; don't wiggle. Try to maintain eye contact with the members of the audience.

, But don't deliver your speech like a zombie. Put animation into your voice. If you sound happy and excited by the information, your audience will catch your fever.

, At an exciting part of the presentation, don't be afraid to wave your arm in emphasis, for example.

Whether you're evaluating a speech for class, or you're helping someone else prepare for a public speaking engagement, sit quietly and listen to the speech as its given. Listen closely and engage with the speaker.


Turn off all electronic devices and put away any distractions. Look at the speaker while the speech is being given. You shouldn't have anything in your hands but maybe a notepad for taking notes.
Don't ever evaluate a speech based on the text alone. In other words, don't read the speech and offer feedback. Have the speaker perform the speech. If something is designed to be spoken, it needs to be heard if it is to be appropriately evaluated.;
, The first thing you want to pick up on in any speech is the main idea that's trying to be communicated. If you're listening to a persuasive speech, especially, learning the thesis or the main idea that the speaker is trying to prove with the speech is the best place to start. It's the speaker's job to make the main idea obvious, so you should be able to recognize the main point relatively quickly.


If you can't find the main idea of the speech, try to guess what you think the speaker is trying to prove. Write it down. When you're evaluating the speech later, this will be helpful feedback.
For some speeches, like a toast, a tribute, or a thank you, the main idea might be obvious, but play dumb. Is the speaker getting across the idea clearly? Or is the occasion doing too much of the work? Could the speaker do more to make the point of the speech obvious?

, The main point of the speech is like a tabletop: it's useless unless it's held up by the table legs of the examples, supporting points, argument, logic, and any research that holds up the main idea. How does the speaker prove to the audience that their main point is true?


If you’re listening to a persuasive speech, try to come up with responses, questions, and retorts that you might use for feedback later. What was confusing? Were there any supporting points that could be made more clear? Did you find any holes in the argument?
If you’re listening to an informal speech, like a toast or a congratulatory speech, focus on the organization of the information that we’re getting. Does it make sense? Does it follow? Does it seem to jump around?

, Going into a speech with a closed mind is a bad way to evaluate it. Even if you’re going to listen to someone give a speech at the Flat Earth Society, try your best to go into it with an objective mind, willing to listen to the content and the presentation of anyone’s speech. If and when you disagree with it, you’ll be disagreeing with the product, not letting your preconceptions offer your criticism.

, Identify the key points and argument that the speaker is trying to make and keep track of them in a list. You don't need to come out of the speech with a formal outline, but keeping a short list of notes is an important way of generating material for feedback later. Take close notes and your evaluation will be much easier.


Write down particularly memorable quotes or moments from the speech to praise. Write down any time the speaker gets a good crowd reaction, or a negative response.

, The most important part of the speech isn't the speaking style or the charisma of the speaker, it's the content of what is said. Giving a speech is hard because it has all the challenges of writing an essay, with the added difficulty of having to make it easy to listen to out loud. The most important thing to focus on in your evaluation is the content of the speech. If it's a persuasive speech, or an argument speech, the content will likely include a lot of research, real-world examples, and main points. In an informal speech, the content will likely involve anecdotes, stories, and jokes. When you're evaluating, keep in mind the following questions and answer them as a way of giving feedback:


What was the main argument of the speech?
Was the content clear and well-articulated?
Was the argument supported with research? Good examples?
Was the content made clear to the audience?
Did the speaker prove their point?

, In order to make the content of a speech clear and easy to digest, it needs to be organized well. Formal or informal, public speaking needs to be easy to listen to. If the speech jumps around or moves from point to point like a tennis match, it might need to be reorganized. To help you evaluate the organization of the speech, keep in mind the following questions to generate feedback for the speaker:


Was the supporting argument logically structured?
Was the speech easy to follow? Difficult? Why?
Do the speaker’s points flow logically from one to the next?
What could be included to clear up the speech for you?

, If the content of the speech refers to what is spoken, the style refers to how it is spoken. A good speech should match the style to the content: it's unlikely a serious paper about dolphin populations would involve ""getting to know the audience"" games or audience participation. Whether or not a speaker chooses to use jokes, how much the speaker engages with the audience, and other personal elements to the speech will all play into the style. How a speech is written will affect the style, but also how it is performed. Are the jokes told like they are jokes? Is research presented accurately and clearly? Keep in mind the following questions:


How would you describe the style of the speech and the speaker?
Did the style of the speech work for the content, or against it? Why?
How convincing was the speaker?
How was the timing of the speech? Was it easy to follow?

, The tone of the speech refers to the overall impact of the content and the style. A tone might be light, or serious, or playful, and there's no right or wrong tone for any content. It might be appropriate to tell light stories and jokes at a eulogy, or it might be disastrous. It might be appropriate to tell a heartwarming story about your boss at his retirement, but maybe not if it's a drunken roast. The tone needs to be match the speech itself and the occasion.


Who is the audience for the speech? What are their expectations of the speech and the speaker?
How would you describe the tone of the speech?
Did it match the content? How?
If not, how might the tone be improved?
How well will the tone match the audience for the speech?

, Whatever the occasion and the reason you're giving feedback, for school or informally, it's better to write down your criticisms, praise, and comments, so the speaker will have some document of your feedback. If you have some suggestions, it'll be too easy for the speaker to forget, especially immediately following the speech. It's best to write a short note, no more than 250 or 300 words, to accompany your evaluation of the speech.


For some speech classes, you may have to fill out a rubric or assign a grade to a speech. Follow the specific class instructions regarding this and assign a grade appropriate.

, Starting feedback with a summary of what you took from the speech is the most helpful way of letting the speaker know whether or not what they were trying to say was communicated accurately. Don't worry about whether or not your summary is perfectly accurate or not. If you were listening closely and trying your best to follow it, any failure on your part should be instructive for the speaker. That's something they need to make more clear in the speech.Try to start your response with things like, “What I heard you saying is…” or “What I got from this speech was…”
A good summary should be several sentences in the evaluation, perhaps slightly less than half of your feedback. Identify the main idea and the main supporting points of the speech. The summary should focus on content only.

, Not everyone can or should be Martin Luther King Jr. Focusing your feedback primarily on the oratorical skills of the speaker isn’t usually going to be that helpful, especially if we’re talking about a class speech, a wedding speech, or some kind of business presentation.


If the speaker is mostly a wet blanket, focus on how the content could better match the speaking style and how the tone might be changed to match. These are changeable things. Telling a speaker to be ""more dynamic"" or ""funny"" isn't good feedback.

, Even if you just watched your best friend struggle through the lamest best-man speech of all time, it’s important to find something good to say. Start your feedback with some praise and start off the evaluation with good will. Make all feedback constructive criticism, not destructive. Starting off by telling someone how nervous they look while delivering the speech, or how flat the speech was will only make those elements worse.If you thought the speech was boring, instead learn to say something like, ""It was subdued, which I think works well for the occasion.""
If the speaker seemed nervous, try to reassure them with some compliments, ""You seemed confident up there. The material really speaks for itself.""

, Aim all feedback at making specific changes that will improve the speech, not identifying what is wrong with the speech, or what seems to be not working for you about it. This will give the speaker something constructive and will work to make the speech better, rather than simply tearing it down.


Don’t say, “I didn’t like the jokes you used,” say, “Next time, I think you could leave the jokes out and the speech would move a little quicker.”

, Overburdening someone with fifty different things to fix and work on can make the job seem hopeless. As an evaluator, it’s important to focus on three major areas of improvement and worry less about more secondary things.


Focus first on content corrections, the organization of the speech, and the tone before you focus on anything else in the speech. These are the most important categories for improvement, and the best ways to quickly improve the speech. Think of these as the highest order of concern.
Worry about the specifics of the delivery later. Whether or not the timing of the joke at the end of the speech works should be one of the last things a speaker worries about. If the speech is already very good, feel free to move onto these secondary concerns.

It may be a job, a school, a volunteer position, or a place that you’ve lived for a long time. Try to think of what you’ve done while there, and how you would tell the story of your time there from beginning to end.Try writing down a narrative history of your time at this place. It doesn’t have to all be appropriate for a speech. Simply write it down to help yourself remember everything you’ve done, and to help yourself realize what has been the most meaningful to you.
Your narrative may start with something like, “I came to work here right out of college and had never lived on my own before. I was so shy that I didn’t make any friends for nine months. Then I got that promotion a year later and formed close bonds within my new department.”
It’s okay to write down things that were difficult. You can edit them out later. You might include something like, “I hated when we had to move to the new office.” When you edit your speech, this may turn into a funny anecdote, or maybe you’ll say something like, “Even when we had to move to the new office, I couldn’t help but notice how cheerful my colleagues managed to be in a hard time.”;
, Once you’ve written your summary, see if there are any anecdotes that you can remember from your time at this place. An anecdote can be funny or touching, but it should be a short, specific story that helps paint a picture of everyday life while conveying your thoughts or feelings overall.An anecdote might start out something like this: “I’ll always remember my third day of school. Spencer and I had been assigned to sit next to each other on the bus, but on the third day, my grandmother followed me onto the bus and declared she’d need to have a word with Spencer…”
Anecdotes can be great ways to express appreciation for a specific person, or to illustrate something you appreciate about the place as a whole. For example, the above anecdote might end with something like, “...and of course, he’s never left my side since then,” or, “...which is how I knew that this school community would finally be a place that I’d feel at home.”

, You want to keep your farewell speech fairly upbeat, but it’s also good to take some time to reflect on what you’ve gained through your time at this place and what you’ll miss. People will appreciate you being reflective for a bit and sharing your feelings about the occasion.Think of things you’re grateful for, or moments that helped you become who you are. Make a note of something like, “when John stood up for me freshman year,” or, “when the boss actually brought my proposal to the board and I realized that my voice mattered.”
Think about the reasons you’re sad to go. This could be something like, “I know that a group of people who look out for each other like this is a rare thing to find,” or, “I learned so much from each person here, it will be sad to move on without everyone.”

, Presumably, others are staying even though you’re making your farewell speech. Offer good wishes for those remaining. Try to be sincere, though it’s always okay to throw in a joke or two if it’s not mean spirited.You can offer wishes for the group in general, such as, “Of course, next year, I’m sure you’ll all finally get to nationals without me on the team.”
You can also offer individual good wishes, such as, “Janet, I hope you have an easy transition to being vice president; I know you’ll do great. Richard, good luck taking over the entire smoothing department.”
You can also state hopes and wishes you have for yourself, such as, “I don’t know what’s next for me, but I certainly hope it involves people as kind as all of you.”

, Once you’ve generated content, it’s time to organize it so that your speech will flow nicely. A great way to do this is to make an outline. An outline is a way to organize content so that it goes in a logical order that a listener or reader can follow.Your outline can be as detailed as you'd like.
Your outline should contain spaces for an opening, the body of the speech, and a tight conclusion.
An outline doesn’t contain the complete text of the speech. It simply has bullet points and summaries of each section.

, Speeches that start with a joke or a great witticism grab the audience’s attention right away. Particularly for a farewell speech, the audience might be expecting something very dry or heavy. Even if the occasion is a bit solemn, try to start with something fun. This will set a good tone and help get people listening for the rest of the speech.An ice breaker might be some kind of inside joke or chant that everyone present would know about and be able to appreciate.
If one of the anecdotes you wrote down is particularly funny or snappy, it could make a good opener as well.
Sometimes a quote or inspirational message can work well as an opener, though you may want to save this for your closer.

, The body of your speech is when you get to share your anecdotes and summarize your time there, if appropriate. You can tell stories about specific people and experiences and also about more broad feelings you have about the people and the place.When speaking generally or summarizing, remember to, “show, don’t tell.” This means that it’s usually stronger to be specific and give details or examples, rather than generalizing.
An example of “show, don’t tell” is saying, “On my first day of work, I noticed that half of the office stayed an extra half hour after closing time to make sure the reports were done,” instead of, “Everyone here always works extra hard.”

, The way that you close your speech is likely to be something that people remember long after the speech is over. Decide if you want to end on a funny note or a serious one. Even if your speech has been largely solemn, leaving people with a joke can be a great way to close things out. It can be a great tension reliever.You can search for great quotes online by subject. There are quotes for almost every occasion.
If you’re particularly clever, you can end with a punchline that ties together with a joke or anecdote you told at the beginning of your speech.
For example, if you started the speech with something like, “I’ll never forget my first day here. I thought I was doomed when I walked in the door and saw that I was twenty minute late,” you could close the speech with, “Well, I guess that’s all I have time for. Look at this. Five years later, and still running twenty minutes behind.”

, Writing a speech is only one aspect of the entire presentation. You also need to practice the speech out loud. That’s because often, the way that you write things might not actually roll off the tongue easily.Go over any parts that seem confusing or that don’t flow easily. Make any notes or changes that will be helpful when delivering the speech.
Time the speech when you recite it.
Give the speech to a mirror so that you can see how often you’re able to look up from your paper without stumbling.
You can also practice the speech in front of a close friend and ask for feedback.

, You might have a lot to say, depending on your tenure at this place and how much it has meant to you. However, this speech is not the time to go into minute detail about it. Remember that people likely need to get back to work, or have other things they’d like to be doing with their time. If you do it right, you can make a powerful speech in a short period of time.A farewell speech should usually be about five minutes long. Ten minutes is acceptable in certain circumstances. More than that should be reserved for extremely special circumstances, such as when a head of state resigns.

, Many people get nervous when speaking in front of a crowd. There are plenty of tricks to help yourself battle nerves if you need to. Make sure to practice your speech many times; then, prepare yourself for standing in front of a group.Know that you may make a mistake. Be prepared for this. Don't beat yourself up if it happens. Acknowledge it and move on. You can even laugh at yourself to help put the audience at ease.
Focus on people who seem to connect to your speech. If they're nodding, smiling, or have their eyes glued to you, focus on them. Their energy will help give you confidence.

Don’t rely on your natural charisma or your ability to think on your feet — once you’re staring out at the dozens or hundreds of expectant faces in the audience, you may find that your ability to be charming and profound come less naturally to you than you thought.

, Like talented authors, good speechwriters know to adjust the content of their speech to fit the needs of their audience. Serious or formal occasions with important guests will require speeches that are similarly formal, while more light-hearted affairs may call for a less serious tone. When in doubt, err on the side of formality — it’s usually less embarrassing to deliver a formal speech at a casual event than vice versa.


As a general rule, the smaller your audience and the more intimately you know its members, the more casual your speech may be.

, Unless you're sure that everyone in the audience will be perfectly aware of your importance, you'll probably want to start your speech with a few brief words about yourself just to give the audience an idea of who you are. This will probably involve briefly listing your position, some important work you've done, and your connection to the honor or award that you're receiving. Keep these remarks short and humble — your goal isn't to build yourself up or brag, but to introduce yourself to people who are unfamiliar with you. Additionally, you may want to be prepared to skip some of your opening remarks if the person who welcomes you to the podium gives you a lengthy introduction.


For instance, if you're accepting an ""Employee of the Year"" award at the tech firm you work for, assuming that your audience contains people who don't know you, you may want to begin with an introduction along these lines:





""Hello. Thank you for honoring me this evening. As you've just heard, my name is Jane Smith. I joined this company in 2009, and since then, I've worked with the marketing, content, and analytics departments in varying capacities. Earlier this year, I had the honor of collaborating with my boss, John Q. Public, on a new data processing system, which is why we're here today.""







, All speeches should have some sort of purpose or ""point"" — otherwise, why would anyone bother listening? After you've introduced yourself, don't waste time moving to the ""meat"" of your speech. Try to tell the audience why they should listen and what you hope for them to take away from your speech fairly early on to give them a sense of direction and prepare them for what you have to say.


Since you’re presumably accepting some sort of award or honor, a good theme to center your speech around is ‘’gratitude’’. Centering at least part of your speech around thanking those who helped you get to where you are makes you appear humble and deserving of the praise you’re receiving, rather than haughty or conceited. In addition to this, you may also want to consider offering advice to your audience or giving some sort of call to action. Whatever you choose, be sure to briefly make your speech's purpose clear in the beginning. For instance, you might want to say:





""I'm here today to offer my sincerest gratitude to the dozens of people without whom this experience wouldn't have been possible. I'd also like to briefly discuss the role that the idea of ""going the extra mile"" has played in setting this company apart from the others in the tech field.""







, As you offer your thanks and advice to the audience, try to explain just how important the honor you're receiving is to you. For instance, you may want to mention that the honor is important to you because it's a sign you've earned the respect of the people who are most important in your life. Doing this proves your sincerity and gives the audience an appreciation of the honor being bestowed. It's not just a trophy or a plaque — it has a symbolic importance that goes beyond this.


One good trick is to call attention to the fact that the honor you’re receiving, while important to you, is less meaningful than the continued honor of simply getting to do what you love. This sort of acknowledgement makes you look humble, passionate, and supremely deserving of your honor. For instance, if you’re receiving a lifetime achievement award for your decades of work as a teacher, you might want to say something like:





“As much as I appreciate this award and as grateful as I am for it, the greatest reward I’ve ever been given is the simple opportunity to help generations of kids learn how to think critically about the world around them.”







, The ending of a speech is one of the hardest parts to perfect, but it's also one of the most important because it's the part everyone will have the easiest time remembering. Try to give your ending a serious emotional wallop or a rousing call to action — you're looking to go out with a bang, not a whimper. Try to use words and imagery that have strong emotional resonance. For your last sentence, try to end with a witty observation or a powerful statement of truth.


For instance, in the teacher example above, we might end like this:





""As we leave here today, I'd like to ask the members of the audience to take a moment to think about the importance of educating the children of this generation. Tomorrow's problems demand bright, hard-working individuals to solve them, and the only way we can create these individuals is by acting as a community to support our schools, our teachers, and the countless people that they depend on for their continued strength.""







, This is an absolute must for acceptance speeches — somewhere in your speech, you need to thank the people who helped you succeed, even if, in your opinion, their help wasn't that essential. Forgetting to graciously thank the people who contributed to your achievement can potentially lead to hurt feelings and embarrassment for you. This is easily avoided by devoting some of your speech to personally thanking as many people who worked with you or supported you as possible (preferably near the beginning or end of your speech so that this is well remembered).


When you're thanking people, it's a wise idea to end with something along the lines of, ""and finally, I'd like to thank everyone else who supported me during my work — there are too many people to list, but I want to thank you all personally."" This covers your bases in case you forget anyone who played a minor role in your success.

, If you're having a hard time penning your speech, consider turning to famous acceptance speeches for ideas on how (and how not) to proceed. Modern history is full of examples of great (and terrible) acceptance speeches that can be used as inspiration. Just a few notable examples are listed below:


As a positive example, consider Jimmy Valvano's phenomenal acceptance speech at the 1993 ESPY awards. Just eight weeks before his premature death from cancer, the famed college basketball coach delivered an immensely moving speech to an ecstatic standing ovation from the crowd.As an example of what not to do, consider Hilary Swank's Oscar acceptance speech for ""Boys Don't Cry"" in 2000. Swank accepted her award gratefully, doling out thanks to all of her supporters, with the major exception of her husband, whom the cameras famously caught crying tears of joy during Swank's speech.As an oddball example, consider Joe Pesci’s Oscar acceptance speech. After taking the podium at the 1991 Oscars for his work in ""Goodfellas,"" Pesci said simply, ""It's my privilege. Thank you.""Pesci was both praised and lampooned for his five word speech.

, Unlike written text, oral speech can't be ""re-read"" — once you say something, it's been said, and your speech continues whether your audience understood it or not. To minimize the chance for misunderstanding and keep your audience's attention throughout your speech, keep your words simple. Use clear, concrete language. Don't make your sentences (or the entire speech) any longer than it needs to be to communicate the points you're trying to get across. People are much more likely to have a favorable impression of a short, simple, powerful speech than they are of a long-winded, complicated, and meandering one.

, For long speeches, it may be impractical or even impossible to have every word of your speech memorized. However, even in these cases where having an outline or a copy of the speech handy is a virtual necessity, you'll still want to have all of the main points you intend to address in your speech ready in your head before you begin speaking. Be sure to know what the main points of your speech are, what order they come in, and any key transitions or examples you use.


Knowing the outline of your speech ahead of time is useful for multiple reasons. For instance, not only will this prevent certain technical snafus (for instance, a breeze carrying your speech away) from derailing your speech, but it can also help you deliver your speech more confidently. After all, if you know basically what you need to say ahead of time, what need is there to worry?

, Mediocre speeches are a dime a dozen. Make your speech memorable by making it something only you could deliver. Craft your speech into a product of your own personality — give your audience opportunities not just to remember the speech itself, but also the person giving it. One easy way to do this is to include brief, memorable personal anecdotes in your speech that are pertinent to the honor you're receiving or the themes you're addressing in your speech. Include these as you please, but don't forget to exercise restraint — remember, short and simple speeches are blessings to most people in the audience.

, Humor has a place in some acceptance speeches. A witty remark is a great way to break the ice at the beginning of a speech and a few jokes peppered throughout can help keep the audience's attention. However, keep the amount (and type) of humor you use under control. Don't rely too excessively on constant joking and don't include lewd, offensive, or controversial jokes. Unless you're a professional entertainer, your audience probably expects a pleasant, dignified speech, rather than a raunchy, joke-filled tirade, so give it what it wants.


Also, don’t forget that there may be people in the audience who were in the running for the honor you ended up receiving. Because of this, you won’t want to demean the organization that’s honoring you or jokingly imply that you were a bad choice. Maintain respect for yourself, the organization honoring you, and the audience as you accept your award.

, Like writing, singing, or acting, speech-giving is an art form. The more you do it, the better you become. Though it's impossible to replicate the experience of standing in front of your audience and giving your speech for real before you actually have to do it, practicing alone or in front of a smaller audience can help you memorize the main points of your speech and get enough experience delivering it that it becomes familiar to you. In addition, practice can also help you pin down problems ahead of time. For instance, if there's part of your speech that your test audience doesn't react as well to as you thought it would, you may take this as a sign that it should be removed or edited before the actual speech.


As you practice, time yourself. You may be surprised how much longer (or shorter) your speech is than you thought it would be. If you have a hard time limit for your speech, use the results of your timed practice to edit your speech as necessary.

, If you're using a written copy of your speech or an outline to keep you on-track, be sure to edit this aid both for its factual accuracy and for proper conventions of grammar, spelling, and sentence flow. One of the absolute most-embarrassing places you can discover an error in your speech is on the podium while you're delivering it, so avoid this awkward situation by thoroughly proofreading your first draft at least once or twice before your speech.

, When you're waiting for your turn to speak at the podium, calm, quiet relaxation will probably be the last thing on your mind. However, knowing how to calm your nerves ahead of time can make an otherwise stressful speech a relative breeze. Below are just a few patented techniques to help minimize problems caused by a case of the jitters during your speech:Rapid heartbeat: Breathe deeply and slowly. Concentrate on someone in the room you're comfortable around, like a friend or family member. Start delivering the words of your speech — you'll naturally relax once you start talking.
Racing, panicked thoughts: Take deep breaths. Look out into the audience and see the humor in their blank, expressionless faces. Alternatively, imagine that the members of the audience are somehow unimportant or laughable (e.g., that they're all in their underwear, etc.)
Dry mouth: Bring a bottle of water with you onstage to drink as you need it. Consider also chewing gum before (but not during) your speech. Mimicking the process of eating can have a calming effect on the emotions. In addition, it can stimulate saliva production, preventing a dry mouth.
Trembling: Breathe deeply and slowly. If necessary, try slowly tensing and releasing the muscles in the trembling body part to work out the excess energy from your adrenaline high.
Above all, relax. You've prepared, so you have no reason to worry about how the speech will turn out. Worrying will only make it harder to deliver the great speech that you're perfectly capable of giving.

, Even people who otherwise have no tics or neuroses sometimes develop strange repetitive behaviors when put under pressure in public. The best cure for nearly any sort of tic is to relax with the techniques listed above. However, in addition, making a mental list of common speech-giving tics ahead of time can allow you to catch them if you notice them appear while you're delivering your speech. Below are just a few of the most common problems you'll probably want to avoid:


Hurrying or rushing through your speech.
Mumbling
Fidgeting or messing with something in your hands
Swaying from side to side.
Coughing/sniffling excessively

, As noted above, one of the most common problems that inexperienced speakers have is that they can tend to rush or mumble through their speech unintentionally. The way you speak when you're giving a speech shouldn't be the same way you talk to people you're close to in a casual setting — you want to speak slower, more clearly, and somewhat louder than you normally would. This doesn't necessarily mean you have to dwell on every word and take long pauses between your sentences, just that you should make an effort to ensure that even the hard-of-hearing in the audience can understand you.

, When you give an acceptance speech, you're addressing the audience, so you'll want to look at the audience for most of your speech just as you'd look at the person you're addressing if you were talking to only one person. It's OK to give the notes or the outline you have with you a quick look to keep your speech on-track. Try to limit this to short glances no longer than a few seconds or so long. The rest of the time, hold your head high and speak directly to the audience in front of you.


If you can remember to do so, try to gradually move your gaze from side to side as you look at your audience. Sweeping your eyes back and forth gives the members of the audience the impression that you're addressing them all individually. If this ""sweeping"" motion is tricky for you, try randomly picking individuals in the audience to look at for a few seconds at a time as you talk.

, To someone who's nervous about giving a speech, the audience can seem like one big, scary, imposing entity that must be confronted and appeased. In fact, the audience is anything but this — it's actually made up of many different individuals, all of which have their own internal motives and preoccupations (just like you!) Some of the people in the audience may be thinking about their own problems or simply daydreaming while you give your speech. Others may be practically (or literally) asleep. Some may not even be intelligent enough to understand your speech! On the other hand, some may find your speech interesting or important. Few, however, are likely to find it as important as you do, so don't be scared by your audience! Thinking of your audience as a collection of real, imperfect people, rather than as a faceless, monolithic crowd is a sure-fire way to make it easier to relax.

Find other great graduation speeches, and look at the themes those speakers hit and the jokes they tell. You don’t want to copy them, just look for ideas that reflect your experiences or potential themes you can use.


Some famous addresses include Steve Jobs at Stanford in 2005, J.K. Rowling at Harvard in 2008, and David Foster Wallace at Kenyon in 2009.;
, You want your speech to have a point, something you are trying to get across to your fellow students. Once you have figured out a theme, you will be able to build your speech around that idea. A theme will make it easy to figure out what should go in, and also what shouldn’t.When looking for a theme, consider what you want your audience to get out of the speech. Maybe you want to inspire them, or perhaps you are trying to reflect on good times. This is an important aspect of your theme.Good possible themes include “Find and follow your passion,” “You do not need to be perfect,” “If you think and believe you can, you can,” and “Try selflessness and give back.” Try to find something that can draw from your own experience and the experiences of your classmates.

, Before you sit down to start writing out your brilliant and insightful message, make an outline. List your big theme, then all the points you are going to make in support of it. Include space for jokes and stories as well. Having an outline will remind you of all the points you want to hit so you don’t forget any while writing. It can also show you how long your speech is, and maybe let you know that some things need to get cut., This ceremony isn’t just for you, it’s for everyone, and each person’s experience at school will have been a little different. Talk to other students, including people who aren’t your friends or you don’t know very well. Learn about how they saw their time in school, and what kinds of memories they will take with them., This speech is for you and your fellow graduates. While it would be nice to thank your teachers and parents for getting you to graduate, remember that you and your classmates are the main focus. Make sure you are speaking to them first and foremost.


If you aren’t sure how your speech will go, think about if you were listening to it. Is this the kind of speech you would like to hear at your graduation? If you’re not sure you would enjoy it, your fellow students probably won’t either., Your speech is just one part of a larger ceremony, and people probably won’t want to listen to you give a half-hour lecture on the nature of friendship and the universe. Keep your thoughts short and to the point. Plus, if you don’t like giving speeches, keeping it short will make it go faster.Talk to your principal or teachers to get a sense of how much time you have. They may not give you a set time to fill, but will probably have suggestions for a good length. If they don’t have good guidelines, 5 to 10 minutes should be more than enough.
To help yourself when writing, remember that the average speaker reads about 120 words in a minute. That represents a little less than 1 page of typing with double spaced with 16 point font, which you’ll want because it is easier to read., Chances are the audience won’t be hanging on to your every word. Make sure you leave them with your biggest idea, even if that’s just restating the big idea you laid out the in beginning. This will be the last thing anyone hears, making it the thing they will most likely remember from your speech., Even though your speech is for the whole graduating class, take a few moments to thank people specifically for what they did to help you get there. You can make a list of names, including your parents, teachers, and friends. Just remember to be brief, and turn your attention back to the graduates.One way to make this more accessible to the rest of the class is to finish this section by encouraging or reminding the other graduates to thank someone too.

, Adding a few lines in your speech to encourage laughter will help you and your audience get comfortable. It can also briefly take people’s minds off of the bigger, weightier topics you’ll be talking about. You don’t have to be voted “Class Clown” to be able to tell a good joke. Just stay relaxed and confident in your delivery, and if people don’t laugh, just move on.One style of joke is the funny inspirational quote, like Will Rogers’s “Even if you’re on the right track, you’ll get run over if you just sit there,” or Ben Franklin’s “You will find the key to success under the alarm clock.” These clever lines can be a good start to a speech, introducing your big theme.Look for funny stories specific to your school. These can help personalize your speech, and reference things that most of the audience will recognize. You can make fun of school construction that was “building the future one closed hallway at a time.”
You only need to include a few jokes. This is a valedictorian speech, not an audition for your stand-up comedy career.
Remember to write them down and rehearse them just like the rest of your speech. You don’t stumble over the punchlines or forget how they go on the big day.
Keep it clean. Your audience will include teachers, parents, grandparents, and siblings, including your own, so make sure your jokes are appropriate for all.

, Focus at least part of your speech on things you and your classmates did during your time at school. Graduation is a time to celebrate all that you have done, including finishing high school.Make sure you mention specific accomplishments. Look for sports championships, awards, charity events, anything that you or your classmates accomplished during your time in high school. The more examples you can include that don’t involve you, the better. You are celebrating your whole class’ accomplishments, not just your own.

, Graduation is also a time to look forward to the future. Spend some time talking about what will happen after graduation. Because you don’t really know the future, this section can be a bit more vague and aspirational. Remember to stay positive, and think about what good will come next.As the valedictorian, you are probably going on to college after graduating. That may not be true for everyone in your class, so don’t forget to mention other possible avenues like getting a job or serving in the military. If you aren’t sure what kinds of things your classmates are doing after graduation, that’s a great thing to ask when you talk to them.

, One good way to illustrate your theme and tie your story to past experiences is to tell a personal story. Think about an experience you had in high school that taught you the big lesson from your theme. If it includes your friends, or others in the audience, even better. This is a good way to personalize your big theme, and let your classmates know about your particular high school experience.If you don’t have a specific funny story about you or your friends, consider talking about how you’ve changed over your time in high school. Think about how you felt when you started as a freshman, how you got lost in the large school, or couldn’t reach your locker. A personal story is also a good way to add a little self-deprecating humor, as long as you arecomfortable telling a story where you don’t look brilliant or cool.

, While it is nice to have a theme, stop yourself from using ideas and statements like “the Real World,” “The future belongs to us,” or “Today is not the end of your education, but the beginning.” These kind of statements are overused and so plainly true that they become meaningless. Hearing them is a sign that your audience can stop listening, which you definitely don’t want.This means quotes too. One or two good quotes from famous people can be useful, as long as they relate directly to your main point. Remember that people want to hear you talk, not recite a list of famous lines., Graduation day shouldn’t be the first time you recite your speech out loud. Give yourself a few practice runs beforehand, either in front of a mirror or your friends. This will let you see how long your speech goes (and if it is too long), as well as how it actually sounds when you say it out loud.If you can, recreate the setting as much as possible. Wear your cap and gown so you will be comfortable in them, and practice at the podium or where the graduation is, if possible. The more familiar you are with the setting, the more comfortable you will be in giving your speech.

, You don’t want to break down during the speech. If you feel some tears coming on, take a few deep breaths and grip the podium to distract yourself.Graduation is an emotional time for everyone involved, and it is understandable that you’ll get a little choked up thinking about your friends and classmates.


Letting one or two tears out can be fine. You can always pass it off by blaming allergies, or make a joke about it being dusty in the room.

, This is a big moment for you, and it should be a proud one too. That being said, your classmates probably won’t remember most of what you say. That’s okay. If anything, it just might take some of the pressure off of you. Relax, have fun, and stick to your big ideas. The important thing is that you find a message that you care about and think is important."

Decide which evidence is the most compelling.",How to Do Research for a Speech," It will make your research process a lot more focused and efficient if you’re able to hone in on a specific subject with a clearly defined scope. Then, you’ll only have to do the research that directly supports your speech. Besides designating a specific topic, consider setting historical/time-based and geographical/place-based parameters on your presentation if they’re relevant.For instance, if you’ve been assigned a broad topic, like “contemporary politics,” be sure you narrow it down to address a particular trend that most interests you or that you think is most relevant, such as “Immigration in 21st-Century U.S. Politics.”
If you know enough about your subject, do a rough outline in advance, so that you can identify each specific point or subtopic that you’d like to address and investigate. Your research may reshape your outline a bit, but it will give you a strong idea about where to start looking.;
, You will also want to consider the aims you have for giving the speech, that is, what you want the audience to take away from it. Is your goal to be informative by helping them learn about something or to be persuasive by making an argument you hope they’ll agree with and/or act upon by the end? Will you approach it as an intellectual or emotional appeal? Deciding your aim and approach will help guide the types of research and evidence that you’ll be seeking.If you’re doing an informative presentation about the hospitality industry, you’ll want to focus on gathering related statistical data. If you’re trying to make an emotional appeal for the audience to support your cancer research charity, you may want to look for personal stories of survivors whose lives were saved by new treatments.
If you’re making a particular argument, you should look specifically for information that supports your angle rather than general data about a topic.

, Knowing the length of your speech can help you figure out the extent of the research that you need to conduct for it. If you only have 15 minutes, you won’t be able to cover 10 case studies, so you can focus on finding one or two examples that best illustrate your point.

, Having a general idea about who you will be addressing can also help guide your research, especially in terms of knowing where to pitch your speech. If you’re speaking to people who are likely to be unfamiliar with your topic, you’ll need to include more basic and background information. If you’re addressing fellow experts, you can include the latest studies and theories in the field and assume that they’ll have insider knowledge of them.Besides knowing their level of knowledge on your topic, it also helps to know if they have something in common, like they are all high school students or all biologists. This can help determine the type of research that will be most effective for your speech.
If your audience members all share a particular interest or work in the same field, consider looking for examples and evidence that would speak especially to them. If they’re high school kids, tie in a pop-culture reference they would know; if they’re biologists, see if you can use biological examples to prove your point.

, Consider what you might want to know about your subject if you were listening to a speech about it. This can help narrow down your research, but it can also help fill in any gaps that you might have on your topic.For instance, if you’re giving a speech on plastic recycling, you might think that an audience would ask questions like, “How much plastic is recycled each year?” or “How much energy does it take to recycle a plastic bottle versus creating a new one?” If you don’t know the answer to these questions, be sure to look them up during your research.

, While you want to stick to a specific topic, it’s always a good idea to start by understanding the “bigger picture” of your subject matter. Take a little time to investigate the history or background of what you’ll be discussing.


For example, if you’re giving a speech on online dating apps, you could look into the history of personal ads and other dating services or frame your topic in terms of the entire app industry.

, Use a system that works for you. Making sure that you have information organized and sources accounted for will make it much easier for you when it comes time to writing your speech.Keep all your research in one place, like a notepad or a word document.
Create a labeling system for your research. If you made an outline in advance, you can simply enter information in under the relevant bullet points. Otherwise, make sure that you devise headings to categorize your notes. You can do this at the end by going back and highlighting everything that speaks to a specific point in a particular color.Be sure to record the bibliographic information for all your sources. You want to make sure you know where you got each bit of evidence, who wrote it, and when it was published so that you can confirm and acknowledge it in your speech.

, These may include books, audio or video recordings, interviews, databases, periodicals like newspapers and journals, and reference tools like dictionaries and encyclopedias. Going to a library to do your research will give you access to a huge variety of credible sources along with a searchable database and reference librarians to help you find them.In each case, you’ll want to evaluate the credibility of the source by considering the credentials of the author(s) and their potential biases. If an author has no professional expertise or first-hand knowledge of the topic, they aren’t the most authoritative source for your research. If the author has a known political or personal agenda, it’s important to acknowledge that the information they present may reflect that bias.
Keep in mind that, in order to be persuasive, you will need to cite your sources within your speech, either by including them in a handout or digital presentation slides, or by saying them aloud. Either way, you want to be sure that your sources are adding to credibility, not detracting from it., Websites are incredibly convenient sources for research. However, because the content of most sites is not regulated by established publishing houses with rigorous editorial standards or by peer-review systems, it’s important to establish the credibility of a website before using any information from it in your speech.To evaluate the credibility of an online source, consider its accountability. That is, determine who’s responsible for the content and whose interests the content is designed to serve. If the content is reliable, there will generally be plenty of information available about the organization and author(s) behind it so that you can assess their credentials and potential biases.
In general, government sites (identified by .gov and .mil) and educational sites (.edu) are more credible than others because their content is regulated and formally restricted.
Use only the official websites of those organizations directly related to your topic whenever possible. For example, if you’re giving a talk on emissions regulations, do research at the Environmental Protection Agency’s official website.
Using a custom search engine like Google Scholar can help eliminate obviously sketchy sources from your search results.

, Primary sources are first-hand accounts of your subject, like interviews or original research papers by the people who conducted the research. Secondary sources, like encyclopedias or history books, are texts written by people who have compiled the research for you. Both are useful to your research since primary sources provide direct, authoritative information while secondary sources can help give you the “big picture” of a particular topic., It will lend credibility to your ideas if you can find an established expert or eye-witnesses who can back them up. If you’re arguing for a different take, set it up with a quote that shows how your ideas differ from those of the prevailing experts.Most of your speech should be your words and ideas, so use quotes sparingly.
Be sure to mention the source and set up the context from which a quote is drawn as you present it. If it’s from a top scientist, you’ll want to note that your quote is from the most recent journal article published by a Nobel-winning biochemist.

, The best stats are the ones that are clear, based on a credible study by a government or academic authority, and defy your audience’s expectations.For instance, if you’re presenting on gender and children’s mental health, you could give the statistics that show how surprisingly prevalent anxiety and depression are (affecting one in eight children) and then how even more surprisingly common they are for girls (affecting one in three).
It also helps if you find a way to connect your stats to concrete ideas. For example, if you’re talking about the distance between the Earth and the Moon, make the 252,088 miles more tangible by explaining that the distance is equal to 32 times the diameter of the Earth, or help people visualize the distance by using a basketball and a tennis ball that are 23 feet and 7 inches apart from one another.
Don’t overload your audience with numbers; you want them to walk away with a few memorable stats rather than a jumble of numbers.

, Help illustrate your points graphically, with diagrams; charts, tables, or graphs; photos or videos. Doing so will visually reinforce your spoken message, helping your audience to better remember and understand your speech.If you’re giving a speech about a battle during WWII, give your audience photos that illustrate your descriptions. If you’re presenting on global warming, offer a graph that shows world climate changes since they’ve been recorded.

, Your research should be more extensive than what you’re able to cover in your speech. That way, you can decide which pieces of evidence most strongly prove your points. Pick the ones that are the most relevant, authoritative, definitive, and accessible to your audience.


Also be sure that you’re including a variety of types of evidence.

On a blank piece of paper, brainstorm a list of people you may need to thank who are not currently on your list. After adding any additional names, review the list and write down what you are grateful for under each name, such as contributions, advice or expertise. You may want to consider the following prompts:Who helped you become the person you are today?
Who offered you the most encouragement?
What specific contributions are you thanking people for?
Who gave you the time of day when you really needed help?
Who offered valuable expertise at crucial moments?

, If your list is handwritten, start by copying your list into a spreadsheet or text editing program so that it can be easily rearranged. Then, arrange the names by what you are specifically grateful for, such as friendship, time or expertise. Once you have the list ordered by type of gratitude, you may want to rank the list from most to least important contributions under each category. When you start writing your speech, it will be helpful to have individual lists of people you want to thank for specific types of contributions.For instance, under the category expertise, you could rank individuals from most to least important contributions of expertise to the project or award you are giving the speech for.

, Review your ordered list and identify the two or three most important people in each category, such as the two or three most important friends, family members or colleagues. It is important to highlight these people, so that you don’t skip them in the speech writing.

, ‘Thank you’ speeches should be short and succinct. Review your list and consider how you might organize your list for concision. You could try re-organizing the list according to function, such as all of the people who made me laugh or all of the people who pushed me to reach higher in life. When you write the speech, you can give thanks to people according to their function or role and then just list their names. This will give you more time to spend on particularly important individuals, as identified in your ranked list.For instance, a ‘thank you’ speech at a wedding should be no longer than three minutes long., Your speech may include an introduction, body and conclusion. The introduction and conclusion are optional, depending on your time limits. The body of the speech should begin by expressing gratitude to the most important people on your list. It may proceed with shorter expressions of gratitude to larger groups of people. On a blank piece of paper, compose a quick outline with section headings and the main points you want to make in each section., As you write your speech, bring to mind a particular individual that you want your speech to touch. Imagine you are in a conversation with this individual or that your speech is a letter to them personally. When people hear your speech, they will get the impression that you are talking to them on a personal level., A great thank you speech is written from a personal, genuine place of gratitude. You should think about what you are really grateful for, and try to express this gratitude in a genuine way in your speech. Some examples of genuine ‘thank you’ speeches include:In 1985, Sally Field spoke from the heart in her Oscar thank you speech. She said, “I can’t deny the fact that you like me, right now you like me!”
In 1970, at the age of 61, John Wayne was genuine about how long it took him to win, upon accepting the award for best actor for the role of one-eyed Rooster Cogburn. He said, “Wow! If I’d known that, I would have put the patch on 35 years ago.”

, You don’t want to sound full of yourself or too self-centered. One of the reasons that you are giving a ‘thank you’ speech is that there are so many people who have helped you along the way. You could express genuine humility, use your self-depreciating humor and wit or show your humility directly with simple statements.


For instance, you could say: “I am so humbled by this honor.”
You could also use humor. For instance, when George Clooney won best supporting actor in 2006 but lost the best director award, he drew on his self-deprecating humor. He said, “Well, it looks like I’m not winning best director…”

, Write short and succinct sentences. If something sounds a little too verbose on paper, it will definitely be too long-winded in a speech. In particular, you want to avoid writing sentences with multiple and complex clauses., Your introduction should address the reason for the occasion, such as an award, career achievement, convention, wedding or other special event. If you have enough time, you may want to start with a little story about the lead-up to the event, a brief history of your career, an amusing anecdote, or a quote.If it is a short ‘thank you’ speech, it is often best to skip the intro entirely. The audience will know why you are giving the speech, so follow the example of Abraham Lincoln who always skipped the introduction., Give yourself time to thank them profusely and include specific details or stories about their contributions. The most important people should get more 'air-time' than those further down your list. Not only do you have more to thank them for, but you also probably have to live or work with them on a regular basis, so you want to build as much goodwill as possible.


Once you have written about the most important individuals, you can always edit the speech later for concision.
Budget your time for each person. Remember that if you spend too much time on any one person, you may not be able to get to others who still really need to be thanked.
If your speech needs to be really short, you could say: ""I would like to thank Charley, my wonderful husband for supporting me through the long nights. I couldn't have done it without you. Thanks to my beautiful daughters, Kiera and Emily. Mommy can play more now. To Jeff Goldstein of Caracas, for feeding my crew; to Jake, Mindy, Paul, and Gwen for staying up so late, so we could get it right...""

, Once you have written about the people at the top of your ‘thank you’ list, write a few paragraphs devoted to people who have served particular roles or functions in your life. If this doesn’t work, you could also try organizing the list by keywords such as job categories.To recognize people by function, you could say, “I also want to thank everyone who brightened up this long journey with good humor, such as John, Johnny, Arjen, Peter, Ann, Zoe, etc.”
So, for example, you might say: ""And for the catering, thanks to Joe, Mike, Mindy, and Jeanette.""

, Although the conclusion is optional, it can be nice to wrap things up with a short summary or a provocative quote. If your time is very limited, you can skip the conclusion entirely. If you have enough time, consider using a memorable quote that relates to your occasion. For instance, you could use one of the following ‘thank you’ quotes:“If the only prayer you said in your whole life was, “thank you,” that would suffice (Meister Eckhart)
“We cannot do great things on this Earth, only small things with great love” (Mother Teresa)
“I can no other answer make, but, thanks, and thanks” (William Shakespeare)

, Set the timer on your stopwatch or smartphone. Press start and begin reading your speech. If you finish with plenty of time left on the timer, you are ready to go. If it is far too short, however, you may consider adding a quote or a story at the beginning or end of the speech. If it is too long, you should revise it accordingly.


You could try using online script timers to get a rough sense of your speech time. However, you should still practice with a real timer because everyone speaks at a slightly different pace., Once you have practiced reading your speech a few times, you could copy keywords from the different sections or paragraphs onto note cards. Use the note cards as reference points for memorizing your speech and all of the people you need to thank.

, You will need to practice multiple times before the actual event. Start by practicing in front of a mirror. As you become comfortable with the speech, you could try using the note cards. After a few times, you could try reading it to friends or family members. If you're well prepared, you'll feel far more comfortable when you actually have to give the speech.You could dress up in the clothes you will be wearing at the event.
Try practicing the speech at the event location to get more comfortable.

A speech for school is usually open-ended, so choose a topic that you are passionate about. Good speeches depend on delivery and the heart put into it by the speaker. If you are enthusiastic, odds are your audience will be, too.

, Why are you giving a speech on this topic? (""My teacher told me to!"" or ""I have to"" is not a valid reason.)


Thesis is the main point to emphasize. If you are writing a speech about an event in your life, what's your message? Your topic may cover your near-death experience, but your thesis or purpose could be advocating the use of seat belts. You need reasoning to back it up; ""It saved my life"" is pretty hard to argue with!

A good speech is made for a good reason: to inspire, to instruct, to rally support, to lead to action, etc. These are noble purposes -- and not merely to sound off; feed the speaker's ego; or to flatter, intimidate, or shame anyone.



, All good speeches require shape: the introduction, the body, and the conclusion. A speech is not an amorphous blob or tangled strings of thought.


Body of the speech. State at least three points to support your argument. If they build on each other, good. For your first draft, you can make a list and pick out the strongest arguments later.

, If your points are illogical, don't attempt to pad them with other reasons. Make sure your reason is sound, and then you can try to add persuasive techniques.


Plato's appeals of ethos, pathos, and logos come in handy here. Persuade your audience to agree by gaining credibility (ethos) or by using others' (when you think of Hanes, do you think of quality underwear or do you think of Michael Jordan?) By manipulating their emotions (pathos), or by simple use of logic (logos). Neither is necessarily stronger or more effective than the others; it all depends on the situation.

, When giving a speech to 8th graders, it's important not to get esoteric -- in other words, use words they will understand and appreciate. Cater your speech to your audience -- what do they want to hear?


That being said, what do they know? Don't waste time explaining concepts to them that they already know; or worse, assuming they know the basics and confusing them horribly. Put yourself in their shoes as you write -- what background knowledge do they need before you jump in to the meat of your argument?

, ""Shake hands"" with them -- figuratively, of course. Personalize your speech by hooking members of your audience. Build agreement with your topic and a sense of rapport with you.


Former Ambassador Robert Strauss used to begin his addresses like this: ""Before I begin this speech, I have something to say."" What's your hook?
Wear your sincere smile, even in your writing. Audiences will be able to tell. You may want to begin with an amusing one-liner or thought-provoking anecdote that can be connected to the situation.
As you're writing, think about what you would say to a friend. The more comfortable and open you are, the more your audience will feel drawn to you. Choose how you express yourself as if you were having a discussion with someone you feel at ease with, someone you're comfortable showing emotion to. A speech with ""heart"" is the most moving kind.

, For some, it's easy to get side-tracked or to try to attack too many things at once. Your speech has one message and it is the only thing that needs to be addressed thoroughly. Don't focus on the details or, what's worse, something completely unrelated. Your audience will be left wondering what the heck is going on.


Rambling will lose their attention. When you have a point addressed and taken care of, do not be afraid to move on. You have more points that deserve the spotlight -- give each its evenly-spread due.

, Make your writing graphic. Your goal is to make the main points of your writing in the speech stick in the minds of your audience. If someone asks or compliments your speech afterwards, it'll probably sound something like, ""I enjoyed the story Tom told about his sister,"" or ""The pie chart of this year's earnings was helpful."" They probably won't say, ""Your second point in the body of your speech was well thought-out and logical."" So think visually.


This can be taken a number of ways. If you are talking to your business team about the year's poor numbers, painting an image of their starving families to drive them to work harder isn't a good idea. Images should be used appropriately. If you're talking numbers, use graphs. If you're talking emotions, paint a picture. Know your context.

, The best actors are equally effective (if not more so) in between their lines. Write pauses, or beats, when you really want a point to sink in. People will automatically take notice -- looking, straightening up and cocking their head to the side and actually hearing the silence. Now that's commanding a room.


Speeches need to be natural - not read off of a paper. And when you talk, you have pauses. This is not slowing you down or showing your weakness, it shows that you have this down so well, you're talking about it like an old pro.

, Open with a big statement that will grab the attention of the audience. Remember that engaging hook we talked about? That goes in now. Dive right in, getting personal and showing your human side.


Opening with important remarks or quotes will immediately establish credibility. Just don't use Merriam Webster as your go-to expert; avoid cliches at all costs.

, Point to ""our"" things -- our team, our city/state/country, or our school, our class-year, our work, people, and product/candidate, etc. Your audience will feel more included and a sense of belonging. If ""we"" feel that way, they'll feel the pressure to feel that way, too.


In a speech by Nelson Mandela, he started off with, ""Today we celebrate not the victory of a party, but a victory for all the people of South Africa.""Now that's a man whose oratorical prowess cannot be questioned.

, This part should contain the main points of the issue and support for each one. That list you made earlier? Narrow it down to about three. Which ones are the most convincing?


Start off with your strongest point. You want the audience to start off seeing zero holes through your argument. Get them on your side before they get the chance to nitpick what you have to say.
Put your weakest argument in the middle. You're sandwiching it here to make it the most forgettable. And, indeed, it will be.
End with your second strongest argument. You want to vamp it up a notch towards the end. Reel them back in, rounding out your argument with your last piece of evidence.

, Build clear and sensible transitions from one thought to the next. The biggest mistake speakers and writers make is to assume people will follow leaps of logic -- place, time or changes of ideas. Spell out to the audience when you are taking a turn in your thoughts with phrases like: ""As an example of this, we can see..."" or ""This brings us back to the larger problem of...,"" and so forth.


Transitions should not only go in between points in the body, but also after the introduction and into the conclusion. Again, your speech is one cohesive work, not a series of points that work independently. Show your audience that by transitioning clearly.

, Conclude with a powerful nail-down, summarizing what you came here to say. Leave them with a question or thoughts of implications; leave them with something -- what do you want that something to be?


Repeat key ideas. Make the audience recall and get on the mainline. Be sure they leave with the ideas you don't want them to forget.
Give your audience a sense of completion in what you write. Bring them back to the beginning, but with a louder spirit -- after all, they have all the knowledge necessary to be passionate now, too. This can be done by starting the last paragraph with a strong, declarative sentence that re-makes your point.

, This will be the most beneficial thing you can possibly do. Try to get someone that's as similar to your audience as possible. If they have a similar background, there's a better chance of them having the same impression.


Ask them for feedback. Did they find anything confusing? Unnecessary? What questions were they left with? Did they follow your logic and end up agreeing with you? What impression were they left with?

, Often when we write things, there's a much easier way to say the exact same thing. Go over your work with an eye for this. Take each sentence as it stands -- could you make it more crystal?


If you're not clear, you could have a good point that goes unappreciated or completely missed. Clarity is possibly the most important quality to look for in your work.

, If it sounds like three different people wrote it, it'll be difficult to follow. What's more, if you slip into language that's condescending or simply over their heads, you're in an equally hard place. How will the audience find your speech?


Don't be tempted to get crass or nasty to get their attention. It'll work, but after you stop the finger-pointing and yelling, they'll tune you out completely.

, Once you have all the content ready, get it in its final form. This is where you may want to start employing tactics for delivery.


Write in your pauses. Though the speech should not be directly read from, rehearsing from it with pauses written in will help you remember when you are actually delivering it.
Write in body cues. Though these ultimately need to be natural and can't be scripted, making little notes where you might want to emphasize a point with your body (be it with your face, hand, etc.) can help jog your mind in the rehearsing process.
Outline the speech on notecards. Since you won't be reading your speech, it's a good idea to have a written outline of the presentation as a reference so you don't leave something out .. like thanking the audience for their attention and the committee for asking you to speak.

You can even watch the evening news, and take notes about the issues that you find interesting. Do a bit of research about any news story that you have an immediate emotional reaction to, especially if it relates to a recurring issue that consistently generates public interest.If you set out to research a topic and are surprised by what you find, take note of anything that stands out. These are the points that are also the most likely to interest your readers.
Think about whether there are any current issues that people are talking about and that you’d like to know more about. Give yourself the excuse to do some research, develop an informed perspective, and share the view you develop with others in a timely persuasive speech.;
, Your audience – especially your speech teacher – has likely heard all about gun control, abortion, the death penalty, and the merits of good ol’ ganja. If you do choose a common topic, be sure to take an original perspective on that reflects research into an angle not everyone will be familiar with.Don’t choose anything too one-dimensional to speak about, such as the importance of wearing your seat belt or the dangers of smoking cigarettes. Instead, look for an issue for which a reasonable perspective is yet to be strongly established.

, If you’re at a loss for ideas about a topic, there are countless lists online to prompt your inspiration. Lists are often organized according to a broad approach too, such as topics for speeches urging action or those about advocating a change of perspective on a specific issue.Re-read the assignment guidelines as well. They may even contain a list of potential topics. Go with one of these if you can frame your own perspective in a unique and compelling manner.

, Not only should you choose something you feel strongly about, address a topic that not everyone feels similarly about to ensure you have people in your audience you can actually persuade. As you consider different topics, think about what your personal position on the topic is. This will help you identify and choose a topic that will allow you to develop a thesis and persuade your audience to recognize the validity of the position you advocate in your speech. Reflect on the following questions to help specify potential topics:What unusual experiences have you had that provide insights that other might learn from?
What additional knowledge have you acquired that most people are not familiar with, and how has this changed your mind about certain things?
Do you have any strongly held opinions or beliefs? If – and only if – you have good reasons to support these opinions, they may make for a great persuasive speech topic.

, Decide what you want to say. Reflecting this decision, be able to summarize your position in a single sentence. While there will undoubtedly be several important points that need to be made, the overarching position should be prominently and independently noted early in your speech.Though your position needs to be concise, it must also be complete.
The more specific, the better.
If you’re researching and find a lot of material making the exact same point, revise the specific argument you wish to make – it’s likely not original or specific enough to be persuasive.

, A persuasive speech not only emphasizes your opinion, and it also clearly states your goal. This goal will be to persuade your audience to either change their beliefs or adjust their behavior. At the most basic level, your position – and thus your thesis – should convey that something is either “good” or “bad”, or achieves or fails to achieve some other meaningful value. For instance, consider the following positions, conveyed in persuasively framed thesis statements:I will tell you how possessing a firearm increases the probability of your involvement in violence.
Today, I will show you why Bernie Sanders was the only legitimate political candidate in the 2016 presidential race.
In the following few minutes, I will describe the vital importance of your personal right to privacy.

, You need to do more than inform your audience. Re-examine your position, and your thesis in particular, to ensure that you’re conveying the intention to do more than simply define something, analyze why certain people feel a certain way, or describe how to do something. The distinction between informative and persuasive is sometimes hard to ascertain.A good question to ask yourself: does my thesis convey my opinion about the topic I’ve chosen?


For instance, here’s an example of an informative thesis that does not make an opinionated claim: “Today, I will explain why many lawmakers feel Supreme Court judges should be required to give a statement during each case they consider.”
A persuasive speech on the same topic would include the articulation of the speaker’s position. For instance, “Today, I will explain why Supreme Court judges need to be required to give a statement during each case they consider.”

, For instance, if you’re advocating that more money should be spent on something, structure the speech as an appeal for funding for an appropriate organization or project. If you’re making a recommendation about a course of action, address the people who have the power or capability to take that course of action.Even your thesis can address the most important audience members.
For instance, you might begin; “Today, I’ll explain why those of you who are concerned about drunk driving should vote in the upcoming election.”
This example both addresses a specific audience and begins to persuade them to act on a position.

, Whatever the topic, there are likely multiple established perspectives on the matter.If you are uncertain about what specific objections people may be thinking to themselves or offer during a question and answer session, reflect on what those objections may be. Even better, do some research into what someone arguing the other side of an issue might emphasize. Acknowledge these likely responses in the course of your speech.


Ask yourself: What do those in your audience – particularly those who won’t agree with you automatically – believe about the topic your addressing?
Say something like, ""While many may contend that _______, recent research shows that ______.
Always be polite in the course of your speech, especially if you know some in your audience will disagree with your perspective. You're more likely to convince them to shift their perspective if you can avoid offending them.

, Directly address the factors you know your audience will consider to be highly important. The more legitimate any concerns may be, the more important it is to address them. For instance, if you’re appealing to a greater expenditure of funds, first acknowledge that funds may be constrained by other factors. Then explain why your position ought be a priority.Similarly, if a situation directly affects certain members of your audience – perhaps even detrimentally – acknowledge this and articulate why your position is still valid.
For instance, if you're giving a speech about why we should bring our troops home, point out that some audience members undoubtedly care for soldiers currently serving overseas. Then point out that those soldiers are much less likely to be killed when they're not occupying a foreign country.

, Appeal to your audience members’ hearts, not just their minds.Not only will this help you settle into the persuasive voice, it will also endear your audience to you, regardless of their position on the topic. For instance, tell a short story about how you came to feel the way you do about the issue, and make sure to mention any blood, sweat, and tears that were shed along the way.


In short, know that a good story is often more compelling than the most damning statistics you can find.
Use descriptive adjectives that will appeal to the audience’s senses. Talk about the way a certain experience felt, or the smells you remembered, or even the sounds that were present during a specific experience.

, Do not try to sound eloquent or philosophical. Furthermore, keep sentences short, as you do when you’re speaking. In fact, if you’re ever uncertain about a sentence you’ve written while developing your speech, ask yourself, “Is this something I would say in conversation?” If you answer is no, you likely need to tone down the sentence.Read lines that you’re unsure of aloud while writing your speech.
Similarly, imagine the words being said aloud by someone else as you write them.
For instance, change out words like ""authoritative"" for a simpler word with a more clear meaning, like ""reliable.""

, This is a simple but vital step to make sure you take when developing a persuasive speech. You need hard, objective evidence to back up your position. Websites that end in .edu or .gov are often especially verifiable. If possible, cite academic journal articles, which are required to adhere to strict codes of scientific credibility.Include some variety in the types of evidence you provide. Cite facts, statistics, and even include visual figures to emphasize your position if such is appropriate.
While information is important, it is of secondary importance in a persuasive speech – all information should be used to support the position you’re advocating.

, In order to support your own credibility, refer to the perspective of those who are experts on the specific topic you’re discussing. Or, simply quote prominent people who are popular with your audience, if their perspective supports your position.Try to include at least one quote that supports your position, and one that refutes the most common oppositional position.
While a scientist may actually be the most legitimate source, favor quotes from people with recognizable names, or simply quote the organization that published a scientist's paper.
For instance, instead of using the scientist's name, say something like, ""A scientist at NASA has pointed out that______.""

, One of the best ways to persuade others to feel differently or take action is conveying how your position coincides with how they likely feel about something already. Provide a quick snapshot of examples that your audience in particular will recognize and sympathize with in a predictable way.


If you are successful in conveying how a value your audience holds dear is being undermined or opposed, your position becomes the solution to a problem you’ve persuaded them that they share with you.
For instance: ""As a community, many of us are facing constant hardship on account of _______. And now we have a solution: __________.""

, Your thesis, which conveys the position you intend to persuade your audience to consider, is already concise. Your speech as a whole should be too. Everything you say should lend support to your position, or undermine any potential reasons for opposition.Practice giving your speech in front of a mirror.
Whenever a line has multiple clauses or requires more than one pause, remove as many of the words as you can from the line without losing the line’s contributing statement.

"
Decide whether the speech resonates with the target audience.,
Evaluate the speech’s clarity.,
See if the speech is convincing and educational.,
See if the speech has personality.,
Evaluate the closing.",How to Critique a Speech1," The content, including word choice, references and anecdotes, should be tailored to the audience who will be listening to the speech. For example, a ""don't do drugs"" speech aimed at first graders will sound very different from one meant to teach awareness to college students. As you listen to the speech, try to determine whether it hits the mark or seems a bit off.


Do not base your critique on your own personal opinion, but on how the speaker would be perceived by a wider audience. Your own biases should not come into play.
If possible, note audience members’ reactions to the speech. Do they seem to understand it? Are they rapt with attention? Do they laugh along with the jokes, or do they seem bored?;
, The speaker should use correct grammar and easy to understand language, making it pleasant to listen to the speech and follow what it’s about. Within a few sentences, the main subject of the speech should be clear, and the rest of the content should build in a smooth, understandable manner to support the speaker’s thesis. Again, whether or not you agree with or like the speaker should be less important than what the speaker is saying. When you’re deciding whether the speech is clear, consider the following questions:


Is the introduction effective? Did the speaker make his or her primary argument apparent within the first few sentences, or did it take awhile before you figured out what he or she was getting at?
Is the speech full of distracting tangents that do not relate to the primary argument, or does it build in a logical manner toward the conclusion?
If you were to repeat the speech to someone else, could you recite all the main points or would you have trouble remembering what it was really about?

, In a well-written speech, arguments are skillfully put forth to prove a larger point. The content of the speech should demonstrate the speaker’s expertise on the subject at hand, and the audience should come away feeling they learned something new. Look for gaps in the speaker’s reasoning or places where further research would have made a point more convincing.


Listen for names, dates, and data cited to back up the points the speaker is making. Write down any names, dates, statistics, and other research-related information given by the speaker so that you can look it up later. After the speech, do some fact checking to make sure they’re accurate. Inaccuracies in data are very important to notice because they can impact the credibility of the talk.
If you must critique the speech directly after it is given, using the internet to quickly fact-check a speech can be useful. Wait for the question and answer, meet and greet, or break period to look up the speaker's points.

, Anecdotes and the occasional joke break up the serious tone of the speech and keep it from getting boring. If the speech is too dry, it doesn’t matter how convincing the argument is; people will never hear it, because they’ll be too distracted. When you’re determining whether the speech is engaging at a high level, ask these questions:


Does it start with a good hook? In order to engage people right away, good speeches usually start with a funny or intriguing point that draws the audience in.
Does it stay engaging the entire time? A good speaker will pepper anecdotes and jokes throughout to grab and keep listeners' attention.
Are the anecdotes and jokes distracting, or do they help build the speaker’s argument? Some listeners will tend to miss the important points, listening only to the hook. The best way to properly critique a speech is to wait for the speaker to make a joke and then listen very closely to what he or she says afterward. Think of jokes and anecdotes as highlighter pens, pointing out the main ideas.
Does the speaker use illustrations judiciously? One really superb, memorable illustration is better than three that don't stick with the audience and are only partially related to the main goal of the speech.

, A good close should tie up all of the points and give the audience new ideas for using the information they've been given. A poor closing will only summarize the points, or outright ignore them and go on to a topic that has nothing to do with what the speaker has been saying for the rest of the allotted time period.


Remember that the ending of a speech is one of the most important parts in the speech making process. It should regain the audience's attention and be powerful, thoughtful, deep, and concise.
When ending a speech, the speaker must also exhibit the greatest level of confidence one can muster, since this technique will help the audience also gain confidence in the speaker's presentation.

Listen to the speaker’s voice inflections.,
Watch the speaker’s body language.,
Listen for filler words.,
See if the speech was memorized.,
Assess how the speaker manages anxiety.",How to Critique a Speech2," Does the speaker talk in a way that makes you want to keep listening, or is it easy to tune out? A great speaker knows when to pause for effect, as well as how fast to speak and at what volume. There’s no one perfect way to deliver a speech, since everyone has their own style. However, all great speakers share in common a capacity to keep their listener’s attention. Here are a few things to keep in mind:


A person who is speaking too loudly may seem aggressive, while one who is speaking too quietly may struggle to be heard. See if the person seems to have a good sense of how loudly to speak.
Many speakers tend to speak too quickly without realizing it. See if the person is speaking at a pace that sounds natural and easy to understand.

, The way the speaker holds him or herself should project confidence and charisma, making the audience feel engaged and included. Someone less skilled at public speaking might look down, forget to make eye contact, and tap his or her foot, while a great speaker will do the following:


Make eye contact with audience members in several different spots in the audience. This helps each part of the crowd feel included.
Stand up straight without fidgeting too much.
Use natural arm and hand gestures from time to time.
When appropriate, walk around the stage instead of leaning against a podium.

, Too many “ums,” “likes” and “uhs” take away from a speaker’s credibility, since they make him or her sound a bit unprepared. Listen for these words and make a note of how many times you hear them. While saying a few filler words is natural, they should not overwhelm the speech or be noticeable in any way.

, A great speaker should have memorized the speech long in advance. Using a typed page of notes or using powerpoint to jog one's memory is acceptable, but glancing down too many times can be distracting for audience members.


It was once acceptable to carry a series of notecards and read from them, but this is no longer the case.
Memorizing the speech allows the speaker to engage with the audience through eye contact and body language, and prevents the speech from sounding like it’s being read from a book.

, Most people suffer from stage fright. Public speaking is the second worst fear in North America, ranking above death. Great speakers might be nervous on the inside, by they’ve learned ways to hide that from the audience. Look for signs that the speaker is nervous so you can offer a critique that will help him or her improve next time.


Note any repeated movements or gestures that take away from the content of the speech; these could be signs of nervousness.
A shaky voice or tendency to mumble are also signs of nervousness.

"
"
Take detailed notes during the speech.,
Discuss your assessment of the speech’s content.,
Give feedback on the speaker’s delivery.,
Point out the positive, too.",How to Critique a Speech3," Bring a notebook and pen to the speech, so you can make note of areas that need improvement. Writing down a shorthand account of what the speaker said will help you to organize the points when it’s time to deliver your critique. Being as detailed as possible in your notes will help the speaker understand exactly what to work on for next time.


If there are no restrictions against it and you have time, record the speech using either a video camera or a tape recorder. This way, you will have the opportunity to play back the speech more than once to get an idea of what point the speaker was making, as well as how well they said it.
Organize your notes so there’s a section on content and a section on delivery. Include examples to back up your evaluation of each.

, Deconstruct the speech by part, starting with the introduction and ending with the conclusion. Give an overall evaluation of whether you felt the main points of the speech were adequately presented and reinforced, and whether you felt the speech as a whole seemed convincing and credible. Would you consider it a successful speech, or does it need to be revised?


Tell the speaker what elements of the speech were interesting, which parts were confusing, and which areas need more references to back them up.
If there were certain jokes or anecdotes that didn’t work, let the speaker know. It’s better to be honest now than to let the person tell the same bad joke twice.
Tell the speaker whether you felt the speech was appropriate for the intended audience.

, It is in this area that speakers often need the most feedback, since it’s difficult to evaluate your own body language and style. Give the speaker a gentle but honest critique of the effectiveness of his or her body language and delivery, including tone of voice, pacing, eye contact, and posture.


It might be helpful to discuss the concept of emotional intelligence, or EQ, which refers to the ability to read an audience and keep people engaged by affecting their emotions. The point of making eye contact, speaking clearly and sounding natural is to make the audience feel as though you care about them and you want them to understand where you’re coming from. Helping them feel included will make them more likely to stay engaged.
If the speaker seemed nervous, you might suggest that he or she practice techniques that help reduce stage fright, like exercising before the speech, laughing before the speech and practicing in front of a small group of people first.

, The speaker you’re critiquing likely put some time and effort into writing and practicing the speech. Any time you’re giving a critique, it’s just as important to point out what went right as it is to discuss what needs improvement. If you’re working with a student or someone who needs help improving their speech-giving skills, be encouraging and complimentary so they have the confidence to keep working on their skills.


Try the feedback sandwich technique: give the person a compliment on an element of their speech, tell them what needs improvement, then give them another compliment. This classic way to deliver constructive criticism makes the medicine go down more easily. For example, you could tell the person he or she started with a brilliant hook, but you were confused about how the second point related to the thesis. However, the conclusion clarified the main point.
As a way to encourage the person to keep learning and improving, you might suggest he or she watch videos of speeches given by famous speakers. Point out similarities and differences between the speech you’re critiquing and the famous speech.

Listen to other storytellers.",How to Narrate," This is really important if you're telling a story or poem by reading it from the page. You can also memorize, which can help, but you want to make sure you know how to read something out loud.


Read it more than once. Especially if you're going to be performing in front of people, you want to read over what you're narrating multiple times, so that you are accustomed to the words and you can look up at your audience.
Catch the rhythm of the words. You'll notice for poems and for stories and even stories that are only verbal, that the length of the sentences and the words used create a sort of rhythm. Get yourself accustomed to this rhythm through practice so you can render the story or poem well, out loud.
Try to avoid simply reading the story or poem off the page. Narration means that you're taking an active part in engaging your audience and performing the narrative. Look up while you're reading so that you meet the eyes of your audience.;
, To tell the story in an engaging manner you will want to vary your voice in terms of speed, volume, tone, cadence. If you speak only in one tone (monotone) you'll bore your listeners, no matter how interesting the story itself is.


You want your tone to match the tone of the story. For example, you don't want to speak confidingly when you're telling an epic tale (like Beowulf), but you wouldn't want your voice to get all epic if you were narrating a humorous Shell Silverstein poem, or a light fluffy romance.
Make sure that you're narrating slowly. When you read aloud, or tell a story to an audience, you want to speak more slowly than you would if you were simply having a conversation. Speaking slowly allows you to capture your audience and allows them to fully appreciate the story or poem. It's good to have water with you when you're narrating and to stop and take a sip so that you can slow down.
You want to project your voice, but you don't want to shout. Breathe and speak from your diaphragm. As an exercise to help you figure out how to do this: stand up straight with your hand on your abdomen. Breathe in and breathe out, feeling your stomach rise and fall as you do this. Count to give on a breath and then ten on the next breath. Your abdomen should start to relax. You will want to speak from that relaxed state.

, Plenty of people don't speak properly or clearly enough when they're trying to narrate. You want to make sure that your audience can hear and understand what you're saying. Avoid mumbling, or speaking too quietly.


Articulate your sounds correctly. Articulation basically means pronouncing sounds properly, rather than pronouncing words. The sounds to focus on pronouncing are: b, d, g, dz (j in jelly), p, t, k, ts, (ch in chilly). Emphasizing these sounds will make your speaking more clear for your audience.
Pronounce words correctly. Make sure that you know what all the words in your story or poem mean and how to say them properly. If you have trouble remembering the pronunciation write up a little guide for yourself next to the word, so that you can say it right when you're narrating.
Avoid ""umms"" and placeholder words such as ""like."" Although fine for regular conversation, these words will make you sound less confident in your narration and will distract your audience.

, You want to make sure that your audience understands the most important parts of the poem or story. Because you're narrating aloud you'll need to show them these parts with your voice.


Sinking your voice into quiet tones and leaning forward to engage your audience for important parts of the story can be a great way to intrigue them. Make sure that you're still projecting even if you're speaking more quietly and carefully.
For example: if you were narrating Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (the first book) you would want to stress the parts of the story like Harry facing Voldemort or Harry winning the Quidditch match by catching the snitch in his mouth.
Poems have specific stresses written into their structure. This means paying attention to how the poem is formatted (what the meter is) so that you know what syllables to stress in your narration., You want to avoid barreling through your narration. Reading or telling a story or poem aloud is not a race. Instead, make sure that you pause at appropriate points so that your audience can fully absorb what they're hearing.Make sure you pause after a particularly humorous or emotional part of your narration to allow your audience time to react. Try to avoid skipping over the important parts of the narrative without a pause. For example: if you're telling a humorous story, you might pause as you build up to the punchline, so people start laughing as they see where the story is heading.
Many times punctuation is a good place to have a pause. When you're reading poetry out loud, make sure that you aren't pausing at the ends of the lines, but instead where the punctuation (comma, periods, etc.) designates a pause.
A good example of appropriate pauses is Lord of the Rings. When reading the work not out loud, you may notice the overabundance of commas, to the point that it looks like Tolkien didn't know how to use commas. Now, if you narrate the book out loud, you find that those commas hit the perfect pauses in verbal storytelling.

, When you're narrating something (a story, a poem, a joke) you want to make sure that you set the right mood. This means setting up the story's place and time, telling it so that the audience feels like they're there and giving the story immediacy.


Give a little background to the story. What is the setting of it? What is the timing (did it happen in your life? someone else's? is this is a story from long ago?)? All these things can help solidify the narrative in your audience's minds.
Tell from the proper point-of-view. Is this your story, did it happen to you? Someone you know? Is it a story people are going to be familiar with (like Cinderella, for example)? Make sure you're telling the story from the right point-of-view.
If you're telling a story, especially one that happened to you, rather than narrating from a written story or poem, you want to tell it in present tense. This makes the narrative more immediate for your audience and sucks them into the story more easily.

, When you're narrating a story, especially one you've come up with yourself or has been related to you, you want to ensure you have a story structure that will interest your audience. People have been telling and narrating stories for thousands of years, so there are a few parameters that can make your story better.


Your story should follow a cause/effect structure, no matter what the story is. This means that something happens and then something else is the effect of the cause, the first thing. Think about it with the word because. ""Because of the cause, the effect happened.""
For example: your comedic story is triggered by you spilling water on the floor. That's the cause, the effect is that you slip on it in the climax of the story. ""Because you spilled water on the floor earlier, you slipped on it when you were playing tag.""
Introduce the conflict early. The conflict and the resolution of the conflict is what keeps your audience interested in the story. Taking too much time introducing it, or veering away from it too often, will reduce your audience's interest. For example: if you were telling the story of Cinderella, you don't want to go on and on about her life before the step-family arrives. The step-family are the conflict in the story, so they need to be introduced early.

, Details can make or break a narrative. If you share too many details you'll overwhelm your audience, or bore them. Too few details and your audience won't get much of a feel for the narrative.


Choose details that are relevant to the outcome of the story. To use Cinderella as an example again: you don't need to give a minute description of every chore she has to do for the step-evils, but descriptions of the chores her step-mom gives her so she can't go to the ball are important because the hinder the resolution of the story.
You can also provide some interesting or humorous details sprinkled through the narrative. Don't overwhelm your audience with these, but a few can get some laughs or provide a deeper interest in the narrative.
Avoid being too vague with your details. In Cinderella's case if you don't tell the audience who is throwing the ball, or where the dress and slippers come from, you'll simply confuse your listeners.

, The tale you're narrating might have dragons and magic that can take a person instantly from one place to another, but as long as it's consistent your audience can suspend disbelief. Now, however, if you add a spaceship to the mix without previous hint of science-fiction, you'll throw your audience out of the story.You also want to make sure that the characters in your story act consistently as well. If you have a character that begins the story being super timid, they're probably not going to immediately confront their deadbeat dad without a lot of character development.

, It's hard to determine what the right length for a story or poem is. That's something that you'll have to decide for yourself, but there are definitely some things that you should consider about the length. These can help you decide how long to make it.


A shorter story is easier to carry off, especially if you're just beginning with narration. It still takes time to make sure you have all the details right and that you hit the right tone, the right speed, and so on.
If you are going to tell a long story make sure that it needs to be long and that it isn't boring. Sometimes you can cut details to make the long story shorter and snappier, therefore making it more interesting.

, Two of the biggest problems that people make when they're trying to narrate are speaking too quickly and not varying their voice. These two problems tend to go together, since it's hard to vary you're voice when you're flying through your narration at the speed of light.


Watch your breathing and your pauses, if you're worried about speaking too quickly. If you aren't taking deep, slow breaths you're probably going too fast. If you aren't pausing, then you are definitely going to fast and your audience will have difficulty keeping up.
Make sure that you're using inflections on words and syllables, so that you aren't simply speaking in one tone. This is one of the biggest ways to keep your audience's interest, even if the story itself isn't the most interesting.

, Another problem is not getting to the story quickly enough and taking too many detours during the story. The occasional aside isn't a problem, especially if it's informative or humorous. Otherwise, stick to the main story, because that's what your audience wants to hear about.Avoid the ""pre-ramble."" When you start your narration, do the briefest introduction of yourself and the work as possible. Your audience doesn't want to hear how the story came to you in a dream, etc. and etc. They want to hear the story.
Don't ramble during the story. Keep to the basic bones of the story and don't go off onto other memories, or other immensely funny things that you just thought of. Too many side rambles and you're going to lose your audience.

, When you're narrating a story, whether it's your own or another's, your audience does not want your moral insight. Think about the stories that you remember from your childhood (like Aesop's fables). Most, if not all, had some moral. Do you even remember it, or do you remember only the story?


Stories are built on facts, the facts of the narrative. Following these facts will provide the moral or opinion or insight whether or not you articulate what it actually is.

, This seems like such an obvious step, but so often this is where people fall down when trying to narrate. You have to practice before you can effectively and entertainingly narrate something, whether it's a written poem or story, or a story you're telling that comes from your own life.


The more you know your material, the more confident you'll appear when you're narrating. The more confident you are in your narration, the more interest your garner from your audience.

, There are people who do narration for a living: storytellers, people who do voice-overs for movies, people who read stories for books on tape.


Watch storytellers live and see how they use their bodies (hand gestures, facial expressions), how they vary their voices, and what techniques they use to draw in their listeners.

Write your return address (and, optionally, your name) in the top left corner.,
Write the date below your contact information.,
Write the ""inside address"" below the date.,
Consider using an alternate header arrangement.,
For casual letters, simply write the date alone.,
Skip a line after the header to position the salutation properly.,
When in doubt, use ""Dear"".,
Account for uncertainties about your recipient.,
Use informal salutations only in casual or intimate contexts.",How to Begin a Letter," Formal letters have somewhat long, detailed headers which contain both your own personal information and the information of the person you are contacting. Provide as much of this information as you are able to. The first thing you should do is to write your address (and/or your name) in the top left corner. Write the address in standard two-line form - in other words, put your street address in the very top left corner and your city, state, and postal code on the line below it.


If you choose to include your name, which is not required, put it in the very top left, rather than your address, which will then occupy the second and third lines.
Here is a sample of how we might write our name and address:



John Smith
21 Jump Street
Milwaukee, WI, 12345



;
, Next, write the current date. Skip a line below your address, then write the date so that it's similarly aligned with the left edge of the page.


Dates are written in the form: month, day, year. Always spell out the month of the date, but not the day or year. Here is a sample date of this form:

April 1st, 2014



, Finally, you must specify the name and address of the person you're attempting to contact. This is called the ""inside address"" because it's the same information as on the outside of the envelope, only inside it instead. Skip a line below the date and write this aligned with the left edge of the page as well. If you know the name of the person you're contacting, lead with this. If not, try to at least include his or her title (like, for instance, ""Professor of English Literature"" or ""Senior Technician""). If you know both, write the name first, then the title on the next line. If you're writing to this person at his or her place of employment, next, write the name of this place. Finally, write your recipient's address on the following lines.


Here is an example of an inside address:



Mrs. Jane Doe
Director of Stadium Operations
Wrigley Field
1060 West Addison Street
Chicago, IL, 98765





, The instructions above aren't the sole way to compose a header in a formal letter. Other options are acceptable as well. The most common alternative to the method above is to position your return address in the top right corner, rather than the top left corner, and to position the date under the inside address, rather than above it. In other words, in this alternative configuration, the return address is in the top right corner, followed by a skipped line, followed by the inside address aligned with the left side of the page, followed by another skipped line, followed by the date., The above instructions assume you're writing a letter in a formal or business context. If you're simply writing a letter to a friend or casual acquaintance, you may want to skip the pretense of a formal header. If so, simply writing the date in the top left corner is sufficient. After this, you may proceed to the salutation and the body of the letter itself.

, The salutation is the greeting that begins a letter - ""Dear distinguished colleague,"", ""My true love,"", and so on. You have a variety of choices when it comes to salutations, each of which may be appropriate for certain occasions and not for others. Whichever salutation you choose, make sure you align it with the left edge of the paper and leave a blank line on either side of it (in other words, have blank lines between it, the header, and the body of the letter). Note that salutations almost always end with a comma.


In the US, in certain business contexts, a colon sometimes substitutes for the comma in a salutation. However, this is rare.

, If you ever have any doubts about which salutation to use, the standard ""Dear ,"" works wonders. This salutation is suitable for letters ranging from formal to casual and from grave to content. If you include a title, use only your recipient's last name. For instance, ""Dear Mr. Smith,"" is correct, while ""Dear Mr. John Smith,"" is somewhat unusual.


For example, we might begin our letter to Jane Doe with the simple ""Dear Mrs. Doe,"". If we want, we can include her title: ""Dear Director Doe,"".

, Sometimes, it's impossible to know exactly who will be receiving your letter, such as when you're writing to a department of a large institution. In these cases, it's important to make sure that your salutation takes your uncertainties into account so as not to make an unfair assumption about the recipient. Below are some common situations in which you'll need to account for unknowns:


If you're unsure of the gender of your recipient, use ""Dear Sir or Madam"", or simply use their full name (i.e., ""Dear Lee Anderson,"")
If you don't know whether you're writing to a man or a woman, but you know your recipient's title, you may use it instead (like ""Dear Professor,"", ""Dear Senator,"", etc.).
If you don't know a female recipient's marital status, use ""Ms."", rather than ""Mrs."", as in ""Dear Ms. Norton,"".
Finally, if you are sending a letter to a business or institution rather than to a specific person within the business or institution, you may want to use ""To whom it may concern,"" rather than a traditional salutation. Some find this salutation undesirable- it is also acceptable to use ""Dear ,"" though this is somewhat informal.

, While you'll generally want to stick to ""Dear"" salutations in most formal and semi-formal contexts, if you're writing to a close friend, significant other, or family member, you can usually get away with informal salutations. Because you're no longer bound by rules of etiquette in these situations, you have a wide variety of options at your disposal. Below are just a few:


If you're writing to a good friend or a close family member, you may want to use a nickname or pet name in your salutation (""Dear Gator,"", ""Dear Fonz,"", etc.)
If you're writing to a lover or significant other, you can be flowery and affectionate in your salutation, though you don't have to be. ""My true love,"" ""Dear Smooshums,"" and ""To my one and only angel,"" are just as valid as simpler romantic salutations, like simply writing your recipient's name, followed by a comma (i.e. ""John,"" or ""Jane,"")

Be aware of your audience's age.,
Establish how many people you're writing to.,
Know how familiar the recipient of the letter is with German.,
Determine if your letter is formal.,
Determine if your letter is informal.,
Understand the spectrum of formality.,
Write a friendly/polite line before the actual closing phrase.,
Choose a formal ending phrase if you've determined that your letter is a formal one.,
Choose an informal ending for more casual correspondence.,
Sign your name after the concluding line.",How to End a Letter in German," Language is constantly changing, and this is reflected in verbal as well as written communication. For older generations, it's always safer to go with a more formal letter structure and ending. For younger generations, you might be able to remain more colloquial.


A good rule of thumb is to be more formal (yes, even in informal letters) with people 60 years of age and older.;
, Sometimes, your audience will be one person but sometimes you might have to address a group of people. Though this point might matter most for the body and addressing of the letter, it can also help you further define an appropriate ending.

, You can choose a more intricate ending if your recipient is a native speaker or has advanced familiarity. But stay with a clear and concise one if your reader only has a working knowledge of the language.

, If you wrote to someone you don't know well or at all, your letter will most likely be formal. It's very important to keep this in mind, not only for the body of the letter, but especially for the ending.


Formal: examples might be your boss, a co-worker, an organization, and anyone you've had limited to no interaction with.

, Writing your best friend or mom? Your letter will likely be informal.


Informal: examples might be family and friends, and anyone you feel very comfortable with.

, Once you've decided that your letter is formal or informal, it's time to zone in on the degree of formality. In other words, writing a letter to your boss might have a different ending than a letter to the President. And writing a letter to your significant other might take a different ending than a letter to your mother or father.

, You might want to thank your reader for his or her time, or say that you look forward to her or his feedback (in a formal letter), or simply say that you miss them very much (in an informal letter). Keep in mind, the first three suggestions are formal while the last three are informal. Here are some ways to wrap up your letter before the ending phrase, :


Ich bedanke mich bei Ihnen im Voraus (I thank you in advance).
Ich würde mich freuen, bald von Ihnen zu hören (I look forward to hearing from you soon)
Für weitere Auskünfte stehe ich Ihnen gerne zur Verfügung (I am readily available should you require additional information)
Ich freue mich auf Deine Antwort (I look forward to your reply).
Bitte antworte mir bald (Please write back soon).
Melde dich bald (Get in touch with me soon).

, Here are the most commonly used ones. Keep in mind, the first closing sentence should only be used for very formal occasions:


Hochachtungsvoll (With the highest regards/reverence)
Mit freundlichen Grüßen (Sincerely)
Mit besten Grüßen (With best regards)
Mit freundlichen Empfehlungen (With friendly compliments)
Freundliche Grüße (Kind regards)

, The first three closing phrases are fairly informal while the last four are very informal.:


Freundliche Grüße (Polite regards)
Mit herzlichen Grüßen (With heart-felt regards)
Herzliche Grüße (Heart-felt regards)
Ich drück Dich (I hug you)
Alles Liebe (All that is lovely to you)
Bis bald (See/talk/write to you soon)
Ich vermisse Dich ( Miss you)

, The last step is to sign your name and send your letter!

Don't ""just"" be funny.",How to Add Humor to a Graduation Speech," Starting with inspirational quotes is a common (even corny) feature of the graduation speech. If you want to have a little humor in your speeches, using humorous quotes can be a great way to do it and add some levity.Here are a few classics of the genre:


Will Rogers: ""Even if you're on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there.""
Ben Franklin: ""You will find the key to success under the alarm clock.""
Bill Watterson: ""What's it like in the real world? Well, the food is better, but beyond that, I don't recommend it.""
Ray Magliozzi: ""You will never have more energy or enthusiasm, hair, or brain cells than you have today."";
, One excellent way of putting a little humor in your speech is ironically referencing something that seems like it would be a silly reference for a graduation speech. Pop culture like songs, cartoons, and action movies could all be great references for a funny graduation speech, as long as you take it seriously and develop it.


Pick a pearl from a favorite rap song: ""As the venerable Lil Wayne taught us, 'Real G's move in silence, like lasagna.' And that's what I want to talk to you about today. No, not the questionable Italian casseroles lovingly served by the lunch ladies at our school, but moving forward. In silence. Like the real G's that Jefferson High School has made us.""
Reference some ""low"" culture: ""Wondering these halls, we were like so many Mario Brothers in the sewers of our lives. Getting lost and finding our way. Reaching for stars. Thinking we were sparkling and invincible. Trampling strange mushrooms. Smashing turtles with hammers. Doing battles with princess-stealing dragon creatures who live in fiery realms. Well...we did some of that.""

, Think of a funny story specific to your school, something that involves characters present at the graduation. This could be a good way to lead into your speech with some humor, as long as the story is appropriate for your audience.


If you're giving a speech because you're an exceptional student or an administrator, it could get a good opportunity to self-deprecate. Tell a story about a time you failed spectacularly.
Try to think of something everyone will be able to recognize. If your school has been under construction all year, make jokes about ""building the future one closed hallway at a time.""
Avoid telling ""inside"" jokes unless you're going to explain them. If something is funny to you and your swim-team friends, but nobody else knows what it means, it's not good for a graduation speech. Remember who your audience is.

, While it might be difficult to pull off well, poking fun at the usual cliches of the graduation speech can be a good way to find something more interesting to say. Think of the corniest speech you could possibly give, then use that as a spring to go in the opposite direction.


Attack the ""hard-work"" cliché: ""Lots of people will tell you that success comes with hard work. And that the only way to climb that ladder of success is by keeping your hands out of your pockets. But it isn't true. Some people are just lucky. And that's what I want to talk about today...""
Pick on the ""I see the future innovators of the world"" cliché: ""I look out at you, my fellow graduates, and you know what I see? I see a future of loan debt. I see the students who will break their thumbs on the Xbox of life. The kids who will back-up the emergency rooms of the world, on Halloween, when the partying was too intense. Who will have 14 grandmothers die during finals week. And who will take control of their lives.""

, Lots of good speeches, and some bad ones, use some conceit, story, or aphorism through the whole speech as a kind of metaphor. David Foster Wallace's ""This is Water"" is a classic speech of the genre.He starts with a simple joke about two fish swimming along in the ocean, and then talks at length about the cliches of graduation speeches, in which many speakers position themselves as the older fish swimming along telling the younger fish what water is.


Pick a common joke that you like and tell it. Knock-knock jokes, chicken crossing the road jokes, talking dog jokes, jokes about moths visiting podiatrists. You can use any joke if you put the work into it.
""My dad used to love to tell a joke. It goes like this: A guy and a skeleton walk into a bar. The guy orders two beers and a mop. I think there are two kinds of people in this world. Skeletons, and the people who mop up after them when they drink too much.""

, As you're crafting your jokes for your graduation speech, Try to keep in mind all of the people who will be there. Your fellow classmates may be your target, but remember that they might be hugely outnumbered by faculty, family members, and other people who might not think your inside joke with the swim team is funny.


You probably won't make everyone laugh, even if your joke is great. Don't worry about broadcasting to every body in the audience, but try to keep it clean for as many people as possible. Remember they are there.

, It's also important to find out about the order of events at the ceremony. When will you be speaking? It's probably not best to include too many jokes if you're slated to speak right after a tribute to a fallen classmate, or a very serious benediction. It might come off as bad taste.

, Being funny doesn't mean being crude. Keep your jokes relatively PG and tasteful, so everyone can laugh. Don't insult administration or single out specific teachers as part of your speech.


It's probably not necessary to name specific people at all in your speech. Even if you think they might laugh to be called out for something in the graduation speech, you never know who'll take offense. Don't tease anyone but yourself.

, Jokes shouldn't be used just for the sake of jokes. The best jokes can be developed into something more complicated and meaningful, for the speech to work.


Sometimes, it can be hard to think of a joke to go along with a specific theme, and it's a lot easier to find a specific theme from a joke you want to tell.

, When you're trying to figure out the best tone and delivery for your speech, watch some.Check out a few of the funniest and most clever commencement speeches given.Here are some recent classics, both by comedians and celebrities, as well as regular students:


Stephen Colbert at University of Virginia
Neil Degrasse Tyson at Mount Holyoke College
Evan Biberdorf's High School Graduation Speech
Lance Jabr's High School Musical
Conan O'Brien's Harvard Commencement

, In the beginning of your speech, it's a good idea to read your audience. You might use an early joke to Try to anticipate how your speech will go, but you don't want to launch into your most complicated or ridiculous jokes right off the bat. Ease into things and see how ready to laugh your audience will be.


Lead in a general way, thanking everyone who has already spoken and brought you up to the stage. Even if your speech involves voices and costumes, don't forget the standard ""thank you"" stuff.
It's hard to guess the mood of a particular audience. Some might be rowdy and ready to laugh, others might be kind of somber, or bored. Start normally and find the right tone for the day.

, What happens if you launch into your jokes and nobody laughs? That could be an awkward situation, if your speech just builds and includes nothing but jokes. While this is unlikely if you do your speech-writing appropriately, it's a good idea to have an emergency back-up plan in place if you suddenly have a change of heart.


You can always avoid emphasizing the jokes with your voice. Just read it as straight as possible, instead of pausing dramatically for emphasis and waiting for the laughter to die down.
Mark all your jokes with one color, or with an underline, and then let all the straight stuff stay in regular font and text. If you need to, you can quickly see the jokes you can skip over. Just focus on the content.

, This always happens. You think one line will kill, and you get nothing but silence. Two sentences later, people will laugh at something you thought was pretty straightforward. Don't worry about this. If people are laughing, that's a good thing. Don't worry about it too much, but be ready to pause in places you might not have thought you should pause.

, In some cases, you might be adopting a kind of character to be funny. You might be overly dramatic, or fake-serious, or you may just end up being yourself. Whatever you're doing, commit to it as much as possible.


If you're going to belt a Sinatra song dramatically, you've got to stay serious so people will laugh. If you're going to give a fake-academic talk, stay in professor mode all the way through.
Don't laugh at your own jokes. Practice saying them so you won't be giving away your own punchlines.

, If your speech is funny, give the people enough time to catch up with your clever sense of humor. Pacing is important to any kind of speech. Slow down as you're giving it and pause in the right places.


Slow down the speed that you're reading your words, as well as your pauses in between sentences. Give each sentence a full stop.
If people are laughing, just stop talking for minute. Don't try to talk over the laughter.

, Mumble-mouthed jokes won't get any laughs. Practice reading your speech slowly, enunciating and pronouncing each word properly. If you stumble over jokes and mess up the words, or have to start over a particular joke, it'll lose some of its punch.


Practice your speech several times. Have it nearly memorized, without actually memorizing it. Nothing stops a joke dead in the water like bad timing.

, Jokes are well and good, but it's important to have a speech that's more complicated than a litany of jokes. You can be the funniest comedian at your school, but you want to say something of substance in the end. Thank people sincerely for having you give the speech and sitting to listen to it at the end, even if the rest of your speech was sarcastic or ridiculous.


End on some positive note. People like to be moved at a graduation, as well.

Write ""Attn"" followed by the name of the recipient.,
Write the business or organization name next.,
Add the street address beneath the company name.,
Fill in the city, state, and postal code on the bottom line.,
Check your address to ensure it is correct.",How to Address Envelopes With Attn," The ""Attn"" line should always appear at the very top of your delivery address, just before the name of the person you're sending it to. Use a colon after ""Attn"" to make it clearly readable. This line signifies to the mail carrier exactly for whom the letter is intended.


For example, write ""Attn: John Smith,"" where ""John Smith"" is replaced with your recipient's name.
As an alternative, you can write out the full word ""attention.""

, The name of the company where the person works goes underneath the ""Attn"" line. The company name should be written on the second line of the destination address.


If the company is large and the person to whom you're writing works for a particular department, include the department name on a line of it's own before you write the company name.
Not including the company name on the envelope will not usually prevent your letter from being delivered. However, your letter will look less professional, and may not get delivered promptly, if you don't include the company name.

, The full street address should be added in a single line. Make sure to include any directional signs (such as ""east"" or ""west""), suite number, or unit number. Suite and unit numbers should not be placed on a separate line unless absolutely necessary.


Make sure you know the exact street address where your recipient works. Many businesses that are located in multi-story or other large buildings will include a suite number in their address. Including this number is crucial.

Ignore the letter.,

Getting upset by the contents of an anonymous letter gives the author power.,
Dispose of the letter.,
Ponder the contents of the letter.,
Try to figure out who sent the letter.,
Determine the seriousness of the letter.,
Confront the problem.",How to Cope with Receiving Anonymous Letters1," One way to deal with an anonymous letter is to ignore it. Some people do not believe that criticism passed through an anonymous platform is worth any attention., If you have received anonymous hate, don't post about it on social media and try to call them out. Don't address the office, or send e-mails to people you know accusing them of sending you anonymous letters. This validates the anonymous sender because they realize they got to you. It may also cause the author to send you more messages if they know they have gotten to you., Instead of keeping the letter, get rid of it. Throw it away, shred it, tear it up, burn it - whatever you feel you need to do. If you receive an anonymous e-mail or social media message, delete it. Holding on to the letter keeps it around, giving it power over your mind. If you toss it out, you also toss it out of your mind.


If the letter contains false or potentially libellous or defamatory information, you could consider destroying the letter by shredding, tearing, or burning. However, it may be advisable to keep the letter in case you wish to show it to a lawyer or the authorities as evidence of threats or harassment. Bear in mind, however, that information would only be defamatory if it is not true. , Take some time to examine what the letter said. Ask yourself: Why would someone send this to me? For example, people who find out about an affair often want to let the betrayed partner know but are worried about 'shooting the messenger. ' If you receive a letter like this, try not to dwell on who wrote the letter but look at the details provided and think about whether the information could be true.


If the letter contains criticism of your personality, appearance, or work habits, confront those criticisms. Do they have any merit? Is there something you can learn from this anonymous letter and change about yourself? Can you take this as a wake up call in some way?, If you really want to get to the bottom of who sends you an anonymous letter, try to figure out who sent it. Narrow it down by the subject of the letter - if it's about work, the letter more than likely came from a co-worker. If it's about your barking dog, the letter is probably from a neighbor who lives nearby.


If it's more general, try to decide who might have a problem with you or something you have done. Have you had any confrontations or disagreements with someone recently? Are you in a high-profile position in your company, community, or other organization that might make you a target for criticism?Sometimes, clues about the writer's identity can be found in the letter itself. Look at the grammar and mechanics usage. Analyze the language being used; sometimes this might help you decide if the person is older or younger, or even what profession they might have. Are there signature words used in the letter that may help lead you to the author? Did they sign it with a nominative like ""A friend,"" ""A concerned neighbor,"" or ""An angry mother""? These aren't foolproof ways of discovering the identity, but it might help you get started.
Often, the senders of anonymous hate are people close to you, like friends, family members, co-workers, neighbors, and people in the same organizations. , Evaluate if the letter is random, generic hate, or a serious anonymous allegation that needs to be addressed. This might be especially important if you receive an anonymous letter related to your place of employment. Decide if the letter is outlining something serious enough to be addressed.


Think about the specifics of the letter. Does it name times, dates, and specific details? This might give the letter some credit; however, it could also be falsified information.
Is there a reason this information might be sent through an anonymous letter instead of in person? Would the writer of the letter risk harm, ridicule, or negative consequences if they came forward?
Is the language abusive, hateful in nature, or overly negative and critical? If so, this might be a spiteful, angry letter that doesn't need to be taken seriously., In some instances, the letter might accuse people of doing something that you can't forget. You have two options in this scenario: forget what you read or confront the person. Make sure to listen carefully and openly to what they say without your own prejudices based on the contents of the letter. However, look for any inconsistencies in behavior or signals that they may be eluding the truth.


The exception to this rule is if you get a letter accusing your spouse of cheating on you. In such a scenario, it is usually recommended that you do NOT raise the issue with your spouse while you quietly look into the matter carefully, so they do not cover their tracks. It is relatively easy to deceive a trusting partner, and sometimes an anonymous letter is the first sign that there might be cause for you to investigate further."

Talk to a trusted friend.,
Reach out to those in authority.,
Obtain the author's location.,
Block the sender.",How to Cope with Receiving Anonymous Letters2," If you got a letter that has bothered you, share it with someone you trust. This person can help give you insight on the contents.If the letter contains hateful criticism and words directed to you, they can help you objectively evaluate if there is any validity in the criticisms. If the anonymous letter accuses someone of something, they might be able to help you determine if it is serious enough to pursue. If the letter suggests some action be taken, they can help you evaluate that, too.

, If you receive anonymous letters that are a cause of concern, or you repeatedly receive anonymous hate, you may want to ask for help from an authority figure. Contact your local police department if you feel threatened by the letters.If you involve the police, you will need to keep the letters as evidence. Some states may have laws against anonymous threatening that could help you.
If you experience anonymous threats at work, go to your immediate boss or supervisor. They can help you figure out what course of action to take.
If you are a youth who is receiving anonymous cyberbullying, talk to your parents, teachers, police officers, or other trusted adults. Schools can help with cyberbullying, and if that doesn't work, try contacting one of the cyberbullying help websites, like Delete Cyberbullying, Cyberbully Help, or Stop Bullying., Sometimes, both physical and electronic letters provide clues to the author's location. If the letter was sent through the mail, check to see if there is a postmark with a city or zip code on it. If the letter was sent electronically, attempt to locate the e-mail's IP address. If the letter was dropped in your mailbox, the person may live in your neighborhood.

Write ""The (Surname) Family"" at the top of the address.,
Use the plural form of the family name.,
Address the rest of the envelope as normal.",How to Address an Envelope to a Family1," When you're looking to address an envelope to an entire family, rather than a single individual, you have two options: you can use the family name to represent the entire family, or you can specifically address the envelope to some (or all) of the family members. Let's tackle the first option first. The easiest way to address an envelope to an entire family is simply write ""The (Last Name of the Family) Family"" as the first line of your address. This method is a good choice for general communications (like friendly letters) but may be unwise for addressing envelopes in which it's important to know who the letter is specifically for (like wedding invitations).


For example, if we're writing a letter to Tim and Janet Jones and their children Emma and Peter, we would address the envelope to The Jones Family.;
, As an alternative to the above, it's also acceptable to simply use the plural form of the family's surname as the first line of the envelope's address. In this case, the plural family name is always preceded by the word ""The"" so that the final result is in the form of ""The Smiths"", ""The Garcias"", and so on.


Don't fall into the trap of using apostrophes here. Apostrophes are used to convey possession, not to make a word plural, so you shouldn't use them in the plural form of the family name. Most family names simply need an -s at the end to become plural (e.g. Thompsons, Lincolns). However, family names that end with an ""s"", ""sh"", or ""x"" sound usually need an -es at the end (e.g. Roses, Foxes, Welshes).
Following our example above, if we're writing a letter to the Jones family, in addition to using ""The Jones Family"" as the first line of our address, we can also simply use The Joneses.

, Regardless of the method you use for the first line of your envelope's address, the rest of the address is written as it would be for any other letter. Under the first line containing the family name, write the street number or PO box, then, on the next line, write the city, state/province, postal code, and so on. If writing internationally, write the name of the country below on a separate fourth line. Write your return address in the same fashion in the top left corner of the envelope. For more information, see How to Write an Address on an Envelope.


For example, in our Jones family example, our final address might look something like this:






The Jones Family (or ""The Joneses"")
21 Jump Street
Anytown, CA, 98765






As a general rule, whenever you're addressing an envelope to a family, the first line of the address is the one you'll change — the actual street address should remain untouched. In the following methods described below, it is to be assumed that the portion of the address following the ""name"" line should be written as normal.

"
"
Begin with the parents' names and titles.,
Follow with any children's names.,
Alternatively, write the parents' names followed by ""and Family"".,
Omit children's names if the letter isn't intended for them.,
Send separate letters to children over 18.",How to Address an Envelope to a Family2," When addressing an envelope to an entire family, in addition to using the family name to stand for all of the family's members, you can also name some or all of them individually. This method is useful for letters such as wedding invitations in which it's important to convey who specifically the letter is for. To begin, on the first line of your address, write the parents' names. In most cases, you will want to use their appropriate titles (Mr. and Mrs. are always safe, while titles like ""Dr."", ""Judge"", and so on are usually optional outside of formal or professional contexts).


For example, If we're inviting the Jones family to a housewarming party, we would start by writing the parents' names on the first line: Mr. and Mrs. Jones.
It's also acceptable to use the traditional form of describing married couples in which the husband's full name serves for both partners: Mr. and Mrs. Tim Jones. However, this method isn't necessary.
Finally, you can also write each partner's full name, sans titles: Tim and Janet Jones. This is usually done in familiar, informal contexts, as using someone's first name rather than his or her title can be seen as rude if you don't know him or her well.

, On the next line, list the names of children who are under 18 and live as dependents of the parents. You can provide the family name once at the end of the list of children's names (e.g., David, Chelsea, and Gabriela Richardson), or you can leave it out entirely (e.g., David, Chelsea, and Gabriela). If you know the ages of the children, list them from oldest to youngest.


For example, in our example party invitation scenario, we would write the names of the children in the family below the parent's names like so: Emma and Peter. This means that the first two lines of our address would look something like this:





Mr. and Mrs. Jones
Emma and Peter







, In situations where you don't know the names of any or all children in the family, it's acceptable to refer to children collectively. In this case, on the second line where you would normally name the children, write ""and Family"". You may also use ""and Children"" to make your intent more specific.


In our example, we could replace Emma and Peter's names with the phrase ""and Family"" or ""and Children"" if we had forgotten their names. In this case, the first two lines of our address would look like this:





Mr. and Mrs. Jones
and Children







, The above examples assume that the letter is intended for both the parents and the children in the family. If this is not the case, name the relevant recipients in the first line, then proceed immediately to the street address without using the second line to list additional family members.


If, for instance, we wanted only to invite the parents in the Jones family to our party, we would use the standard Mr. and Mrs. Jones without naming any of their children.

, If the family contains any children over 18 (or the traditional age of adulthood in the recipient's community), send these children their own, separate letter in addition to the one you send to their parents. Receiving your own mail is a sign of adulthood. Though it's relatively minor, it can be perceived as somewhat insulting to, for instance, be invited to a party via a letter addressed to one's parents.

Address the outer envelope to the parents only.,
Address the inner envelope to all the recipients.,
Include a stamp on the return envelope.",How to Address an Envelope to a Family3," Some types of letters make a point of requesting a response from the recipient. In situations like these, a small, usually pre-addressed reply envelope is often included inside the outer envelope. If you're mailing a letter like this, it's worth noting that the outer and inner envelopes are usually addressed slightly differently when the recipient is an entire family. To start, address the outer envelope (the one in which the contents of the letter and the second envelope are contained) with only the names of the parents or heads of the household.


For the outer envelope, write the parents' names as described in the section above. For example, if you're inviting the entire Jones family to your wedding, for the outer envelope, you would only write the names of the parents: Mr. and Mrs. Jones, Mr. and Mrs. Tim Jones, or Tim and Janet Jones.

, For the inner return envelope, the rules differ somewhat. If you're requesting a response for every member of the family (for instance, if you're inviting the entire family to your wedding), write the parents' names on the first line of the address and the children's names underneath on the second line. If, however, you're only requesting a response from the parents, you would only write their names on the first line of the address, then proceed to the street address and so on.


Note that the directions for the inner envelope refer to its return address. Obviously, the main address that tells where the envelope is being sent will be your own (or that of a relevant agency, business, PO box, etc.) so that their reply will be sent to the correct place.
In our wedding invitation example, if we're inviting the entire family, the return address of the inner envelope would have the parents' names on the first line followed by the names of the children on the second. The first two lines of the inner envelope's return address would look something like this:





Mr. and Mrs. Jones
Emma and Peter







, Regardless of who specifically you're requesting a response from, it's always a sign of courtesy to pre-stamp your letter's return envelope. Stamps are relatively cheap, so including a stamp on the return envelope is more a sign of respect and care than it is actual financial aid. Still, it's usually best to avoid a minor faux pas by taking the time to give your letter's return envelope a stamp


As above, you should send separate letters to children who are over 18 (or are considered independent adults according to some other standard). In situations where you're sending letters with included return envelopes, this means that you'll need to address and stamp each return envelope with the name of the over-18 child in the return address as well.

Follow French etiquette when writing the addressee’s name.,
Put the recipient’s address on the front middle of the envelope.,
Understand additional French postal rules.,
Put the letter in the envelope.,
Write your address on the back.,
Mail your letter to France.,
Include the proper header.,
Address the recipient properly.,
End the letter appropriately.",How to Address a Letter to France," Write the person's full name in the top line of text, near the middle of your envelope. Include their title; this means that you should use ""Madame"" for a woman and ""Monsieur"" for a man. ""Mademoiselle"" is often used for a young, unmarried woman.You can also use title abbreviations, such as ""M."" for ""Monsieur,"" ""Mme"" for ""Madame,"" and ""Mlle"" for ""Mademoiselle.""
In France, people typically write last names all in capital letters to avoid any possible confusion. For example, you should address your letter to John SMITH instead of John Smith.
For example: Mlle Brigitte MENIVIER
Write the company's name on the second line, if you are writing a business letter. Exclude this step if it is a personal letter. For example: Firm France.;
, When writing letters to France, the recipient’s address is the only thing that should appear on the front of the envelope – and the postage, of course. Write it in the middle of the envelope, leaving at least 5⁄8 in (16 mm) of blank space between the address and bottom of the envelope for the French post office’s printed bar codes. You should include the recipient’s name (line one), the street address (line two), the postal code followed by the city name (line three), and the country (line four). Be sure to capitalize all proper nouns, like street names and towns.Here is an example of how the recipient address should look:
John SMITH
118 Boulevard Saint-Germain
75006 Paris
France

, When addressing a letter to France, there are a few other things to keep in mind. Each address line can contain a maximum of 38 characters, with a maximum of six overall lines allowed.Some people prefer to write the street name, city name, and country name in all caps as well, though this is not required.
Do not include a comma between the house number and the street name.

, Place the letter or contents inside the envelope and seal it if you have not already done so. Make sure the contents fit well inside the regular or padded envelope, as mail can sometimes be damaged in transit, especially if it is an odd shape.


If you are using a padded envelope, or if your package is bumpy, address your envelope before placing the contents inside to ensure that the addresses are clear and legible.

, Once you have inserted the letter into the envelope and sealed it shut, you should write your name and address on the back. The French post likes to have the return address over the sealed portion of the envelope to show that it has not been opened or tampered with. You should include the following information:Your first and last name – with the last name in all caps (line one)
Your street address (line two)
Your city, state and postal code (line three)
The country (line four)

, Take your letter to the post office and ask for help from one of the associates at the counter. They will be able to weigh the letter, and notify you of the correct postage amount. Pay for the postage and the post office employee will affix the postage stamp to your letter.Your stamp should be placed in the upper right hand corner of your envelope.

, For a formal letter, you’ll need to include a header with your name and address as well as the name and address of the recipient, and the date. You should align your name and address on the left, followed by one line break, then align the recipient’s name and address on the right side of the page. Include an additional line break, then the date, then begin to address the recipient.The format for both your info and that of the recipient should appear as follows: name (line one), house number and street address (line two), postal code and city name (line three), country name (line four).

, If you are writing a letter to France, unless it is to a close personal friend, you should follow the guidelines for formal letter writing. You should address the person by their official title – like Monsieur le Directeur or Madame la Directrice.The French word “cher” is the equivalent of the English “dear.” You can say “Cher Monsieur” for a man, or “Chère Madame” for a female addressee.
If you are writing to more than one person, you can say “Cher Messieurs et Mesdames” – which means “Dear Sirs and Madames.”
If you don’t know the name(s) of the recipients, or you are writing to a group of sorts, you may use “À qui de droit,” which is the French equivalent of “To whom it may concern.”
And remember that if you are writing the letter in French, you should always use the formal “vous,” rather than the informal “tu.”

, Remember that the French are a bit more formal than some English-speaking countries, so a letter to France requires a somewhat formal closing. Be sure to choose a closing remark that fits with the situation.For a very formal or professional situation, you can write “Je vous prie d’agréer, repeat the title as you started your letter, l’expression de mes salutations distinguées.”
For a slightly less formal, but still professional, situation, you can write “Cordialement” (like “Cordially”), or “Bien à vous” (“yours truly”).
For a letter to friends or family members, you can write “Affectueusement” (like “Fondly”) or “Gros bisous” (like “hugs and kisses”).

Consider an adhesive label.,
Lay the envelope flat.,
Arrange the envelope in a landscape orientation.,
Write the sender's address in the top-left corner.,
Write the recipient's address in the center.,
Add optional instructions.,
Place you mail inside the envelope.,
Lift the clasp arms.,
Wet or peel the flap if necessary.,
Push the metal clasps through the hole in the flap.,
Flatten and secure the arms.,
Affix postage.",How to Address Clasp Envelopes," If the clasp on your envelope makes it difficult to write legibly, think about purchasing a sticky address label from a post office or stationary store. You can write on the label on a flat surface, then peel it off and fix it onto the envelope. If you decide to write directly on the envelope, just continue to the next step.


The return address label should be smaller than the main address label.;
, Before placing anything in the envelope, lay it flat with the clasp facing down. Run your hand across the envelope so you can feel where the clasp is.

, Turn the envelope so the flap is on the right side.

, Write your address in fairly small print, so you have plenty of space in the center of the envelope. Use the same address format as you would on a normal letter. This is the standard in the US, and similar format are used for most other countries:Name of Sender
Street Address
Apartment/Suite Number (if needed)
City
State and Postal Code (a.k.a. ZIP code)
Country (for international mail)


, Write the address where you'd like to send the envelope, in the same format. Write this on the same side of the envelope, in large print.


If the clasp is located under the center, feel for it first to plan where to write. To avoid bumps, you might need to write this slightly off-center, or write so the clasp is in between two line of the address.

, If you have extra instructions such as ""Do not bend,"" write them once at the base of the front, and again on the back of the envelope.


If you're not sure whether you need to write ""Air Mail"" or a similar instruction, ask someone at the post office or look up instructions on the post office website.

, Flip the envelope open and slide your mail into the opening. Place the top edge of the document nearest the opening if possible.

, The most common type of clasp envelope has a butterfly clip with two metal arms. Unfold these so they stand straight up. You may need to pry them up using your fingernails.


If your envelope has two circles and a string instead, just close the flap and wrap the string tight around the other circle instead.

, If your envelope has a strip of paper along the edge of the flap, peel this off to reveal the adhesive. If your flap has a lick-able strip, wet this slightly to make it sticky.

, Lower the flap and adjust the metal arms so that they are positioned right beneath the hole. Push the hole over both arms. Seal the flap against the body of the envelope by running over the edge with your thumb.

, Push the clasp arms outward again and flatten them against the flap. To prevent the clasp from catching on other mail, put a piece of tape over the arms.

, Apply the appropriate postage in the upper right hand corner of the envelope, and your envelope is ready to mail. The exact postage required depends on the size and weight of the envelope, as instructed by your local post office. If you can't find instructions, just take the envelope to the post office and pay for postage over-the-counter.

Avoid things like ""To Whom it May Concern"" in cover letters.,
Make sure you get titles correct.",How to Address a Letter to Multiple Recipients," Business letters include a header in the upper lefthand corner. This is a single-spaced list of information about the company and the letter's recipients. When addressing a business letter to multiple recipients, you will still need to include the header.In the top right corner of the letter, you should write the recipient' names first. Write the names using formal titles if necessary (e.g., Dr. Nora Woods), and separate the names by a comma (e.g., Dr. Nora Woods, Dr. Mark Brook).
Then, write the name of the company on the next line (i.e., Penbrook Medical Associates), and on the next line write the company's address. On the last line write the city, the state abbreviation, and the zip code.;
, It may be possible to include all names in the salutation of a business letter. You can use ""Dear"" as your greeting, and proceed to address all the recipients. In a business letter, you end the salutation with a colon rather than a comma.For example, ""Dear. Dr. Nora Woods and Dr. Mark Brook:"".

, However, you may be writing a letter to many, many recipients. In this case, you can include a carbon copy on the bottom of the letter. A carbon copy, or cc, lets others know who else is receiving the letter. You can include a carbon copy somewhere below your signature.A carbon copy is usually marked by the words ""cc"" or ""copies to"", usually followed by a colon.
Multiple recipients are listed using their full names and alphabetically. For example, ""cc: Dr. Mark Brook, Dr. Nora Woods."" If the recipients are from a different business, it's important to include that business's name in parentheses after the names. For example, ""cc: Dr. Mark Brooks (Penbrook Medical Associates), Dr. Nora Woods (Shepherd Medical Hospital).
Keep in mind, the term ""carbon copy"" means there will be copies of the letter circulating. You should make sure, if you're using a carbon copy, all parties listed receive their own copy of the letter. You should not use a carbon copy if you're only sending the letter to one person.

, In rare cases, you may be sending a business letter out to an entire office or a very large group. In this case only, it is appropriate to use an informal word to address the letter. If you're sending a mass e-mail to your entire company, for example, you can write something like, ""Dear Associates"" or ""Dear Colleagues"" if your company consists of well over 10 people. Keep in mind it is always better to get a name, however., Formality makes a big deal in how you address a letter. When sending out a formal invitation, like a wedding invitation, it's custom to use titles like ""Mr."" and ""Mrs."" This is also the case for sending out cover letters. However, if you're sending a casual letter to a close friend or family member, formality matters less. It's appropriate to simply use first names, which may actually be easier when addressing multiple recipients. For example, it's more cumbersome to write ""Dear Mr. Silas Kingsley and Mr. James Knight"" than it is to simply write, ""Dear Silas and James.""

, When addressing a letter to multiple recipients, you're often writing to a married couple. Do some research ahead of time. See whether or not the couple has the same last name, and make sure to address them by the appropriate title in a formal letter.Whose name comes first is somewhat subjective, but some etiquette rules claim if someone has a high ranking title, like doctor, their name should come first. For example, if you're writing to a husband and wife, and the wife has a PhD, you would write, ""Dear Dr. Jacobs and Mr. Jacobs."" You could also write, ""Dear Dr. and Mr. Jacobs.""
If no one has a formal title beyond ""Mr."" or ""Mrs."", you can simply write ""Dear Mr. and Mrs. Jacobs"" or ""Dear Mr. Jacobs and Mrs. Jacobs."" This really depends mostly on your preference. You can also try something like, ""Dear Oliver and Marie Jacobs."" You can also switch up the order of the names. Formal rules of etiquette usually place the man's name first, but this is a largely outdated practice and some people may even take offense.
If a couple has different last names, make sure you acknowledge this in your salutation. For example, ""Dear Mr. Jacobs and Ms. Elliot"" or ""Dear Mr. Oliver Jacobs and Ms. Marie Elliot.""
If this is an informal letter, keep things simple. You can just write ""Dear Marie and Oliver"" or ""Dear Oliver and Marie.""

, If you're writing a letter to a family, consider addressing them as one unit. For example, you can try something like, ""Dear Donahue Family."" This is a salutation often used in holiday cards.You can also try including a couple of names, but not all the names. If you know a couple with a lot of kids, for example, you can try something like, ""Dear Katie, James, and family.""
For smaller families, including the names of everyone can be a nice touch. If it's not too cumbersome, try to include everyone's name. For example, ""Dear Katie, James, Harper, and Brayden.""

, In some cases, you may not know who exactly you're addressing. While it's always ideal to try and get a name, if it's not possible you can use informal words. If you're sending a cover letter to a large literary magazine, you can write ""Dear Editors"" if there are five or six editors that handle submissions. If you're a boss and sending a letter to all your employees, something like ""Dear employees"" is sometimes appropriate.Keep in mind it's always best to get a name. You should only use this approach as a last resort if you're unable to find a specific name.

, In a business letter, you would write the name, then the company name, then the delivery address, and lastly the city, state, and zip code.In a business letter, write the first person's name, then a comma, then their title at the company after the comma. On a new line, write the next person's name, title, and so on.

, If you're sending the letter to one address, try to include all names. In a formal letter, it's best to include full names and titles of all the recipients. However, this is not always possible. It depends on the size of the envelope and your handwriting. If you're able to write small and neat, or working with a larger envelope, it's probably feasible to include all names.For example, you could write something like ""Mr. Oliver Jacobs and Mrs. Marie Jacobs"" as the recipient's name. If you're limited on space, you can try something like, ""Mr. and Mrs. Jacobs.""
Make sure you get titles correct. For example, if Oliver Jacobs has his PhD, write something like ""Dr. Oliver Jacobs and Mrs. Marie Jacobs."" Or ""Dr. and Mrs. Jacobs.""
For more informal letters, do not worry as much about titles. Simply write something like, ""Oliver and Marie Jacobs"" or ""Marie and Oliver Jacobs.""

, If you're sending out a Christmas card, it's usually appropriate to write the family as a single unit. You can write down ""The Jones Family"" on the envelope. As long as you have the address correct, the mail carrier should be able to figure it out.

, If you're mailing a letter to a larger institution, you should usually write down the name of that institution. When applying to grants, scholarships, and so on, there is usually instructions on your application explaining how to address your envelope. Usually, you would write something like, ""Admissions Office at Brown University.""


When sending in submissions to a literary magazine, the magazine's website should provide information on how to address your envelope.

, Some very dated rules of etiquette advise omitting the woman's name when addressing a married couple. You would address a couple as something like, ""Mr .and Mrs. Oliver Jacobs."" While this was once the preferred method of addressing a married couple, it's considered dated by modern standards. Many women find it sexist to have their names omitted in a letter. You should err on the side of caution and avoid omitting a woman's name when addressing a letter or envelope., Many people begin cover letters with something like ""To Whom It May Concern."" You may do this if you find multiple names for the hiring manager. However, it's always better to go with one or two names. Writing ""To Whom It May Concern"" conveys you did not do your research. You can usually figure out a company's hiring manager by browsing their website.If you cannot find any information on hiring managers, use a specific word to address your cover letter. For example, ""Dear Hiring Managers"" would work, or something like, ""Dear Hiring Staff of the Hilton Hotel.""

, When addressing multiple recipients, make sure you get everyone's title correct. Know if someone has a PhD and address them as ""Dr."" If someone is a priest, check to see if they're typically addressed as ""Rev."" When sending out a letter, you want to make sure you're respectful of everyone's titles."

The salutation should be Dear Father. To be even more polite, refer to a priest as His Reverence. If it’s a very formal letter, say, ""The Reverend Father last name as the salutation or Dear Reverend Father.""If you know the priest well, it’s either ""Dear Father or Dear Father last name.""Conclude the letter: ""Respectfully yours in Christ, your name.""You could also end the letter: ""Respectfully yours in Christ, your name."";
, On the envelope, write, ""Rev. first name, middle initial, and last name,"" adding letters designating his Order.


The key difference here is to add the initials of the religious order community, as in,""The Reverend first name last name, O.F.M. or The Reverend Father first name last name, O.F.M."" Example: ""The Reverend Father Leo F. McKenzie, S.J."" In the example, SJ refers to (The Society of Jesus).
The salutation should say: ""Dear Father."" Conclude the letter: ""Respectfully yours in Christ, your name.""

, Address the envelope appropriately; the Pope is the highest leader in the Catholic hierarchy. Address the envelope to ""His Holiness Pope Francis."" It’s also acceptable to address the letter to ""The Sovereign Pontiff, His Holiness Pope Francis.""


The letter’s salutation should say ""Most Holy Father"" or ""Your Holiness."" In personal speech instead of writing, you would address the Pope as Your Holiness. The Pope’s address is: Apostolic Palace, 00120 Vatican City.

Don’t indent your paragraphs. Leave an extra line between each paragraphs. You could also align your name and contact information on the top left of the letter.
Use nice stock paper and matching envelope. Make sure to include your name and return address on the envelope.

, It’s not acceptable to call a priest by his first name, say Father Bob. Instead, you should address a priest as Father Smith or simply Father.In the old days, a priest would be called Your Reverence. You can still do this if you want to be very respectful and traditional.
Of course, if a priest requests that you call him Father Bob, that’s his right. However, it’s considered disrespectful in some circles.

, Stand when a priest enters the room. You should stay standing until the priest suggests that you sit.


If you’re a man, remove your hat in the priest’s presence. Kiss the priest’s hand. This is designed to honor the fact priests consecrate the Holy Eucharist.
Show similar respect when you are leaving the presence of a priest.

If you are using a bubble wrapper, an envelope padded in bubble wrap, or if your package is lumpy, address your envelope before placing the contents inside to ensure that the address is legible.;
, You will be writing the address of the letter’s recipient in the middle of the envelope. Leave enough room for up to nine lines of text in the middle, or middle to lower right hand side of your package. Your stamp will be placed in the upper right hand corner of your envelope.

, Address the person using their title, first name and last name. Or, you can choose to use the initial of their first name.Example of full name: Mr. Jim Stewart
Example with initial: Mr. J. Stewart

, If you are writing a business letter, you should write the name of the company or organization that the recipient belongs to below their own name on the envelope. However, you should only do this if you are writing a business letter--there is no need to write the name of the business if you are writing a personal letter. For example, let’s say the business is British Imports/Exports. Your address would now look like:Mr. Jim Stewart
British Imports/Exports

, This should be written on the line below the business’s name--if you are sending a business letter--or the recipient’s name if you chose not to include a business name. Note that if the building you are sending your letter to has a street number, you do not need to include the building’s name. For example, the building’s name is Pilton House. You would now write:Mr. Jim Stewart
British Imports/Exports
Pilton House

, Write down the street number of the building you are sending the letter to, as well as the street name. To our example address, you would now add:


Mr. Jim Stewart
British Imports/Exports
Pilton House
34 Chester Road

, You only have to do this if there is another street within the post town that has the same name as the street your recipient is located on. If the street you are mailing your letter to is the only street with that name in the post town area, you do not need to include the city or town name. To continue with the Jim Stewart example:Mr. Jim Stewart
British Imports/Exports
Pilton House
34 Chester Road
Greenway End

, The postal town is the main town or city that you are sending your letter to. You must write this name down in all capital letters. For instance, if you were sending your letter to Timperley, you would write:


Mr. Jim Stewart
British Imports/Exports
Pilton House
34 Chester Road
Greenway End
TIMPERLEY

, However, some people prefer to write the county’s name--it all depends on your personal preference. To continue the example, you would write:


Mr. Jim Stewart
British Imports/Exports
Pilton House
34 Chester Road
Greenway End
TIMPERLEY
Altrincham

, Unlike many other countries, England uses a postal code that is made up of both numbers and letters. You can run a search for your recipient's postal code online by using a postal code finder. For example:Mr. Jim Stewart
British Imports/Exports
Pilton House
34 Chester Road
Greenway End
TIMPERLEY
Altrincham
SO32 4NG

, On the last line of the address, write the name of the country you are sending your letter to. In this case, it would be the United Kingdom or England. So, to finish our example, you would write:Mr. Jim Stewart
British Imports/Exports
Pilton House
34 Chester Road
Greenway End
TIMPERLEY
Altrincham
SO32 4NG
England

, Each address will contain different information, depending on whether you are writing a personal or business letter, and whether or not you choose to include the county name. If were to write every piece of information out, you should have:Your recipient’s name, the name of their business or organization, the name of the building, the street address, the village name, the post town name, the county, the post code, and the country’s name.

,How to Write a Letter Asking for an Extension1,
,How to Write a Letter Asking for an Extension2,
"
Write the letter as soon as you can.,
Determine how much extra time you will need.,
Be aware of the existing rules.,
Include a sound explanation for your request.,
Provide a few carefully chosen details as part of your request.,
Stay positive in tone and content.,
Proofread your letter prior to submitting it.",How to Write a Letter Asking for an Extension3," As soon as you know you will need an extension, immediately begin preparing your letter. You need to give the recipient as much time as possible to make a decision about your situation. You also want to appear prepared, despite asking for an adjustment to the schedule.

, Consider all factors and submit a realistic request. If you ask for too little time, you may need to request another extension. Missing deadlines should be avoided whenever possible. So, it’s best to overestimate a little.


Depending on the situation, you might need to consider your letter as part of an ongoing negotiation. In that sense, it is better to ask for a longer amount of time so that you can compromise and meet in the middle.Gauge your pace based upon your current progress and what parts of the project have yet to be completed. For example, if you have worked on a consulting project for three months you should have a pretty good sense of how much is left to do.
Be aware of the time constraints facing the recipient as well. They may be under their own deadlines that will now need to be pushed back. For example, college professors are often required to submit midterm grades and schedule their paper deadlines accordingly.

, Verify the current deadline before you ask for it to be altered. You don’t want to appear disorganized by requesting an extension when you don’t understand the current situation. For example, some government entities require that you submit your request within 24 hours of initial contact with them. If this doesn’t work for you, then you can always cite the tight turn-around schedule., You are taking the time to craft the letter and your recipient will then take the time to read it, so make it worthwhile. Carefully consider your true reason for needing the extension and honestly convey this to your reader. Don’t lie or exaggerate as this will only hurt your case.


A good reason might be the desire to be thorough or cautious in your work. For instance, if you are completing a project that could potentially impact the safety of others, pointing this fact out when asking for extra time could work in your favor.
If you have multiple reasons for your request, choose the best one and focus on it. For example, if you are delaying a job offer you might want to tell them that you would like to conduct additional research into the transfer costs (if this is indeed true) instead of letting them know that you are also waiting on another offer., Details will give your letter a sense of legitimacy and craftsmanship. This is especially important if you are submitting your letter to a government panel or some other group that you have never met personally.For example, if your grandfather dies two days before your college essay is due, it is best to describe the incident as a “family emergency” as opposed to a general “emergency.” You may also want to mention his passing and some information about your travel arrangements.Have your paperwork in order before submitting any request. You may need to lay out a timeline of prior actions and applications, especially if dealing with the government or another official entity. Showing that you have followed all steps of the process up until this point can only work in your favor., No one wants to read a letter that is one whiny line after another. Instead, describe negative events quickly and concisely and move on to the positive solution that you propose. For example, if you think that an initial salary offer is too low, you might write, ""I need more time to consider your offer. I do, however, think that a higher salary would allow me to do my job more efficiently.""

, Give yourself at least a few minutes to read over your letter before you send it off. Look for editorial mistakes and typos. Run the grammar and spell checking software on your computer. Send it off to a trusted friend for a quick second read through. Don’t rush or skip this process or you will appear sloppy and it could impact the final outcome."
"
Prepare a header section.,
Employ a formal and full salutation.,
Use a concise paragraph format.,
Pay attention to your concluding remarks.,
Include your full name and signature.",How to Write a Letter Asking for an Extension4," The date should go in the upper right corner of the page. Skip one line below it and then type out your address, also justified to the right. Then, skip another line and place your recipient’s full address flush with the left hand side of the page.


If you are sending your request via email, you can omit the date and address portions and start with your salutation. However, make sure to use an effective and clear subject line. For example, if you are emailing a professor, your subject line might read, ""Mike Smith HIST 359 Paper Extension Request.""

, Start my typing “Dear” and then follow with their title and last name. For example, “Dear Mr. Brady” or “Dear Ms. Smith.” Some titles can be more complicated, such as “Dear Professor Montgomery” or “Dear Senator Smith.”


Even if you know them informally, this is an official request so keep the tone and content formal. Do not write “Hi, Jim,” for example.
Try to find some specific person that you can address your letter to. Otherwise, it can appear like a form letter. For example, “Dear Senator Smith,” is preferable to, “To Whom It May Concern.”, The body of your letter should be somewhere between 1-3 paragraphs. In many cases, you can open with 1-2 lines, explain your request in 2-4 lines, and conclude in 1-2 lines. If you need to expand to a full three paragraphs, simply separate the introduction, body, and conclusion.


To open your letter you might state, “I am John Smith a student in your HIST 456 MWF morning class.” This will jog your professor’s memory and save them time looking you up.

, Don’t disregard the importance of a solid conclusion. Use your final sentences to restate your case (in one line) and to thank them for their time. You might write, “I appreciate your consideration of my request.”


It is best to close with an official “sign off” before your name. Some of the better options are: “Sincerely” “Best” “All the Best” “Best Regards.”If you need a reply by a certain time, you should include that information at this point as well. You can always pair it with your thanks. For example, “Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you next week.” Just be careful not to appear overly pushy., Below the “Sincerely,” leave 3-4 lines blank. Then, type your full name and justify it to the left. Use the blank space to sign your name in pen. If you plan to email your letter, you can delete those spaces and go directly to a typed name."
"
Make or save a copy of your letter.,
Place it in the standard mail.,
Email your extension request.,
Make a phone call instead of writing.",How to Write a Letter Asking for an Extension5," As soon as you’ve proofread your draft, and prior to sending it off, take a photo (transfer to pdf), save a draft online, or make a traditional copy of your letter. You may also want to write down the mail off date if it doesn’t match the one at the top of the letter. File this copy somewhere safe for your personal record.

, Take your letter to the local post office, give it to your mail carrier, or drop it in a post box. If you want more assurance that your letter was received you can always request extra tracking services for an additional fee.


If you are going to mail off a hard copy of your letter, make sure to print it out using a high quality printer with a good ink cartridge. A handwritten extension request is generally not acceptable., This is the probably the best way to send your request as it requires little time and is very reliable. Verify your recipient’s email address before sending and include your identification number, if relevant, in the subject line.


Your recipient may be able to see the exact time that you sent the email. Be aware of this if you like to send off emails very late at night.
Keep your email formal and that includes the address that you use as well. Send this email from a professional-sounding account. For example, sending a work email from “John.k.Smith@yahoo.com” is appropriate.
If you send your letter via fax, make sure to hold on to the confirmation page showing that your transmission was successfully sent and received., If your need for an extension is urgent or very last minute, you may be better served by talking to them in person or by calling. If this is the situation, continue to act formally and state your case in an organized way.

Explore your own feelings.,
Communicate any unresolved feelings in writing.,
Accept the apology through a letter.,
Finalize the letter.,
Mail or email the apology acceptance letter.,
Determine the future of the relationship.",How to Accept an Apology in Writing,"


Read or listen to the apology carefully. If the issue is emotionally charged, it can be easy to get distracted and miss important details in the apology. Focus intently on what the person is communicating.
Gauge the sincerity of the apology. Evaluate whether the offender seems truly sorry and accepts responsibility for his mistakes. Also examine the tone of the message.;
, Determine whether or not the apology is emotionally satisfying. Decide whether you are ready to forgive or if you feel unresolved anger or pain.

,


Express any unresolved anger or pain in a letter. You can only accept an apology if your feelings are truly resolved. Limit discussion to your feelings and facts. Avoid focusing on general weaknesses and character flaws that the person cannot change overnight.
Ask for time to process feelings. If you are not ready to accept the apology, let the person know that you have unresolved feelings and will get back to him.

,


Write that you accept the apology if you are ready to forgive. Express your appreciation and gratitude for the sincerity of the apology.
Summarize the events in your letter. Briefly recount the facts of the event, your feelings during the process and how you are feeling now.

,

, To limit misunderstandings should the email or letter get lost, ask the recipient or the mail service to confirm receipt.

,


Evaluate your feelings about the relationship. You may have forgiven the person and want to continue the relationship. If so, put the events behind you and focus on other things in future communications.

End the relationship if it is one you cannot continue. You may forgive the wrongdoing, but are not interested in continuing with the relationship. In this case, your apology acceptance letter may be your last communication with the person.

"
Begin by listing your contact information at the top of the page.,
Explain the purpose of the letter in a few words.,
Begin the actual letter with a polite greeting followed by the proper name of the recipient.,
Introduce yourself and explain why you are submitting the income verification letter.,
Provide details about your basic income.,
Mention any additional income you have, in addition to your basic employment.,
Finish this section by summarizing your total income and suggesting how it will be sustained or increase in the future.,
Include a note at the end signaling that there is additional paperwork included with your letter.,
Thank the reader for their time and consideration.,
Type ""Enclosure"" under your name.,
Include a disclaimer such as, ""all of the information above is true to the best of my knowledge.,
Sign the letter by hand, if you are sending a printed copy.,
Have your income letter notarized by an official notary public.,
Enclose copies of check stubs as income documentation.,
Enclose copies of tax returns as income documentation.,
Provide documentation for other types of income.",How to Write a Letter for Proof of Income," This should include the name, address, telephone number and email address of the entity responsible for preparing the verification of income, in this case you.


If you are self-employed, you should include your business name and information.
This information should be positioned at the top left of the page. Separate it from the next section by inserting one blank line below it.

, You should do this in memo format under the contact information. For example: ""RE: income letter.""


This brief blurb about the subject of your letter will help your reader quickly understand that they need to continue reading, as the subject is important.

, For example, you may say, ""Dear Mr. Williams,"" or ""To Ms. Mayer.""


If you are not sure who the letter should be officially addressed to, use the standard, ""To Whom It May Concern.""
It's important to keep your greetings businesslike and official. This letter is not a casual one, so don't begin it with a casual tone.

, For example, you may say, ""My name is John Homebuyer. The purpose of this letter is to accompany my mortgage application, in order to substantiate my worthiness for loan approval.""


This quick summary is important to provide. This may be one of many such letters that your reader reads in a day. You need to tell them the point of your letter quickly and succinctly, so as not to waste their time.

, You should outline how much money you make, how you make your money, how long you have been making that much money, and how long you anticipate being able to maintain the same (or greater) income.


For example, you may start this portion of the income letter by saying, ""I am self-employed as a freelance photographer. I have been in this line of work for the past 12 years, and self-employed for the past 6 years.
Do not embellish your income or give incorrect information in this section. The person you are writing to will probably independently verify that the information you are giving it true, so don't get caught lying. This could jeopardize the services you are requesting.

, This could include a variety of items such as annuities, pensions, government benefits, or gifts. Make clear how much and how often you receive this income.


For instance, you can simply state ""Additionally, I receive a monthly pension from ABC Technology of $500. This pension is a guaranteed income for the rest of my life.""
The person you are writing to may verify this income as well. Be sure that the information you are giving them is correct. Otherwise, it might cause a problem for the service you are requesting, such as a loan.

, The suggestions for how it will change should be based in fact, for instance trends over time in changes to your income. Do not simply state your hopes for future income.


Here is an example of what this could look like: ""My current employment income is approximately $45,000 annually, and my pension payment is $600 per month. As my business income has increased by an average of 5 percent each year, I can expect to be able to maintain this growth in the foreseeable future. As well, my pension payments are scheduled to continue for the next 15 years.""

, You can transition into this easily by simply requesting that the reader examine the enclosed documentation, which must support the claims you make in your letter.


Including this note will help insure that the person receiving your letter will know that you have included supplementary documentation.

, Then close your letter with a formal closing salutation followed by your full name.


""Sincerely"" is a common formal closing salutation used in letters such as this.
If you are planning on printing out the letter, you may want to leave two blank lines between your formal closing salutation and your name. This will give you room so that you can sign it by hand, right above your typed name., This will indicate the supporting documentation you included with the letter.

,""This is optional but shows that you are taking the seriousness of this letter and your request for funding earnestly.

, If you are sending this letter electronically you will not be able to sign it by hand.


Remember, you left two blank lines between your closing salutation and your typed name if you planned on printing your letter. Then, once printed, this is where you insert your signature.

, This will help ensure it is recognized as an official document by the institution you are submitting it to.


You can find your closest notary public by searching online. There is even an official database of notary publics across the US.However, it is usually a good bet that there is one available at your local banking or governmental institution.
Notary publics will probably charge you a small fee for their services. This is, after all, their business.

, As there are many different forms of income, there are also different types of documentation you may need to include. Check stubs are a good way to prove the steadiness of your current income.


In the modern era, with electronic payrolls, you may not actually get check stubs. Direct deposit records should work well as income documentation if you do not have actual check stubs.

, Tax returns are a good way to document your income over time.


Tax records may be helpful if you have changed jobs recently, as they can show that you have consistently made an income, despite changes in employment.
If you are self-employed, you may need to submit a variety of documents as your verification of income, including bank statements, tax forms and a financial statement from your accountant.

, This may include social security income, pensions, or retirements.The Social Security Administration will provide you with an appropriate proof of income letter, if applicable.You can also include documentation of employment insurance benefits as proof of income."

Post the letter.",How to Write a Business Letter," Whatever the content of your letter, there are a few business standards to follow regarding the way it looks. Business letters should be typed and composed in a common font such as Arial or Times New Roman. Employ block paragraphing. This means that you start a new paragraph by hitting ""return"" twice. Don’t use indenting for block paragraphs.Use one-inch margins on all sides.
An emailed business letter should also be composed in a common font. Don't use script or colors other than black and white in a business email.

, The letter should be printed on 8.5” by 11” (known as “letter size”). If you are outside the U.S., you might use size A4 paper. Some lengthy contracts may be printed on 8.5” x 14” (“legal size”).


If you're printing the letter to send, consider printing the letter on company letterhead. This lends it a more professional air and provides your company's logo and contact information.

, List your company name and the company address, with each part of the address written on a different line. If you're self-employed or an independent contractor, add your name either in place of the company name or above it.


If your company has pre-designed letterhead, you can use this instead of typing out your company and address.
If you're typing out the address, it should appear either right or left justified at the top of the page, depending on you and your company's preference.
If you’re sending the letter to an international location, type out the country in capital letters., Writing out the full date is the most professional choice. For example, write either ""April 1, 2012"" or ""1 April 2012."" This should appear left justified a few lines below the sender's address.


If you wrote your letter over several days, use the date that you finished the letter., Write out the recipient's full name, title (if applicable), company name, and address in that order, with each piece of information on a separate line. If necessary, include a reference number. The recipient's information should be left justified a few lines below the date.


It is best to address the letter to a specific person. This way, an actual person will be able to respond to your letter. If you don’t know the name of the person to whom you should send the letter, do a bit of research. Call the company to find out the person’s name and title., The salutation is an important indicator of respect, and which one you use will depend on whether you know the person to whom you're writing, how well you know them and the level of formality in your relationship.Consider the following options:


Employ ""To Whom It May Concern"" only if you don't know whom, specifically, you're addressing.
If you do not know the recipient well, ""Dear Sir/Madam"" is a safe choice.
You may also use the recipient's title and last name, e.g. ""Dear Dr. Smith.""
If you know the recipient well and enjoy an informal relationship with him or her, you may consider a first-name address, e.g. ""Dear Susan.""
If you are unsure of the recipient's gender, simply type the whole name, e.g. ""Dear Kris Smith.""
Don't forget a comma after a salutation or a colon after “To Whom It May Concern.”

, Time is money, as the saying goes, and most business people hate to waste time. The tone of your letter, therefore, should be brief and professional. Make your letter a quick read by diving straight into the matter and keeping your comments brief in the first paragraph. For instance, you can always start with ""I am writing you regarding..."" and go from there.


Don't concern yourself with flowery transitions, big words, or lengthy, meandering sentences - your intent should be to communicate what needs to be said as quickly and cleanly as possible.
Be persuasive in your letter. Most likely the purpose of your letter is to persuade your reader to do something: change their mind, correct a problem, send money or take action. Make your case.

, It is perfectly fine to use “I,” “we,” and “you” in your business letter. Refer to yourself as “I” and your reader as “you.”


Be aware if you’re writing the letter on an organization’s behalf. If you are stating the company’s perspective, you should use “we” so that the reader knows that the company stands behind your statement. If you are writing your own opinion, stick with “I.”, Let your reader know exactly what you are trying to say. Your reader will only respond quickly if your meaning is crystal clear. In particular, if there is some result or action you want taken because of your letter, state what it is. Explain your position in as few words as possible.

, When describing a situation or making a request, make sure to choose the active voice, rather than the passive voice. The passive voice can make your writing ambiguous or impersonal. In addition, the active voice is more streamlined and straight to the point.For example:


Passive: The sunglasses are not designed or manufactured with attention to their durability.
Active: Your company designs and manufactures sunglasses without attention to their durability.

, Letters are written by people to people. Avoid form letters if possible. You cannot build a relationship with canned impersonal letters. However, stay away from colloquial language or slang such as ""you know,"" ""I mean,"" or ""wanna."" Keep the tone businesslike, but be friendly and helpful.


If you know the recipient well, it's fine to include a friendly line sending good wishes.
Use your judgement when determining how much personality to reveal. Sometimes adding a little humor is actually helpful in a business setting, but err on the side of caution before making a joke.

, Even if you are writing with a complaint or concern, you can be courteous. Consider the recipient's position and offer to do whatever you can, within reason, to be accommodating and helpful.


For example, a discourteous complaint might read: “I think your sunglasses suck and I am never buying them again.” A courteous complaint might read: “I am disappointed with the construction of your sunglasses, and I plan to take my business elsewhere in the future.”

, Most business letters should be concise enough to be one page in length only. But if you have something lengthier, such as a contract or legal findings, you may need additional pages. Use “second page” letterhead, which usually has an abbreviated address and is made of the same type of paper as the first page letterhead.Include the page number on the second and subsequent pages, at the top of the page. You may also want to include the recipient’s name and the date., In the last paragraph, summarize your points and clearly outline either your planned course of action or what you expect from the recipient. Note that the recipient may contact you with questions or concerns, and say thank you for his or her attention to the letter/matter at hand.

, The closing, like the salutation, is an indicator of respect and formality. ""Yours sincerely"" or ""Sincerely"" is generally a safe bet; also consider ""Cordially,"" ""Respectfully,"" ""Regards"" and ""Yours Truly."" Slightly less formal but still professional closings include ""All the best,” “Best wishes,"" ""Warm regards,"" and ""Thank you."" Use a comma after your closing.

, Leave about four lines empty for your signature. Sign the letter after you've printed it, or, if you're sending it via email, scan an image of your signature and affix it to this part of the letter. Blue or black ink is preferred.


If you are signing the letter on someone’s behalf, write “pp:” before your signature. This stands for “per procurationem,” which means “by agency” or “on behalf of.”, Beneath your signature, type your name, title, phone number, email address and any other applicable means of contact. Give each piece of information its own line.

, If someone other than the writer typed up the letter, you should add this person’s initials below the signature block. Sometimes, the letter writer’s initials are also included. Then it is clear who worked on this letter.


For example, if you include just the typist’s initials, write them in lowercase: mj
If you include the writer’s initials, put these in uppercase with the typist’s initials in lowercase: RW:mj. Some styles add a slash between the two sets of initials: RW/mj.

, If you've enclosed additional documents for the recipient to review, note this a few lines beneath your contact info by noting the number and type of documents. For example, write: ""Enclosures (2): resume, brochure.""You can also abbreviate “Enclosures” by writing “Encl.” or “Enc.”

, If you are sending a copy of the letter to another person, you should include this on the letter. This is noted by typing “cc:” below the “Enclosures” line, which stands for “courtesy copy”, along with the person’s name and title (“cc” used to indicate “carbon copy” when letters were typed on carbon copy paper).For example, write: “cc: Mary Smith, Vice President of Marketing”
If you are adding more than one name, align the second name underneath the first name, but without the “cc:”

, Presentation is a key element of being professional. Make sure that the recipient will easily be able to see you as capable and in charge by editing your letter for errors. Run spell check on your word processor, but also give the letter a thorough read before you send it.


Ask yourself whether the letter is clear and concise. Are any paragraphs more than three or four sentences long? If so, determine whether you can eliminate unnecessary statements.
If the letter is extremely important, you might want to have a friend or colleague look it over. Sometimes a second pair of eyes can help you catch errors or awkward wording you may not have noticed.

, If you have multiple pages, staples are generally avoided. If you want to ensure that the papers stay in order, then use a paperclip at the top left corner.

, If you're sending the letter via post, use a business envelope. If available, use one with the company logo printed on it. Neatly print your return address and the recipient's address. Fold the letter into third parts, such that the recipient will first unfold the top flap, then the bottom flap. Make sure you affix sufficient postage, and send it off.


If you feel like your handwriting is messy and doesn't match your professional persona, type the addresses in your word processor and run the envelope through your printer.
If the letter is extremely important and/or time-sensitive, consider having it delivered by courier.
If you want to email the letter, convert the letter in HTML or save it as a PDF to preserve formatting. It is better, however, to send the physical letter.

Know your friend's situation.,

Be open about what makes you uncomfortable.,
Remain aware of boundaries.,
Be open about what is happening in your life.,

Make sure they know you value their friendship.,

Sign off with a friendly farewell.",How to Write a Letter to a Friend of the Opposite Sex," Open communication is key. If your friend is single and looking for a relationship, it is important to know this. Likewise, if you or they are in a committed relationship, it is important to know one another's boundaries. If you clearly understand one another's intentions and goals, you can be aware of potential missteps.;
, According to researchers, men and women share 99% identical genetic code. However, this 1% difference can cause differences in perception and communication. For example, on average, women talk faster and use more words daily. Being aware of differences in conversation pace and your volume of words can help bridge a gap between inter-gender communication styles. This can also help your friend feel more at ease.
A recent study showed men and women viewed their inter-gender friendships differently. For example, men are more likely to be attracted to a female friend, and think the attraction is mutual. Knowing these perceptual differences can help avoid unwanted advances and create awareness that each friend may potentially view the relationship differently.

, If your friend is using language or gestures that make you feel uncomfortable, make sure to tell them. This sort of open communication can do wonders to saving your friendship over the long term. , Although you want to communicate open and freely with your friend, be aware that friendships with the opposite sex have added complications, such as potential tension or physical attractions. In order for it to work, both friends need to be aware that you see one another as siblings or good friends and nothing more. Do not put anything in your letter that might be suggestive of physical attraction or any other lines that cross friendship lines. Avoid flirting. Although many guys and girls flirt with one another, for the good of your friendship you should avoid this.

, Filling one another in on what is happening in your life will not only help you forge a closer friendship, it will also help avoid any miscommunications about your intentions. This sort of exchange also helps build up your friendship and reaffirm the value of platonic involvement in one another's lives.


Let them know if you've met someone special. One way to create an awkward moment is for you to keep a new romance from your friend. Let him or her know that you're going on a date, or that you had one that was successful and hope this one will be a keeper. Not only does it keep your friend in the loop of your life, but it also cements the notion that you are friends and only that.

, You and your friend no doubt have built your relationship on a history of interactions. It will make for a nice letter if you reference things you both have in common, whether it is a hometown, college, or anything else. It will also be helpful in reminding them why your friendship has lasted and show an intimacy only friends can have.

, If there are any doubts about your intentions, you can clear them up by communicating why you are happy to be friends. Tell them they give great advice, or that you feel comfortable telling them things so that they know what aspects of your friendship you value.


Inter-gender friendships can have benefits that intra-gender friendships do not. You may talk to your girl/boy platonic friend about things that girls or guys do not typically talk to one another. For example, maybe you and your guy friends talk a lot about sports; but not feelings. Your letter is a chance to focus on things that make your friendship special.

, If you have a significant other, try to keep complaints about them to a minimum. While relationship griping is part of a normal friendship, inter-gender relationships should be aware of potential implications. Your friend may interpret your relationship as unhappy and mistake your availability.If you're having relationship problems, talk to one of your same gender friends about it and leave it out of the letter. If you do talk about it with your friend of the opposite sex, it would be best to do in person where you are less likely to miscommunicate.

, Language is very important. Do not use language that is reserved for relationships such as terms of endearment like ""honey,"" or ""dear"". Also avoid any suggestive or sexual language that may make your friend think you have interests beyond platonic friendship.

, After saying hello to your friend, you should be sure to fill your letter with interesting tidbits about your life. This will help keep your friendship strong by creating a bond on involvement in one another's life. Be sure to avoid ambiguous language and also ask questions and make comments showing you are interested in their lives.

, Don't gush or get overly sentimental, even if you are really missing your friend - keep it positive and light. ""Miss you, buddy,"" is great. Or ""XOXO,"" even, but just make sure you don't leave the letter ambiguous with a sign-off of affection that could be interpreted the wrong way.

Save the template so that you can use it again.",How to Write a Memo," State that this document is a memorandum at the outset. Label the page “MEMORANDUM” 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from the top of the page. Put the word in bold on the first line. You can either center it on this line or left-align it. You might also choose to make the font larger for this word.Double space between this line and the next line of the heading.

, A memo is a formal business communication, and you should address the reader formally as well. Use a full name and title of the person to whom you are sending the memo.If you are sending a memo to the entire staff, you might write: “TO: All Employees.”

, The “CC” line indicates who will receive a “Courtesy Copy” of the memo. This is not the person to whom the memo is directed. Rather, this is someone who may need to stay informed about policies or issues that you’re addressing in the memo.

, The heading needs to include who is writing and sending the memo. Your full name and job title go in this line.

, Write the complete date, spelling out the month and including the date and year. For example, write: “DATE: January 5, 2015” or “DATE: 5 January 2015.”

, The subject line gives the reader an idea of what the memo is about. Be specific but concise.For example, instead of writing, “Ants,” for the subject, be more specific by writing, “Ant Problem in the Office.”

, The heading should be at the top of the page, aligned to the left-hand side of the page. Capitalize the words “TO:”, “FROM:”, “DATE:”, and “SUBJECT:”.


A sample heading would look like:
TO: Name and job title of the recipient
FROM: Your name and job title
DATE: Complete date when the memo was written
SUBJECT: (or RE:) What the memo is about (highlighted in some way)
When constructing the heading, be sure to double space between sections and align the text.
You may choose to add a line below the heading that goes all the way across the page. This will separate the heading from the body of the memo.

, In order to get people to read and respond to the memo, it’s important to tailor the tone, length, and level of formality of the memo to the audience who will be reading it. Doing this effectively requires that you have a good idea of who the memo is intended for.


Think about your audience’s priorities and concerns are.
Try to anticipate any questions your readers might have. Brainstorm some content for the memo, such as examples, evidence, or other information that will persuade them.
Considering the audience also allows you to be sensitive to including any information or sentiments that are inappropriate for your readers.

, A memo does not begin with a salutation like “Dear Mr. Edwards.” Instead, dive right into your opening segment that introduces the matter you’re discussing in the memo., Briefly give them the context behind the action you wish them to take. This is somewhat like a thesis statement, which introduces the topic and states why it matters. You might also consider the introduction as an abstract, or a summary of the entire memo.As a general guideline, the opening should take up about one paragraph., All employees will receive health coverage and will make a minimum of $15 per hour.”

, Your reader may need some background information about the issue you’re addressing. Give some context, but be brief and only state what is necessary.If it’s relevant, continue your memo by stating why the policy is being implemented. For example, you might write: “The county government voted to require all employees in the county to receive a $15/hour minimum wage.”

, Give a short summary of the actions that will be implemented. Give evidence and logical reasons for the solutions you propose. Start with the most important information, then move to specific or supporting facts. State how the readers will benefit from taking the action you recommend, or be disadvantaged through lack of action.


Feel free to include graphics, lists, or charts, especially in longer memos. Just be sure they are truly relevant and persuasive.For longer memos, consider writing short headings that clarify the content of each category. For example, instead of stating ""Policies,"" write ""New policies regarding part-time employees."" Be specific and brief in every heading so that the basic point of your memo is apparent to the reader right away.

, A memo is a call for action on a particular issue, whether it is an announcement about a new company product, new policies regarding expense reports, or a statement about how the company is addressing a problem. Restate the action that the reader should take in the closing paragraph or sentence.


For example, you might write, “All employees must use the new accounting system by June 1, 2015.”
This can also include some evidence to back up your recommendations. 


, The memo’s final paragraph should restate the next steps to address the issue at hand. It should also include a warm note that reiterates the solidarity of the organization. You might write, ""I will be glad to discuss these recommendations with you later on and follow through on any decisions you make.""
You might end with something like, “We are excited about the expansion of this product line. We’re confident that this will grow our business and make this company a more sustainable business.”
This should generally be one to two sentences in length.


, Use a standard format for your memo to ensure that it is easy to read. Use a 12-point font such as Times New Roman or Arial. Use one-inch margins on the left, right and bottom sides.


Use block style paragraphs. Double space between paragraphs. Do not indent each paragraph.

, Review and edit your memo to make sure that it is clear, concise, persuasive, and free of errors. Check that you are consistent in the type of language that you use. Eliminate unnecessary scholarly words or technical jargon.


Review for spelling, grammar, and content errors. Pay particular attention to names, dates, or numbers.
Check that it is not excessively long, and cut out any extraneous material. 


, A memo does not include a signature line. But you should initial the memo with a pen in the header. Write your initials next to your name. This indicates that you have approved the memo., You may have special letterhead designed for memos, or you might use regular business letterhead.


If you are creating a digital document (to use for emailing, for example), you might want to create your own letterhead in a Word document that has your company logo and basic contact information. Use this as your memo template for every memo you send out.

, Determine the best way to distribute your memo. You may want to print out hard copies of the memo and distribute it this way. You may also send it via email.


If you send your memo via email, you might want to format your email in HTML. Alternately, you can save your memo as a PDF and attach it to your email.

, Consider whether you want to use a template instead of writing a memo from scratch. If so, your first course of action should be to search online for some good memo templates. Microsoft Word also has memo templates. Templates generally all share the same basic formatting, but they may use different fonts, sizes, and designs.


Download the template that best fits your needs.
Be sure to read the terms of use before using any templates from a web source.

, After you have pressed the download button, the template will automatically download into your computer or may take few steps to start the download. It is downloaded as a zip file, so you need to unzip the file and then open it in Microsoft Word.


It’s a good idea to use the latest version of Microsoft Word in order to ensure that you will not run into any unforeseen software problems and that the template will operate as it was designed to function. If you are operating on an older version of Microsoft Word, simply update your software before downloading any templates.

, Keep in mind that everything on the template is changeable. You can customize every part of the memo template to fit your particular needs. For instance, you can add your logo and copyright sign in the header section of the template. Just click on the header section and type in your company’s information.

, Be sure to fill in the ""TO"" and ""FROM"" fields, as well as ""CC"" and ""SUBJECT” fields. Use caution when filling these fields to ensure that you have not skipped over any field, leaving some of them blank, or that you have not made an error in typing somewhere along the way.

, Write the introduction, context, discussion and summary parts of your memo in the body. If you want, you can use bullet points or lists to organize information.


Maintain the template’s formatting. This will ensure that your paragraph alignment is proper and you have the correct margins and font size.
If necessary, you can even customize the memo to use a table. This is sometimes a good idea, especially if using a bullet list or something similar makes the memo look too crowded or difficult to read.
Make sure that you have deleted any words that were already in the template. Also, carefully proofread your memo before sending it.

, The footer is the space at the bottom of the page that often has additional information. You might include your company information or personal contact information here. It is important that you take the time to ensure that this information is correct. The last thing you want to happen is to write an excellent memo and then have incorrect contact information or have that information missing altogether.

, One of the most appealing things about the template is that you can even change the color of the document. This allows you to exercise a certain degree of personality and makes the entire document stand out more precisely. It also allows you to choose a color that is appropriate for the situation at hand in order to ensure that the memo is visually striking, yet professional.

, Be sure to save a copy of this memo. Then you will have a digital backup document that provides proof of your business communication.

, Whenever you need to use the memo for a slightly different subject in the future, simply change each field to suit the particular memo subject. This will save you time and will also help you create a consistent memo that is professional and that will get the attention of people so the memo will be read in a prompt manner.

Keep a copy of the letter.",How to Make an Authorization Letter," An authorization letter gives another person the right to act on your behalf in specific matters. They are primarily used in circumstances in which the letter writer is not able to represent themselves. A few examples of situations that may require an authorization letter include:


A parent or guardian may grant child care workers authorization to make basic emergency medical decisions regarding the children in their care.It is advisable to give an authorization letter for minors traveling with adults who are not their parents or guardians. This will protect the minor from child trafficking and child custody issues.If you have money held in a regional bank that you can no longer easily access, you may need to write a letter of authorization to allow someone else to handle issues that arise with the account or financial institution.
An authorization letter can allow release of personal information, such as medical records.You may also need to authorize another party to act on your behalf to handle especially fast-moving financial transactions. Not every business deal can wait for you; if you are temporarily indisposed, you can write a letter of authorization and temporarily grant decision-making powers to a trusted colleague.

, There are three parties involved in an authorization letter. The first party is the original rights holder, such as the parent of a child or the owner of a bank account. The second party is the group or individual with whom the first party is conducting a transaction, such as a financial institution or hospital. The third party is the person selected to act as a proxy in the first party’s absence. The letter should be addressed to the second party.


The letter will explain the rights granted to the proxy who will be acting in your place.If the second party is not known (especially in cases where authority was granted for potential emergency situations), you will have to address the letter simply ""To whom it may concern.""

, A handwritten letter may be difficult to read and isn't as professional in appearance as a typed letter. The authorization letter is an important document authorizing someone to hold your legal or financial powers for you. It must be prepared to meet scrutiny. If someone else close to you wants to dispute the authority of the letter holder, the document may be used as evidence in a court of law.

, Follow the standard format of a business letter. Your name should be on the first line, your street information on the second line, and your city, state and zip code on the third line. All lines (including those that follow) should be single spaced., After your name and address, skip one line and place the current date on the next line. Write out the full date (such as February 2, 2015, for example). Do not abbreviate the date.

, Leave one blank line between the date and first part of the recipient's name and address. The receiver's information should be in the same format as your information.


Keep in mind that the recipient is not the same as the one authorized to make decisions for you. You are granting authority to a third party (a proxy) to act on your behalf, but the letter should be addressed to second party (the one with whom you and your proxy are dealing).You may have to leave this portion blank if you do not know the party with which you will be dealing. For example, if you have granted emergency medical powers over your child to a child care worker in case you cannot be reached, you may not know which hospital your proxy will have to deal with.

, Use the appropriate titles, such as ""Dr.,"" ""Ms.,"" ""Mrs.,"" or ""Mr.,"" rather than using first names. The salutation may open with ""Dear,"" or more formally just the word ""To.""


Use the full name and title of the person to whom the letter is addressed.
If you do not know the specific name of the party with whom your proxy will be dealing, write ""To whom it may concern.""

, Longer letters will include more information that can be interpreted in different ways. Brief letters that specifically address the matter with as little extra verbiage as possible are less likely to lead to conflicting interpretations.

, Make sure your authorization letter is concise and precise. You need to give specific details about the authorization you are granting. For example, your representative can authorize a medical procedure, sign legal documents in your absence, or withdraw funds from your bank. For example, start out the authorization letter with:


I, (insert your full name), hereby authorize (insert proxy’s full name) to release to (insert the organization that will receive your medical records), the following medical information from my personal medical records: (list the medical information here).Give very specific details for this authorization. If the letter is regarding your medical information, include your medical insurance number and claim information. If you need assistance regarding a legal matter, include the case number. For financial matters, include the applicable account information.

, Specify when this authorization is in effect. Give the beginning and ending dates. For example, you might write, “The proxy has authorization to make medical decisions for my child while staying at (address) from September 1, 2015 to September 15, 2015.”


In some cases, you may be unsure of the dates, such as if you are authorizing in case of an emergency. For this type of authorization, specify a length of time. For example, you might write, “In the event of an emergency, the proxy has authorization to act on my behalf for 30 days.”

, Explain why you need a representative to act on your behalf. The explanation might indicate that you are ill, out of town, or may not be able to be reached for certain periods of time.

, You may also want to identify the areas that you are not authorizing. For example, you might say that the proxy is not allowed to use your medical information for any other purpose than specified in the letter. Or, you might say that the proxy is not allowed to make certain financial decisions on your behalf without prior written consent., Finish up the letter with a closing word such as “Sincerely.” Leave four blank lines, which is where you’ll put your handwritten signature, and then type your full name.

, A letter of authorization is a business letter and should be formal in tone and format. Standard business letters use a block format. The body should be single-spaced, and there should be no indentation of the paragraphs. Instead a blank line between the salutation and the first paragraph as well as between paragraphs., A witness is someone who will observe you signing the authorization letter. This ensures that you are not signing the letter under duress, and that you are in fact the person giving the authorization. In some instances, it is a good idea to have your letter notarized by a notary public.This person is someone authorized by your state to attest to legal documents.


This person should not be anyone named in the letter.

, Print out the letter and sign it with blue or black ink. You may choose to include a date line next to your signature. If so, write the date that you sign the document.


Have your witness sign and date the letter as well, or ask the notary public to notarize the letter.

, In most cases, the proxy will retain the letter so that he or she has proper documentation of authority granted. The proxy may need to present the letter to immigration officials, for example, if he is traveling internationally with your child.

, Make sure to retain a copy of the letter for your records. You may need to produce it if any questions arise regarding the authorization you’ve given to your proxy.

Remove the bandage applied by the tattoo artist.,
Clean your tattoo with mild soap and water.,
Take a shower with your new tattoo.,
Dry off after showering with your tattoo.",How to Take a Shower With a New Tattoo," After finishing your tattoo, most artists will wash the area with mild soap, apply an antiseptic ointment, and cover your tattoo with a bandage to help prevent infection. Depending on the size of your tattoo, this bandage may be gauze, medical bandaging, or even plastic wrap.


This bandage should be removed after 4 to 6 hours. This will allow your skin to breathe, which is essential for the tattoo's healing. Showering with this bandage still in place can soak the bandage and hold too much water against your tattoo.





;
, After removing the bandage, your tattoo will likely be covered with adhesive, ointment, and dried blood. This mixture should be washed away before you shower.


Use a very mild soap (such as liquid hand soap) and water to clean the tattoo. Use only your fingers to lightly massage the soap onto your skin; do not use a cloth and do not scrub - this can easily abrade your skin and result in scarring. Gently pat the area dry with a cloth when finished.







, After getting tattooed, you should try to wait at least 48 hours before you shower to give your new tattoo time to form a protective barrier, but sometimes it's unavoidable. For the first week or so - especially the first few days - after getting your new tattoo, you will need to follow specific rules in the shower.

Run your shower with cool or lukewarm water. This is helpful for 2 reasons: it prevents the stinging pain that hot water would cause on your fresh tattoo, and it prevents your pores from opening too wide. Hot water will cause your skin's pores to open, which can lead to loss of pigment. As an added precaution, consider running cold water indirectly over your fresh tattoo for the last 30 seconds of your shower to close your pores.






Do not allow the stream of water to hit your tattooed skin directly. When rinsing, let the water wash over your tattoo indirectly. This will help prevent scarring or puckering of your skin.






Take as brief a shower as possible. Your tattoo will heal better if it is minimally exposed to steam, water, and soap. Hold your tattooed skin out of the water as much as possible during the shower.







, After showering, you should dry your tattoo as quickly as possible. Using a clean towel, gently pat your tattooed skin dry. Do not use a rubbing motion, and do not allow your tattoo to slowly air dry. Dry the rest of your body as usual.

Wait a few days before coming to any conclusions.,
Look for severe inflammation.,
Look for serious swelling.,
Take your temperature.,
Show the infection to the tattoo artist.,
Go to the doctor.,
Use a topical ointment as directed.,
Keep the tattoo dry while the infection heals.,
Get tested for allergies before receiving a tattoo.,
Only get tattoos from licensed tattoo artists.,
Make sure your tattoo artist uses new needles.,
Keep your tattoo clean.,
Let the tattoo get enough air as it heals.",How to Tell if a Tattoo Is Infected," The day you get a tattoo, the entire area will be red, slightly swollen, and sensitive. New tattoos will be somewhat painful, about as sore as a severe sunburn. In the first 48 hours of getting a tattoo, it can be very difficult to determine whether or not an infection has set in, so don’t jump the gun. Maintain a proper tattoo aftercare procedure and adopt a wait and see policy.Pay attention to your pain. If the tattoo is especially painful, and the pain lasts for more than three days following the tattoo session, go back to the parlor and ask the artist to examine the tattoo.;
, Large or complicated tattoos may take longer to heal than simpler line drawings and smaller tattoos, but if the tattoo remains seriously inflamed for more than three days, it might be a sign of infection. Again, all new tattoos will be inflamed somewhat, but it should go down in a few days.


Feel with your hand above the area for warmth. If you can feel heat radiating from the area, that's a sign that it might be seriously inflamed.
Itchiness, especially itchiness spreading outward from the area of the tattoo is also a sign of an allergic reaction or infection. Tattoos will itch some, but if it gets especially strong and lasts more than a week after you get the tattoo, you may want to get it checked out.
Redness can also be a sign of infection. All tattoos will get slightly red in the area around the lines, but if the redness gets darker as opposed to get lighter, and if it gets more painful instead of less, it's a sign of serious infection., If the area in or immediately around the tattoo swells up unevenly, that can be a serious sign of infection. Any fluid-filled boils or pustules in the area are definitely signs of infection and should be treated immediately. If the tattoo raises up significantly instead of shrinking down, get it checked out.


Foul smelling discharge is also a very serious sign. Go immediately to the emergency room or see your physician.
Look for red lines radiating out from the tattoo itself. If you see thin red lines radiating out from the tattoo, go to the doctor immediately, because you may have blood poisoning.

, Any time you’re concerned about the possibility of infection, it’s a good idea to take your temperature with an accurate thermometer and make sure it’s not high. If you’re feeling feverish, it can be a sign of an infection that needs to be treated sooner rather than later.

, If you’re concerned about your tattoo but aren’t sure whether or not it may be infected, the best person to talk to is the artist from whom you received the tattoo. Show them how it’s progressing and ask them to evaluate it.


If you’re experiencing severe symptoms, like foul-smelling discharge and significant pain, skip this step and go to the doctor or the emergency room immediately to receive treatment.

, If you've spoken with your tattoo artist and have tried to care for the tattoo as best you can and still are experiencing symptoms of infection, it's important to get to the doctor as soon as possible and get on antibiotics. There's usually not much that can be done topically to the tattoo, but medication can help fight the infection.


Start taking antibiotics as directed as soon as possible to help your body fight off infection. Most topical infections should be able to be easy to kick quickly, but blood infections are serious business and need to be treated swiftly.

, Your doctor may prescribe topical ointment as well as antibiotics to keep your tattoo healing properly. If so, apply the topical ointment regularly and keep the tattoo as clean as possible. Wash it gently with clean water twice a day, or follow your doctor's specific instructions.


After treating, you may need to keep the tattoo covered with sterile gauze, but also let it get enough air to avoid promoting further infection. The tattoo needs fresh air.

, Wash your tattoo regularly with a very small amount of non-scented soap and clean water, then blot dry it thoroughly before re-bandaging it or keeping it uncovered. Never cover or soak new tattoos that have become infected.

, While it's uncommon, some people are allergic to certain ingredients in tattoo ink, which can create an ugly and painful situation if you get a tattoo. It's best to get an allergy test performed if you're interested in getting a tattoo.


Usually, black ink doesn't contain anything that people are allergic to, but often colored inks will have other additives that can cause reactions in some people. If you just want to get a tattoo with India ink, you're probably fine, even if you have sensitivities.

, If you're going to get a tattoo, spend some time researching good parlors and artists in your area, and make sure the artist you choose to tattoo your body has a license and that the parlor has a good track record of cleanliness and customer satisfaction.


Avoid stick 'n pokes and other home tattooing options. Even if your friend is ""really really good"" at giving tattoos, make an appointment with someone who gives tattoos professionally to get yours done.
If you make an appointment and show up to find any suspicious behavior or unclean environments, cancel your appointment and walk out. Find a better tattoo parlor.

, Good tattoo artists make cleanliness a priority and will take steps to show you clearly that they're opening new needles and putting on gloves. If you don't see this happening, ask. Good tattoo parlors should make this obvious and should respect your concern for your own safety.

, Always follow the instructions the tattoo artist gives you about caring for your new tattoo and make caring for your new tattoo a priority. Rinse gently and dry thoroughly with warm soapy water, starting 24 hours after receiving the tattoo.


Tattoo artists will usually provide you with a tube of something called Tattoo goo, or other topical ointments which should be applied to tattoos to keep them clean and healing properly, for at least 3-5 days after receiving the tattoo. Never use Vaseline or Neosporin on new tattoos.

, In the first couple of days of receiving a new tattoo, it's important to keep it as comfortable as possible, letting it heal naturally. Avoid wearing clothing that might irritate the area and keep it out of the sun as much as possible to avoid bleeding the ink.

Think of images and symbols that matter most to you.,
Add to your sleeve over time.,
Choose patterns or motifs that will add continuity.,
Go with colors that are easily duplicated for consistency.,
Work with a tattoo artist to design your sleeve.",How to Start a Sleeve Tattoo1," Make a list of meaningful images, symbols, and words that could serve as potential components of your sleeve. Think of interests, values, and signs that you won’t regret having on your body in the future.You can look for inspiration in tattoo magazines, like Inked (http://www.inkedmag.com/), or shops’ online portfolios. Keep in mind your sleeve will be a major investment of time and money, and it’ll have more meaning for you if you come up with your own imagery.;
, Sleeve tattoos typically cost hundreds or thousands of dollars and have such a level of detail that getting it done in one sitting is impossible. You might have a set vision of what you want your sleeve to look like, but try to be open to including new images you might discover in the future.


Completing a sleeve over time offers the opportunity to add meaningful images that represent life events, like a visual diary.
As you discover new images to add to your sleeve, you can use smaller patterns, colors, and other compositional elements to keep the sleeve cohesive as it develops., Framing larger images with smaller patterns will lend a sense of composition to your sleeve. Work with your tattoo artist to incorporate the framing motif into your first sleeve tattoo and include it in later additions.Examples could be your birth month’s flower or your favorite flower, vines and leaves, cloud patterns, stars, or waves. These elements can reappear throughout your sleeve and unify its other elements.

, Choose simple, basic colors that will resist fading and give your sleeve continuity. As you add to your sleeve over time, a unified color scheme will help it become a more intentional, cohesive work of art.Ask your tattoo artist, “Can you suggest colors that are easy to replicate in tattoos I'll add to the sleeve in the future? I want to avoid having multiple shades that might clash or seem mismatched. Which color scheme would work best for my skin tone and fade the least?”

, A good tattoo artist will help you design your sleeve from the first piece and plan for later additions. Bring your list of tattoo ideas, which is called a brief, to the artist, and try to be as descriptive as possible in conveying your ideas. Ask the artist to sketch some designs, and consult with them about color, spacing, unifying motifs, and other compositional elements.A good tattoo artist will take pleasure in helping you create a meaningful, unique design, so finding the right artist is vital to starting a sleeve tattoo.

Ask friends with tattoos for a referral.,
Check your friends’ tattoos for quality.,
Look through tattoo shops’ online presence.,
Visit the shop and check for sanitary conditions.",How to Start a Sleeve Tattoo2," The first place to look for a good tattoo artist is your social circle. Word of mouth is often the best way to get clear, honest information about a shop.If you have friends with tattoos you find beautiful, ask them, “Where did you get this piece done? What was your experience with the artist like? Would you recommend them?”

, You should only ask friends with quality tattoos for referrals. Ask if you can check out their piece, and take mental notes about its quality.Assess the level of detail in the work. Look for clear, crisp, and thin lines. Check for pigment that’s faded or bled out, as if someone held a marker to a piece of paper for too long.

, Once you have a few potential shops, check their websites and social media pages. Browse through their portfolios to get a better idea of their quality and style, and narrow your list to include the style or styles most consistent with your aesthetic.While you’re checking websites and social media pages, look for comments, complaints, and reviews from past clients.

, After checking shops out online, your next step is to visit in person. If it appears dingy, dirty, or unprofessional, find another shop.Look for evidence of sanitary practices, such as:Clean, well-organized work space and tools.
Tattoo needles still in sterile packaging and only opened in front of clients.
Sterilizing equipment, such as chemical, steam, or ultrasonic cleaners.
Artists sterilize all reusable items.
Artists wash their hands and wear gloves.

Try hanging an image above your bed before getting it tattooed.,
Make sure a sleeve won't impact your job prospects.,
Start your sleeve when you’re ready to spend some money.",How to Start a Sleeve Tattoo3," Print out an image of the first potential element of your sleeve, such as a design drafted by your artist. Hang it next to your bed, above your alarm clock, on the refrigerator, or another location where you’ll see it multiple times a day. Keep the image posted for a few weeks before you decide to get it tattooed on your body.If you can go a few weeks or a couple of months living with the image without getting sick of it, it’s more likely you’ll actually enjoy it being a permanent part of your body.

, Before starting your sleeve, double check your job’s dress code and consider the clothing typically worn by people in your field of work. In general, companies across industries are more accepting of tattoos than they’ve been in the past.However, it’s better to be on the safe side and make sure your new ink won’t have an impact on your present or future job prospects.If you’re worried about the potential professional consequences of a large-scale tattoo, try starting on your upper arm and working toward half sleeve coverage.

, If you’re eager to start your sleeve but have a limited budget, you might want to take the time to save up some money for a quality tattoo. Your work of art is a major investment and will be a permanent part of your body. Some full sleeves add up to thousands of dollars spent over the course of years, and it’ll be worth it in the long run to invest in quality artistry.Depending on the size of your sleeve’s first piece, be prepared to spend at least $100 (U.S.) before tip. That amount will increase for larger pieces with finer details or more colors. As for gratuity, you should tip your artist 20%, especially if you intend on working with them on later additions.
For a more accurate idea of how much starting your sleeve will cost, get a price quote from your artist when you begin discussing the first piece.

Identify the Active Ingredient.,
Understand the Difference Between Lidocaine and Benzocaine.,
Purchase a Numbing Cream with a pH less than 7.",How to Select the Most Effective Numbing Cream for a Tattoo," Topical anesthetics are medications that decrease the sensation of pain and itching when applied to the skin. Numbing creams sold to reduce the pain of getting a tattoo contain one of these two active ingredients: Lidocaine - an amide-based topical anesthetics.Benzocaine - ester-based topical anesthetic. Over the past seventy years, numerous scientific studies and medical research have confirmed that numbing creams containing Lidocaine are the most effective in reducing pain associated with getting a tattoo.;
,


Lidocaine is the most effective of the amide anesthetics. Lidocaine’s superior pain-reducing properties are evidenced by the fact that dermatologist use Lidocaine exclusively to numb the skin prior to performing a procedure. In addition, because Lidocaine has a pH in the acidic range less than 7, it does not alter the skin’s surface characteristics. In other words, Lidocaine does NOT cause swelling or exfoliation of the epidermal or dermal layers. When you use a Lidocaine-based numbing cream prior to getting a tattoo, you can rest assured that your tattoo’s design, shape, and color will not be altered by the use of the Lidocaine numbing cream.
Benzocaine, an ester anesthetic, has been medically proven to provide no pain relieving properties when applied to skin. Ester anesthetics reduce pain only when applied to “mucous membrane” areas of the body, such as the gums, inside the cheeks, and the anus. Benzocaine’s specific pain reducing benefit is evidenced by the fact that it is used by dentists and proctologists. So, unless you want to get a tattoo on the inside of your lip or on another mucous membrane, you have no need to purchase a numbing cream containing Benzocaine as its active ingredient.

, Clinical evidence suggests that topical anesthetics that have a pH in the alkaline range greater than 7 should not be used as a numbing agent for tattoos. Alkaline agents alter the surface properties of skin and, therefore, have the potential to alter the pigment and ultimately the tattoo’s color. A numbing cream that alleviates the pain of getting a tattoo, but leaves you with a tattoo which is distorted or dull defeats the purpose of getting a tattoo. It is not always easy to discovery a numbing cream’s pH.

Look for worsening redness.,
Notice any swelling.,
Pay attention to pain.,
Feel if the area is hot.,
Look for any discharge or pus.,
Consider the age of the piercing.,
Consider the location of the piercing.",How to Tell if a Piercing Is Infected1," It’s normal for a fresh piercing to be pink; you just received a puncture wound, after all. However, redness that get worse or spreads to a larger area is a sign of possible infection.Keep an eye on your piercing and make a note about whether your redness is improving or worsening over a day or two.;
, The area around your new piercing will likely swell for about 48 hours as your body adjusts to what it perceives as an injury. After that time, swelling should start to go down. Worsening swelling, swelling that appears after a time of being normal, and swelling accompanied by redness and pain are symptoms of infection.Swelling can cause loss of function, like if your tongue gets swollen and doesn’t move easily. If the area around your piercing is too painful or swollen to move, you could have an infection.

, Pain is your body’s way of telling you something is wrong. The original pain from your piercing should subside within two days or so, around the same time that swelling starts to decrease. It’s normal for this pain to be stinging, aching, burning, or tender. Pain lasting longer than a couple of days or that gets worse may indicate infection.Of course, if you accidentally irritate your new piercing you’ll probably experience some pain. It’s pain that gets worse or doesn’t go away that you want to watch out for.

, With redness, swelling, and pain comes heat. If your piercing is really inflamed or infected it might feel like it’s giving off heat or even feel hot to the touch.If you’re going to touch your piercing area to check for heat, always wash your hands first.

, It is very normal and healthy for a new piercing to ooze some clear or whitish fluid that then might crust around the jewelry. This is lymph fluid, and it is a part of the healing process. On the other hand, thick whitish or colored discharge (yellow, green) is probably pus. Pus might have an unpleasant odor.Any thick, milky, or colored discharge should be considered a likely sign of infection.

, Discomfort you feel the day you get pierced probably isn’t infection; it generally takes a day or more for signs of infection to develop. It’s also unlikely that you will develop an infection in a piercing you have had for a long time and is already healed. However, infection in old piercings is possible if any sort of injury occurs to the area; any cut or opening in the skin can be a doorway for bacteria.

, If the piercing is in an area of the body more prone to infection, you should suspect infection more quickly. Ask your professional piercer about how likely your piercing is to become infected.



Navel piercings must be cleaned well. Because they’re in a warm, sometimes damp location they have a higher risk of becoming infected.
Tongue piercings have higher risk of infection because of bacteria in your mouth. Because of its location tongue infections can lead to serious complications like infection of the brain."

Clean your new piercing properly.,
Follow new-piercing guidelines.,
Choose a reputable professional.,
Get pierced with hypoallergenic jewelry.,
Know how long it takes for your piercing to heal.",How to Tell if a Piercing Is Infected2," Your piercer should give you specific instruction for how to clean your new piercing, including suggesting what products to use for cleaning. Different piercings have somewhat different cleaning requirements, so get clear, written instructions. In general, follow some simple guidelines:Clean skin piercings with warm water and non-scented antibacterial soap, like Dial.
Don’t use rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide on the new piercing. These are too harsh and can damage or irritate the skin.
Avoid using antibiotic creams or ointments. They trap dirt and debris and do not allow the piercing to breathe.
Don’t use table salt to clean your piercing. Use non-iodized sea salt dissolved in warm water.
Clean your piercing as often as your piercer recommends – not more or less. Under-cleaning can cause buildup of dirt, crust, and dead skin. Over-cleaning can irritate and dry skin out. Both are detrimental to healing.
Gently move or twist the jewelry while cleaning it to get the solution inside the piercing and coat the jewelry. This isn’t true for some types of piercings, so always ask your piercer first.

, Other than proper cleaning techniques, taking care of your piercing can help prevent unnecessary pain and infection. Some guidelines to follow for general piercing care are:Don’t sleep on your new piercing. Your jewelry can rub on your blankets, sheets, or pillows, causing irritation and getting the area dirty. Sleep on your back if you got a navel piercing; if your new piercing is facial, try using an airplane support pillow and aligning your piercing with the middle ""hole.”
Wash your hands before you touch the piercing or surrounding area.Do NOT remove the jewelry before you piercing is healed.Doing so will probably let the piercing close up. If the area is infected, the infection will be trapped in your skin.
Try not to let clothes rub directly onto new piercings. Also, do not twist your jewelry unless you’re cleaning it.Stay out of pools, lakes, rivers, hot tubs, and submerging in other water under your piercing heals., About 1 in 5 piercings get infected, usually because of unsterile piercing procedures or improper aftercare.Only ever get pierced by a trained professional and in a reputable, clean piercing studio. Before getting pierced, insist that your piercer show you how and where their equipment is sterilized – they should have an autoclave, and clean all surfaces with bleach and disinfectant.


Piercers should only ever pierce you with a new needle out of a sterile package, NEVER a reused needle, and they should always wear fresh, sterile gloves while piercing.A piercing gun is NEVER appropriate. Walk out if you see a piercing gun. Go to a professional to ensure a sterile procedure.
Check with your State legislation about what licensing and training someone needs to have in order to pierce you.
Do NOT pierce yourself or ask an untrained friend to pierce you.

, Though having an allergic reaction to jewelry is not the same thing as getting an infection, anything that irritates your new piercing also increases the risk for infection. A severe allergy could also force you to remove your new jewelry. Always get pierced with hypoallergenic jewelry for the best chance for good healing.


Request stainless steel, titanium, niobium, or 14- or 18-karat gold., There are lots of places you can get pierced, through different types of tissue in areas that get more or less blood-flow. Thus, healing time varies a lot. Know the specifics of your piercing so you know how long you have to take extra care of it (for a specific piercing not listed, consult your professional piercer):Ear cartilage: 6-12 months
Nostril: 6-12 months
Cheek: 6-12 months
Nipples: 6-12 months
Navel: 6-12 months
Dermals/anchors/surface piercings: 6-12 months
Earlobe: 6-8 weeks
Eyebrow: 6-8 weeks
Septum: 6-8 weeks
Lip, labret, or beauty mark: 6-8 weeks
Prince Albert: 6-8 weeks
Clitoral hood: 4-6 weeks
Tongue: 4 weeks

Try a home remedy if you have a mild infection.,
Call your piercer for mild problems.,
See your doctor if you have fever, chills, or stomach upset.",How to Tell if a Piercing Is Infected3," Dissolve 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of non-iodized sea salt or Epsom salt in 1 cup (250 ml) of warm water in a clean cup, preferably in a disposable plastic one for each treatment. Soak the piercing or make a compress with a clean washcloth saturated with the salt water. Do this two to three times per day, fifteen minutes per session.If you don’t see improvement in 2-3 days, or if your symptoms get worse, contact your piercer or doctor for help.
Be sure to cover the entire piercing with the salt soak, on both sides of the hole. Continue to clean the piercing regularly with warm water and mild anti-bacterial soap.
It’s also okay to dab a small amount of antibiotic ointment onto the wound if infection is present.

, If you notice slight signs of infection like some redness or swelling that doesn’t go away, it’s okay to call your piercer and ask for advice on how to care for it. You can also go in to see them if you start to have drainage – they’ve seen so many piercings they can probably tell you whether the discharge is normal or not.


This only applies if a trained professional pierced you. If not, consult a doctor with any medical questions.

, Infections in piercings usually stay localized to the area of the piercing. However, if an infection spreads or gets into your bloodstream it can result in a serious, even life-threatening systemic infection. With severe infection you can have a fever, chills, nausea or vomiting, or dizziness.If you notice that your pain, swelling, and redness near your piercing start to spread to a larger area, see your doctor right away. This might be a sign that the infection is worsening and moving to larger areas of your body.
Your doctor will probably prescribe you antibiotics to prevent a severe infection. If the infection is already in your blood, you’ll probably have to stay in the hospital and have IV antibiotics.

You need to have this approval so that you don't waste your time taking care of a piercing that you'll just have to take out regardless.;
, Find a piercer with a good reputation at a reputable tattoo or piercing shop. Read customer reviews online to find out information about the piercer's reputation, and make sure the piercer has completed an apprenticeship with a reputable piercer.

, It is crucial for a piercing/tattoo shop to be sterile and clean. If you go to the store, and it does not appear immaculately clean, don't get a piercing there.

, When you get the piercing, make sure that the piercer opens up a package of unused, sterile needles to use for your piercing. This is crucial to prevent the spread of infection and disease.

, The piercing itself will hurt minimally. The initial healing and swelling are the worst part.

, For the actual piercing, the piercer will take a clamp and put it on your tongue to hold it in place. This protects you from jerking when the piercing happens.

, There will be more symptoms for the first 3-5 days immediately after getting the piercing. Expect to see swelling, light bleeding, bruising, and tenderness, especially during this initial period.

, Drink lots of ice cold water and let small ice chips melt in your mouth to help keep the swelling down. Make sure they are small ice chips so you don't freeze your mouth.


Don't suck on the ice chips; just let them melt in your mouth.

, Avoid tobacco, alcohol, large amounts of caffeine, oral sexual contact (including french kissing), chewing gum, and playing with your jewelry during the initial week of healing.

, These can cause stinging and burning sensations on and near the piercing.

, Even if you follow these steps and do exactly what the aftercare sheet says, there could still be a whitish goo that come out of the piercing hole. This is normal and is not an infection. Just make sure that it is not puss.

, After you get the piercing, use alcohol-free mouthwash 4 or 5 times daily for up to 60 seconds, including after meals and at bedtimes.

, To clean the outside of the piercing, dab sea salt on the piercing 2 to 3 times daily and wash with mild anti-microbial soap up to twice a day.

, Always wash your hands with antibacterial soap before cleaning or touching the piercing or jewelry.Never touch the piercing except during moments of cleaning.

, Dry the piercing after cleaning with a paper towel or napkin instead of a bath towel or cloth. Towels can contain germs and bacteria, so it is better to use a disposable paper product instead.

, Occasionally, the balls on tongue piercing bars can become unscrewed or loose over time. It is important that you regularly check to make sure they are tight. Use one hand to hold the bottom ball in place and use the other hand to tighten the top ball.


Note: To tighten the balls, remember twisting to the right tightens and twisting to the left loosens.

, Know that the original jewelry should be replaced with shorter jewelry after the swelling has reduced. See your piercer for this change, because it usually will be during the healing period.

, Once the initial healing process is over, you can pick any of the many styles of jewelry for your tongue piercing. Just keep in mind if you have metal allergies or sensitivities to certain materials.

Consider the quality of your gun before tattooing anyone. A set up that is cheaper could hurt or infect someone.;
, For those who want better quality parts, purchasing individual components is the path for you. This can also be a good way to upgrade your starter kit. Most people upgrade the gun. Tattoo guns are the most complex piece of equipment in the tattoo machine. They make contact with the skin, so it’s important to use a nice one., If you have a regular tattoo artist, open up a dialogue about home kits. Artists who operate out of tattoo shops often have worked from home at some point. They can offer their input, if they’re willing.

, Tattoo guns need to be treated with the utmost care. Take precaution before handling these machines. Wash your hands with antibacterial soap or wear latex gloves.

, The frame holds all the pieces together. Then you have two electromagnetic coils which provide the power for the machine. The coils rapidly move the armature bar, which is connected to a barred needle. The power supply connects to the electromagnetic coils.


All of these components can be removed or replaced as needed.

, Inspect the grip of the gun. There are two sides of the grip for the tube and the gun's tip. Set these to the preferable length, and tighten the two screws on the grip. On average the needle shouldn't exceed the tip more than 2 mm and no less than 1 mm.


If there is excessive blood, then your needle is too long., Take a look at the needles you received with the gun. You should have a few different sizes of needles. For example RL, RS, M1, M2, RM, or F are all sizes. Install one of the needles by inserting it through the tube towards the tip. Be careful not to dull a needle while assembling. This could lead to a painful tattoo., The nipple, also known as a grommet, secures the needle and grip to the gun’s base. Place a nipple on the armature bar pin. Fasten the needle’s blunt end onto the nipple., Once you’ve assembled the grip, you need to adjust the length of how much the needle is exposed. You can adjust the needle’s exposure by adjusting the tube vise. The tube vise is the adjustable screw in between the armature and needle., Power supplies vary in specifications and voltages. When buying a starter kit, a less adjustable power supply comes with the machine. Your power supply shouldn’t cost more than the tattoo gun.

, Check the fuse of the machine. Make sure you are running the proper voltage into your machine. Most tattoo power supplies will have a regulated control for the amount of fuse and power going into your gun. Some of the cheaper models don’t have this feature.

, If your machine doesn't come with a footswitch, you’ll need to buy one. A footswitch is fairly inexpensive and doesn't require a major setup.

, Attach your footswitch to the the power supply. The footswitch activates and regulates the power from the power supply to the needle., You’ll need to connect the gun to the machine using clip cords. There will be a clear location at the bottom of the gun for the cable to connect to. There should only be two inputs on the machine itself. Make sure you connect the cables in their proper location.

, Once everything is connected and assembled, you’re ready to test the gun. If you are worried about testing the gun on yourself, just turn everything on and examine the gun. The needle should vibrate at a quick speed upon pressing the footswitch.


Start your tattooing exploits!

, A good way to practice your art is by practicing on apples or pears. The skin on apples and pears are similar to the human flesh. If your fruits become damaged, then you're puncturing the needle too deep."

Practice with paint or pencil.,
Practice tattooing on a pork belly.,
Choose an appropriate tattoo machine and needle size.,
Consider the speed on your tattoo machine.,
Prepare the area.",How to Shade a Tattoo1," Shading is an artistic endeavor - no instructions will be able to duplicate the confidence you'll gain by trying to shade yourself. Shading a tattoo is not so much different from shading a still life. Try to become comfortable shading off body, even if you are already an accomplished artist.


Practice with pressure. Pressing hard versus pressing lightly can have dramatically different effects, so you should get a feel for this ahead of time.;
, Pigs make good human analogues and you can buy a pork belly at a local grocery store or even online. This way you can get a feel for how much pressure to use and what type of strokes to use without worrying about permanently marking a human's skin just yet.

, You’ll use larger gauge needles for bigger shading areas and smaller gauge needles for smaller areas. Ensure that the needle is protruding no more than one millimeter for the purposes of shading., Most tattoo artists recommend that you choose a faster setting for shadingbecause they think it helps make the tattoos look smoother. This is a personal preference, so try both ways.

, Clean the entire area with soap and water, especially if you have already done the lining. Make sure that you have gotten rid of any stencil marks, sticky residue, or grease that will get in the way of your shading process.

"
"
Be sure you've washed your hands with antibacterial soap before touching the jewelry or the fistula (piercing hole);
,
Stretch one size at a time.,
Use a water based lubricant or a specialized stretching oil.,Never use acrylic/silicone/kaos/collapsible plugs or tunnels to stretch, they will irritate your piercing and more often than not tear your ear.,
Use a Taper to Stretch.

,
Sea salt soak the area to draw out any possible infections.

",How to Stretch a Piercing,", Sizes go down in number, by two's (for example, 12g to 10g, etc). You will regret it if you do not as you will cause scar tissue and a blowout.

, Do not use vaseline or anything else that will clog up the piercing and trap bacteria. (Do NOT use Neosporin!)

Plan the tattoo accordingly.,
Consider light and shadow.,
Plan ahead.,
Draw a sketch for the customer.",How to Shade a Tattoo2," Always discuss with your customer how they want their tattoo to appear. Even if they say they trust you, it’s always good business to keep them in the loop on the decision-making process.

, You need to consider that light and shadow will play into each individual tattoo if you want to successfully shade. Shading a tattoo is as much about art as it is about technique. Ask your client to describe the hypothetical lighting of the tattoo., Your hypothetical light source should always be the same throughout the course of your shading. You don’t want the shadow to be incongruous. If the top part of an arm is lit up, then the bottom part should be darker. If you're using colors, try to shade with complementary colors. Grab a color wheel and find a complementary color to the one you used for lining. This will make the tattoo really pop.

, The customer will want to have an idea of what the tattoo is going to look like and it will also help you figure out exactly how to draw it. Try a few practice sketches to get it right.

"
"
Fire up your tattoo machine.,
Leave time between lining and shading.You don’t want to go straight from your line work to shading.,
Work in a circular motion.,
Change the depth of the shade by adjusting the weight of your technique.,
Change the ink capacity in the needle mouth as you move forward.,
Dilute the ink.,
Clean the needles as you go.,
Cover up previous work if necessary.,
Remove all unnecessary ink.",How to Shade a Tattoo3," Ensure that you are using a machine that is appropriate to the tattoo and a needle size that will fit the work that you are doing. Address the speed on the tattoo machine as well. Many tattoo artists recommend a higher speed for shading than normal lining.

, Although it is possible to wait fifteen minutes or so for the tattoo to dry, most artists prefer to do the shading in a separate session than the lining. Not only will this make your job as the tattoo artist easier, but it will also give the customer a chance to think over how they want their shading done.

, Start with the darker areas of the tattoo and then move out in a circular motion to the lighter areas. Remember that the darker areas are going to require more pressure than the lighter areas. This takes a lot of feel, so you’ll have to practice. , Essentially, your brushwork should be heavy to light. You want to add more pressure to produce the darker areas and reduce pressure as you move to a lighter area. You don’t want the gradients to look obvious, so try to make this transition very smooth. , This is a slightly more time consuming method. However, it helps if you aren’t comfortable with your ability to produce a gradient simply by managing the pressure you apply with the needle. If that is the case then changing the ink capacity is another option.

, This is another strategy. Dip your needle in distilled water to dilute the black pigment into a gray pigment. This is helpful because you don’t have to change needles as you move through the tattoo. As you apply the ink, tilt the needle in a circular manner to blend the tones of the tattoo effectively. This will apply a different amount of ink and contribute to the shading., You want to make sure that the darker ink is completely gone from the needle before you move onto shading lighter areas. Neglecting to clean your needles could seriously mess up your shading.

, Shading is a great time to cover up any mistakes that you or a previous tattoo artist has made. You can even shade over previous shading mistakes. Follow the same techniques.

, If there is any unnecessary ink on the surface after you have finished the tattoo, take it off. You need to be able to examine your work. You may notice some inconsistencies in your work, in which case you need to go back in and fix it up. Alter the shading to address any inconsistencies in that specific tattoo.

Taking collegiate courses in fine arts will ensure you have a good grounding in these principles.;
, You will need to prove your artistic worth before another tattoo artist is willing to invest time in you as an apprentice. Your designs should be similar to common tattoo art, as well as anything that shows off skillful composition and coloring talent.

, You can also showcase your talent and dedication by performing henna tattoo designs imitating permanent tattoo designs. This will also show to the master tattooist you want to apprentice under that you already have an understanding of what it means to translate a design to the pliant medium of skin.


Volunteer your services as a face painter at a school festival, local parade or festival, or at a nearby carnival.

, This will give you first hand experience as to the procedure, atmosphere, and techniques from other tattooists. Also, having a tattoo of your own will show your clients that you can empathize with the experience, which will help put them at ease..

, Everyone gets a start somewhere, and a member of your local body art community might be able to put you on the trail of a good place to apply. Come prepared to every meeting with a professional: bring your portfolio and any other artistic accreditation you have earned.


Even if the tattooist you inquire with can't help you, you can always ask for her professional opinion on your work. Maybe you have a flair for a certain style that a colleague of hers is known for, in which case, her recommendation might go a long way.

, The avenues for gaining an apprenticeship are few, but by making your presence known at and inquiring for an apprenticeship with local tattoo parlors, you are likely to get some direction.


If there is a tattoo parlor that you are particularly interested in apprenticing for, be respectful but persistent. Visit the parlor regularly with your art in tow and some small niceties, like coffee. Volunteer your time with cleaning or maintenance.

, Depending on the terms of your apprenticeship, this can last for three years and may cost thousands of dollars. You will need to support yourself during this time in addition to covering any additional expenses related to your education as a tattooist.


The Alliance of Professional Tattooists (APT) recommends a minimum of a three year apprenticeship.Generally, after being accepted into an apprenticeship, you will sign a contract either agreeing to pay the tattooist a sum of money in exchange for the apprenticeship, or to work for the tattoo parlor for a number of years following the completion of apprenticeship.

, This will normally come in the form of a contract from the tattooist under which you will apprentice. This will establish the expectations of you as apprentice and the tattooist as the master artist. Read over the terms of this contract carefully and, if you are able, have a lawyer check it as well.

, Though you will someday, with enough practice and dedication, be a master tattooist in your own regard, during your apprenticeship, the beginning especially, you will mostly be doing menial tasks in the tattoo shop. You will also be expected to watch carefully as the artist works.

, Modern tattooist employ a variety of tools. An electric tattoo machine uses groupings of needles to drive ink into the skin up to 150 times a second.These needles are only used once and are packaged separately.

, Over the course of your apprenticeship, you will learn how to clean your equipment and keep it running efficiently. This should be done methodically and consistently to prevent contamination or infection, with all the equipment being sterilized by an autoclave after every use., You must wash your hands thoroughly to prevent infection in addition to the surgical gloves you will wear while performing the tattooing. The areas of skin you are tattooing must also be kept scrupulously clean., These can affect the tattooing process, and in some cases negatively impact even flawless artistic execution. A client can have an allergic reaction to some of dyes, or even the gloves you are wearing; being aware of these issues will help protect you and your client., Your clients will need to be instructed on how to look after their tattoos for a period of weeks or months after the tattoo's application. The following rules apply:


The tattoo should be bandaged immediately and remain covered for two to three hours, after which it should be gently cleaned with antibacterial soap.
Wear loose clothing that will not rub the tattoo.
Do not swim while the tattoo is still healing.
The tattooed skin must be kept clean at all times, with unscented soap and water. Drying must be done with great care and no rubbing is allowed.
A moisturizer can be applied to the tattoo a couple of times a day.
Keep the tattoo out of the sun for a minimum of three weeks. After that, cover it with a high-SPF sunblock., This will be the final stage of your apprenticeship. The tattoo artist you are apprenticing under will only approve you to start work when she is certain you are ready and fully trained in all aspects of the art.

, This includes both washing your hands and putting on surgical gloves. Make sure that your work space is clean and well maintained, as this will make your clientele more comfortable.

, An autoclave is a machine used to sterilize equipment. You should sterilize your equipment in plain view of your client. Think about explaining this process so your client understands you are taking health and hygiene into consideration every step of the way.

, You will have to shave and disinfect the area where the tattoo will be applied. You should try to shave in the same direction the hair is growing, to prevent irritation to the skin or cuts., Prior to the actual tattooing, you will transfer a stencil of drawing onto your client’s skin to serve as a guide and help prevent mistakes. Keep the skin taut while doing this so the image is applied to the contours of the skin naturally.

, You will start by using your ink and a single tip needle. Using these, complete the outline of your client's design in preparation for the central parts.


Following this, you should clean the area again.

, At this point you will need to create a single line wider than your first. You will need to use thicker ink and different set of needles for this part of the process.


Clean the area again after completing your second set of lines.

, Now that you've tattooed the outside and inside boundary of your outline, you can apply ink to overlap the two to make sure there are no gaps in the design.

, The tattoo is now finished and fully applied, but you will still need to clean the area one more time before bandaging it. Now your client's ready to head home.

Consider the benefits of a book journal.,
Choose a medium.There are two main routes you can go with a book journal: You can write in a physical journal, or you can take your writing online with a blog.,
Buy a durable book.If you opt for the physical option, you shouldn't rely on a cheap coil-bound book.,
Set up a blog.,
Create a Goodreads account.,
List the book's essential information.Every journal entry you make should have obvious info included for the sake of posterity.,
Write in facts you might forget.The memory is fickle.,
Copy memorable quotes into your entry.,
Comment on writing techniques in the book you're reading.Some book journals will rely exclusively on what a book is about, but there's just as much value in talking about the way an author explores his topic.,
Note your current time and place with each book entry.A book journal doesn't just catalogue what you're reading.,
Relate the book to what's going on in your life.For the sake of understanding the experience of reading a book, it may be a good idea to write in a few notes about what is actually happening in your life at the time of reading.,
Reflect on whether the book has changed you.Books are a source of fun and relaxation, but they also help us grow as people.,
Make a periodical reading goal.,
Write your book entry as you read.Some book journal keepers prefer to wait until the end of a book to make their entry.,
Finish your entry as soon as you're done reading.,
Keep your book somewhere safe.,
Take care of your book journal.If you're keeping track of your reading with a physical journal, you should take extra care to protect it from natural wear and tear.",How to Keep a Book Journal," The usefulness of a reading journal ultimately depends on how much you read. If you're reading most days of the week, it stands to reason you probably go through more books in a year than you can remember in depth. If you find yourself struggling to remember bigger details of a book you read a few months ago, a book journal will be a big help. The act of writing thoughts down does a lot to retain memory.


If you only read a few books a year, it may not be so helpful to keep a reading journal. These journals are usually only worthwhile for truly avid readers.;
, Some people prefer the personal touch of a physical book, while others swear by the convenience and accessibility of a web publication.


Although you may already have a preference for one over the other, you should consider both routes before making a firmer choice.
In some cases, a fusion of physical and online note keeping is a good idea. You won't always be around a computer when you're reading, and your finalized reflections can be input into a blog once you're done reading a given book.

, Although these are cheap and functional, they don't hold up to wear very well. When you're buying a book, look for something with a high-quality spine, preferably leatherbound.


While you're going for durability, you also want something that you'll feel happy with writing in for the next several months. It's not uncommon for writers to develop an emotional attachment to their journals, so make sure you buy a journal that's high-quality enough to deserve it.

, A blog is a free online journal. You won't have to worry about running out of space if you go online with your book journal. Your entries will be easier to organize and retrieve. In addition, a blog offers the possibility of a readership.


There are lots of free blogging sites available. Blogspot and Wordpress are just a couple of the best-known.Although you can keep a book journal private if you want, giving other people a chance to go along on the journey with you can lead to feedback and discussion, both regarding the stuff you're reading and the content of your writing itself.

, If you want a place to record your reading history, Goodreads is arguably even better than a plain blog. Goodreads is a site specifically designed for people to keep track of their reading habits and post their reflections on literature.It has an info-packed database, as well as a vibrant community that is every bit as passionate about reading as you are.

, This includes the name of the author and the title of the book. Make a point of putting this in boldface or otherwise emphasizing it on the page or screen. That way, it'll be easier to keep track of your reading when you go back to look at your entries further down the road.

, Even if you're enjoying the book you're reading a lot, there's no promise you'll remember most or even some of the material. This problem becomes bigger the more stuff you read. While you're definitely not expected to log in every piece of information a book has to offer, it's a good idea to jot down things that interest you.


The bits of info you mark down can be an anchor for remembering other things.

, Most books will have certain lines that jump out at you. You won't be able to snag all of the quotes you want, but there may be one or two per book that will be worth recording word for word. Going quote-hunting is especially worthwhile if you think you've found a line or two that perfectly expresses what the rest of the book is about.


Don't forget to include the page number if you quote something from a book., Think about things like writing perspective (first person, third person etc.), the length of the book, the use of imagery and poetic devices, and whatever other techniques the author has used.


For the sake of writing in your journal itself, write your feelings on whether you think certain techniques worked or not. A journal entry can be an informal critical review. By putting technical aspects under the microscope, you'll be able to tell good from bad writing apart more easily over time.

, Like any type of journal, it also indirectly comments on the course of your life. Your life experiences dictate what you read about, and in turn, certain books will be associated with parts of your life. With this in mind, write down the time and place you were when you read most of it.


Writing down the ties between what you're reading and what you experienced is a great way to better remember both. This will help enrich the association between the book and the circumstances of your life.

, Having a idea of what was going on (where you were living, who you were dating etc.) will bring a lot of the smaller details from that stage of your life back to you.


With some given background in place, you can contextualize the book in question with the mindset you were in at the time. This can help explain why you focused on or wrote certain things in each entry.
Obviously, more personal details should only be included if the book journal is totally private and not at risk of being read by anyone else.

, Most books you read probably won't have a lasting impact, but a few inevitably will. If you feel like a book has permanently altered the way you see the world, you should make a clear note of it at the bottom of your entry.


It may be helpful to put a note like this in boldface. That way, when you're scanning past entries months or years from now, you'll be able to quickly spot the ones that were especially noteworthy to you at the time.

, Books are enjoyable, but actively reading takes a bit more motivation than watching TV or playing video games. Some people find it helpfully motivating to set goals for themselves. For instance, if you're not reading as much as you'd like, you can write something down along the lines of ""I will read three books this month.""


Make sure the goal is realistic, and account for the fact that some books will take you much longer to read than others.
Goodreads has an annual reading goal feature free for use by all accounts.If you sign up with an account, you can set a chosen book goal at the start of the year and see how you've done by the end of it.

, Others find it enriches the experience of reading to be actively writing down notes as you go along. If you have a note journal at your side while you're reading, it may motivate you to have a stronger attention to detail.


This is a very important part detail if you've been out of school for a while and find you've been losing your touch as a critical reader in the time since.

, A longer-form journal entry can feel like a bit of a chore before you get into it. Some journal keepers make the mistake of procrastinating their entries until days or weeks after they've read the book. This defeats the purpose of keeping a book journal. You want your reflections to be as fresh as possible. Otherwise, you're not writing about the book itself so much as your memory of the book.

, A book journal is a long-term commitment. Although you're encouraged to bring it along with you when you go on trips, accidentally losing your book journal could feel catastrophic depending on how much time and work you've invested in it. Make a habit of storing it in the same place when you're between books.


Even if you don't publish your entries on a public blog, recording a second copy of your entries can be insurance against losing them permanently.

, Even a high-quality leather book will begin to ear if it's given enough abuse.


Take care to keep your book journal clear of food and drink spills, and put it in a special compartment in your backpack if you're taking it out someplace.
Alternatively, if you're keeping your book journal up to date with a blog, make sure you keep close guard over your password info.

Get a good journal or notebook.,
Make a front page explaining what you're doing.,
Write.,
Read the Bible regularly.,
Write down the things you'd like to share with God.,
Consider creating lists of things you are praying to change or happen.,
If you're going through a difficult time, a challenge or you're working hard to achieve something, use the journal to align your efforts with biblical encouragement.,
Use the journal to help you memorize scripture.,
Carry the journal with you wherever you go.",How to Keep a Christian Journal," There are tons of notebooks and journals to choose from. Pick one that you like and decorate it in any way you'd like.


Decorative ideas include: A saying from the Bible, scrapbook cutouts, your name in large letters, words that represent the joy of Christianity to you, etc.
If you'd rather, you can even make a journal from scratch. It all depends on how craft-savvy you are. There are prayer journal templates available for printing off from a variety of online sites; just do a quick search and choose what you like the look of.;
, This will help to guide you with the purpose for the journal and will help anyone else you'd like to read it to see what you were aiming to achieve through the journal. You don't have to share it with anyone though, but it can be nice to hand down this journal as a family heirloom later.

, You can write anything that inspires your Christianity, your views about Christianity and the things that you've learned from the Bible, church, etc. This might include poems, songs, your favorite scriptures, sermons, and faith mementos. Just remember that it is a Christian journal, not a regular journal that you would normally write what you did for the day. It is a journal intended to help increase your faith, so it is important to focus mainly on what inspires your faith and keeps you strong.


You can make the journal as visual as you like. Mind maps, images, doodles, etc., are all creative ways to increase the value and enjoyment of creating your Christian journal.

, Use your journal to make notes about what you've read and the interpretations as they appear to you. What biblical passages have great meaning for you? In what way are you inspired or motivated by what you have read? Are there things that you want to do to help others through your readings? Are there other ways to apply the verse or chapter you've read for this day? Add these things to your journal, as notes, snippets, essays, poems, or whatever feels appropriate.


Write down verses, quotes and stories from the Bible that are of particular importance to you.
You may wish to write down prayers too. These could be prayers you have read or ones that you have made up yourself.

, These might be thoughts, ideas or questions.

, For example, in one column you can have the item needing resolution, such as a safe medical checkup for a family member or a safe journey for a friend. In the other column, you can write down the resolution or achievement that prayer has brought about once the hoped for change or happening has occurred. If the hoped for outcome has not been positive, use the journal to work through why this might be the case and come up with your next approach.

, Find verses and chapters within the Bible that lift you up and help you get through the hardest times.


For example, if you're going through a hard time letting go of the past, look for verses that help you to deal with such letting go. You might focus on something like: ""Psalm 27:14, Wait for the Lord; be strong and let your heart take courage; yes, wait for the Lord."" Or, ""1 Corinthians 15:33, Do not be deceived: “Bad company ruins good morals.”"" Use a verse or story to inspire your plan for letting go and moving forward with God's help.

, You can write it down then read it again and again. Decorate the pages beautifully, so that you want to spend time gazing at it; the decorative effects will also become part of your memory, triggering it and making it easier to remember the words.

, The Lord works in mysterious ways. You never know when you will encounter something worth writing down!


Take the journal to such places as: School, church, the library, summer camp, when visiting family, etc.

Choose a journal medium.,
Find a calm, quiet space to get in touch with your emotions.,
Make a habit of journaling.,
Consider logging the date and time of every entry.",How to Journal for Therapy1," You can keep a journal in many forms, from digital to analog and aural to visual. The important thing is that you choose a journal medium which inspires you to write. If no medium leaps out at you as the right choice, try journaling in various ways until something sticks.


Use an analog notebook if you prefer to set your thoughts down with a pen or pencil. Jot down your thoughts in an old spiral notebook, if that captures your fancy, or buy a leather-bound journal so that you can start fresh. Use a small notebook for portability, or a large notebook to conceptualize big ideas. Make sure to choose a pen that feels good in your hand.
Keep a journal on your computer or your phone, if you prefer to type. Use a standard word processor (like Word or Notepad) or anything other program that feels right. Save all of your journal entries into one document, or save each entry into a new document within a ""Journal"" folder. It may be most convenient for you to journal on your computer if you also work from your computer.
If you like the idea of making your thoughts more public, consider keeping an online journal. Build a simple page on a free blog site like WordPress or LiveJournal. Post regular journal entries. You don't need to share the link with anyone, or try to amass a following – the very act of posting online may help you keep yourself accountable.
Consider keeping an audio journal. If you are more comfortable speaking than writing, consider recording your thoughts to the voice recorder app on your smartphone or computer. Sit down with the recorder and talk through your thoughts for a few minutes – you may find that you process emotions better through talking.;
, Consider writing at home, at a cafe, at the library, or out in the woods. Clear your mind of distractions. Try to remove your head from everyday life, however temporarily, and slip into a state of deep introspection. If you can't find physical space, try to create a mental bubble: listen to ambient music or white noise on headphones; shut yourself into a quiet, enclosed space; climb a tree, or find your way up to a roof.


Consider meditating or sitting quietly before you begin to write. This can help silence distractions and focus your thoughts. Stretch, breathe deeply, light candles, or play gentle music – anything that puts you into a calm, reflective state., Introspection takes regular practice. Make a goal to write each day, whether you set down a few sentences or a few pages. Set aside 10-30 minutes to journal with no procrastination or delays. Be disciplined.


If you have an especially busy schedule, consider setting one specific time to journal each day. Journal just before breakfast, on the train to work, or at night before you drift off to sleep. Find a time at which your thoughts are clear.
Try leaving your journal somewhere convenient so that it isn't a hassle to start writing. Take it with you when you leave the house, and always keep a pen handy!

, This way, it's easy to refer back to specific events and look for patterns in the things you've written. If you are writing a sequential journal, the entries will fall into a sort of loose chronology of their own accord – but a more precise log may help you reference concrete events.


Try logging any information that you feel is relevant to what you write. This may include the weather, the season, the significance of a given day (birthday, holiday, etc.), or the reason that you're writing this particular entry.

"
"
Decide what you want to write about.,
Time yourself.,
Start writing.,
Re-read what you've written.",How to Journal for Therapy2," Ask yourself what's going on in your life; how you feel; what you're thinking about; and what you want. Identify the issues and emotions that you need to explore. If you've been dwelling on something lately, there's a good chance that it will rise to the surface as the focus of your examination. Close your eyes and take a deep breath – inhale, then exhale. Review the ideas, events, or emotions that are most pressing.

, Write for 5-20 minutes, or as long as you feel inspired. Write the start time and the end time at the top of the journal page. Set an alarm on your phone, clock, or computer so that you don't need to keep checking the time. This way, you'll be able to fully immerse yourself in the writing process.


If set writing times aren't your style, feel free to write for as long as you like. The aim of a timed writing session is to practice the process of sustained writing. If you want to write something cumulative, there's nothing wrong with taking extra time to flesh out a thought – or with refraining from times at all.

, Set your pen to the page and don't take it away until the time is up. Try to channel the thoughts directly from the top of your brain. Try not to be critical of yourself while you are writing – this might take you out of the moment and impede your flow. Start with a simple topic sentence—something that sets the tone for everything else you'll write—as though you were starting a conversation with a friend. Review these example sentences:


Today was the greatest day that I've had in months. Where do I start?
I don't know what to do. I can't do this anymore.
I'm beginning to suspect that Dan is cheating on me.

, When you finish writing, read over your new journal entry. Write a sentence or two of reflection: “As I read this, I notice—” or “I’m aware of—” or “I feel—”. Consider whether there are any actions that you can take based on what you wrote. If so, figure out what you need to do to make them happen."
"
Journal what you feel.,
Evaluate your actions, your thoughts, and your emotions.,
Journal in conjunction with your therapy sessions.,
Don't be afraid to get creative.,
Go into detail.,
Give yourself writing prompts to stimulate your self-inspection.,
Think of your journal like a friend.,
Read through your journal regularly.",How to Journal for Therapy3," Whenever you have a strong emotion, record it in your journal. Write what you are feeling, what triggered that feeling, and what you're going to do about that feeling. Use your journal as a way to process feelings in the moment. If you feel overwhelmed, you might be able to release some of the tension by simply setting your thoughts down on paper.

, Write about what you did and how you did it. Write about what you thought and what you felt. Question what you did, and answer your own questions. Focus on the logical progression of your thought processes, and try to better understand yourself.Write about what you feel that you could or should have done; write about what you feel about what you chose to do; write about who you are; and write about what you want. Try to define your goals for the future, whether they are personal, professional, or otherwise.

, Record your thoughts about your most recent session, and take note of anything interesting that you learned. Experiment with journaling during your sessions, directly after your sessions, and later on when you reflect upon your experience. Set personal goals with your therapist, and use your journal to track them.


Some therapists are actually trained in journal therapy. If you'd like to explore journal therapy with an intentional and professional guiding hand, consider finding a licensed journal therapist in your area.

, If you feel that you can best express a thought by drawing it out, do not hesitate to do so. Use color! Paint, marker, crayon. Consider pasting photos, clippings, flowers, and other ephemera into your journal – anything that feels meaningful.


Try to incorporate scrapbooking. If your therapist gives you any worksheets or print outs of useful info, stick them in your journal! Use your journal as a scrapbook of self help techniques. Create lists of things that make you happy and triggers you should avoid.
Consider drawing ""mind maps"" to connect your ideas. Draw lines, arrows, or webs between related ideas. Find the themes that arc across your troubles, and try to identify the various ways in which they manifest.

, Later on, it can be easy to forget why you wrote or drew something. Push deeper, and try to flesh out your thoughts as thoroughly as possible. The more fully you examine your worries, the better you'll be able to understand them. The better you understand your worries, the more easily you'll be able to overcome them.

, Look for journal prompts on the Internet, ask a friend or a therapist for ideas, or try to come up with a few solid themes that you want to explore. Having a different question or journal prompt to answer each day can be a great way to keep up with writing. When you write to a prompt, you may feel more like you're writing to someone instead of just writing for yourself, and you may feel accountable to the journal structure. Consider these questions and more:


Are you proud of who you are? How would you like to be remembered?
What is a personality trait that you admire or seek in others – and why?
Think about something you feel obligated to do, daily or regularly. Why do you feel obligated?
What is the best advice that anyone's ever given you?, Journaling can simulate the feeling of pouring out your feelings to a close, trustworthy friend. Try to address your journal as though it's a close friend who anticipates each new entry; imagine that it is eager to learn of your progress through life, and that it cares about your emotional well being. The feeling of a one-on-one ""relationship"" can tap into the therapeutic effect of sharing experiences.

, Compare the things you have written recently with the things you wrote six months ago. Look for patterns, and try to chart your personal development. It may be difficult to go through the negative emotions again, but you will know you are progressing when you can remember these feelings without feeling swept away by them."

Don't let diary writing be a chore.,
Get a special, unique dairy.,
Write anything you want.,
See the point of a diary.,
Hide your diary.,
Make yourself future goals in your entries so you can look back at them in the future to see if you've accomplished them.",How to Enjoy Writing a Diary," The key to enjoy writing a diary is to write whenever you feel like it. Maybe something bad or great has happened in your life and you want to share it. A great place to share it is your diary. There are no laws or expectations as to how often you have to write in your diary. You can leave a diary for forty years and then return to it after a long diary break. See your diary as freedom.

, Your diary should reflect your personality. You should feel proud to open up your diary. Maybe you want a beautiful, colourful diary, or maybe just a notebook. You can even make your own home-made diary. Your diary can look plain on the outside, but decorated with pictures, drawings and photographs on the inside. Be creative.

, You aren't being judged, and nobody is reading your diary. You are free to write all your secrets, hopes, fears and dreams.

, A diary is a precious escape, where you can share anything and everything you want. You can look back on it in years to come, and review how you've evolved and changed. When everything is jumbled up into a messy knot in your head, by writing it down in a diary, you can undo this knot. So what are you waiting for?

, Your diary is full of your personal and private information. Nobody has the right to stick their nose into your world of secrets, so don't let them have the opportunity. Hide your diary well so that you know that it will never be found by anyone. Maybe you could write a fake diary to give people the wrong idea.

, It's fun and worthwhile.

Express your difficult feelings.,
Clarify your goals.,
Navigate your way forward.,
Process your thoughts and feelings.",How to Journal to Cope with Cancer1," A journal is a place to express your deep emotions, even the ones you’re scared to admit to others. Take the opportunity to express the difficult feelings that are hard to talk about to others. Explore your difficult emotions, even the ones you may not want to admit to yourself or others. This can help you process your experience and express your difficulties in a positive way.For example, write about how you feel about your treatments and any fears you have about death, dying, or suffering.
Purposefully processing and expressing emotions can positively affect adjustment and health, as found in breast cancer patients.This can be a difficult process, so plan on calling or meeting up with a friend after. Or, you can also plan a relaxing activity to help take your mind off of things, such as going to see a movie or taking a walk.;
, A journal can help you organize your thoughts and create goals.Especially if you’re facing a difficult decision regarding treatment, you may want to journal about your choices and how you feel about them. Think about what goals you have for treatment and beyond and begin to put them into place.


Writing about your indecision can help you make choices. For example, write your options and how you feel about them. Re-read your journal in a few days and see how you feel then. It may become clearer for you.
Be sure to include both short-term and long-term goals. It is also helpful to break up large goals into objectives or small steps to help you accomplish your goals. For example, if your goal is to earn a promotion at work, then you might identify some things you can do to work towards that goal, such as completing all of your assignments on time, volunteering for an important project, and cultivating positive relationships with your coworkers.

, Use your journal to create hope and things to anticipate in the future. Write down some positive affirmations for yourself, such as “I am a strong, resilient person and I will get through this.” This will help to prevent discouragement, self-loathing, and hopelessness. You can also journal about what you’re looking forward to and how you plan to continue once your treatment is over.You may wish to journal about what treatments are coming up and how you feel about them. You can also journal about what you might expect with treatments and how you will cope with changes.


For example, you may wish to journal about how you will deal with potentially losing your hair and how that will affect you.
You may have a goal of being cancer-free one year from now. Journal about what that would be like and how your life would change between now and then.

, You may wish to document your experience, but don’t forget to include your own thoughts and feelings in your journal. This is your space to express yourself. Write about things that make you feel scared, what makes you feel unsure, and your thoughts about treatment. While it can be difficult to share your thoughts and feelings with others, take advantage of the opportunity to safely share them in your personal writing.Make a point to write at least one thought and one feeling each day in your journal. For example, start with writing your mood or current feelings (“I feel anxious about my next treatment”) and write your thoughts about what may happen.
Include some things that you are grateful for as well, even if they are little things. For example, you might be grateful for a good cup of coffee, a beautiful sunrise, or time to catch up with a friend.

Join a journaling group.,
Share your writing with others.,
Reflect on your writing.,
Write your life experiences.",How to Journal to Cope with Cancer2," An online writing group for cancer patients helps people with cancer connect and share their stories. Often, these groups include prompts and the opportunity to share your writing with others. You can also read what others write and connect to each other’s experiences.Keep in mind that this is not helpful for everyone. It may make you feel better, but if it makes you feel sad then it might not be a good option for you.

Joining a writing group can help you connect with others and relate through sharing your journal entries.

, Having a blog is a great way to connect with others about your experience. If you’re hoping to help others relate to the experience of having cancer, a blog or public forum can unite people from around the globe. Maybe you want to help people see what it’s like to have cancer or go through treatments. Perhaps you want to shed light on the day-to-day experience of living with cancer. Whatever your goals, having your writing public allows others to interact and engage with your thoughts. Engaging with others can help you cope with your own experiences.


Start a blog, post in forums, or write in your social media profiles. However, keep in mind that people will respond and it may not be always be helpful. Think about how much you want to engage with people before posting. You can always delete people’s comments if you choose.

, Keeping a journal can be helpful in reflecting on your life during different stages. Use your older journal entries to help inform your current decisions.Especially if you’re working through difficult emotions or making tough decisions, writing about your experience then reflecting on it later can be helpful in informing what happens next.


You may wish to look through your journal of treatment once you’ve completed treatment. On the other hand, you may wish to burn your journal or toss it in the trash to symbolize that part of your life as over.

, If you’re at the end of life, you may wish to use a journal as a way to pass along your own life experiences and advice to family and friends. Reflecting on your life can be cathartic for you and helpful to others. Think about your experiences, what they’ve taught you, and how they’ve shaped you. Leave these notes as your legacy to others.


Write about defining moments in your life and difficult choices you’ve made. For example, talk about how your travels to South America helped you see people from different cultures as more like yourself than you had originally thought.

Figure out how you want to keep your journal.,
Create a comfortable space.,
Set aside time each day.,
Write what feels right.",How to Journal to Cope with Cancer3," You might want to have a pen and paper journal, or you may opt for a digital journal. Lots of websites allow you to keep online journals and toggle the privacy settings depending on your preferences. It’s up to you whether you want your journal to be private or if you want to share it with other people.Some phone applications are also available as journals. Try out different formats and styles to find what works well for you and your lifestyle. For example, if you like to have a journal on hand, a phone application may be handy. Yet, if you like to journal each morning or night, a pen and paper journal may be preferred.

, Because you will be writing your thoughts and feelings, it’s important for you to feel safe and comfortable in your atmosphere. Find a place that feels comfortable and where you will not be interrupted. You may want to write in your bedroom or at the kitchen table with a cup of tea. Some people like to go to a library or coffee shop to write. Find a place that feels comfortable to you.Don’t choose a place where you know you will be easily distracted. For example, you may not want to write in your living room if you know your children will interrupt you there.

, Get into the habit of journaling as a daily event. You may choose to journal first thing in the morning, after cancer treatments, or before going to bed. Perhaps you want to bring your journal along during treatments or appointments. Find a routine that you can easily follow to allow you to journal regularly.Some people find that journaling first thing in the morning helps to set the tone for a positive, peaceful day while other people find that it makes them too emotional and makes it harder to start the day. Try out different journaling times to find what works best for you.
Find a time when you feel creative and able to write. Make sure you are awake and energized enough to write meaningful content.

, You may want to start writing prompts, move onto free writing, then back to prompts. Don’t force your writing. Instead, let it flow naturally. If you start writing a prompt and then move into free writing, go with it. Don’t constrain yourself by feeling like you need to journal a certain way. Allow yourself to express what needs to be expressed without judgment. Write your thoughts and feelings as they arise. Don’t worry about grammar or spelling or what others might think if they read your journal.

Bring your journal with you.,
Find somewhere comfortable to write.,
Just write!,
Be calm about onlookers or questions.,
Avoid making a big deal out of it.",How to Journal in Public," You cannot write in it if you don't have it! When you're getting from place to place, though, consider stowing it in a purse or bag to avoid drawing too much attention to your private writing.;
, Writing in public can be a bit trickier than writing in the privacy of your room or office. Find a spot where you can sit and write comfortably, without being right in the center of attention. When you've got a good spot, take your journal out of your purse/bag/fanny pack and open it to a clean page.


If you want, before you start writing, you can go somewhere less busy, such as the corner of a party, or exit the room.

, Journal writing is a personal experience and pursuit, so you don't have to announce it. There's no guarantee someone will even notice.

, If someone notices, don't lie. Just say you have personal things to write down - you don't have to elaborate on what you're doing or why you're doing it now. Steer the conversation towards writing or journaling in general, without focusing on the private thoughts you're documenting (unless you want to). It may even start a conversation!

, Remember, there is nothing bad about keeping a diary or a journal. Just do your thing, and write down your thoughts when you feel the need. When you're done, you can return to whatever other activities you were doing before.


If public journal writing becomes a ""big deal"" for you for some reason, you can always hold off until you're in a private place. If desired, you can jot down a couple of basic words and thoughts while in public so that you don't forget them, and then elaborate on them in private.

Simply select a notebook with lined pages that you can easily transport from place-to-place. Moleskin notebooks work well. A decorative notebook, or one with existing sections, is not necessary for bullet journaling as you'll be organizing the notebook yourself.You can personalize the notebook a bit, however. For example, if you love the color blue, invest in a blue notebook.;
, You will be writing numbers on each page of your journal. Your index will help you track which sections fall on which pages. The first blank spread, meaning the first two blank pages that fall side by side, will be your index. To start, all you have to do is write ""Index"" on the top of both pages.You can write in pen or pencil, and in your chosen color. Pen may show up better, however, and darker colors are generally easier to read.

, Flip to the next blank spread in your journal. This will be your future log. Your future log is a way of getting a bird's eye view of tasks you need to complete within the next six months. It will include a month-by-month breakdown of events, tasks, and goals. To start, count the number of lines and divide that by three. For example, if each page has 24 lines make three sections on each page of eight lines each.Use a ruler to draw three straight lines across the spread, diving it into three equal sections on each page.

, For example, if you're starting your bullet journal for the new year, you would write, ""January"" in the first box, then ""February,"" and so on.


Write page numbers on the corners of each page. As your future log is your first section, the page numbers should be one and two. Flip back to your index and write something like, ""Future Log . . . 1-2.""

, Flip to the next blank spread in your journal. This will be your monthly log. It gives you an overview of a given month. Start with the current month and write the name of this month on the top of both pages.On the left page, write down every date of the month. After you finish, write down the abbreviation of the day of the week next to the number. For example, you would write ""January 1st, Sun.""
On the right page, jot down your task list for the month. Using bullet points, make a list of all the goals you hope to complete, any bills you have to pay, and any deadlines you need to meet. For example, you would write things like ""Pay the cable bill,"" and ""Complete draft of term paper.""

, When you're done, write page numbers on the corner of each page. Flip back to your index and add your monthly log to your index. For example, ""January Monthly Log... 3-4.""

, Flip to the next blank spread and write today's date on the top of the page. Use small bullet points to write down things you need to do that day, tasks you completed, and anything else of interest that occurred that day. Use as many lines as you need to log your daily activities. When the day ends, make a new entry the line below for the next day.A bullet journal is meant to be brief, so use short, simple sentences. For example, do not say, ""Today, I called the vet to discuss the cat's vaccinations, including the rabies vaccines that is due."" Instead, simply write, ""Called vet to ask about cat's vaccinations. Rabies due.""

, Signifiers are the types of bullet points you use in your journal. There are not set rules about establishing signifiers, and it heavily depends on the types of events you choose to journal. You can break down events into categories, such as work, school, bills, personal, creative projects, etc. Every type of event should have a different bullet point signifying its type. It's best to use as few categories as possible to keep things from getting confusing.For example, creative goals could be signified with a star. Work could be signified by a simple bullet point. Hobbies could be signified by an arrow. Bills could be signified by a small dollar sign, and personal could be signified by a heart.
As you track your goals on your daily calendar, use your signifiers. For example, an entry may look something like, ""$ Paid Cable Bill today.""

, It can also help to categorize monthly goals in your monthly log. Instead of having a random list of bullet points lumping everything you need to do together, organize further. Separate your tasks by type.For example, you could write headings like ""Weight and Fitness Goals,"" ""Deadlines and Due Dates,"" ""Work Goals,"" and ""Creative Goals.""
From there, write down tasks under their corresponding categories. Under ""Weight and Fitness Goals,"" for example, you could write something like, ""Visit the gym 12 times this month.""

, Collections are broad to-do lists that you want to accomplish over the course of a year. It basically includes anything that is not a log. For example, collections can include books you want to read, movies and TV shows you want to watch, recipes you want to try, and so on. It's good to fill out your collections page as ideas strike you, and you can refer to it later on when you need inspiration.For example, if a coworker suggests a book, write that down in the ""Books to Read"" section of your collections page. When you're choosing a new book, flip back to this section to remember the recommendation.

, As you track your day log, fill out events according to your preference. This depends heavily on why you're keeping the bullet journal. If it's primarily to organize work goals, for example, you can track what occurred at work each day. However, the journal does not have to be entirely professional. You can also record personal moments that made you smile. For example, ""Boyfriend brought me coffee during my lunch break.""Remember to make use of your personal signifiers as you fill out your journal.

, Each time you complete a task, flip back to your monthly log. Cross off the task on your broad to-do lists. This can help you track what you have accomplished and what you still need to accomplish for a given month., At the end of each month, review your monthly log and daily log. See which tasks you have completed and which still need to be done. Set up a new monthly and daily log, the same way you did before. Transfer the uncompleted tasks to the next log.However, you do not need to transfer all your tasks to the next month. If you see a task that's no longer worth your time, or that is too late to complete, cross it out. This will help you stay organized by trimming down unnecessary information.

, You want to continue building on your future log over time. As you glance through your daily and monthly logs for the past month, see what longterm tasks are included. For example, if you're working on a graduate thesis, it will likely pop up in your logs over time. Add things to your future log as necessary.For example, break down your thesis into small goals and jot them down in your future log. In February, you would write ""Complete draft"" and in March write ""Revise draft.""

, It can help to eventually make a project log or list in the back of your bullet journal. This can help you track long term projects. You can make a list that says something like ""Yearly Projects."" When reviewing each monthly log, flip back to this list. This will remind you of any short term goals regarding longstanding projects you should add to each month.For example, if a longterm goal is to be able to run 30 minutes without stopping, for one month you may write, ""Increase running time to 15 minutes.""

Keep your journal safe.",How to Keep a Journal," Decide how you want to keep your journal, either on paper or in electronic form. Both methods have advantages and drawbacks, so you'll need to weigh up what works best for you. For example, a paper based journal can be taken anywhere, never needs electricity, and can be highly personalized with drawings, collages, theater-tickets and mementos. It also can give you more ""pressure"" to edit your feelings. However, typing can be faster and easier in the electronic format, and an electronic document can still be personalized in different ways. Both journal types can be found if measures aren't taken to hide them well, but it's probably easier to hide an electronic file than a paper book.


While there is no need to get a fancy journal, for some people the stationery used is a large part of the sensory experience of keeping a journal. You don't have to buy expensive or fancy versions but if they are something you really want and they're a treat to yourself, then work it into your budget.
Decorating possibilities are endless for cheaper journals and it's fun to personalize a journal rather than rely on someone else's idea of good design. Just keep in mind that it's not about using a fancy book; it's about tapping into the stream of thoughts and writing them down.
Decide on your writing implement if using paper. Choose a pen that feels good to you and works for your own aesthetic needs.

, There are different possibilities open to you when developing your journal theme or approach. You could simply use your journal to write down all the thoughts that come to you at any particular time, randomly, or you could make your journal more focused on a specific theme to draw out something that you're trying to develop more of in your life. And there is nothing saying that you can't keep both a random and a specific journal at the same time! Some ideas for themed journals include:


A gratitude journal – in this journal you record all the things for which you feel grateful each day, week, etc. and note the people, animals, events, and things that really matter to you.
A vacation journal – in this journal you record more than just what you see on your vacation; you also record your feelings, impressions, and emotions as they are challenged, changed, and illuminated by your travels.
An ideas journal – in this journal you record all the ideas and inspirations that flash into your mind at any time without warning, providing a place that you can come back to as an idea-storming resource when you have the time. The ideas can be for writing, for business, for play, for inventions, for anything at all!
A child raising journal – in this journal you record all the things that you think are special, wonderful, lovable, and memorable about your kids at different ages and stages. This is a great way to keep a record of those funny words, phrases, and comments made by kids as they grow up and see the world anew.
A transition journal – in this journal you record the transition you're going through, such as job hunting or loss, becoming a parent for the first time or again after many years, starting a business, going on a special journey, etc. This type of journal can document changing patterns in your life, and it is useful to ask yourself such questions as ""What do I enjoy and not enjoy?"", ""What do I expect for the future in what I am doing now?"", ""Which people can help me as I transition?"", etc.

, Journal writing is a time of reflection and requires solitude, peace, and no interruptions. It's important to feel relaxed, at ease, and not worried about someone else barging in on your reflection time. It's also important to feel comfortable. Select your favorite journal writing spot or spots keeping in mind all of these essential needs and experiment by writing in different places to see what happens to the content of your writing.


Take a seat in your chair by the glowing fire or lie down underneath a blossoming apple tree.
Find a quiet part of the house where you know you won't be disturbed.
The suitability of a place can change with the time of day. Keep this in mind when selecting your writing nook; for example, the kitchen might be hubbub and bustle all day long but come 10pm, it might be the quietest and most enjoyable part of the house.

, Some of the advice on journal-writing tries to turn it into an effort by suggesting that you should commit to daily writing, or to some form of regular writing. This misses the point in keeping a journal, which is that it is an extension of you and how you're feeling. And if you don't feel like writing in your journal even though you made some commitment to yourself to write in it, it's possibly going to turn into something that you resent. Better than making a commitment to regular writing is to make a commitment to yourself that when you feel like using your journal to be creative, to vent feelings, to write down ideas, etc., then you will. And if that's daily, then good for you; if it skips a month or two or even a year here and there, then so be it. Many journal writers have journals spanning years with gaps of entire years between and pick them up again from where they last left off whenever they need the journal.


Keeping your journal by your bedside can be helpful if you find yourself forgetting to write in it. Often thoughts come before sleeping time and writing in a journal can be a helpful way to wind down at the day's end, provided it's a comfortable place for you.
Remind yourself whenever you feel down, antsy, brimful of ideas, etc., that your journal is the perfect outlet.

, Every person differs in what helps them to relax and feel contented, and it is no different when getting in the mood for journal writing. Some people enjoy having music to get them in the mood, others need total quiet, while others need the constant drone of city life to stimulate thinking. Choose whatever methods aid your escape into journal writing and doesn't make it feel like too much effort.


Don't fuss about grammar, spelling, or other perfection in your journal. This is your place, and if there are boo boos, then so be it. Wanting to erase errors while working through deep issues of feelings or having a wellspring of ideas can hamper your flow and also tends to suggest that you're trying too hard to control the situation you're writing about rather than to learn more about it and to find new ways to perceive it.

, It's often easiest to start with your current feelings. Transfer them to paper and see where this takes you next. There are no rules at all about journal writing and you may find that your starting points vary every time you begin a new entry. Sometimes it is easier to begin with a narrative about something that happened to you during the day, something that is burning right through you and that you want answers to but feel confused about. Writing down the mundane facts and events can open up a whole stream of consciousness as you're writing, leading you to insights you would not have been able to bring forth without arranging your thoughts in the journal. Other spurs to writing can include:


Try movies, books, or TV shows as a starting point sometimes: for example, you can consider the philosophical implications of your favorite movie, or write an essay about why you find this or that character compelling... or not.
Pretend you have an audience and you are the professor; give a lecture in what you want them to hear. Sometimes writing down events in your life that have taken place or writing down questions and answering them can waken the creative juices simmering in your mind.
Discuss something you bought or made during the past few days. Is it something that you're going to use for a new hobby, to help you complete an essay, to woo a person with, to decorate your home, etc.? Take the reason for buying or making it and proceed to write about the motivations behind it.

, Journals come top of the list when venting your troubles; many therapists rubber-stamp the journal as a key part of recovery from emotional distresses that patients are seeking to work through. A journal soaks up your anger, your rage, your vengeance, your jealousy, your whole plethora of negative emotions and doesn't judge you, doesn't shout back at you, doesn't curse you, and doesn't tell you to get a life. It sits there passive in one way but very revealing in another. Getting negative feelings off your chest and into a journal can liberate you from having to vent the feelings anywhere else, and can give you the necessary breathing space to try to see the facts beneath the emotions and to stand in the shoes of others involved in your feelings to see whether or not they have a point.


Feel free to curse, to call people names, and to let it all out. It's better here than anywhere else and it is a way of giving vent to frustration, anger, and attitude that needs an outlet somewhere safe.
Keep writing until you feel spent. This gives you the best chance of freeing yourself from the feelings that are haunting you and preventing you from moving on to more positive feelings.
Write about the guy you never think you'll get to date, write about the girl next door who keeps telling secrets about you, write about your parents or parents-in-law, or your family in general, write about your ambitions, your callings, your skills, your favorites; the list can go on and on.

, Of course, doodles are totally acceptable. Lyrics to songs, poems, book excerpts and newspaper clippings are also encouraged. It's sometimes fun to glue in little tidbits of your life, like the ticket stubs from a movie or play you saw on Friday night or the picture you took of a breathtaking sunset. The journal is the real-life manifestation of your mind, so make it something that's completely yours!

, It's not all write and no read; comparing where you are now with where your were several weeks, months, and years ago is a beneficial exercise in growth. Think about what things have become clearer to you from one journal entry to the next, and think about what hopes and dreams once written in your journal have now turned into reality. Think about the things that are yet to still happen and whether there are signs or patterns you can discern that are somehow blocking your intended progress. Use your journal to assess your life's journey.

, No one will see this journal but you have to make sure of that too. You'll only feel free to truly express yourself if the journal cannot compromise your relationships with others or how you're viewed, so be sure to find safe places to keep the journal.


Find perfect hiding places for your journal. Vary them regularly if you have concerns about anybody prying. Be clever about the cover too; perhaps make it appear like a chemistry textbook or accounting principles to throw off snooping siblings or spouses.
Learn how to lock access to electronic documents. If you're keeping your journal in electronic form, password protect your computer and your document. Be careful of cloud computing just in case some slip-up happens.
Write a simple beginning note for any prying eyes, just in case. Write something along the lines of ""Before you feel compelled to read my deepest thoughts, consider how you would feel if somebody did the same thoughtless and uncaring act to you. The karma be with you.""

Know the kinds of dashes.,
Identify an independent clause: Before you begin using a dash in a sentence, you must know what an independent clause is.,
Use the em dash: Understanding how to identify an independent clause, you're ready to begin using a dash.,
Put your sentences together: Now practice using a dash.,
Know the other ways to use a dash: Dashes are also used to offset lists placed in the middle of an independent clause, where commas are already used, for example:


All of my school work—physics, Academic Decathlon, sociology, and calculus—got washed away when my house was flooded.,
In dialogue, dashes are used to indicate interrupted speech.,
Dashes can also be used to emphasize a sentence.,
Type the dashes in correctly.,
Understand some common examples:


Wrong: We saw two movies at the theater today—but I didn’t really like either of them—.",How to Use a Dash in an English Sentence," A dash is noticeably longer than a hyphen. There are several different dashes, but the most commonly used are the en dash (–) and the em dash (—). They are so named because they are the same width as the small letter n and capital letter M, respectively.


The figure dash is a special typographical character most often used in phone numbers. Since it's normally unavailable in word processing, you can simply use a hyphen. (Example: 408‒555‒6792, or use 408-555-6792.)
An en dash (–) is most commonly used to indicate a range of numbers.It is longer than a hyphen although a hyphen with spaces surrounding it can be used if a dash is not available. In Microsoft Word, doing this will automatically change the hyphen into an en dash. (Example: August 13–August 18, or pages 29–349. Note that there should be no space around the en dash.)
An em dash is most often used to indicate a break in thought or to set an appositive off from the rest of the sentence. It can also be used to show a date when the time frame in question has not yet ended (Example: John Smith, 1976—).
The remainder of this article will address using the em dash.

, An independent clause is one that can stand on its own because it contains both a subject and a verb, for example:


I love pizza.
My mom makes me dinner.

,


Most commonly, a dash connects an independent clause with another, with a separate or interrupting thought plus a conjunction like or, but, yet, as, for, and after the second dash.
The dash works somewhat like parentheses or commas, but it is used where a stronger punctuation is needed. It can connect an independent clause with the 'interrupting' thought like so:

Independent clause—thought—independent clause.
Independent clause—thought.



, Here are some examples of a dash being used correctly:


I'd better have passed my test—it's ninety percent of my class grade—or I'll have to go to summer school.
Well, I passed the test—granted, I cheated—but I passed!
Abby gave me a terrible haircut—and she expected a tip!

,


Note: If there is only one appositive (which renames a noun), then you should set that off with commas, not dashes, for example:


The best waiter, Alain, can speak three languages.

,


""But I—But you said— ... wait, what?"" stammered Edna.

,


Of course, I'll sign a prenuptial agreement—as long as it's in my favor.

,

wikiHow or wikipedia: Use — to express an em dash. The & symbol (ampersand) lets the system know that a code may be coming up. The ; (semicolon) ends the code. Similarly, use – for an en dash.






When using a word processor, such as Microsoft Word, type two hyphens in between the words you wish to separate, leaving no spaces in between the words and the hyphens. The processor will automatically change the two hyphens into an em dash.







,

Right: We saw two movies at the theater today—I didn’t really like either of them.

Wrong: My best friend—Sam—went to the doctor with me today.

Right use of commas: My best friend, Sam, went to the doctor with me today.

Right use of the dash: Sam—even though she fears clinics terribly—went to the doctor with me today.Note: The last example using 'Sam' is not an appositive; the set off item is a subordinate clause.

Keep in mind you cannot copyright an idea.,
Be aware of what you can protect in terms of your written work.,
Note the small likelihood of someone stealing unpublished work.,
Gather written evidence of your work.,
Send the evidence to a trusted friend or colleague.,
Archive all your emails and documents relating to the written work.,
Register your work with the Writer’s Guild of America.,
Apply for a copyright from the United States Copyright Office.,
Place a copyright symbol on your written work.,
Submit your work to reputable editors and publishers.,
Consult an intellectual property attorney if you suspect your work has been stolen.",How to Protect Your Written Ideas and Stories," According to Section 102(b) of the Copyright Act, “In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated or embodied in such work.”This means that according to the law, you cannot copyright an idea or concept. You can attempt to sue someone for “idea misappropriation” if you believe they have stolen your idea or concept, but this can be difficult to prove in court.It can also be useful to remember that although you cannot protect your ideas, there is also a very slim chance that someone else will execute your idea the same exact way as you or as good as you and then sell it. This is why you should not be shy about sharing ideas with trusted friends, writing partners, and collaborators. Protecting your ideas, besides being impossible to do legally speaking, is also not as important as protecting your written stories.;
, As soon as your written work is put down on paper, it is copyrighted from that moment forward. Your written work does not need to be published in order to be protected and you do not need to place a copyright symbol on your written work for it to be protected. However, you may want to consider copyrighting your work with official bodies, such as the Writers Guild of America and the U.S. Copyright Office, to ensure it is protected in the event of a legal dispute.Copyrighting your work allows you to protect your execution or expression of your idea. This could be in the form of a short story, a novel draft, a script, or a film treatment. So while you cannot protect your ideas, you can protect your written stories through copyright.If you end up in court over your copyright, you will need to prove that you possessed your execution of the idea before someone else and that there are enough similarities between your execution and someone else’s execution to suggest your execution has been stolen. Registering your work for a legal copyright is one way to prove this. You should also collect evidence to show that you conceived the execution of your idea first., In order for someone to steal your unpublished writing and profit from it, they must somehow get a copy of your work, develop and package it for the market, and sell it to an editor or publisher. It must then be read and purchased by readers. At this point, the person who stole the work may not be able to stay below the radar and could be found out. There is a only small likelihood that someone would go through all this trouble to steal your unpublished work, no matter how good it might be.It’s important to remember how rare it is for unpublished work to get stolen and repackaged. Most writers view stealing other people’s writers as a lot of work and the consequences of getting caught may outweigh the trouble of doing it.
Protecting published writing may be more of a concern, though again, it is unlikely that someone will try to steal your writing word for word. You can use copyright and hard evidence to challenge someone in the event they try to steal your published work.

, One of the ways you can protect your work is by creating a paper trail that proves your work is yours in one place. This could be a copy of the novel summary or outline, a script treatment, and all of the existing drafts of your written work.You can gather all of this written evidence together in a computer folder or print them out and create a physical folder of evidence. Add to the folder as you continue to write and develop your ideas on paper. This folder will act as evidence of your rights to your work in the event of a dispute.
If you are using a computer folder, you should archive it and use password protection on it. This will ensure the folder is protected from any computer glitches or issues.

, Though you will have your own copy of the archive, it can also be useful to send the evidence via email or mail to a trusted friend of colleague. This way, in the event of a lawsuit, this person can come forward as a credible witness and provide their own copy of the evidence.This person could be your editor, your writing partner, your publisher, or a close friend or family member. Chose someone you can trust, preferably someone who is good at saving and preserving important documentation.

, Save all your emails and any related documentation where you discuss the written work with others or send copies of the written work to others. This will ensure you have access to all documents relating to the written work and have a record of who had access to the written work.You should also keep a detailed account of any meetings or in person discussions you had with individuals about the written work. This will ensure you have a record you can refer to later in the event of a dispute around ownership of the written work.

, This option is useful if you have a final draft of a script that you want to protect. Registering your script with the WGA will allow you to create a public record of your claim to authorship.You can register with the Writers Guild of America, West  , based in Los Angeles, and/or the WGAeast, based in New York. To register your script, you will need to mail in a package that contains the title page of the material and your name, one unbound copy of the material and a check for the registration fee. You can also complete the registration process online on the WGA website.
The WGA charges $10 for members of the guild, and $20 for non-members at WGAwest, $22 for non-members at the WGAeast.

, Another option is to register your written work with the U.S. Copyright Office. Registering your work through the U.S. Copyright Office can come in handy in the event you have a legal dispute over ownership of your written work.You can find more information about copyrighting your work through the Copyright Office website or through the mail. The fee for registering your work with the U.S. Copyright Office is $30., If you are worried about your work getting stolen and want to have an extra layer of copyright, you can place a copyright notice on the upper right corner of your document. It should appear as: Copyright © 20XX by (your name).Keep in mind some editors and publishers consider placing a copyright notice on your written work amateurish and a rookie move. Most editors and publishers are aware of the rules around protection of your work, as your work is protected the moment is put down on paper. So they may view the copyright notice as unnecessary.

, Perhaps one of the most effective ways to ensure your work is protected is to always submit work to reputable editors and publishers. Avoid editors who want you to sign away the rights to your work right away or publishers who do not produce quality materials (for example, self-publishers and publishers of low end e-Books).Reputable editors and publishers will also not likely try to steal your ideas from you and resell it or repackage it. Most big publishers and editors do not want to get involved in a stolen work dispute, as it will end up being bad press and a legal hassle for them.

, If you are concerned that your written stories have been stolen or repackaged by another writer, you should consult an intellectual property attorney. The attorney can advise you on what you can do to protect your ownership of the work and prove your ownership in court.If you are negotiating any legal agreements with a publisher or a literary agent in terms of the rights to your writing, you should also consider hiring a lawyer. This will ensure you and your work are protected and you receive the best deal for your work.

Try to add the following information to the entries: date, time, location, weather, temperature (how it feels) people present, good things, bad things, what you ate, what you did, (try to write down things that are common, like you just washed your hair, these make the entry more lifelike), what you feel (love, nausea, etc...), thoughts, ideas, things you're looking forward to and those you don't.;

And it's a good idea to think a little bit about what kind of journal you want to make, so that you can get an appropriately-sized book along with all the materials you'll need. Some ideas of how to approach your own nature journal include:


Simply record all your excursions into nature. Write down what you see, feel and notice; add photos as well if wished.
Create a nature journal that just focuses on a certain place (such as a river, a park, a secret bush hideout your backyard) or on living beings (such as redwood trees, monkeys, cockroaches).
Create a nature journal to chronicle a particular trip.
There are also several types of journals that are generally used for more specific scientific purposes, such as Grinnell journals and phenology journals (see the ""Tips"" section below).;
, The majority of nature journals are compiled using pads or books of plain white paper. Lined paper generally interferes with sketching, but it may be suitable for your purposes and it is possible to find some books with a division on each page that includes both plain paper and lined paper. Or, you can put loose sheets in a binder or buy a pad (or specially-made journal) that's already bound. Since you'll be taking your journal into the elements, you'll want to make sure it's sturdy and protected. While some paper is waterproofed, most will need to be protected by a book cover or a plastic bag.


If you can afford it, choose strong, high-quality paper. Even if you can't invest in good paper, ensure that the pages are well secured, either in good book binding or spiral binding.
Look for a journal book that has an interesting and high quality cover, or make your own cover to protect your journal's contents.
Consider any special needs. Perhaps any old pad will do for your purposes, but think it through.
If you want to make very large drawings, for example, make sure you have a big enough journal, but if backpack space is at a premium, go with a smaller one.
If you want to include watercolor paintings, get appropriate paper, and if you're going to paste photos or souvenirs in your journal, consider getting archival paper.
If you're going someplace very wet, perhaps you'd best go with a waterproof pad.

, You don't need a lot of equipment to keep a nature journal. A journal and a pencil will do just fine if you simply want to write in your journal and make sketches. If you want to do more colorful drawings, get crayons or colored pencils or maybe even a watercolor set. If you want to paste photos or found objects into your journal, get some appropriate adhesive or photo tabs. If you've got a lot of equipment, you may want a special case or binder to keep it all together. Again, just think about your needs and your budget and customize your journaling set.

, Finding time to keep a journal or diary of any kind can be difficult, and nature journals are no different. Depending on the plan for your journal, though, you can be flexible. Perhaps you just want to go out one day on the weekends, or perhaps you just want to keep your journal while on a camping trip. If you're doing fieldwork, of course, you'll probably need to make an entry in your journal at least once a day. Whatever you do, make sure you actually use your journal.


Keep your journal somewhere that is easy to access. This will encourage you to use it more often, especially if it's somewhere easily noticed.

, Creating a nature journal is much less about writing and drawing than it is about observing. No matter where you live, you can observe nature in some form. Get out and watch. Sit silently or take a leisurely stroll, and contemplate your environment or your chosen subject. Don't worry about writing or drawing right away; just pay attention.

, A nature journal is most valuable if you use it in the field to record your observations as you are observing them. If you rely on your memory to write in your journal later, chances are your journal will be less accurate and you might not be as encouraged to concentrate on your environment in the field.


Add your nature journal to any lists of things to take for hikes, camping trips, vacations, etc. That way, you're less likely to forget to take it with you to new locations.

, Like any journal, you'll want to be able to look back at your nature journal and know exactly when and where you were when you wrote each entry. If your journal is for scientific purposes, you'll need to be very specific, and you may need to include other basic information, such as weather specifics.

, A lot of people consider themselves bad artists, and you may be one of them. No matter what your current artistic ability, you should at least try to do some sketches of plants, animals, or scenes that you observe. For one thing, drawing (or attempting to draw) an accurate rendition of something helps you to focus on that thing more deeply than you would otherwise. Draw a plant, for example, and you're naturally forced to pay attention to the shapes of the leaves, the differences between each leaf, the many different colors, and other details that you might otherwise miss. Thus, it's not particularly important to draw well – drawing simply helps you observe better. Of course, if you're recording your observations for scientific research or to help you identify a plant when you get home, the quality of the drawing does count. Fortunately, your drawings will get better with time and practice, so don't give up.



Take pictures. If you just can't bring yourself to draw, photograph your subject. Even if you're a great artist, you may want to add photographs to your journal from time to time. Photographs can be useful, creative, and sometimes absolutely necessary, but be sure to at least try doing some drawing, too. If you're going to take pictures, be sure to leave some space in your journal to paste them in later.

, What and how you write should be customized to the purpose of your journal, but for a general-purpose nature journal, you can write just about anything.



Be descriptive. Try to ignore what you know about things you see, and write about them as though you're seeing them for the first time. Be as descriptive as possible so that another person could pick up your journal 100 years from now and be able to picture the bird you wrote about and learn about it even if that bird no longer exists. While this may seem silly, keep in mind that antique nature journals have provided us with much of what we know about some of the many animals that became extinct in the past two centuries. You may wish to go into great detail about one particular plant, or you may wish to write only about the characteristics of the entire environment. Try to get the basics down, such as the weather and environment you're in, and then write about whatever interests you.
Write how you feel. If you feel awestruck by a mountain or calmed by the sight of a bee on a flower, go ahead and put that in your journal. A nature journal gives you an opportunity to respond to the natural world, and writing your response can help you understand who you are – and maybe even your place in the universe.
Don't censor yourself; don't edit as you go along. Just let your thoughts flow freely onto the paper.
Choose your own style. You may develop a consistent style for each entry into your journal, or you may just write and sketch in whatever manner feels right at the moment. How you write and how you structure your journal are choices that you alone can make (unless you're working on a school or work assignment). Some people like to write their entries as though they're writing a letter to a friend or to themselves. Others like to include poems or little stories. Just write.

, A journal can be a catalyst to learning. Once you've gone out and observed things in nature, go back home or visit the library and read more about what you've seen, especially if something in particular interested you or if you have unanswered questions. For example, you may see a plant you're not familiar with. Armed with your sketch and description of the plants, you can then look it up when you get back to ""civilization."" Use your journal to write down any questions you have – What was that bird doing when it kept moving its head up and down? Why was the grass so much shorter on one side of the hill? – and try to find the answers to these questions.


If you're keeping a journal on a specific organism or ecosystem, you'll probably find it beneficial to do as much research as you can before you go out in the field.

, From time to time you may wish to consult your past journal entries for a specific reason. Perhaps you'd like to revisit a particular time in your life, or maybe you need some to compare your observations for a scientific paper. In any case, reading your nature journal can be a great learning experience, and it can be a lot of fun. You can relive days long gone by just by flipping the pages, or you can see how your attitudes and writing styles have changed over time.

,How to Improve Your Writing Skills1,
"
Use active instead of passive voice.,
Use strong words.,
Cut the chaff.,
Show, don't tell.,
Avoid clichés.,
Avoid generalizations.,
Back up what you say.,
Use metaphors and similes with caution.,
Break the rules.,
Edit, edit, edit.",How to Improve Your Writing Skills2," One of the most common manifestations of bad writing is overuse of the passive voice. In English, the most basic sentence structure is S-V-O: Subject-Verb-Object. “The zombie bit the man” is an example of this sentence structure. The passive voice can cause confusion by putting the object first: “The man was bitten by the zombie.” It usually requires more words and use of a “to be” verb form, which can suck the energy out of your writing. Learn to avoid these constructions as much as you can.Using the passive voice isn't always bad. Sometimes there is no clear way to make a statement active, or sometimes you want the lighter touch a passive construction allows. But learn to follow this rule before you start making exceptions.
The main exception to this is science writing, which conventionally uses the passive voice to put the emphasis on the results, rather than the researchers (although this is changing, so check the guidelines before you write). For example, “puppies fed spicy dog food were found to have more upset stomachs” puts the emphasis on the finding rather than the person doing the finding., Good writing, whether it’s in a novel or a scholarly essay, is precise, evocative and spiced with the unexpected. Finding the right verb or adjective can turn an uninspired sentence into one people will remember and quote for years to come. Look for words that are as specific as possible. Try not to repeat the same word over and over unless you are trying to build a rhythm with it.


One exception to this is the words used to describe dialogue. Bad writing is filled with ""he commented"" and ""she opined."" A well-placed ""sputtered"" can work wonders, but most of the time a simple ""said"" will do. It may feel awkward to use the word ""said"" over and over, but changing it up unnecessarily makes it harder for your readers to get into the back-and-forth flow of the conversation. “He said/she said” becomes nearly invisible to your readers after a while, allowing them to stay focused on the characters’ voices.Strong doesn't mean obscure, or more complicated. Don't say ""utilize"" when you could say ""use."" ""He sprinted"" is not necessarily better than ""he ran."" If you have a really good opportunity to use ""ameliorate,"" go for it—unless ""ease"" is just as good there.
Thesauruses can be handy, but use them with caution. Consider the predicament Joey from Friends gets into when he uses a thesaurus without also consulting a dictionary: “They’re warm, nice people with big hearts” becomes “They’re humid, prepossessing homo sapiens with full-sized aortic pumps.”If you’re going to use a thesaurus to spice up your vocabulary, look up your new words in the dictionary to determine their precise meaning.

, Good writing is simple, clear and direct. You don't get points for saying in 50 words what could be said in 20, or for using multi-syllable words when a short one does just as well. Good writing is about using the right words, not filling up the page. It might feel good at first to pack a lot of ideas and details into a single sentence, but chances are that sentence is just going to be hard to read. If a phrase doesn't add anything valuable, just cut it.Adverbs are the classic crutch of mediocre writing, and they often serve only to clutter up a sentence. A well-placed adverb can be delightful, but much of the time the adverbs we use are already implied by the verb or adjective—or would be if we had chosen a more evocative word. Don't write ""screamed fearfully"" -- ""scream"" already suggests fear. If you notice that your writing is filled with ""-ly"" words, it might be time to take a deep breath and give your writing more focus.Sometimes cutting the chaff is best done at the editing stage. You don't have to obsess about finding the most concise way to phrase every sentence; get your ideas down on paper however you can and then go through to edit out unnecessary stuff.
Your writing doesn't just exist in a vacuum—it's experienced in conjunction with the reader's imagination. You don't need to describe every detail if a few good ones can spur the reader's mind to fill in the rest. Lay down well-placed dots and let the reader connect them.

, Don’t tell your readers anything that could be shown instead. Instead of just sitting your readers down for a long exposition explaining a character's background or a plot-point's significance, try to let the readers discover the same ideas through the words, feelings and actions of your characters. Especially in fiction, putting this classic piece of writing advice into practice is one of the most powerful lessons a writer can learn.For example, “Sydney was angry after reading the letter” tells the reader that Sydney felt angry, but doesn’t give us any way to see it for ourselves. It’s lazy and unconvincing. “Sydney crumpled the letter and threw it into the fireplace before she stormed from the room” shows that Sydney was angry without having to say it outright. This is far more effective. Readers believe what we see, not what we’re told.

, Clichés are phrases, ideas or situations that have been used so often that they’ve lost any impact they once had.They’re also usually too general to leave a lasting impression on your reader. Whether you’re writing fiction or nonfiction, cutting clichés out of your work will make it better.""It was a dark and stormy night"" is a classic example of a clichéd phrase—even now a clichéd concept. Compare these similar weather-related opening lines:“It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.”—1984, by George Orwell. It's not dark, nor stormy, nor night. But you can tell right from the start something's not quite right in 1984.
“The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.”—Neuromancer, by William Gibson, in the same book that gave us the word ""cyberspace."" This not only gives you the weather report, it does so in such a way that you are immediately placed into his dystopian world.
""“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.”—A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens. Weather, emotion, damnation, and despair—Dickens covered it all with an opening line that leaves the reader ready for anything.


Clichés are also important to avoid when you’re writing about yourself. Saying you’re a “people person” says nothing definite about you. Saying you’re able to communicate well with a variety of people because you grew up in a bilingual family and lived in six countries growing up lets your reader know you’re a “people person” without you relying on lazy language.

, One of the hallmarks of sloppy writing is broad generalizations. For example, an academic essay might say something like “In modern times, we are more progressive than people a hundred years ago.” This statement makes a host of unfounded assumptions and doesn’t define important ideas like “progressive.” Be precise and specific. Whether you’re writing a short story or a scholarly essay, steering clear of generalizations and universal statements will improve your writing.This applies to creative writing, too. Don’t allow yourself to assume anything without examining it. For example, if you’re writing a story about a female character, don’t assume that she would automatically be more emotional than a man or more inclined to be gentle or kindly. This kind of non-examined thinking keeps you in a creative rut and prevents you from exploring the variety of possibilities that real life presents.

, Don’t speculate without providing evidence for your assertions. In creative writing terms, this is similar to the “show, don’t tell” principle. Don’t just say that without a strong police force society as we know it would break down. Why is that true? What evidence do you have? Explaining the thinking behind your statements will allow readers to see that you know what you’re talking about. It will also help them determine whether they agree with you.

, While a good metaphor or simile can give your writing punch and vigor, a bad one can make your writing as weak as a baby. (That, by the way, was a weak simile.) Overusing metaphors and similes can also suggest that you aren’t confident with what you’re saying and are relying on figures of speech to explain your ideas. They can also become clichéd really quickly.


A “mixed” metaphor mixes two metaphors so that they don’t make sense. For example, “We’ll burn that bridge when we come to it” mixes the common metaphor “We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it” and “Don’t burn bridges.” If you’re not sure how a metaphor goes, look it up -- or skip it altogether.

, The best writers don't just follow the rules—they know when and how to break them. Everything from traditional grammar to the writing advice above is up for grabs if you know a transgression will improve your piece. The key is that you have to write well enough the rest of the time that it's clear you are breaking the rule knowingly and on purpose.


As with everything, moderation is key. Using one rhetorical question to create a punchy opening can be very effective. Using a string of six rhetorical questions would quickly diminish their effect. Be choosy about when and why you break the rules.

, Editing is one of the most essential parts of writing. Once you finish a piece of writing, let it sit for a day and then read it over with fresh eyes, catching confusing bits or scrapping whole paragraphs—anything to make your piece better. Then when you are done, give it another read, and another.


Some people confuse “editing” with “proofreading.” Both are important, but editing focuses on considering what your content is and how it works. Don’t become so attached to your wording or a particular idea that you aren’t willing to change it if you discover that your ideas would be more clear or effective presented in another way. Proofreading is more technical and catches errors of grammar, spelling, punctuation, and formatting.

Pick up a good book or ten.,
Map the allusions that run through your culture.,
Make sure you understand why a classic work is considered great.,
Attend the theatre.,
Read magazines, newspapers, and everything else.,
Know when to put down your influences.",How to Improve Your Writing Skills3," Whether you’re writing the next Great American Novel or a scientific journal article, becoming familiar with examples of excellent writing in your genre will help you improve your own writing. Read and understand the works of great and influential writers to learn what is possible with the written word and what readers respond to best. By immersing yourself in works by good writers, you will expand your vocabulary, build knowledge, and feed your imagination.Look for different ways of organizing a piece of writing or presenting a narrative.
Try comparing different author's approaches to the same subject to see how they are alike and how they differ. For example, Tolstoy's Death of Ivan Ilych, and Hemingway's The Snows of Kilimanjaro.
Remember that even if you’re writing nonfiction or academic writing, reading examples of great writing will improve your own. The more familiar you are with the many ways it’s possible to communicate ideas, the more varied and original your own writing can become.

, You might not realize it, but books, movies and other media are filled with references and homages to great literature. By reading some classics, you will build a body of cultural knowledge that will better inform your own writing.

, It's possible to read a novel like The Catcher in the Rye and not ""get it"" or see its value immediately. If this happens, try reading an essay or two about the piece to learn why it was so influential and effective. You may discover layers of meaning that you missed. Understanding what makes great writing great is one of the best ways to grow your own skills.


This applies for nonfiction and academic writing too. Take some examples of work by well-respected authors in your field and take them apart. What do they have in common? How do they work? What are they doing that you could do yourself?

, Plays were written to be performed. If you find that you just don’t “get” a work of literature, find a performance of it. If you can’t find a performance, read the work aloud. Get yourself into the heads of its characters. Listen to how the language sounds as you read it.


More than a movie ever can be, a theatrical performance is like words come to life, with only the director's interpretation and the actor's delivery as filters between the author's pen and your ears.

, Literature isn't the only place to get ideas—the real world is filled with fascinating people, places and events that will inspire your writerly mind. A great writer is in touch with the important issues of the day.

, It happens all the time: you finish an awesome novel, and it leaves you fired up to get cracking on your own writing. But when you sit down at your desk, your words come out sounding unoriginal, like an imitation of the author you were just reading. For all you can learn from great writers, you need to be able to develop your own voice. Learn to cleanse your palate of influences with a free writing exercise, a review of your past works, or even just a meditative jog.

Buy a notebook.,
Write down any ideas that come to you.,
Fill up your notebook and keep going.,
Join a writing workshop.,
Write every day.",How to Improve Your Writing Skills4," Not just any notebook, but a good sturdy one you can take with you anywhere. Ideas happen anywhere, and you want to be able to capture those oft-fleeting ideas before they escape you like that dream you had the other night about...um...it was...uh...well it was really good at the time!

, Titles, subtitles, topics, characters, situations, phrases, metaphors—write down anything that will spark your imagination later when you're ready.


If you don’t feel creatively inspired, practice taking notes about situations. Write down the way people work at a coffee shop. Note how the sunlight strikes your desk in the late afternoon. Paying attention to concrete details will help you be a better writer, whether you’re writing poetry or a newspaper article.

, When you finish a notebook, put a label on it with the date range and any general notes, so you can refer back to it when you need a creative kick in the pants.

, One of the best ways to improve your writing and stay motivated is to talk with others and get feedback on your work. Find a local or online writing group. In these groups members usually read each other's writing and discuss what they liked, didn't like and how a piece might be improved. You may find that offering feedback, as well as receiving it, helps you learn valuable lessons to build your skills.


Workshops aren’t just for creative writers! Academic writing can also be improved by having friends or colleagues look at it. Working with others also encourages you to share your ideas with others and listen to theirs.

, Keep a diary, mail a pen pal, or just set aside an hour or so for free writing. Just pick a topic and start writing. The topic itself doesn't matter—the idea is to write. And write. And write some more. Writing is a skill that takes practice, and it’s a muscle that you can strengthen and nourish with the right training."

Write the final draft.",How to Improve Your Writing Skills5," It doesn't have to be complex, just a way to get your head around the direction of the plot. For example, that classic Hollywood story line: boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again. (The chase scenes are added later.)

, It can be tempting to just start writing and try to figure out twists and turns of your plot as you go along. Don't do it! Even a simple outline will help you see the big picture and save you hours of rewriting. Start with a basic arc and expand section by section. Flesh out your story, populating it with at least the main characters, locations, time period, and mood.


When you have part of an outline that will take more than a few words to describe, create a sub-outline to break that section into manageable parts.

, Give each of them a little story of their own, and even if you don't add that info into your story, it will give a sense of how your character might act in a given situation.

, If you suddenly have a brilliant idea about how to resolve a situation near the end, but you're still on Chapter 1, write it down! Never let an idea go to waste.

, You're now ready to start your ""sloppy copy,"" otherwise known as your first draft! Using your outline, flesh out the characters and the narrative.


Don’t let yourself get bogged down here. It’s not crucial to find exactly the perfect word when you’re drafting. It’s much more important to get all your ideas out so you can tinker with them.

, Let your story have its say, and you may find yourself heading in unexpected, but very interesting directions. You're still the director, but stay open to inspiration.


You’ll find that if you’ve thought sufficiently about who your characters are, what they want, and why they want it, they’ll guide how you write.

, Don't get caught up in fine tuning things yet, just let the story play out on paper. If you realize 2/3 of the way through the story that a character is really the Ambassador to India, make a note, and finish the story with her as the Ambassador. Don't go back and start re-writing her part till you're done with the first draft.

, First draft, remember? Now you get to write it from the beginning, this time knowing all the details of your story that will make your characters much more real and believable. Now you know why he's on that airplane, and why she is dressed like a punk.

, By the time you are done with the second draft, you will have all the information about your story, your characters, the main plot, and the subplots defined.

, Now that you've finished the second draft, it's time to read it—dispassionately, if possible, so that you can at least try to be objective. Share it with a couple trusted friends whose opinions you respect.

, Armed with notes from your reading the story, plus notes of your friends or publishers, go through your story one more time, finalizing as you go. Tie up loose ends, resolve conflicts, eliminate any characters that do not add to the story.

Understand the difference between formal and informal English.,
Use appropriate punctuation.,
Avoid common colloquial words and expressions (colloquialisms), such as ""cute"" (use ""adorable""), ""yeah"" (use ""yes""), ""how-do-you-do,"" and ""movie"" (use ""film""), as listed below or labeled as such in your dictionary.,
Delete emotion or opinion words.,
Avoid clichés to be formal.Formal writing tries to use literal language that will not be misunderstood by any of the readers.,
Avoid stage directions.,
Avoid vague words such as ""good,"" ""bad,"" and ""nice."",
Avoid phrasal verbs such as ""put up with"" or ""make up."",
Use proper grammar.,
Always include the relative pronoun in formal writing.,
Develop short, choppy sentences into longer, more graceful sentences.",How to Avoid Colloquial (Informal) Writing," Formal and informal writing are intended for different audiences. For instance, an informal letter written to a friend seeks to create a friendly, conversational tone and may use contractions (e.g., ""don't,"" ""we'll,"" and ""let's""), slang (e.g., ""awesome"" or ""cool""), and informal grammar (e.g., ""It's me, Susan"" or ""Who did you vote for yesterday?""). By contrast, a formal letter written to an employer should be free of colloquialisms and use proper grammar and punctuation. Formal and informal English differ in diction and grammatical structures. Informal English may include colloquialisms such as ""contraption,"" ""fire,"" ""kid,"" ""how come,"" and ""quote"" as a noun. A formal writer might prefer ""device,"" ""dismiss,"" ""child,"" ""why,"" and ""quotation."" Informal writing may sound more like conversation, whereas formal writing may be more polished. An informal style may make listeners feel more comfortable when you are speaking, but a formal writing style can make a good impression.

, For example, American English employs a colon in a formal letter as in “Dear John:” but British English employs a comma.Limit parentheses, exclamation points, and dashes (prefer colons) in formal writing. Avoid the ampersand (&); write out the word “and.” Punctuate your writing as you go along to reduce your risk of leaving out punctuation.

, This includes slang such as ""cool,"" ""dude,"" and ""humongous"" as well as short forms such as ""TV,"" ""phone,"" and ""fridge."" Two good phrases to delete are ""you know"" and “you might be thinking.” You do not have the power to know your readers’ thoughts while they read your paper. Another empty sentence is “Think about it.” Assume that your readers are already thinking about what they are reading, and state your point more clearly. The adverb “pretty,” meaning “relatively,"" ""fairly,"" or ""quite,” is unacceptable in formal writing and is often unnecessary.

, Formal writing should be as objective as possible. Try to present a fair, balanced view of the issue on which you are writing. Note that ""balanced"" does not necessarily mean devoting equal amounts of space to each side, since one side may be much stronger than the other. This also means limiting first- and second-person pronouns. The use of ""you"" and ""your"" can sometimes make your writing seem too personal or even emotional. Avoid writing ""We should all..."" because when we use this phrase, we assume that everyone will act in the same way. Another phrase to avoid is ""I think that...""; instead provide compelling reasons for why you think so. Also avoid saying that you like or love anything; instead focus on the reasons why you love it. Instead of writing ""I love Osmosis Jones because it teaches children about the human body,"" you could write, ""Osmosis Jones is a powerful teaching tool that shows children how the human body works.""

, Clichés can make your writing unoriginal, but they can sometimes be fun in casual writing, especially as an original play-on-words called an anti-cliché. Here are some clichés to avoid in formal writing:


Hercules was as strong as an ox.
I have to give an arm and a leg to find a parking spot during the holiday season.
It was as pretty as a picture.

, Do not commence a letter by telling the recipient what you plan to do in the letter or begin an essay by telling the reader what the paper will discuss.


""I am writing to you to ask you to. . . .""
""This paper is going to talk about how. . . .""

, Consider using more vivid words such as ""beneficial,"" ""deleterious,"" and ""pleasant."" Do not end a list with ""etc."" or ""et cetera"" in formal writing. If those extra examples that you did not list are important enough that you felt the need to write ""et cetera,"" you may want to consider including them. Eliminate words such as ""a few"" or ""enough"" and discuss precise numbers and quantities.

, Instead, choose strong verbs such as ""tolerate"" or ""compose.""

, In particular, check your use of pronouns, such as ""I"" and ""me"" and ""who"" and ""whom."" Make sure that all of your verbs agree with their subjects. A common mistake is to use a plural verb when a single verb is needed: ""A group of these voters is concerned about global warming."" Look for dangling participles (e.g., ""Shaded by a palm tree, the waiter brought me a tropical drink""), split infinitives (e.g., ""to boldly go""), and terminal prepositions (e.g., ""Whom did you send the letter to?""). Avoid starting sentences with coordinating conjunctions such as ""and"" or ""but""; use other types of transitions instead.

, You can also rephrase the sentence to remove the pronoun. Be sure to use ""that"" for things and ""whom"" for people (since this relative pronoun will always be the object).


""This is the poem John wrote.""
""This is the poem that John wrote."", or ""John wrote this poem"".
""These are the people we love most.""
""These are the people whom we love most."", or ""We love these people the most"".

, Formal writing generally uses longer sentences: compound, complex, and compound-complex sentences. You can develop two or more simple sentences into one of the previously listed sentence structures. Long sentences add variety to your writing and can be particularly effective when paired with short sentences; the contrast grabs the readers' attention. As the last sentence shows, you also can use a semicolon to join two simple sentences, provided that they are closely related to each other.

Plan before you speak.,
Know your audience.,
Convey the central idea first.,
Skip unnecessary details.,
Use active descriptions.,
Stay focused.,
Pay attention to your speech.,
Practice speaking concisely.",How to Be Concise1," Choose what you want to say before you say it. This will help you convey the most important points without beating around the bush. If you are giving a speech, write out a script and stick to it. If you are speaking off the cuff, take a brief moment to plan out the most important parts of what you want to say.


Think about how you would say something if you only have a few minutes. What do you need to include? What can you leave out?
For example, if you are giving a project update in a meeting, you probably don’t need to discuss all of the steps you took to work on something. Instead, talk about the results that you’ve achieved on the project so far.;
, It’s important to know who is listening to you speak. This will help you determine how much explanation you need to give, or how you can cut corners.


For example, if you are talking with a colleague who understands your work, you don’t need to spend a lot of time explaining basic concepts. If you are speaking to a crowd who is unfamiliar with your work, you might need to describe more.

, Start your talk with the most important idea. Give your audience the main headline of what you want to say. This also helps your audience follow your line of thinking. Your most important point won’t get lost.


People tend to listen most closely to the first 30 seconds of a speech, so make this first part count., Think about the details that the listener needs to know. Unless it is directly relevant, the listener probably doesn’t need to know the life history of someone in your story, or the color of a dog’s collar. Leave out these types of details.

, Choose meaningful words that say a lot. Stay away from passive sentence constructions, such as “There are” and “We have.” Make declarative statements that get to the point immediately. Choose ways of speaking that pack a lot of meaning in fewer words.

, Try not to get distracted when you’re speaking. Stay on topic without going off on a tangent about something not directly related to the topic at hand.

, Start listening to how long it takes you to get to the point. This will help you start figuring out where you can trim words and tendencies from your speech. Then you can work on being concise.Do people often ask you to repeat yourself?
Do you often use “What I mean is…” when speaking to clarify your points?
Do you use words like “um” and “uh” a lot?

, When you are confident with your speaking skills, you are more likely to speak concisely and directly. If you feel nervous or you lack confidence, your speech may start to fill with “ums” and “uhs.”


Try practicing in front of a trusted friend. This person can give you feedback on your speech.

Plan out what you want to write.,
Consider your audience.,
Know your word limit.,
Write in active language.,
Make each word serve a purpose.,
Use the two-line rule.",How to Be Concise2," Wordiness or vagueness can occur when you're unsure of what you want to say. Avoid a lack of clarity by making an outline before you write.


Pinpoint your main point and follow it with 3-5 supporting points.

, Think about who will read your writing. Write appropriately so that your audience will catch your meaning.


For example, if you are writing something technical, consider the comprehension level of your audience. You may need to use space to explain concepts.
If you write a letter to the editor, keep in mind that your letter may be trimmed down anyway. Don’t let your letter’s meaning get changed because the newspaper editor cut out half of your words.

, Most assigned written work has a word limit. This limit forces you to be concise. If you are not assigned a word limit, impose your own limit.Think about an appropriate length so that your reader won’t get bored.

, Active language identifies meaning clearly and quickly in a sentence. People tend to understand active language more quickly. The active voice gives credit for action, declaring what happened.For example, instead of writing, “The cat was chased by a dog,” write, “The dog chased the cat.”
You may still need to use the passive language in the event of delicate writing. For example, in this instance, “An error was made…,” passive wording softens the meaning., Choose your words carefully so that each word has a specific function. If you can just as easily leave out a word or phrase without changing your meaning, do so.

, The two-line rule refers to the length of your sentences. If your sentence takes up two or more lines on a sheet of paper (or typed on the computer), start looking at your phrasing to find unnecessary words. What can you cut out so that you convey the same meaning in one line?If you still need most of the information in the sentence, consider breaking it into two shorter sentences.

Eliminate unnecessary and redundant words.,
Replace wordy phrases with precise and concise words.,
Avoid excessive use of common modifiers.,
Print out a hard copy for editing.,
Read your work out loud.",How to Be Concise3," You may use more words than necessary to explain your idea. More often than not, these words are filler, taking up valuable space in your writing. Take out redundancy and extra explanations from your writing.Some typical filler words are: “just,” “some,” “that,” “but,” and “and then.”
Rearrange phrases to the possessive form. You might use a phrase like “the leaves of the plant.” Rearrange this to the possessive form, writing “the plant’s leaves” instead. This retains the same meaning and eliminates two unnecessary words.

, Take out lengthy descriptions and replace them with more accurate words. For example, Say you wrote, ""It is not the case that all historical kings, queens, and princes lived in very large and very beautiful castles."" This can be shortened to: ""Not all royalty lived in extravagant castles.""


Use a thesaurus to find a descriptive synonym for a general term.
Don’t go overboard with choosing descriptors. In many cases, the simpler word or phrase is best. The reader will grasp your meaning more quickly. For example, replace “utilize” with “use,” or replace “terminate” with “end.”, Some modifiers, such as ""very"" and ""really,” are overused to the point where they have become dull and add no extra feeling to sentences. Eliminate many of these without changing the meaning of the sentence.

, Go old school with your writing and work from a hard copy. It is satisfying to cross out unnecessary words with a red pen. See how much you can cut out without losing your original meaning.

, Take a few minutes to listen for unnecessary words. Does the writing flow naturally as you say it out loud?


Ask someone to listen to you reading your work. He might hear other unnecessary or redundant words that you don’t catch.

Join Toastmasters.,
Record yourself speaking.,
Get an editor.,
Work on body language.",How to Be Concise4," Toastmasters is an international organization that teaches and hones public speaking and leadership skills. You are given regular speaking assignments and will perform them in front of a supportive group.Search the Toastmasters website to find a local chapter.

, Listen to your speeches and presentations to catch instances of when you say “um,” “like,” and “uh.” Once you’re aware of these phrases, you will be more likely to eliminate them from your speech.

, It may help to have someone else look at your writing. An editor can give you pointers on how to streamline your writing. This person is less attached to your writing and is more likely to suggest cuts that you might not make yourself.

, When you have confident body language, you will be more confident in your speech.Confident body language include:


Regular eye contact
Holding your shoulders and back straight
No fidgeting
Smiling
Relaxed muscles

Define the abbreviation the first time you use it.,
Understand the punctuation.,
Spell out certain words.,
Use Latin abbreviations when appropriate.,
Don't duplicate acronyms.,
Be consistent.,
Don't overuse abbreviations.,
Save acronyms and abbreviations for repeat offenders.,
Follow the crowd.,
Understand language is fluid.,
Make your own rules.,
Know when to drop the textspeak.",How to Abbreviate," In formal writing, you must always spell out the abbreviation the first time you use it. Generally, you follow the full name with the abbreviation in parenthesis.For instance, if you are using the abbreviation for an organization, you would spell out the name first: ""The organization is called Poetry for Poetry's Sake (PPS).""
Not every abbreviation or acronym needs to be spelled out. Certain acronyms have become commonly used as words instead, such as ""radar,"" which actually stands for ""radio detecting and ranging."";
, Punctuation can be confusing when it comes to abbreviations, and it can vary by style guidelines. However, in American English, you generally use periods with abbreviations such as honorifics (titles for people) and street name abbreviations.For instance, you use a period when you abbreviate ""Mister"" to ""Mr."" or when you add ""Ph.D."" after someone's name to show she has a doctorate.Don't abbreviate a person's title if it's not in front of her name. For instance, you wouldn't say, ""I went to the dr.,"" but rather ""I went to the doctor."" However, you can abbreviate things like ""Ph.D."" when it's not after a person's name.You abbreviate ""Street"" to ""St."" or ""Terrace"" to ""Ter.""You can find a list of standard street abbreviations from the Post Office.Don't use periods with units of measure, such as ""ft"" or ""km.""Don't use periods with acronyms, such as the one used above: Poetry for Poetry's Sake should be abbreviated ""PPS"" not ""P.P.S."", For instance, don't abbreviate class names or state names in most formal writing, though this rule also depends on what style guidelines you're using. (AP Style, for instance, has its own rules about abbreviating state names). Also, don't shorten regular words, such as ""your"" to ""yr"" or ""through"" to ""thru"" in formal writing., You can use some abbreviations derived from Latin. Some style guidelines prefer you leave some of them out; check to make sure it's appropriate for what you're writing by checking the style guidelines for that piece.For example:


use ""etc."" for et cetera, meaning ""and so forth""
use ""et al."" for ""et alii"" or ""and others""
use ""i.e."" for ""id est"" or ""that is""
use ""e.g."" for exemplī gratia or ""for example."", In other words, if you use ""OCC"" for an acronym for Ohio Community College, you shouldn't also try to use it for Oklahoma Community College. If you double up, you'll only confuse readers., As stated, each style guidelines will require you to use abbreviations slightly differently. However, one of the most important rules of abbreviations is to be consistent. Once you choose an abbreviation, make sure you write it the same way throughout the document.For instance, if you choose to use the acronym ""PPS"" for the organization ""Poetry for Poetry's Sake,"" don't suddenly change to ""PFPS"" partway through the paper.

, Even if you define abbreviations the first time you use them, having too many in one text can confuse readers. For instance, don't try to abbreviate certain terms, such as ""subject"" or ""object"" in academic paper just because you use them often. Stick to acronyms for organization names and standard abbreviations that most people know., That is, if you just define an acronym and then only use the phrase once or twice, it's not really worth the confusion. If you're only going to use the phrase or organization name a couple of times, just spell it out., While generally it may seem like textspeak online and on smartphones is all about breaking the rules, in many ways it's as formalized as abbreviations in other forms. That is, through widespread use overtime, certain abbreviations have come to be considered standard.""Textspeak"" just refers to the language and spelling that has developed since the advent of texting.For instance, a common acronym online is ""LOL,"" meaning ""laughing out loud,"" to show amusement, although some people use ""haha"" instead.Capitalizing ""LOL"" has become optional; some people may use ""lol"" instead.
If you're unsure what abbreviations to use, you can find any number of abbreviation dictionaries online that give definitions for textspeak, such as on Webopedia.

, Just like in everyday language, certain groups will deviate from the norm or use their own set of jargon abbreviations. In fact, online text often deviates from texting abbreviations, as people tend to use fewer abbreviations online. Sites like Twitter are the exception, as it restricts the number of characters a person can use per tweet., Though it's good to use acronyms and abbreviations when they already exist, textspeak tends to change as it needs. That is, as long as the other person can understand what you are saying, you can shorten words, replace complicated spellings with simple spellings, and make your own contractions. You can also leave out vowels., Nonetheless, textspeak has its limits. Whenever you're communicating with a colleague, your boss, or even just someone who's a bit older, it's probably a good idea to drop the textspeak and use regular spellings. Older generations tend to frown on this type of texting, though that's not true across the board. Regardless, it's best to keep it out of professional and work settings, with the exception of like-minded peers.


If you are writing a business email or other formal correspondence, do not abbreviate. Use full words and formal, clear language.

Don't take it personally.,
Know house styles.,
Help your editor understand expectations.,
Be prepared for changes and questions.,
Communicate with your editor.,
Understand the point of the final product.,
Understand that writing involves different creativity from editing.",How to Work with Editors," This is rule number one. Always. The editor has a job to do and that is to make your writing clear, readable and concise. Readers are getting busier every day and writing must convey more with fewer words. The editor is trained to achieve this. The editor is polishing, not telling you how to write. And the editor will find things that might have come to you in the heat of the moment but doesn't make sense to anybody else, be sure to do some of your own editing first!;
, You can save yourself a lot of angst and wasted editing time by getting the right house style in place from the word go. Even before you put pen to paper, it is prudent to brush up on the accepted style before you meander down the wrong path and have to backtrack. Fixing poor style is time-consuming and tedious.

, Will Kelly makes a good point in relation to technical editing. Editors are trained to work in many subject environments. However, you cannot expect a non-technical editor to just somehow know what your company, workplace, institution, etc. is looking for without giving them directions. He suggests that you provide the necessary resources to such editors to bring them up to speed on technical editing.

, An editor is being paid to make sure your work is salable. Don't take it personally and be open to criticism, even if it seems harsh. If you accept in advance that you have done your best to that point and that a second pair of eyes will be a source of strengthening rather than diminishing your work, you are in a position to gain much more from the editing relationship. Your editor will appreciate your openness to change, and you won't feel ""attacked"" by changes.

, Where your editor makes changes and asks questions, it is important to engage in discussion if you do not understand or like the suggestions. Sometimes the editor might not convey adequately why the changes are necessary. It is far easier to sit down together and address the concerns., In the real world, unless you are writing a diary or blogging, your writing has an element of being a final product, whether it be to help sell magazines, inform the prime minister or to tell a story so compelling that your novel is read by more people (or at least sells more copies) than the others. The ""final product"" must be one that attracts or clearly informs readers. Often the writer is not in a good position to assess this alone but the editor aids the writer in keeping the bigger picture on track. If you keep in mind the end use of your product, you will maintain a better distance from it that will allow you to accept constructive feedback.

, Writing and editing are similar but distinct fields. Writers can easily get caught up in their own feelings about the subject matter; a good editor will ensure that the language flows more smoothly and still reflects the intended meaning, direction and voice, without over-burdening the reader with too much detail. Both skills are valuable, and it is a good idea to swap hats now and then while writing and remember what the editor sees: the process of turning emotions and knowledge into text.

Learn the ""i"" before ""e"" rule.,
Learn how to deal with double vowels.,
Be wary of piggyback pairs.,
Watch out for homonyms and homophones.,
Be careful with prefixes.,
Learn the correct way to pluralize nouns.,
Break words into syllables and look for words within words.,
Sound out words.,
Use memory aids or mnemonics.,
Try to memorize commonly misspelled words.",How to Spell," The rule ""i"" before ""e"", except after ""c"" is a useful one to remember. It means that the letter ""i"" should always come before the letter ""e"" when the two are beside each other in a word (eg. ""friend"" or ""piece""), except for when they come after the letter ""c"", in which case the ""e"" should come before the ""i"" (eg. ""receive""). Memorizing this rule can help you to spell many common words where the placement of the ""i"" and ""e"" is confusing.



Sounding it out: Another useful way to remember the placement of ""i"" and ""e"" is to sound out the word. If the combination of the ""e"" and the ""i"" sounds like a long ""a"" (""ay""), then the ""e"" should be placed before the ""i"". For example, the words ""eight"" or ""weigh"".

Understanding the exceptions: However, like most rules, there are exceptions - words which don't follow the ""i"" before ""e"" except after ""c"" rule. Such words include: ""either"", ""leisure"", ""protein"", ""their"" and ""weird"". Unfortunately, there is no trick to help you memorize these, you just have to learn them.

Even more exceptions: Other exceptions include words containing the letters ""cien"" such as ""ancient"", ""efficient"", ""science"", and words containing the letters ""eig"" (even when the ""e"" and ""i"" don't make an ""ay"" sound) such as ""height"" and ""foreign"".

, When you come across a word with double vowels (or two vowels beside each other) it can sometimes be difficult to tell which one should come first. Luckily, there is another helpful rhyme you can use to remember which vowel should come first, as follows:



When two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking. This means that the vowel who's sound you can actually hear when you say the word should come first, followed by the vowel you can't hear.

Listen for the long vowel: In other words, when there are two vowels together, the first one in the word is a long vowel sound and the second one is silent. When you say the word ""boat,"" for example, the letter ""o"" says its name but the ""a"" is not pronounced.
So if you're not sure how to arrange the vowels in a word, just sound the word out -- which long vowel do you hear? Put that one first. Words that prove this rule include team (you hear the ""e""), mean (you hear the ""e"") and wait (you hear the ""a"").

Exceptions: As always, there are exceptions to the rule which simply must be learned. Some of these include the words ""you"" (you hear the ""u"" sound rather than the ""o""), ""phoenix"" (you hear the ""e"" sound rather than the ""o"") and ""great"" (you hear the ""a"" sound rather than the ""e"").

, It's not uncommon for pairs of consonants to be pronounced so that one is silent - and so it figuratively ""piggybacks"" on the sound of the other.


This ""piggybacking"" can make words containing consonant pairs difficult to spell, as it's easy to forget about the consonant you cannot hear and just write the one you can hear.
Therefore, it is important to familiarize yourself with these piggyback pairs and learn some of the most common consonant combinations, so you can spell these types of words correctly.
Some of the most common piggyback pairs include the following:

Gn, pn and kn - in these piggyback pairs you can only hear the ""n"" sound, the consonant preceding the ""n"" is silent. Words containing these pairs include ""gnome"", ""pneumonia"" and ""knife"".

Rh and wr - in these piggyback pairs you can only hear the ""r"" sound, the other consonants are silent. Words containing these pairs include ""rhyme"" and ""wrestle"".

Ps and sc - in these piggyback pairs you can only hear the ""s"" sound, the letters ""p"" and ""c"" are silent. Words containing these pairs include ""psychic"" and ""science"".

Wh - in this piggyback pair you can only hear the ""h"" sound, the ""w"" is silent. An example of a word containing this piggyback pair is ""whole"".

, Homonyms and homophones are two types of words that can cause difficulty for spellers. But before you can learn to watch out for homonyms and homophones, you must first understand their definitions.


A homonym is one of two or more words that are spelled the same and pronounced the same but differ in meaning. A good example of this are the words bank (meaning embankment) and bank (meaning a place where money is kept).
A homophone on the other hand is one of two or more words, such as night and knight, that are pronounced the same but differ in meaning. Sometimes they are spelled the same - such as the word ""rose"" (meaning the flower) and ""rose"" (meaning the past tense of rise) - and sometimes they are spelled differently, such as the words ""to"", ""too"" and ""two"".
As a result, all homonyms are also homophones because they are pronounced in the same way. However, not all homophones are homonyms because not all homophones are spelled the same (whereas homonyms are).Examples: Some other common homonyms and homophones are ""here"" and ""hear""; ""eight"" and ""ate""; ""wear,"" ""ware,"" and ""where""; ""lose"" and ""loose""; and ""sent,"" ""scent,"" and ""cent.""

How to Use Its and It's



, Prefixes are word parts that you add to the beginning of other words in order to change their meaning. For example, adding the prefix ""un-"" to the word ""happy"" makes ""unhappy"" (meaning ""not happy""). Adding a prefix to a word can make spelling slightly tricky, however there are a couple of rules you can follow to make things easier:



Don't add or take away letters: Remember that the spelling of a word doesn't change when you add a prefix, even if it means putting two of the same letter right next to each other. In other words, you never add any letters in or take any letters out, even if you think the result looks slightly odd. As an example, look at the spelling of the words ""misstep"", ""preeminent"" and ""unnecessary"".

Understand when to use hyphens: In certain circumstances, you will need to put a hyphen between the prefix and the base word. These circumstances include: when the prefix comes before a proper noun or numeral (eg. un-American), when using the prefix ""ex-"" meaning ""former"" (eg. ex-military), when using the prefix ""self-"" (eg. self-indulgent, self-important), when it becomes necessary to separate two ""a's"", two ""i's"" or certain other letter combinations in order to improve readability (eg. ultra-ambitious, anti-intellectual or co-worker)., Learning how to correctly pluralize nouns is another spelling task which often causes difficulties, as there are many different ways of pluralizing words in the English language (though the most common way is just to add the letter ""s"").



Look at the last letters of the word: The key to correctly pluralizing nouns is to look at the last one or two letters of the word you wish to pluralize, as this will provide a clue to the correct ending. Some of the most common rules are as follows:

Most singular nouns which end in the letters ""ch"", ""sh"", ""s"", ""x"" or ""z"" can be converted to plural form by adding the letters ""es"". For example, the word ""box"" becomes ""boxes"", the word ""bus"" becomes ""buses"" and the word ""prize"" becomes ""prizes"".

Most singular nouns which end in a vowel followed by the letter ""y"" can be converted into plural form by simply adding the letter ""s"". For example, the word ""boy"" becomes ""boys"" and the word ""day"" becomes ""days"".

Most singular nouns which end in a consonant followed by the letter ""y"" can be converted into plural form by dropping the ""y"" and adding the letters ""ies"". For example, the word ""baby"" becomes ""babies"", the word ""country"" becomes ""countries"" and the word ""spy"" becomes ""spies"".

Most singular nouns that end in the letters ""f"" or ""fe"" can be converted into plural form by dropping the ""f"" or ""fe"" and adding the letters ""ves"". For example, the word ""elf"" becomes ""elves"", the word ""loaf"" becomes ""loaves"" and the word ""thief"" becomes ""thieves"".

Most singular nouns that end in an ""o"" can be converted into plural form simply by adding an ""s"". For example, the word ""kangaroo"" becomes ""kangaroos"" and the word ""piano"" becomes ""pianos"". However, sometimes when a word ends in a consonant followed by the letter ""o"", the correct way to convert it into plural form is to add the letter ""es"". For example, the word ""potato"" becomes ""potatoes"" and the word ""hero"" becomes ""heroes""., Just because a word is long, that doesn't necessary mean that it's difficult to spell - all you need to do is break the word down into syllables, and look for smaller words within the bigger one.



Breaking into smaller words: For example, the word “baseball” can be broken down into two smaller words: “base,” and “ball” which aren't difficult to spell at all!

Breaking into syllables: Even if you can't make actual words, breaking a long word down into smaller syllables can be very helpful. For example, you can break the word ""hospital"" down into ""hos-pit-al"", or the word ""university"" into ""u-ni-ver-si-ty"".

Breaking into parts: You can even remember a seemingly difficult fourteen-letter word such as “hypothyroidism” by breaking it down into parts: one prefix, one full word, and one suffix: “hypo-”, “thyroid,” and “-ism.”
Keep in mind that you can significantly improve your spelling by learning all of the common prefixes and suffixes, as a large number of words contain either one or both of these.

, Sounding out the pronunciation of a word (in an exaggerated fashion) can help you to figure out its spelling. However this only holds true when you are pronouncing the word correctly.


Therefore, you should do your best to make a habit of correctly pronouncing words (don't skip consonants or vowels that you're not supposed to) and you'll have a better chance of spelling them correctly.

Examples: Some words that are commonly mispronounced - and therefore misspelled - include: ""probably"" (usually pronounced like ""probly""), ""different"" (usually pronounced like ""difrent""), ""Wednesday"" (usually pronounced like ""Wensday"") and ""library"" (usually pronounced like ""libry"").
Other words you need to watch out for when using this method are the ones we tend to say too quickly, such as ""interesting"" or ""comfortable"". Because we often say these words so quickly, it can be difficult to sound out the correct spelling.

Slow down: When sounding out such words, try to slow down and really enunciate each syllable. Pronounce the word ""interesting"" as ""in-TER-esting"" so you don't forget the ""e"" in the middle, and pronounce the word ""comfortable"" as ""com-FOR-ta-ble"" to help you remember where each of the vowels go.

, Mnemonics are devices which help you to remember important information, such as how to spell a word. They come in many different forms, some of which are described below:



Silly sentences: A fun mnemonic device for remembering specific problem words is to make up sentences in which the first letter of each word corresponds with a letter in the word you are trying to spell. For example, to remember how to spell the word ""because"", you could use the sentence ""Big Elephants Can Always Understand Small Elephants"". Or to remember the word ""physical"" you could use the sentence ""Please Have Your Strawberry Ice Cream And Lollipops"". The sillier the sentence, the better!

Clever clues: Some other creative memory aids use hints found within the words themselves to aid with correct spelling. For example, if you have difficulty in remembering the difference between the word ""desert"" (meaning arid land) and the word ""dessert"" (meaning a sweet treat), just remember that the word ""dessert"" has two ""s""s because you always want seconds.If you have difficulty with the word ""separate"", remember that there's a rat in the middle. If you are always forgetting the difference between the word ""stationery"" and ""stationary"", remember that ""stationery"" spelled with an ""e"" is about envelopes and such things. And if you have trouble differentiating between the words ""principal"" (meaning the person with the highest authority) and ""principle"" (meaning a fundamental truth), just remember that the principal or head of the company is your ""pal"".

, Even if you learn all of the rules and try all of the spelling tricks, there will probably still be some words you'll have a mental block against and will consistently misspell. For these words, memorization may be the only way to go.



Identify problem words: First you will need to identify the words that you have the most trouble with. You can do this by looking back through previous writings and checking your spelling. This will be easier to do if you have electronic files and run a spell check program but the very best way to get this done is to have an impeccable speller (someone who is excellent at spelling) edit your work. Which are the words you tend to misspell the most often?

Make a list: Once you have identified your most commonly misspelled words, make a neat list, then rewrite each word (using the correct spelling) at least ten times. Go through each word, sound it out, ""see"" the syllables, and make a conscious mental effort to memorize the spelling.

Practice makes perfect: Do this every day or every other day. What you're essentially doing is ""training"" your mind and hand(s) to spell the word correctly. Eventually, you might want to quiz yourself by having someone read the words out loud (or making a recording of yourself) and writing out each word as you hear it. Then go back and see which ones you got wrong.

Use labels and flashcards: Another method you can use to learn how to spell problem words is to use flashcards and labels. Stick labels with the correct spellings on everyday household items, such as ""faucet"", ""duvet"", ""television"" and ""mirror"". Then every time you use one of these items you will be reminded of how to spell it. You can also try sticking a flashcard with 2 or 3 of your problem words beside the bathroom sink or on top of the coffee maker - then every time you're brushing your teeth or waiting for your coffee you can work on memorizing the correct spellings!

Use your senses: You can also try using your finger to 'write out' the spelling -- trace the letters on your book, your desk, even the sand on the beach! The more of your senses you use, the better you will train your brain.

Read newspapers for structure. Newspapers do an excellent job of structuring information from most important to least important. Read newspapers to get a sense of the lede, or main idea of the story, which usually occurs at the beginning of each article.
Read fiction for creativity and empathy. Works of fiction tend to examine the role of human relationships in shaping meaning and creating happiness (or taking it away). In addition to making you more socially attuned, it can even temporarily boost your empathy.These skills are important for the worldly editor.
Read nonfiction for historical context and informational insight. Nonfiction explores the stories of real events and people, which are often stranger than fiction. A good editor will use nonfiction to place stories in historical context and derive useful information from them.;
, You may think that as an editor, you won't be doing much writing. Disabuse yourself of that idea. Although they aren't always acknowledged as writers in their own right, editors spend as much time toying with phrases and molding language to fit their will. Write something every day, whether it's the casual reminiscing of diaries or the formal analysis of an essay, and stick with it. Don't make excuses for why you can't write. Make excuses for why you write as much as you do.

, Vocabulary is an essential part in learning how to be well-read and sharp-penned. Editors who constantly play with new words and discover new meanings in words see the world in a more nuanced way. Being a more nuanced thinker is what will set you apart as an editor.


Carry a dictionary around with you wherever you go. Maybe your ""dictionary"" is an app on your phone. Maybe it's a pocket Merriam-Webster. Whatever it is, use it. Whenever you come across a word you don't know, look it up and write it down on a list. Browse the list periodically to learn — not just memorize — the meaning of the word.
Practice the art of the mot juste. Mot juste is a fancy French phrase, coined by Flaubert, that roughly translates to ""the perfect word for the occasion."" Knowing lots of vocabulary, and seeing it in action, will help you choose the mot juste. The best editors and writers seem to pull le mot juste out of their black hats with a beguiling ease.

, Writers, readers, and editors alike (as an editor, you are all three by default) seem to share an innate curiosity about the world. This curiosity propels them to learn about the world, package up that data in interesting, timely pieces, and present it to others in the hope that their curiosity might be piqued as well.


If you get an opportunity to, explore the world. Traveling is an excellent way to learn about different places and different cultures. Put yourself out there and meet people. Have interesting conversations by asking pointed questions. Put yourself in uncomfortable situations. Above all, be a fresh air fiend. Oh yeah — write about everything.

, In order to be an editor, you need three main mental attributes: creativity, or the ability to think of different permutations on the fly; persistence, or the ability to spend long hours staring at the same sentence; and analytical judgment, or the ability to make quick decisions about something's significance, place in context, or truthfulness.


Surround yourself by people who are smarter than you. If you're constantly the big fish in the little pond, you're eventually going to run out of mental stimulation. You'll get bored. You'll get the big-head. Surrounding yourself with people who are smarter than you will force you to re-evaluate and think through ideas from the ground up. You might even absorb some smarts by osmosis.
Make mistakes. Mistakes are your friend, not your enemy, as long as you learn from them. Don't be afraid to try out a sentence that ultimately doesn't work. Take that logical leap that you know is a little too stretched for comfort. Then re-evaluate, and think about where you went wrong. Vow to never make the same mistake twice. This is quite literally how you get better at what you do.

, Identifying which industry you want to work in and the kind of editing you want to do will help you determine the kind of training you'll need. There's a ton of leeway when it comes to deciding what kind of editor you may want to become. Figuring out which kind you're really drawn to is the fun part!


You should enjoy the field in which you wish to edit, such as loving literature to be a book editor or sports to edit a sports magazine. You should also develop your knowledge in that field.
Knowing the types of editing can also help you determine what kind of training you need. To become a content editor, you'll need to improve your writing skills in order to revise the content submitted by others. To become a copyeditor, you'll need to improve your grammar skills to proofread for grammar and punctuation errors.
Some specialty areas, such as legal, technical or medical publishing, may require learning a specialized style guide. Other areas require learning supplemental skills; to work as a design editor, you need to develop layout and graphic design skills.

, Many, many people go to college and end up getting a degree in English, but not too many people go to school specifically to become an editor. Although you should absolutely pursue your dream of becoming an editor if you have one, know that many people who graduate with degrees in English regret not having chosen a degree with a more solid economic pathway to freedom.Formal college training is decidedly helpful but not always necessary in becoming an editor. A degree in English, journalism, or communications is helpful in getting an in-house editorial position, and there are degree and certificate programs in writing and editing. However, if you write and edit well, you may be trained on the job.
To become a freelance editor, it's more important to demonstrate the ability to edit than to have a degree, although it may be necessary to get a degree if you seek in-house experience before freelancing.

, If you're still in college, look for internships that provide you with hands-on experience. If you're out of college, volunteer your services to charitable and other non-profit organizations or to friends or colleagues, or trade your services with someone whose products or services you need.


Some employers use interns as gofers instead of giving them actual editing-related work to do. If in doubt, check with others who have interned there before accepting an internship.

, With editing, as with many of other professions, there's usually a chain of command that you need to slowly work your way up in order to be given the reins. Although it's not necessary to start off as a fact-checker or ghostwriter, it's definitely easier to get your foot in the door; once you have your foot in the door and impress people with your timely writing, sharp intellect, and willingness to work, it's much easier to move up from the inside than it is from the outside looking in.


Ghostwriters often learn to work with individual writers and establish long-term relationships with them. The downside is that you won't necessarily get the credit that you deserve (which is bigger than you might think), but the upside is that you'll establish a relationship with a writer who knows a lot of other writers and editors. Nurture these connections if possible.
Fact-checker jobs are often entry-level, right beside internships. Although normally tedious and having little to do with actual writing, many find the job to be a great way of building journalism chops and networking while angling for a better position. At some publications, such as the New Yorker, fact-checker positions can be prestigious, while at Der Spiegel, they can be numerous.

, Be versatile. Think of yourself as a trusty Swiss-army knife, capable of doing many things at once in many different situations. The more skills and abilities you have under your belt as an editor, the better your employment opportunities will be.


For example, you can market your editing skills to aspiring authors as well as to book publishers and book packagers or market your design editing skills to advertising agencies as well as graphic design firms.

, Other editors can tell you the process they took to get where they're at and refer work to you when they have too much work or are given a project they can't handle. Since the work of editors is often overlooked and underutilized, networking is also a great way to stay connected to top jobs and openings.


One way to network is by joining a professional editors' organization. Many have directories of editors already established in the field you may wish to become an editor in.
Another way to network is to attend writers' conferences and conventions associated with the areas you wish to find work in.
You can also network through professional social networking Web sites, such as LinkedIn, where you can join groups devoted to writing and editing.
Keep in touch with other writers and editors. Send them sincere congratulations when you see something they're written or edited that you like. Never burn bridges if you happen to leave a job.

, This advice is applicable to a broad range of jobs, but it especially applies here. If you gain the reputation of being someone who's willing to tackle tough, unpleasant, or otherwise undesirable assignments, you'll begin to make yourself indispensable. You'll probably have no shortage of assignments if you're in the right kind of job, and you'll be viewed with the same adoration that a woodworker reserves for his favorite chisel.

, Unlike sales positions, where the white lie is actually encouraged, or some managerial roles, where the big picture is more important than the details, editors have to get the small things right. Whether it's being consistent with punctuation in your copy, making sure typos don't go unnoticed, or simply getting the facts straight, the small things matter more to editors than they do to other professionals, arguably. Editors stake their reputation on the small stuff. They're definitely worth sweating.

, After all the generalization and odd jobs that will probably define your early going as an editor, you'll begin to learn about the types of books, issues, or categories of work that you enjoy the most. After going broad and superficial early in your career, it helps to be known as the guy or gal when it comes to your specialization.


Editors can't get the Pulitzer prize, but if they could, it would probably go to those who chose to specialize in a particular field. What's yours? Do you care about human trafficking? Political unrest? Educational innovation in America? Define your own interests so that others have an easier time defining you.

, Never stop caring about the best way to present, share, and communicate language so that it encourages other people to do the same. As an editor, your solemn task is to make language easier to understand while communicating as much information as possible.


Find someone who you can mentor. They'll appreciate the guidance and work you give them. On a practical level, they'll sing your praises to other people, helping bolster your reputation.
Appear in the media as a pundit. Be the trusted guy or gal that a news site goes to when they need an interview or a talking head. You'll have to forge a lot of deep connections to make this happen, but it's not impossible.
Continue to learn new things every day, and delight in them. You finally learned the correct way of conjugating an abstruse word you've been getting wrong all the time. Share your learnings with others. Instead of being known as the person who's too afraid to admit that they made a mistake, be the person who lives to discover new things. That's what's at the heart of being an editor.

Know the kinds of software technical writers use.,
Take classes in the software that interests you.,
Learn on the job.,
Learn on your own.",How to Learn Technical Writing Software," Technical writing software can be broken down into several types, listed below. A knowledge of several types of these tools, as well as several applications in each type, can help you in finding a technical writing position.


Word processing applications: Although many technical writing duties require special software applications, there are also many documents that can be written with word processing applications such as Microsoft Word, Corel Word Perfect, or OpenOffice Writer. A fully featured word processing program includes the ability to create text styles to assign fonts to headers and text as well as the ability to lay out graphic images within the text.
Help authoring software: Specialized help authoring tools include Adobe RoboHelp, Madcap Flare, Help and Manual, Doc-2-Help, Help Logix, Author-it, and Wink. These applications automate the process of creating help file topics and the hyperlinks to jump between them, as well as organizing the topics into books and creating search keywords for users to find information quickly. Many help authoring tools also include graphic editing capabilities such as screen capturing, graphic resizing, and embedding hyperlinks into graphic images.
Desktop publishing/page layout software: Although word processing applications can handle some layout functions, more robust programs such as Adobe InDesign (successor to its earlier PageMaker program), Adobe FrameMaker, and Microsoft Publisher make it easier to handle creating manuals, brochures, pamphlets, newsletters, and quick reference guides.
Graphics editing software: Adobe Photoshop is the best-known graphics tool, although other tools include Illustrator, Paint Shop Pro, and Gimp. Graphics editing programs enable technical writers to create and capture graphic images. Related to graphics editing programs are computer-aided drafting software applications such as AutoCAD, which are usually used by technical illustrators for architectural and mechanical drawings.
Screen capture utilities: Programs such as SnagIt are graphics applications dedicated to creating screen captures, resizing them, and adding captions and callouts. They are often easier to use than full-fledged graphics editing programs, particularly when technical writers are only called upon to make and use screenshots.
Video capture utilities: Although most technical writing is in the form of static documents featuring text and still images, video tutorials are becoming more commonplace, thanks to the number of instructional videos available on the Internet. Capture utilities such as Adobe Captivate and Camtasia Studio are to capturing video what SnagIt is to capturing still images.
Other technical writing software applications that may be useful include presentation software such as Microsoft PowerPoint and flowcharting/screen creating programs such as Microsoft Visio.;
, Classes in technical writing software may be available at your local community college or through a private institution that specializes in software training. Classes are often the best way to learn fully featured graphics editing applications like Photoshop or layout applications such as FrameMaker. Classes may be offered in one of these formats:


Traditional classroom training features a computer-equipped classroom or lecture area and computer lab with an instructor who provides a mixture of lectures and hands-on experience. Sessions range from short ""lunch and learn"" overviews to day-long workshops and multi-session classes running for 1 to 3 months
Student-driven classes are held in computer classrooms, but the students direct themselves in learning the software application, with instructors serving as guides to answer questions as they arise. They may be used in combination with traditional classes.
Virtual classes are online classes structured like traditional classes with instructors delivering lectures. Some class sessions may be broadcast at certain times, with remote students able to ask questions and receive answers during those times by email or instant message, either using the software on their own computers or guiding classroom computers remotely. Other sessions may be podcasted, allowing students to review the presentation at their leisure.

, You can sometimes learn a piece of technical writing software on the job. The key features of most help authoring tools and screen capture utilities like SnagIt can be learned by sitting down with them for 1 to 2 hours a day or even over the course of an afternoon, by working with them. You probably won't achieve mastery for several months, but you should be able to create something useful in a short time.


The most likely circumstances where you can learn technical writing software on the job is if you already have a technical writing position with the company or are being cross-trained in a department that has a technical writer on staff. You may be able to supplement such training with virtual classes as described above, using your office computer.

, If you have the ability to learn software quickly, you can learn the less complicated technical writing software applications on your own, by devoting the same amount of time to learning them that you would in an office setting. Some applications, such as RoboHelp, come with a hefty price tag, however. You may want to try an open-source application to see if you're comfortable with that type of technical writing software before moving to more common commercial tools.

When editing, you need to try to view your work objectively, as a reader would. So step away from the computer and give yourself a break from the manuscript. Focus on a different writing project or another activity and then return to the piece of writing with fresh eyes in several days.If you have waited until the last minute or were given a short deadline, you may not have time to do this. Getting a little distance and time from your work will help you read it more objectively and focus on what's actually on the page rather than what you think should be on the page.
You don't have to take day-long breaks. Even something as simple as moving to another task temporarily, going outside for a walk and a break, or calling a friend for a few minutes can help you ""reset."";
, While some writers find it easy to edit their work on a computer screen, others find it much easier to spot mistakes on paper. Put the writing in a different format than the one you wrote it with. This will help you approach your own work critically and give you an outsider perspective.Usually, this will mean printing out writing that you've done on the computer, but you can also retype a first draft you wrote by hand.
Using a paper copy will also allow you to mark up the manuscript with editing notes and revisions.

, Try to read through the entire piece of writing without changing anything or making notes about any major fixes. This will help you shift from your writer mode to your reader mode. Keep a mental note of any sections that felt confusing, unfinished, or weakly supported.


You can also try reading your work aloud. The best writing sounds smooth and natural — almost like you're speaking. Listening to your written syntax is one of the best ways you can catch areas with awkward phrasing. Make a mental note of any sentences or sections that do not make sense or that you stumble over while reading., After you've written and revised your work, put yourself in the shoes of your audience. Try to imagine that you have the knowledge and perspective of the person who will read your work. Keep in mind that your reader may have a very different attitude toward your writing than you do. Jot down your thoughts and make any necessary changes. Below are a few things to consider:Is the writing so confusing that you're getting bored by page two?
Is there any language you might not understand?
Are new, foreign concepts well-explained?
Is it written with a tone that seems appealing or attention grabbing?
What stands out to you most?

, Often, writers focus on editing individual sentences and neglect the larger structure of a piece of writing. Do a big picture edit first, before you tackle words and phrases.Look at any chapters or sections that need to be tightened or fleshed out. Ask yourself: have I covered every possible angle of the topic or subject in this section? If you are editing an essay, you should check that there is an introduction, body, and conclusion. If you are editing a creative piece of writing, like a short story or a novel, look for any long winded passages or paragraphs that could be revised or shortened, especially in dialogue.
Note missing chapters or sections. Maybe you forgot to include a few lines clarifying an earlier point in the section. Or perhaps you realize you neglected to include a new section. Look at any gaps in the structure of your piece of writing.
There may also be scenes or sections that need to be reworked or revised. If you’re working on a long piece of writing, mark these with a post it note or a highlighted mark so you can remember that they need to be reworked more closely.

, Think about the form you are writing for, and if the tone and voice of your writing fits this form. For example, if you are writing an online how-to article, your tone might be conversational and accessible with sentences that are no longer than one to two lines. But if you are writing period fiction, your tone and voice may be more formal and have anachronisms that were commonly used in the time period. An essay on a scientific topic will use scientific terms and a serious or professional tone, while an essay on a literary topic may use more casual language.One way to check that your tone and voice match your subject is to do a reading level writing check. Use an online tool, like the Hemingway App, that checks the reading level of a piece of writing. Most pieces of writing made for the general public, such as a how-to article or a blog post, should be written no higher than a grade 6-7 level. A scientific essay for a university class may fall in a higher reading level.

, Though there are several different variations of tense, the most basic tenses used in writing are past, present, and future.Most pieces of writing use the past or the present tense. Whichever tense you decide to use in your manuscript, it should be consistent and remain the same tense throughout.Once you choose a point of view in your writing, the piece of writing should stick to the same point of view (first person, second person, third person). For example, an essay that begins in the third person should not then switch to the first person, with “I feel” or “I think” sentences.

, Editing isn't just about looking for spelling and grammar mistakes. It's also about checking your statements for accuracy.For example, maybe you realize you misquoted someone or cited an incorrect set of data. This can then cast doubt on your entire piece of writing. If you don't have the facts right, readers will find it hard to take your main points seriously. Be sure to double-check all of your major claims and citations to ensure that your arguments have the firmest factual foundation possible.

, Read paragraphs or sections out loud and mark any sentences that sound awkward or wordy. Make sure each sentence is clear and concise. Avoid long, meandering sentences and sentences that don't add anything to the paragraph that contains them.One common mistake is using too many subordinate clauses. A subordinate clause (also known as a dependent clause) has a subject and verb but can't stand alone as a sentence. For instance, this sentence has a subordinate clause before the comma:



When staff fatigue was high during the fourth quarter because of lower earnings than projected, I led an initiative to improve morale.




The sentence can be edited so there is no subordinate clause:



I led an initiative to tackle staff fatigue and improve morale in the wake of disappointing fourth-quarter earnings.





, This may seem like obvious advice, but it's something that's often forgotten when trying to reach a word limit. Every paragraph should have a clear, easily-stated point or focus. If you can't figure out why you included a certain paragraph in your writing, this is a sign that it needs to be changed or left out. When this point is well-developed or the focus of your writing changes, start a new paragraph with its own point.A useful way of determining when to start a new paragraph is to use the mnemonic ""TiP ToP."" This stands for Time, Place, Topic, Person. In other words, start a new paragraph whenever the time, place, topic, or person being discussed changes.

, Sometimes, simple rearrangement can make the difference between a good piece of writing and a great one. Order your writing so that it has a clear progression. The beginning should put forth the main point, while the pieces that come after should support it (or, in other words, show why it's correct). This general structure is good both for the entire piece of writing and for each paragraph.See our guide to five paragraph essays for an introduction to this sort of organizational structure.

, Good writing proves a point as quickly and directly as possible. Unnecessary content will only make it more likely that your readers will never make it to the end. Get rid of anything that doesn't play a clear, logical role in supporting your writing. Below are a few things you may want to look out for:Paragraphs with sentences that do nothing to advance the main point.
Sentences that make claims or statements with no support in the rest of the writing.
Content that isn't directly related to the main points of the writing.
Long or flowery descriptive passages.
Passages where you repeat yourself, or repeat a point that was made earlier.

, Using the hard copy of your manuscript, highlight all the adverbs and adjectives in your manuscript. Then, consider if each one is essential to a sentence or phrase. You don’t need to get rid of all of them, but you should check that they aren’t making a sentence more convoluted or confusing. Adverbs also tend to be wordy and can act as a crutch for writers, as there may be more descriptive language that might work better in a sentence.For example, instead of referring to the sky as hazy and cloudy, you may describe it as “overcast”. Or, if you are writing a more creative piece, you may note how it reminds a character of when she used to play in her house as a child wearing a veil. A slowly flowing river could be described instead as a river that doesn’t seem in a particular hurry to get anywhere.
When using adjectives, ensure you know the precise meaning of every adjective used in your paper. Go for simple adjectives, instead of more complex or obscure ones. For example, describing the afternoon sky as cerulean may not be as effective as describing the afternoon sky as bright blue.

, This is especially important when you’re writing an opinion based essay. When you make a point in your essay or paper, throw yourself fully behind it and be clear and assertive. Don’t give your reader the impression that you don’t fully support your own argument.Remove any language like “It seems to be”, “It appears”, or “One could argue”. Avoid wishy-washy sentences like “I believe” “In my opinion” or “I guess”. Remove these phrases and don’t quantify your opinion or your beliefs in your paper.

, A big part of editing is proofreading your work for grammar, spelling, and punctuation mistakes. But if you try to identify and revise too many elements at once, you can lose focus and get overwhelmed by the proofreading process. Instead, focus on checking for one type of error first, like spelling errors, and then move one to another type of error, like punctuation errors.Try reading each sentence out loud when proofreading. This will force you to say each word and lets you hear how the words sound together. When you read silently to yourself, you may skip over errors, scan rather than read, or make unconscious corrections as you read that will cause you to miss these errors.
Another technique is to separate your text into individual sentences. Press the return key after each period so every line begins a new sentence. Then, read each sentence one at a time, looking for grammar, punctuation, or spelling errors. If you are working with a printed copy, use an opaque object like a ruler or a piece of paper, to isolate the line you are proofreading.

, A few spelling mistakes won't usually make it hard for readers to understand your writing, but they can easily distract from the points you're trying to make. Carefully read your entire work over again, checking for letters that are out of order or misplaced.Today, nearly all word processors will have a spell check feature that will point out spelling mistakes to you. Note, however, that these can't usually detect when you use the wrong word, spelled correctly. For example, a spell check may not tell you that you are mistakenly using ""pair"" instead of ""pare."" Avoid relying completely on the spell check tool and go through each sentence to check for spelling errors., Does each sentence start with a capital letter? Does each sentence end with a period (full stop), question mark, or exclamation point? Have you used commas, quotation marks, and asterisks appropriately? Like misspellings, these sorts of errors can be distracting for readers and may be seen as a lack of effort.One technique is to circle all punctuation on the hard copy of your manuscript, from commas to periods to em dashes. Then, look each one over to make sure they are being used correctly in a sentence or if they are unnecessary and can replaced or cut.See our main punctuation article for a thorough step-by-step guide on adjusting punctuation correctly.

, Some words look or sound the same but have different meanings. Spell checkers often won't detect when you accidentally substitute one of these words for another, so careful re-reading is important for catching these mistakes. A few examples include:""Their,"" ""they're,"" and ""there.""
""Too,"" ""to,"" and ""two.""
""Lay"" and ""lie.""
""Sit"" and ""set.""
""Accept"" and ""except.""

, Do you use a lot of quotation marks around phrases or terms that appear awkward or unnecessary? Do you have big sections in italics, or capital letters? Too many emphasized words can be jarring to your reader and actually weaken the impact of your sentences. Try to reduce the number of emphasized words or phrases in your writing to avoid throwing off your reader.This rule also applies to exclamation points, as they should be used rarely in essays or academic papers.

, This technique is helpful for checking for spelling errors you may have missed or self corrected when reading your writing straight through. Start with the last word on the last page and work your way back to the beginning, reading each word one at a time. Content, punctuation and grammar won’t make sense backwards, so your focus will be only on the spelling of each word.You can also read backwards sentence by sentence to check for grammar issues, as this will help you avoid becoming distracted by the content.

, Most writers will admit critiquing someone else's work is much easier than deconstructing your own. Outside eyes bring a fresh perspective — the person you get to help you may think of things that never would have occurred to you. After you've self-edited, get a friend, family member, or teacher/professor to read over your work.Your editor doesn't have to be an expert writer. In fact, if you're writing for an everyday audience, s/he shouldn't be one. Ask a friend, family member, or peer to look over your writing for proofreading elements like spelling, grammar, and punctuation and provide notes or comments on these issues.

Keep a notebook of your mistakes from your writing and tips you learn.,
Develop reading and business knowledge of a second language.",How to Improve Your Technical Writing Skills," Many polytechnic schools, universities, and community colleges offer courses as well as full and part-time programs in technical and business communication. You might even able to find online/distance education classes to 'attend'. Some online courses may have a cost to them, others will not.


Note: Technical writers come from a diverse range of academic backgrounds, spanning the military to electrical engineering to Swedish literature to theatre. If you were trained in the sciences or trades, focus on your communication skills. If you were trained in the arts, focus on your technical skills. Take courses, enroll in certificate programs, or teach yourself through books.;
, The more informed you are about the field of technical communication, the better a technical writer you will be. Such books will teach you about technical writing style, different types of technical writing, how to build and manage your career, and a range of other useful tidbits.

, Technical communication is a digital entity. You need to intimately know communication and digital publishing software such as Microsoft Office, Adobe FrameMaker, Adobe PhotoShop, and Adobe RoboHelp; Social Media such as LinkedIn, Yammer, Twitter, and WordPress; and Markup languages such as HTML, XML, and CSS. Specific industries may call for knowledge of other tools such as DITA, Dreamweaver, Java, database languages, AutoCAD or others.

, Ask yourself, are you writing and editing for civil engineers or mad scientists or basement-dwelling hackers or Joe Average? Are you developing online help or parts manuals or memos or corporate e-mails? The number of fields and types of communication that technical writing covers is limitless.

, While most people don't forget how to 'write' per se, specialty types of writing takes practice and a desire to improve. One sound way of going about this is by developing and maintaining wikiHow articles.

It also shows employers that you take your professional writing seriously.

, Sound technical writing involves being precise with words, language, and information - it's as simple as that.

, These two rules are imperative for making information as clear and accessible as possible. Keep in mind that your audience may have range of reading comprehension levels. Also, if you are writing for an international audience, try to avoid local idioms such as ""the cat's pajamas"" or ""easy as pie""---such concepts do not easily translate across languages or cultures.

, Trial and error is one of the best ways to learn. Don't be afraid to make mistakes and take criticism, you will improve with time and practice.

, This is important if you work in an international or multilingual context. It opens doors and breaks barriers between you and your client/employer and it enables you to cross-check the quality of translated (localized) technical documents as well as potentially translate technical documentation yourself. Consider languages with major technical, scientific, or academic output as German, Spanish, French, Russian, or even Japanese!

Read the job posting carefully.Search committees can’t put everything into a short job posting, but they will highlight the most important expectations regarding experience required, job duties, etc.,
Review your application.,
Research the company.Being familiar with the company interviewing you helps you perform well in an interview.,
Prepare an “elevator pitch.”This should be a short statement (1-3 minutes) that summarizes your career goals and skills.,
Prepare short answers to potential questions.One of the best ways to prepare for an interview is to anticipate the questions you will be asked during it, and how you will answer them.,
Practice answering questions.,
Prepare a portfolio.Since technical writer positions hinge on the quality of work you can produce, it is a good idea to have a portfolio representing past projects with you during the interview.,
Prepare to be tested.,
Be ready to ask your interviewer(s) questions.Usually, there is a point during an interview when the interviewers ask you if you have any questions for them.,
Dress professionally.,
Sleep and eat well beforehand.It is essential to get rest before your interview, so that you will be alert, energetic, and confident.,
Prepare what you need.,
Arrive early.Showing up late for an interview will not be perceived well by your interviewers.,
Make eye contact, shake hands, speak clearly, and be positive.These are simple tips to help you do your best during the interview.,
Refer to your application documents, portfolio, website, etc.,
Take notes during the interview.",How to Prepare for a Technical Writing Interview," Reading the job posting thoroughly can help you decide if the position is a good potential fit for you, and then how to tailor your application and/or responses to interview questions.


For example, if a job posting mentions that the search committee is looking for an “independent worker,” make sure to stress how you have been able to complete projects successfully on your own.
Expect specific questions about your technical writing skills. Prepare to discuss any computer programs you use, such as Microsoft Office, Adobe Framemaker, Dreamweaver, and Visio. If you have experience with databases, prepare examples.
Summarize examples that show how you organize information and projects, handle revisions and collaboration, and prioritize your tasks to meet deadlines.;
, If you are invited to interview for a position, make sure to reread your application very carefully, especially if you have recently been applying to many jobs.Look at your application materials (such as a cover letter and resume) together with the job posting, and think about how you have the skills or knowledge requested in the posting. If you think that you do not have enough experience in a particular area requested by the posting, be prepared to explain. You might emphasize other skills or experiences that will make up for any deficiencies.


For example, if a job posting requests “five years in-house technical writing experience,” and you only have four, you can emphasize your diversity rather than a lack of experience by mentioning any other writing experiences that have enriched your training beyond in-house work.

, It also helps you determine whether or not the company is a good fit for you. You can find out information about a company by visiting its website, by reading any of its publications, from other people who have knowledge of the company, or other means. Look to find information to answer questions like:How is the company organized?
How many employees does the company have?
Who manages the company? The department you would work for? What kind of educational and professional background do they have?
What kind of projects has the company worked on?

, It should be well-rehearsed, so you know exactly what to say, but it should not sound stilted or unnatural. The “elevator pitch” provides a quick and easy way to describe yourself to potential employers and colleagues.


You may have the opportunity to give your “elevator pitch” in the course of an interview, but be prepared to give it informally—you never know if you might end up next to your interviewer on an elevator, in a coffee shop, or elsewhere.

, Your responses should be specific and meaningful without rambling. Make a list of key points you want your interviewer(s) to know about you and plan on working these into your responses during the interview. Common questions you may be asked during an interview for a technical writer position include:“Tell me about a recent project.”
“What experience do you have working with subject matter experts?”
“Describe your knowledge of X industry.”
“What experience do you have working as part of a team?”
“How well do you work independently?”
“What do you like most about technical writing? What do you like least?”
“What content development tools are you familiar with?”
“What instructional design methodologies have you used?”
“What markup languages (graphics tools, page layout programs, desktop publishers, etc. are you familiar with?”
“Do you belong to any professional associations?”
“What do you like to do in your free time?”

, Once you know how to answer potential questions, you should practice giving your responses again and again until you are very familiar with them. They should be well-rehearsed, yet still sound natural during the interview.


You can begin by practicing in front of a mirror. That way, you can also pay attention to your body language as you give your responses.
You can also have a friend ask you the potential questions, and listen to your responses. Your friend can tell you whether or not everything sounded clear, if you were speaking too fast or too slow, how your body language appeared, etc.

, Even if you already submitted writing samples or other work as part of your application, bring a portfolio with extra copies to the interview, so that your interviewers can review the work as you talk about your skills.


Include some of your best work in your portfolio, but also consider showing the diversity of work you have produced, if it is relevant to the position.

, Many technical writer interviews include some form of writing test.This is so that your employers can get a sense of your skills and preparedness for the position. You can ask your search committee beforehand if there will be a test as part of your interview, and if there is one, what the format will be.


A test will assess your writing and computer abilities. The writing test will likely ask you to take some technical specifications or other material and develop a paragraph or two that explains them. You might also be asked to use programming language, such as Java or Visual Basic, and to demonstrate a knowledge of HTML and other web writing codes.

, This is often a signal that the interview is coming to an end, but it is also an opportunity for the interviewers to gauge your interest in the position. Don't ask questions that will put your interviewers in an awkward position; for example, if you ask them if the company has resources for professional development, the answer might be “no.” In many cases, it is also considered aggressive to discuss salary unless the interviewers bring it up first.Questions to consider asking include:


“Tell me about your management style.”
“Can you tell me about one of your recent projects?”
“Who are your typical customers or clients?”
“Do you use a particular style guide?”
“What role does technical communication play in your company?”
“How do you train new writers?”

, Unless explicitly told otherwise, you should dress for the interview in “business wear”: conservatively and professionally, in a suit or equivalent clothing. Dressing too informally for an interview will be taken as a sign of unprofessionalism or a lack of interest in the position.


Pay attention to your grooming. Make sure your nails are trimmed, your clothes are clean and pressed, your breath smells good, and your hair is neat. You want to make a good impression at the interview.
If the interview does not take place in-person, but rather via a video-conference, you should still dress appropriately. Even if the interview takes place over the phone, dressing as though the interview were in person will put you in the right frame of mind.

, You should also make sure to eat beforehand, so that you are not hungry or weak during the interview. You may not want to eat a large meal, but a protein-rich snack at least will give you some energy.

, If your interview takes place in person, remember to bring a portfolio with samples, copies of your resume, as well as your notes and any other materials (such as a pad and pen to take notes) for the interview. If the interview takes place over the phone or a videoconference, be sure to charge your device(s) beforehand., Try arriving for your interview about 10 minutes early. This will give you some breathing time to mentally prepare for the interview. If the company has a receptionist or assistant, you can let him or her know that you are there for an interview while you wait.


If your interview takes place over the phone or a videoconference, have everything set up in a quiet, private, professional location at least 10 minutes before the interview is supposed to start.

, Making eye contact and shaking hands firmly helps show your confidence. Speaking clearly makes you easy to understand, and also conveys confidence. Being positive suggests to your interviewers that you will be a good fit, so avoid talking badly about previous employers, work projects, etc.

, during the interview.Sometimes, search committees interview many people, and so referring them to specific documents can help you stand out. Even if you are one of only a few candidates, the specificity is beneficial.

, You may want to have a pad and pen with you during the interview so that you can take notes. Jotting down a few notes can help you keep track of the questions you are being asked—just make sure that you don’t appear distracted, or stare at your notes instead of making natural eye contact with your interviewers.

Select a technical writing track.,
Be tech-savvy.,
Add an Associate's degree or certification.,
Volunteer for experience.",How to Become a Technical Writer," If you are inclined towards technical writing, explore this profession a bit more to find out if it really is for you.

, It is usually rare to find a program which combines communication with technical writing. However, you can go for a degree in communication with an emphasis on technical writing. Technical writers usually have a college degree. Having a relevant degree or training in the field can multiply your chances of landing technical writing jobs.

, Technical writing degrees normally give you the option of technical, medical, and scientific options for your degree. You need to select the option that interests you the most so that you can understand the style, terminology, and trends of that specific area.


If you are not enrolled in a technical writing degree you can go for a double major in writing and another field that you are interested in, such as biology, computer science, graphic design, law, engineering, or mechanics. If a double major is not an option for you, you can always learn on your own.

, Although computer science classes at your school can help you a lot in a technical writing career, you should have knowledge of various software programs.

Review the letter.,
Write a final paragraph.,
Write a final sentence.",How to End a Letter1," Before writing a conclusion, reread your letter and decide whether you are satisfied with the message you have written. Did you communicate your message clearly? Will it have the effect you want it to have on the recipient?


If you're writing a cover letter or a business letter, make sure you've covered all of your bases before getting to the conclusion. The body of the letter should make the case that you're a good candidate for the job; the conclusion serves only to wrap things up, so don't save the most important information for last.
No matter what kind of letter you're writing, make sure it is written in such a way that the intent is understood. Letters, unlike some other forms of communication, have an element of permanency. Once you write something down it's hard to take it back. Review the body of your letter with this in mind before moving to the ending. 
;
, Write an ending in keeping with the tone of the rest of the letter. Did you write a brief, to-the-point letter, or was it a longer profession of love? Think of the last paragraph of your letter as a conclusion, in which you have the chance to restate the major themes of the message and leave your recipient with just the right feeling. For example:


""My experience working at the Humane Society and leading the Paws for Peace group at my university will make me an excellent candidate for an internship at Boston Animal Hospital.""
""Celebrating Steve's promotion, welcoming a new grandchild to the family and vacationing in Australia have made 2013 a year to remember for our family. We hope your family's year has been equally well blessed.""
""I know I'll smile every time I think about your visit. Our daytime excursions, long dinners and wild nights won't soon be forgotten. I can't wait until next time!""


, The very last sentence in a personal letter is a chance to wish the recipient well or request for him or her to write back. Make sure the last sentence matches your overall tone and hits just the right note.


If you want to thank the recipient for taking the time to meet with you in a professional setting, consider ""Thank you for taking the time to meet with me on Tuesday"" or ""Thank you for your time and consideration.""
If you'd like the recipient to write a letter back, ""Write back soon!"" or ""I'm looking forward to hearing from you"" are both good choices.
If you're writing a loved one, you might want to tell them ""I love you,"" ""I'm thinking about you"" or ""I miss you.""
If you're writing the letter to suit a particular occasion, like a birthday or holiday, reiterate your well wishing. For example, write ""Again, have a wonderful Thanksgiving!""

Write a formal sign-off.,
Write a casual sign-off.,
Write a personal sign-off.,
Write an intimate sign-off.",How to End a Letter2," Business letter sign-offs should be formal, familiar, and appropriate for the situation. Unless you are in a field that values creativity and originality above traditional business decorum, it's best to play it on the safe side when your letter is formal in nature. Always follow the sign-off with your signature. Consider the following options:


Sincerely,
Best wishes,
Warm wishes,
Thank you,
Respectfully yours,

, For letters that are more casual in nature, the closing helps maintain goodwill and keep correspondence flowing smoothly. If you're writing to an acquaintance, casual friend or a classmate, you might close with a friendly goodbye, like these:


Cheers,
Take care,
Til next time,
Later,
Peace,
Warmly,

, If you're writing to a close friend or family member, consider a more personal closing, like:


XO,
Yours,
Hugs,
Kisses,
Til soon,
Write soon,
Love,

, If you're writing to a lover, ending words can be even more intimate. A genuine, personable closing helps the letter sound like it came from you, not a store-bought greeting card. The right phrase might even improve your relationship. Follow the sign-off with your initials or signature. Consider these:


Love always,
Yours forever,
Affectionately yours,
Longing to see you,
Patiently yours,
Your darling,

Decide not to add one.,
Add a postscript to include additional information.,
Add a postscript to enhance the letter's meaning.,
Reread your finished letter.",How to End a Letter3," If you've said all that you need to say, there's no need to add a postscript, or a ""PS."" In fact, there are certain occasions when you actually shouldn't - namely, when you're writing any type of business letter.

, Postscripts are often added after a letter has been signed as a way to include information that was accidentally left out, or that is not important enough to warrant its own paragraph in the letter. For example,


""PS. I bought you a souvenir! I'll give it to you when I get back.""
""PS. My aunt says 'hi.'""

, Sometimes postscripts are included as a way to lighten a letter's tone with a joke, or to playfully flirt with the recipient. Since postscripts are usually just a sentence or two, they can be used as a way of including information without the pressure of writing an explanation. Take these, for example:


""PS. I already finished off the box of chocolates. Please send more supplies.""
""PS. Oh, I forgot to mention one thing: I'm madly in love with you.""

, It should flow seamlessly from body to conclusion, with no inconsistencies in tone or message. If it doesn't, erase what you wrote or press ""Delete"" and keep working on it. People often read letters more than once, and some even save them forever. It's worth taking a few extra minutes to make the letter perfect.

Know who your reader is.,
Determine what your reader needs to know.,
Organize the document to meet your reader's needs.,
Choose an appropriate tone for the document.",How to Create Technical Writing Headlines1," The audience for your document and the headlines you'll create to help present it will determine what information you will present and how you will structure it. For example, quick start guide for a software application requires simpler language, briefer sentences, and less extraneous material than does a paper for a scientific journal.


In many cases, if you're writing for an internal ""discourse community"" such as a school, hospital, or government agency, you'll be provided with a company or agency style guide that details how to format documents for the people who will read your work.;
, Although you may have done a large amount of research in preparing your document, not all the information needs to be presented up front. Someone needing to know how to change a spark plug does not need to know the complete history of the internal combustion engine. But he or she does need to know the right type of replacement plug, where the plug goes, and the right tool to use to remove the old plug and replace it with a new one.

, Most readers read technical documents looking for solutions to their problems, for example, how to operate a lawn mower, how to use Microsoft Word's Track Changes feature, what to do when their car's ""Check Engine"" light comes on. Documents that answer these questions (owner's manuals, user manuals, help files) are organized by defining the reader's problem and presenting those solutions. You'll want to create an outline for your document to decide where each piece of essential information goes and from that, create the headline that introduces it. A sample structure is given below, with places for headlines marked.


Definition of the problem, with appropriate background and context. You'd have a headline for this section; the section itself may be as short as a single sentence or as long as 3 paragraphs.
Recommendations for solving the problem. You'd introduce this section with a headline; the recommendations could be single sentences or 1 to 2 paragraph subsections introduced with subheadings.
Reasoning behind the solution(s) offered. In a user manual, support for each recommendation will likely follow the recommendation itself. In a research paper, the research procedure would be a section of its own, with its own headline.
Implementing the solution. You'd introduce this section with a headline. The section might be a list of single-sentence steps, or it might be a series of paragraphs with the first sentence defining the step and subsequent sentences explaining the reason for performing it.
Appendices. Your document would include an appendix if you need to include a lengthy explanation of how you gathered the information your solution is based on or for the data you based any graphs or charts in the main document on-in short, anything that would break the flow of your main document. You'd use a headline for this section, and if you have several Appendices, a heading for each appendix.

, For most technical writing, your tone will be serious and businesslike. Articles for a scientific journal will tend to be more scholarly, while marketing materials may adopt a more engaging, upbeat tone to encourage people to buy a product or service after presenting the advantages the product or service offers.


If you've been provided with a style guide, it will usually define an appropriate tone for the audience you're writing to, particularly when the prospective audience is large, as for a website.

"
"
Match the tone of your headline to the text following it.,
Make the heading describe what follows it.,
Keep the length reasonable.,
Use subheadings where necessary.,
Adopt a consistent style of capitalization.,
Use parallel construction in headlines when possible.,
Consider using a numbering system for section headings and subheads.",How to Create Technical Writing Headlines2," A serious document should have a serious-sounding headline to introduce it; an upbeat document should have an upbeat headline.

, This can be as simple as the words ""Introduction,"" ""Recommendations,"" ""Implementation,"" ""Conclusion,"" and ""Appendix"" or something more creative, such as ""About the Problem,"" ""We Suggest,"" ""Doing It,"" ""In Summary,"" and ""For Further Reading."" (The exact wording would be determined by the tone of the article, your audience, and whatever style guide you may be writing to.)

, You do not have to keep your headlines to 3 words or less, but shorter headlines usually grab your readers' attention better than do longer headlines. Put the most important words close to the beginning, so that people will notice them more easily and remember them better.


One way to structure a headline is with a main point, followed by a colon and then a memorable subtitle, such as ""Help Files: How to Write Them So Users Will Actually Use Them.""

, Sometimes, the information in a document or section of a document covers more than a single headline can reasonably introduce. In those cases, you can have a main heading as an overview of the section, with subheadings introducing each significant concept within the section. (In this article, the subheadings ""Planning Your Technical Document"" and ""Writing Headlines For Your Document"" communicate first the importance of planning the document itself before you write headlines for it and then the process of writing those headlines.)

, There are several ways you can capitalize headlines in a technical document. You can use a different capitalization style for a subheading than you do for a main headline, but you should use the same capitalization style for each headings and for each subhead within the document.


Capitalize the first letter of each word in the headline. (This is known as ""Title Case"" in Microsoft Word.)
Capitalize the first letter of the first word and of the last word.
Capitalize the first letter of the first word, the last word, and each significant word in between. (Words that aren't capitalized are the articles 'a, an, the' conjunctions, and prepositions of 2 or 3 letters, unless they are the last word in the headline.)
Capitalize the only first letter of the first word and any proper nouns or adjectives that may be in the title. (This is known as ""Sentence Case"" in Microsoft Word.) If you combine this style with one of the others, use this style for subheadings and the other for headlines.

, ""Parallel construction"" means to structure phrases the same way: if one headline begins with a verb, all headlines should begin with a verb. (The subheadings in this article, ""Planning Your Technical Document"" and ""Writing Headlines For Your Document,"" are an example of parallel construction.) Although more commonly used in writing bullet points, parallel construction is also effective in headlines to show your reader the similarities in content that follow each similarly phrased headline.


Parallel construction is more difficult to maintain when you have a large number of headlines or subheadings to work with.

, You can further structure your technical document by incorporating a numbering system into your headings and subheadings. In this system, section headings begin with an Arabic numeral, followed by a period (1., 2., 3.), then the text of the heading. Subheadings below the section heading begin with Arabic numerals with one decimal place, followed by a period, (1.1., 1.2., 1.3.) and are indented so that the numeric label falls under the first word of the heading. The next level of subheading begins with an Arabic numeral, a period, another Arabic numeral, another period, and another Arabic numeral and period (1.1.1., 1.1.2., 1.1.3.) and is indented so that the label falls under the first word of the subhead above it.


This method is more commonly used for technical documents for an internal audience, such as engineering procedures. It is rarely used for documents for an external audience, such as software user manuals or help files.

Learn the strokes.,
Focus on the muscles, not the bones.,
Apply pressure, but not too much.,
Massage slowly.,
Communicate with the person you're massaging.",How to Give a Massage1," The most common massage type is a Swedish massage, which uses four different types of strokes to relax and heal the muscles.A full-body massage employs all four techniques:


Effleurage is a smooth stroke that relaxes soft muscle tissue. Your hands should glide easily over the surface of the body.
Petrissage involves squeezing and rolling the muscle between your hands, which is useful for loosening muscle tension.
Friction is the use of deep movements administered with steady pressure in order to cause tissues to rub against one another and stimulate circulation.
Tapotement is a staccato tap done with the sides or heels of the hands.;
, When you're giving a massage, the key is to use your hands to work the muscles in the neck, shoulders, back, arms, legs and feet. Use a gentle touch to locate the soft, fleshy muscles, then knead them with your hands. Never exert pressure on a person's bones, especially the spine and tailbone. If you're in doubt about whether a spot is composed of muscle or bone, use a gentle, light touch to stroke it, then move on to another section.

, Knead the muscles with your fingers, palms and the heels of your hands. Exert a steady, firm pressure to stimulate circulation and loosen the muscles. Don't use the weight of your body to push down on a person's muscles, though; you could end up causing pain or even an injury if you press too hard.


When you apply the right amount of pressure, you should be able to feel the muscle move and relax under the skin. The person you're massaging might utter sounds of relaxation, but he or she should not cry out in pain. If the person complains, ease up.
Sometimes it's difficult to apply even pressure using your hands, especially if you get tired after awhile. Try using a tennis ball instead of your hands. Place the ball against the muscle you're massaging and use your hand to gently roll it against the body.

, The person you're massaging should not get the impression that you are in a hurry. Working too quickly makes the massage session less relaxing, and also less effective; you can't thoroughly massage the muscles if you make quick motions over the surface of the body instead of taking the time to penetrate deeper.


Use steady, even strokes as you massage, rather than quick, jerky motions.
Divide the total massage time among the body parts you are massaging. For example, if you planned for the massage to take an hour, spend ten minutes on the neck, twenty on the back and shoulders, ten on the arms, ten on the legs, and ten on the feet.

, Ask him or which muscles feel tense or tight. Tell him or her to let you know if the massage feels painful or uncomfortable in any way, and be sure to respect his or her wishes during this intimate process.

"
"
Start with the neck and shoulders.,
Rub the back.,
Work on the arms and legs.,
Massage the hands and feet.,
End with the face and head.",How to Give a Massage2," People often hold a lot of tension in this area of their body, and when you don't have time to do a full massage, focusing on the neck and shoulders can provide instant relaxation. To massage the neck and shoulders, use the following technique:


Use your fingers to grasp the side of the neck and gently press on the muscles and tendons. Knead with your thumb and forefingers. You can massage the head at the same time with your free hand.
Rest your fingers over the shoulders and place your thumbs on the muscles located on either side of the neck. Squeeze the shoulders and press in with your thumbs. The motion should be slow and steady.
You can also use your forearms to massage the shoulders. Rest your forearms on either shoulder and gently rock back and forth to loosen the shoulder muscles.

, Work down from the shoulders on either side of the back, rubbing the muscles as you go. When you get to the lower back area, knead the tight muscles there with your hands and thumbs. People who stand or sit for hours every day often develop pain in this area, so you might want to spend extra time loosening the muscles.


Remember not to exert pressure on the spine and other back bones. Focus on the muscles to either side of the spine.
Go deeper by kneeling beside the person and placing the heel of your hand on the lower back muscle on the opposite side, with your fingers pointing away from the body. Place your other hand on top of your first hand and lean into the muscle. Knead the muscle this way for a few minutes, then switch to the other side.

, Use both hands to form a circle around the upper arm. Knead the arm muscles with your palms and fingers, working your way down to the wrists. Repeat with the opposite arm, then work on the legs, starting from the thighs and kneading the muscles until you reach the ankles.

, Have the person you're massaging turn over so that his or her face and torso are now facing up. Massage each hand between your thumb and forefinger, taking care to work the muscles in the palms, thumbs, and each individual finger. Do the same with the feet, making sure not to press too hard on the bones.


Use gentle, even strokes on the feet. Try not to tickle the person, since that could break his or her state of relaxation.
Bend the hands and feet back and forth to stretch the muscles as you massage them.

, Kneel behind the person you're massaging and use your fingers to rub his or her temples in circles. Gently rub the forehead and sinus area. Place your fingers on the person's scalp and massage it using the same motion you'd use to shampoo your hair.

"
"
Choose a peaceful room.,
Prepare the massage area.,
Set up a table with massage supplies.,
Consider lighting and music.,
Help the person you're massaging get comfortable.",How to Give a Massage3," During a massage, outside distractions should be kept to a minimum. Traffic noises, outside music, and the sound of people's voices can disrupt the relaxing mood that makes massages so emotionally beneficial. The bedroom is the most obvious choice, but if there's another room in your house that's more removed from the main action in your home, consider using it as the massage room.


The massage room should be clean, without excessive clutter or messy areas that could make the person you're massaging feel anxious or stressed out. If you're using the bedroom and there's a pile of laundry in the corner, clean it up before you start the massage.
Choose a room with plenty of privacy. Find a place where you aren't likely to get interrupted by children, roommates or pets wandering in. If the door to the room has a lock, you may want to consider using it.
Make sure the temperature in the room is comfortable, so that the person you're massaging doesn't get too cold or warm.

, Professional massages take place on massage tables, but any flat, comfortable surface is appropriate for a home massage. You can use a bed, the floor, or even your dining room table, as long as you're sure it's sturdy enough to hold the weight of a person without collapsing.


Line the massage area with clean, soft sheets. If the person you're massaging tends to get cold, you could also line the area with a warm blanket or two. The surface you're using should be flat and smooth, so the person being massaged feels as comfortable as possible while also being supported.
Provide a small pillow for the person to rest his or her head upon during the massage.

, To give the most basic massage, all you really need are your hands. However, certain equipment can make the experience more effective and pleasurable. Prepare for the massage but setting up a small side table with these items:


Massage oil or lotion. Applying some oil or lotion before you begin rubbing the person's body will help your hands slide smoothly across his or her skin. This prevents chafing and irritating or painful friction.

Special massage oils are sold in health and beauty stores, but you could also use almond oil, jojoba oil or another cosmetic-grade oil from the health food store.

Make your own massage oil by mixing coconut oil with a few drops of essential oil, such as lavender, which promotes relaxation, or lemongrass, which is energizing.


A few clean towels. If you decide to use oil or lotion, it's good to have a few towels in case you need to wipe up spills or excess liquid as you go. You might also use the towels to cover parts of the person's body that aren't being massaged so they stay warm while you work on other parts of the body.

, The lighting in the massage room should be dim, but not dark, to promote a soothing but not sleepy atmosphere. Turn off the overhead lights in the room, and if the sun is bright, close the shades as well. Consider lighting a few candles around the room. If you want to use music to help the person you're massaging feel relaxed, choose peaceful instrumental music without a steady beat.

, Invite the person into the room and show them the bed or spot on the floor you've set up for the massage. It's up to you and the person you're massaging to determine what the person wears during the massage. If clothing is worn, it should be thin and lightweight, so that the massage can be effectively administered through the fabric.


Let the person know that he or she should lie face down on the bed or massage area.
You may want to leave the room for a few minutes so he or she has time to get comfortable before the massage begins.

Apply facial lotion.,
Massage their forehead.,
Massage their temples.,
Massage their cheekbones.,
Massage their jaw and lower cheek.,
Massage around their ears.,
Give them a face mask, if desired.,
Allow their face mask to rest.,
Rinse their face and apply toner.",How to Give a Facial Massage," Whomever is getting the massage should remove any makeup that they have on. Makeup clogs the pores and will interfere with restorative massage products that you will be using on their face.


You might suggest that they wash their face in a shower just prior to the massage. Since you'll be working with them closely, they will want to be as fresh and clean as possible. This will also help them feel less self conscious and relaxed. No one wants to be worrying about whether they have body odor while they are getting massaged (and you don't want to be smelling it either!).;
, Ideally you will have a massage chair or bed, but if not a normal comfortable chair is fine. Just make sure that the surrounding area is neat and tidy. It is best if the area feels empty, with nothing besides you, the other person, and your massage tools.Take care of this in advance or while the person receiving the massage washes.

, Set out any clean pillows or towels that you and the other person may be using (a towel behind the head is customary). Be sure that they are clean and fresh.Make sure your milky face lotion, face mask, rinse, toner, and moisturizer are within reach if you will be using them.

, Gentle, relaxing music or calm ambient noises are used to set the mood during professional massages.Doing the same is very easy. You can also light scented candles or incense to further relax the mind and body.Be sure that the room is at a comfortable temperature.

, You will be working on the delicate skin of someone's freshly washed face. The last thing you want is to be spreading germs or bacteria there. Thoroughly wash your hands.

, The person receiving the massage should either lie down on the massage bed or sit in their chair. Make sure that they are comfortable.Propping a rolled towel behind their head will usually help. Have them close their eyes and relax.

, Apply a hypoallergenic milky face lotion to their face and gently rub it into the skin.Appropriate lotions will be non oily, light, and easily absorbed. As you massage the face, the moisturizer will be absorbed and hydrate the skin as well as reduce friction between the face and your hands.Don't apply too much pressure at first.








Don't apply lotion directly to the face. Apply it to your hands first!, Start with fingers, but before long place your palm on the forehead. Move it up and around in a circular motion with even pressure.Go back and forth across the forehead several times. This relieves tension and helps to ensure that they person receiving the massage keeps their eyes closed.









Use circular motions here and elsewhere, circular motions are ideal for the face., Place one hand on each side of to head, at the temples. Using only your fingertips at first, massage lightly in circles, applying gentle pressure on both sides.Repeat 2-3 times or more, as desired. Depending on the person, you can increase the pressure by using your thumbs or more of your hands as necessary.







, Move your hands in a little bit, under the cheekbones on each side. Using only fingertips at first, apply light pressure to the skin, then gently rub towards the ears.Gentle circling is also fine. Apply only as much pressure as feels comfortable to the face.

, Put both your thumbs under the jaw, with your index fingers pointing up to rest against either side of the nose. Then move your whole hands upwards and outwards, so that they slide along the cheeks towards the ears.Use the same motions you did on the cheekbones., Finish with a massage around the ears, if desired.Use your fingertips and then escalate pressure as necessary. You can circle the top of the ear and apply pressure on the head and neck as you slide down towards the torso. Massaging the ears themselves is often relaxing as well. , Adding a face mask is a nice touch.There are a variety of choices for facial masks. You can also make your own natural face mask.

, Most face masks need to be left on their face for a while to be effective. While you are waiting for this time to elapse, you can either talk or continue the massage by gently massaging their neck and shoulders.

, If you used a mask on them, be sure to rinse it off completely. You can also have them rinse it if that is easier. At this point, apply toner and a light facial moisturizer, if desired.

Drape the person well.,
Apply massage oil.,
Use some gliding.,
Massage with your fingers together.",How to Give a Deep Tissue Massage1," People are generally not fully clothed for deep tissue massage, and most people will not feel comfortable if they are completely exposed.Therefore, you need to cover the areas you're not working on at the moment to help the person feel more at ease.You'll usually start the person face down on the table.;
, Use a bit of oil on your hands. You don't need a large amount of oil for deep massage. Use broad strokes across the person's back to help spread out the oil. The heat from the strokes will also help melt the oil.Check in with the person to see if they have any allergies to particular oils., Gently run your hands over the person's skin. You don't want to start with working on deep tissue, as that will cause the person to tense up. Light gliding helps get the person warmed up and relaxes them, so that you can move on to deep tissue.Basically, you'll use your whole hand to rub over the area where you'll be doing deep tissue massage. You'll only be applying light pressure at this time, just enough so your hands are felt.

, Use your whole hand with the fingers together. If you spread your fingers apart, you're more likely to pinch the muscle, which can be painful. Pretend you're sculpting clay, whether you're gliding your hands over the person or moving on to deep tissue."
"
Use the palm of your hand.,
Massage with your fingertips.,
Use your forearm to apply pressure on the back.,
Go sideways along the bottom of the back.",How to Give a Deep Tissue Massage2," As you move through the first gentle strokes, you'll feel the muscles start to warm up. When they do, you can use the palm of your hand and your body weight to start adding pressure to the strokes. Move your hand along the muscle that runs beside the spine down the length of the back. Apply pressure in slow, even strokes.Try not to put pressure on any bone or the spine.

, Once the muscles have warmed up a bit more, start using your fingertips instead. You can use very small sideways strokes or a light rocking motion along the muscles, still keeping your fingertips together. Run your hands from the bottom of the back up to the shoulder., Starting at the shoulder, place the forearm on the inner part of the back. Applying pressure with your body weight, run your forearm on the muscle that goes along the outside of the spine. Your forearm should glide from the upper body down the back in a fluid motion., As your forearm reaches the bottom area of the back, turn your arm sideways to go just above the buttocks. Take the arm up the back along the outer edge and around to the shoulder. With your hand towards the ground, move your arm down the shoulder towards the chest as you finish up."
"
Use your forearm to apply pressure to the leg.,
Apply pressure on the calf with your thumbs.,
Press up the upper arm with the heel of your hand.,
Run your fingers up the forearm.,
Massage the hand with your thumbs.",How to Give a Deep Tissue Massage3," Starting above the ankle on the back of the leg, use your forearm to add pressure to your strokes. Your forearm should be across the leg, and you add pressure with your body weight. Move up the back of the calf and thigh, and rest your arm for a moment just under the glutes. Sweep your arm in a fluid motion around the hip., Place your hands on either side of the calf with your thumbs in the middle of the calf, one behind the other. While applying pressure, move your thumbs up the calf, staying in the groove in the middle.The muscle along the back of the calf is actually one muscle, the gastrocnemius muscle, but it has two heads. That means that there's a groove down the middle of it for your thumbs to follow.
Alternatively, you can use your knuckles.

, Starting at the elbow with the person on their back, move up the arm toward the shoulder with the heel of your hand. Use your body weight to help apply pressure.You can also use your knuckles on the arm to apply pressure. Use small circular motions.

, With your thumb on one side and the rest of your fingers on the other side of the forearm (inside/outside), apply pressure on both sides. Move your hand up the arm towards the elbow.You can also use both thumbs on the top of the forearm. Have your thumbs in a single line, not next to each other. Applying pressure, run them up the middle of the forearm.

, Have both thumbs next to each other on the inside of the wrist. Move them together slowly over the wrist and up along the lifelines in the hand. Pay special attention to the muscled areas, including the area around the base of the thumb."
"
Don't hit the spine.,
Avoid other vulnerable areas.,
Discuss the person's health before beginning.,
Move towards the heart.,
Pay attention to the person's reaction.",How to Give a Deep Tissue Massage4," When you're using deep tissue massage, particularly on the back, you need to be careful of where you are massaging. Hitting the spine could cause pain or even damage, so you need to avoid massaging heavily in that area., If you're massaging the whole body, avoid the front of the neck, the abdomen, and the inside of the upper arm. These areas are more vulnerable to damage than others, so it's best to avoid them., Deep tissue massage, like most forms of massage, can cause problems if the person has certain health conditions. For instance, bleeding disorders, fractures, osteoporosis (severe), and deep vein thrombosis could all cause problems with massages., When working on the limbs in deep massage, it's best to apply pressure as you move towards the heart. That means going up the leg, for instance, instead of going down it with your massage techniques.Applying deep pressure towards the heart helps keep the blood flowing that direction.
Deep tissue massage may help lower blood pressure., A deep tissue massage shouldn't be overly painful. A little bit of pain may be okay, but if you notice the person is clenching their muscles or curling their toes, it's too much. You need to adjust your approach to make it softer. You can also check in with the person, asking them if it feels okay."

Raise and rub one leg.,
Repeat with the other leg.,
Finish by massaging the thigh.,
Be very gentle with swollen legs.,
Avoid massaging the inner thighs on a pregnant woman.,
See a doctor for chronic leg pain.",How to Give a Leg Massage," To start, help the person you're massaging find a comfortable position. For leg massages, it's usually easy to lie down somewhere like a couch. The person can have their legs stretched forward. If you're only massaging one leg, you may want to have the person lie on their side with the leg you're massaging extending upward. You can also have the person lie with their legs stretched out and elevated slightly. A pillow can be used to elevate the person's legs., If you want, it's okay to use oil for a leg massage. This can make it easier to run your hands and fingers over someone's legs and oils can also provide a soothing effect. For leg massages, go for oils like olive oil, avocado oil, or almond oil. Most of these oils can be purchased at a supermarket.Make sure the person you're massaging does not have an existing allergy to the oil you use.

, You should use a lighter pressure over bony areas like the shins and knees. Use more pressure for big muscles, such as the thighs.The body parts you use to perform a massage affect the pressure. The elbows generally provide the strongest pressure. The palms and fingers will generally apply less pressure., Ask the person if there's a particular area where they want extra pressure or attention. For example, if someone's thighs are bothering them, they may want you to focus on massaging their thighs. You may want to linger on certain areas and give them more attention., Starting at the foot helps promote blood circulation, which can help ease pain and tension in the legs. Sandwich the person's foot between your palms. Then, rub the foot firmly for a few minutes. When you're done rubbing the foot between your hands, give the foot a few gentle strokes moving from the toes to ankles.It does not matter which leg you start with.

, Move upward from the foot towards the thighs and calves. For these areas, use a loose fist to make long, gentle strokes. Move from the foot upward when you make your strokes. This pushes blood towards the heart, increasing blood circulation., Raise one of the person's legs. Use one hand to support the ankle. Place your hand on the person's ankle and push upward towards their knee. Apply pressure between your palms for the best effect. Do six strokes.It does not matter which leg you massage first.

, After raising one leg, raise the other. Repeat the same process. Hold the leg up by the ankle with one hand and massage the lower leg with the other. Do six strokes on this leg as well., Finish with a few fast rubs to the thigh, using your palms. Then, do some more firm strokes using the heel of your hand. Repeat with the other leg.You can massage either the inner or outer thigh or both.

, If legs are swollen due to medical reasons, be very gentle. Make sure to check with the person to make sure they're comfortable. Use the lightest pressure possible when massaging swollen legs., If you're massaging a pregnant woman's legs, stay away from massaging the inner thighs. Blood clots are more common in this area during pregnancy and massaging the area can dislodge clots. This can be a very serious, even fatal, problem., Leg pain can indicate health problems such as a leg injury or chronic conditions like arthritis.While massages can temporarily relieve, frequent leg pain should be evaluated by a medical professional."

Massage the neck and the base of the head.,
Move up the head.,
Try some hair tugging.",How to Give a Head Massage," It's best to start with clean hands when providing a massage to someone. Scrub your hands in soap and warm water. You should spend at least 20 seconds washing your hands., Wet heat can help the person relax. You can have them take a bath, for instance. Another option is dampening a towel and heating it up in the microwave until it's warm. Wrap the person's head in it for 10 to 15 minutes., It can help to run a brush through the person's hair first so that you aren't catching your fingers on tangles. However, you can also just use your fingers to work through any big tangles before you start the massage.If you hit a tangle later, don't try to pull it out, as you'll jolt the person out of their relaxed state.

, Most kitchen oils will work for this purpose, as will massage oils. You can use avocado, coconut, almond, or mustard oil, to name a few. Begin on the sides. Massage the oil into the scalp with your fingers and thumbs, moving up to the top of the head. Make sure you get both the front and back of the head, as well.Warm the oil up in your hands first, and start with a small amount. You can always add more.

, When massaging the person's head, try to go in slow, gentle strokes. Slow strokes generally feel better than fast movements. Also, slow movements tend to be much more relaxing than faster movements.For this type of massage, it's fine for the person to be sitting up or lying down.

, Using your fingertips, make light circular motions across the person's head. Move from back to front and then front to back. You can go over the head a couple of times with this motion., With one hand, cup the person's neck. Gently rub the neck with the thumb on one side and the other fingers on the opposite side. Move up and down the neck. Try to move the skin as you massage instead of rubbing on top of the skin.You can also use this motion at the base of the head where the hair begins.If you're massaging yourself, use your thumbs at the base of your head. With one thumb on each side of your head, use circular motions to massage the base of your head. You carry a lot of tension here, so some slow massaging can help., Run your hands under the hair near the temples. You can use this technique on another person, but it works just as well doing it on yourself. The heels of your palms should end up over the temples. Apply light pressure, and push upward for a few seconds. You can use this technique all over the head., With a deep massage, you're going to apply more pressure, and it's easier for both of you if the person is lying down. They should be face up, and you should be facing towards them at the top of their head., Place your hands under the person's head to start. Stroke up the back of the neck until you reach the base of the head. Your fingertips should rest on the ridge at the back of the head for a moment. Rub in a circular motion starting at the base of the head. This movement is different from a basic massage, where you cupped your hand around the neck. Here, you're just using your fingertips to massage., As you move up the head, your circles can get bigger, and you can apply a bit more pressure, which makes it different from a basic massage. In a basic massage, your strokes are generally light. In a deep massage, use your thumbs in addition to your other fingers to create the movements, and don't forget to massage the crown. At the temples, move up into the hair for deep, slow circles., Using your fingertips, gently stroke the person's head from back to front. As you come back, gather sections of hair, and gently tug outward. Continue tugging different sections as you move backwards.Not everyone likes this sensation, so make sure the person is okay with it.

Identify a condition or injury that can benefit from medical massage.,
Check insurance rules.,
Talk to your primary care provider.,
Obtain a referral.,
Keep records carefully.",How to Get a Physician Medical Massage Referral," In order to prove medical necessity for a massage, you must have a recognizable health condition that may respond to massage in a positive way.;
, Before proceeding with a request for a physician referral for a massage, check to see what the actual rules are for your insurance policy.


Consider whether or not a referral will result in coverage. Often, even if you have a referral, other coverage limitations may apply. Read the policy document thoroughly to make sure that this is not the case.
Understand any exclusions or limitations specifically mentioned in the policy. Another stumbling block for getting medical massage covered is when it is included in exclusions, along with chiropractor visits and other specific types of treatment.

, In many HMOs and other health plans, this doctor is the one who must authorize the referral.


Discuss medical necessity with the doctor. Figure out how that medical professional will diagnose a condition that can formally necessitate medical massage.
Ask the doctor about what kinds of other treatments go along with medical massage. One way to get a better chance of successful coverage is to combine medical massage with other types of treatments. Ask about how a holistic treatment plan can help provide better rehabilitation or recovery while legitimizing the use of medical massage within a greater context.

, Make sure that the primary care physician's office releases the referral, either to you or directly to the specialist and the insurance company.

, If the insurance company comes back in the future to ask for the referral or other facts such as a date range, keep that document on file to be able to provide that information and streamline any coverage or eventual payment by the insurance company.

Avoid the spine and any bones.",How to Give a Full Body Massage," It is essential that the room is comfortable for conducting your massage. If your partner/client feels uncomfortable throughout the massage, they will not enjoy it as much!


Make sure they have somewhere comfortable to lie down, such as a bed, a soft rug or a proper massage table. Cover the surface with soft towels to keep them clean and free of oil.
Make sure the room is nice and warm. Remember that your partner/client will be partly undressed for the duration of the massage, so you don't want them to be cold. Use a space heater if necessary.
Make sure the room you use for the massage is somewhere private where you will not be disturbed by any other people, children or animals.;
, There's something very relaxing about candles, so it's a good idea to light a couple around the room.









If possible, turn the lights down low or off completely and work only by candlelight. You want the person receiving the massage to be so relaxed that they're almost asleep by the end, so the darker it is the better!
Use candles with relaxing (but not overpowering) scents, such as lavender or sea breeze, to contribute to the overall experience.

, Playing some soothing music can contribute to the calm and relaxing atmosphere of the massage. Gentle classical music, or sounds from nature are both good options.









If possible, try to find out what type of music your partner/client enjoys. Remember that the massage is about them, not you, so you should try to cater to their tastes.
Don't play the music too loud, it should be playing very softly in the background. It should add to the experience, not take away from it.

, It is essential to use oil when giving a massage. It helps your hands to glide easily over the skin, so you don't cause pulling, pinching or any kind of pain to your partner/client.









There are plenty of fancy (and expensive) store bought oils available, but any kind of natural oil will do just fine. For example, if you have sunflower or grape seed oil in your kitchen, you can use them for your massage. Jojoba and almond oils are also very effective and have a pleasant aroma.
You can add a few drops of essential oil to your massage oil. You should use pure (natural and unadulterated) essential oils, not chemical perfume oils. Be aware that essential oils can penetrate the bloodstream, so choose wisely: opt for relatively gentle oils like lavender or orange. However, you should consult a medical professional first if your partner/client is pregnant or has any serious medical conditions.
Try to warm the oil and your hands slightly before applying the oil to your partner/client's skin. Cold oil/hands are not conducive to a relaxing massage!

, Make sure you have plenty of fresh, clean towels on hand for use during the massage.









First you will need to cover the surface you are working on with towels in order to protect them from the massage oil (which can stain).
Secondly, you will need towels to cover the your partner/client's body as you work on them. Ideally they should be stripped down to their underwear to leave as much skin exposed as possible. Then you can cover them with a towel to protect their modesty and to keep them warm while you are working on each body part.
Thirdly, you will need extra towels to wipe the excess oil off you hands during and after the massage.

, Start massaging the soles of the feet by wrapping both hands around the foot and using your thumbs to apply pressure.









Pay special attention to the arch of each foot, as this area tends to accumulate a lot of tension, but also massage the heel and the ball of the foot.
When you get to the toes, grab each one individually and give it a gentle pull, this helps to release any tension.
Be aware that not everyone likes having their feet touched, and some people are very ticklish, so ask your partner/client before you touch their feet!, When you're done with the feet, move onto the back of the legs. Give each leg a couple of long, relaxing strokes to begin with, all the way from the calf to the upper thigh.









Apply light pressure with both hands, smoothly stretching the skin. This technique is known as effleurage, and is a good way to ease into the massage.Then, cover the leg you're not currently working on with a towel and focus on massaging the calf of one leg. Use a kneading technique (like kneading bread) to work the calf muscle.
Move up towards the thigh and repeat the kneading technique here. Then press the heel of your hand into the skin and very slowly move it along the thigh. You should always move in the direction of the heart.
Cover the leg you just finished working on with a towel (to keep in heat) and repeat the massage on the other leg.

, Use the effleurage technique described above to perform long, soft strokes, going from the top of the glutes to the base of the neck.









Place the palm of each hand on either side of the spine and work your way up, keeping your hands parallel to one another. When you reach the top of the back, fan your hands outwards across the shoulders, as if outlining the top of a heart.
Return to the lower back and use a kneading motion to work the large muscles on either side of the spine. These areas tend to build up a lot of tension, so make sure to spend some time here.
Next, use a ""press and release"" technique to work your way up the back. This involves pressing your fingertips firmly into the flesh of the back before quickly releasing. When the pressure is released, your partner/client's brain will release a rush of pleasurable chemicals.
When you get to the upper back, have your partner/client bend their elbows so their shoulder blades stick out. This will give you better access to the muscle around the edge of the shoulder blades, which tends to harbor a lot of tension and knots.To work on the knots, use a thumb or single finger to press and release repeatedly around the problem area.

, When you've finished with the shoulders, use the press and release technique to massage along the neck, all the way to the hairline. Remember to keep your hands on either side of the spine.









Place a hand on either shoulder in the classic massage position and knead the thumbs deep into the muscles of the shoulders. Use your fingers for grip, but don't press them into the collarbone, as this can be painful.
Now move around to stand in front of your client/partner's head, so their shoulders are facing you. Make a fist with each hand, then rub the knuckles gently but firmly across the tops of the shoulders, to release any tension,
Next use your thumbs to press and release along the tops of the shoulders and up the back of the neck.

, When you're done with the neck and shoulders, move onto the arms, working on one at a time.









Hold your partner/client's wrist in your left hand, so their entire arm is lifted from the bed. Then use your right hand to sweep along the back of the forearm, along the tricep and over the shoulder, coming back on the opposite side.
Now, switch to holding their wrist in your right hand, then sweep your left hand along their forearm and bicep, then over the shoulder and down the opposite side.
Place your partner/client's arm back on the bed, the use your fingers and thumbs to gently knead the forearms and upper arms.
To massage the hands, take their hand in yours and massage the palm with your thumbs, using small circular motions. Then, take each finger in turn and slowly slide from the knuckles to the nail. Pull each finger firmly, but not so hard that you cause it to crack!

, Ask your client/partner to flip over so you can work on the head and face. Give them a moment if they need to rearrange their towel.









Use your thumbs to gently massage the top of the scalp. For added pleasure, use your nails to scratch slightly.
Next, massage the folds and lobe of each ear between your thumb and forefinger. Then use your fingertips to gently swipe along the contours of the cheekbones and not.
Put your hands beneath your partner/client's head and lift it slightly from the bed. Use your fingers to find the small hollows when the neck meets the base of the skull. Apply firm pressure with your fingertips, then release. Repeat several times.
Put your hands underneath the jaw and pull the head gently upwards, to stretch the neck muscles. Now, gently press the center of the forehead (between the eyebrows) with your fingertips and release. Repeat for 30 seconds.
Next use your fingertips to gently massage the temples, moving in slow circular motions. The temples are an important acupressure point, so this helps to relieve tension., Never try to rush through the massage - it should be a luxurious, relaxing experience for your partner/client.









Dedicate time to each individual body part, giving it your full care and attention, and keep your strokes long, smooth and slow.

, Your hands should be in contact with your client/partner's skin for the full duration of the massage - this keeps the momentum flowing and never breaks the atmosphere of relaxation.









Even if you have to grab a towel, a drink of water or more massage oil during the massage, try to keep one hand on the skin at all times.

, Communication is key throughout a massage. What feels good to you mightn't feel good to the other person, so it's important to ask them how they're feeling and to really take on board their responses.









Ask them how the pressure feels, where they would like you to work on and what they enjoy the most. However, try to speak in a low, soothing voice to maintain the calm atmosphere., If the person you're working on has a lot of knots in their back, it's a good idea to work on them to try to release them.









However, make sure to ask your partner or client first, as some people find this too painful and would rather not ruin their relaxing massage.
The knots may feel like large, circular areas of tightness, or tiny bumps which almost feel like peas beneath the skin. Try to get directly on top of the knot, otherwise it can slip out from beneath your fingers.
Apply increasing pressure to the knot, then rotate your thumb or finger to try to undo it. You may need to rotate in opposite directions in order to work it out fully.Try not to get too involved in any deep tissue work though - this is best left to qualified massage therapists. Stick to what feels good for you partner/client.

, Never apply pressure to the spine or any other bones. This will feel unpleasant and uncomfortable for your partner/client and has the potential to cause more harm than good.









Besides, it is the muscles you really need to work on, as this is where the most tension collects. Stick to the muscles and you can't go wrong!

A full bladder will press against the uterus, making it relax and bleed more extensively. Emptying your bladder will also make it easier to concentrate on the massage., Choose a comfortable spot to lie down for your massage (e.g. your bed or a yoga mat). If possible, choose a quiet room with very few distractions. Lie completely flat on your back., Hold your hand flat and use the entire length of it to press downwards on your abdomen, starting just below your navel. As you press down, rub your hand in a gentle, circular motion. Brace yourself for cramping or extra bleeding, which is likely to occur during the first few moments of the massage.If pain relievers have been approved by your physician, take ibuprofen before massaging your uterus to reduce the pain from cramping.

, Uterine massage helps the uterus return to its pre-pregnancy size, and helps to slow and stop post-natal bleeding. Continue daily uterine massages for a few weeks until the bleeding subsides. You may experience vaginal bleeding for anywhere from 2 to 6 weeks after child birth.Ideally, your uterus should feel firm, almost like a grapefruit. If your uterus feels soft and baggy, it is more likely to bleed heavily and requires further massage., To ensure that you perform post-natal uterine massage properly, ask your obstetrician, nurse, or mid-wife to demonstrate it prior to attempting it yourself. If you are concerned that the massage is not working, or that something may be wrong, contact your physician immediately. Signs of a problem could include:Severe abdominal pain
Pain when urinating
Dizziness or fainting
Vaginal bleeding that gets heavier over time (instead of getting progressively lighter)

Be very careful about rubbing salt into your tattoo.,

Know that procedures that use salt as an abrasive do exist.,
Try laser tattoo removal.,
Talk to an aesthetician about dermabrasion.,
Consider cryosurgery and chemical peels.,
Talk with your doctor or aesthetician about surgery.",How to Remove a Tattoo at Home With Salt," Whether you've just gotten your tattoo or have had it for longer than you'd like, using salt to remove a tattoo is a dangerous proposition. Here's why:


Your skin has effectively two layers — the dermis, or inner part of the skin, and the epidermis, or outer layer of your skin. When you get a tattoo, the ink travels past the epidermis, or superficial layer of skin, and into the dermis. Rubbing salt onto the epidermis is easy but useless. You need to get the salt into the dermis; even if you did manage to rub away the top layer of your skin to get at the ink, it's probably not going to end well.Rubbing your tattoo with salt will give you a pretty nasty road rash. It may also cause pigmentation of the skin, wrinkling, and possibly scarring. Know that doing this procedure at home can have significant adverse consequences, and may make your tattoo look even worse.;
, Although there is a dermatological procedure that uses salt as a slight abrasive, there is probably one glaring reason why salt is thought to be a good tattoo eraser. When you get a tattoo, you're told not to submerge your tattoo in water, especially in salt water. If you're not supposed to soak your tattoo in salt water if you want to keep it, maybe you could soak your tattoo in salt water if you didn't? That's the reasoning at least.


Soaking your tattoo in salt water, in fact, will only cause the ink to disperse, run, or possibly fade. It won't cause your tattoo to magically vanish. It's likely your tattoo will look worse after you soak it in salt water if your tattoo is newly inked. If you've had your tattoo for several weeks or longer, it's likely that submerging your tattoo in salt water will have no effect.

, Trying DIY salt abrasion, also called salabrasion, is probably not the best idea. As mentioned earlier, you're likely to hurt yourself and do more harm than good. But there are professional procedures out there that use salabrasion, and some of them can be promising.


According to a German study in the National Institute of Health database, salabrasion had ""perfectly acceptable to good results"" in tattoo removal.In this study, wrinkling did occur, but not scar formation.
In one salabrasion procedure, a topical anesthetic is applied to the top of the tattoo. An ink gun-like device used a saline solution to effectively puncture the dermis and draw ink up instead of deposit ink in the skin. Effectively this is like getting a tattoo in reverse. The procedure heals in 6 to 8 weeks. Ask to see testimonials before agreeing to the procedure.

, Laser tattoo removal is the safest and most effective means of eliminating an unwanted tattoo. Doctors or aestheticians shoot highly-concentrated pulses of light at the ink, which can help shatter the ink and lead to a remarkable reduction in visible ink.


Depending on the size of the tattoo, laser surgery will set you back anywhere from $100 to $1,000, making it one of the most cost-effective removal procedures on the market.

, This procedure is very similar to salabrasion in that it's administered under the supervision of trained professionals and sands down layers of skin to get at ink.


This method is a bit less pricey that laser treatment, costing about $1,000 to $2,000.This procedure tends to hurt as much as getting a tattoo, and the ink generally is more visible after a dermabrasion than it is after laser removal.

, With cryosurgery, the skin is frozen and the ink burned off with liquid nitrogen. Chemical peels cause the skin to blister and slough off, removing some of the tattoo ink. Neither is a horribly popular option, as they are both expensive and painful. If you are desperate however, they may be worth considering.

, Surgery is the final option. With a scalpel, a doctor will remove the skin of the tattoo and cinch old skin around it.A new scar will form, and it may be painful, even if you are given a topical anesthetic.

Time your fertility self-massage.,
Gently massage your lower abdomen.,
Make the experience relaxing.,
Do self uterine massage for 1-3 months.,
Get a Mayan massage.,
Consult a physician or fertility specialist.",How to Do Uterine Massage2," Uterine massage should be conducted at certain points of your menstrual cycle and avoided at others. For instance, uterine massage should be avoided during menstruation as it may increase your blood flow, and cause discomfort or pain. Aim for the period of pre-ovulation and ovulation, when conditions are ideal for insemination.Avoid uterine massage if you are pregnant, or suspect that you might be, particularly during the first trimester.

, Uterine massage for fertility should be conducted in largely the same way as post-natal uterus massage, if not slightly more intense due to the lack of pain and sensitivity. Use the flat of your hand and fingers to gently press and rub your abdomen in circular motions.Press gently on your abdomen, just above the pubic bone, and push upwards, gently but firmly, as if you move the uterus upwards. Repeat this motion 15 times.The massage should last approximately 5 minutes., To enhance your uterine massage, play tranquil music and use a calming scented oil (e.g. lavender) when massaging your abdomen. Stress can contribute to fertility problems and adversely affect your health, so any relaxation is beneficial in helping you conceive. Group your regular uterine massage together with other calming activities like yoga, light exercise, or journal-writing for additional benefits., For best results, give yourself regular uterine massages for a period of one to three months. Conducting the massage daily (excluding menstruation days) should re-position the uterus and clear any blockages preventing conception within this time frame. Regular massaging will also improve circulation, which will have benefits for your fertility and overall health., Mayan massage has been used to increase fertility, improve digestion, ease menstrual cramps, and improve symptoms of menopause. Look online for massage therapists near you practicing Mayan massage, which is gaining popularity. Schedule an appointment to fall between the end of your period and ovulation, as many practitioners of Mayan massage will decline to conduct the massage when you are menstruating or may be pregnant., Before embarking on any fertility boosting measures, consult your doctor to ensure their safety. Your physician may give you a referral to a fertility specialist who can offer more comprehensive help in your attempts to conceive. You can also contact an organization like the American Society for Reproductive Medicine for more information about reputable fertility specialists in your area.To search for fertility specialists near you, visit the ASRM's website at https://store.asrm.org/Default.aspx?TabID=1527.

Research your dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon.",How to Remove a Tattoo1," Laser tattoo removal is one of the few methods of tattoo removal that does not involve cutting into the skin and instead uses pulses of light at a very high concentration to remove the tattoo.Your dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon will have an initial consultation with you to discuss your treatment options, including how many laser session will be required to remove your tattoo.Thought considered one of the most effective and safest ways to remove a tattoo, laser tattoo removal can cause scarring, blisters or scabbing, as well as pain in the lasered area.Patients are normally given a local anesthetic gel prior to undergoing the laser treatment.
Keep in mind professional tattoo removal is considered a cosmetic procedure and will likely not be covered by medical insurance.;
, In this procedure, your skin will be sprayed with a numbing solution and then sanded down to reveal the unblemished layers of skin underneath the tattoo.This will also allow the tattoo ink to leach out of your skin.You will be given a local anesthetic for this procedure. Bleeding usually occurs and the process can be painful.
This method will also set you back upwards of $1000, depending on the size of your tattoo.You'll be sore for a little over a week (or 10 days) after the procedure and will likely be given an ointment to treat the affected area. Keep in mind that like laser removal, dermabrasion may not completely remove the tattoo.This procedure is not recommended if you are prone to scarring or hypo-pigmentation., If your tattoo is small, you may be able to actually remove it (and the skin) entirely.During this procedure, your doctor will take a scalpel and remove it, cinching the edges of the skin together, forming a small scar.
If your tattoo is large, this is still an option, but it will take several treatments and possibly a skin graft to remove it., In cryosurgery, the tattoo is frozen and burned off with liquid nitrogen. Chemical peels are similar in that they are applied to the skin, causing it to blister, and subsequently peel off.Be aware that cryosurgery and chemical peels may not remove the tattoo completely, and can be very painful procedures. As well, they are not as effective as laser treatment., The effectiveness of any professional method is dependent on the abilities of the professional, your skin type and color, your tattoo, and your tattoo artist. Before you go into any procedure, it's important to collect as much information as possible about the best removal option for your specific tattoo.


All of these methods will most like result in a scar. But, a scar may be preferable to the tattoo.
It may be worth saving your money and investing in professional tattoo removal to ensure you get the best removal results and lessen the risk of scarring or damage to your skin.

Try using salt, or salabrasion.,
Research removal creams.,
Be aware of the dangers of using an at-home TCA system to remove the tattoo.",How to Remove a Tattoo2," Salabrasion is the term for rubbing a salt solution onto your skin, thereby heating it, and scraping the top layers of skin away, as well as the unwanted tattoo.Salabrasion is an ancient method for removing tattoos, first developed in the Middle East, but modern methods like selective laser removal and dermabrasion are much more effective at removing the tattoo and will prevent excessive scarring of the affected area.The rubbing of your skin with salt will lead to damage to the top layers of your skin or epidermis, as well as very visible scarring. This method can be detrimental to sensitive skin and is not a verified remedy for removing a tattoo successfully., Removal creams are the cheapest and least painful method of tattoo removal: however, their effectiveness depends on regular, diligent use. The Tattoo Removal Institute recommends a couple different creams that may be effective, including TatBGone and Tattoo-OFF.These creams can be expensive and will require 3 to 9 months to fade the tattoo.Keep in mind creams are not as effective as professional removal methods and should be used with caution.

, TCA or trichloroacetic acid can be used as a chemical skin-peeling agent in at-home removal kits, and could lighten the appearance of the tattoo. However, TCA can lead to health risks like serious burns and injuries due to the application of acid on your skin.While at-home removal kits containing TCA and other skin bleaching agents like hydroquinone or alpha arbutin are a cheaper alternative to professional tattoo removal, their effects will be minimal at best and could cause other serious medical issues."

Draw constantly.As a professional tattoo artist, you'll be expected to sketch out, sometimes start to finish, the designs your clients want.This will require you to be skillful at reproducing many different kinds of styles, which can only really be mastered through experience and repetition.,
Draw on contoured objects.,
Test your tattooist skills with a non-toxic marker and a friend.,
Use henna to learn how to apply designs to the contours of the body.,
Train yourself in inking lines and tracing.",How to Practice Tattooing1,";
, Apples, oranges, and other contoured items, like rocks, can simulate some of the difficulties you'll have tattooing various parts of the body. Seek out items that somewhat resemble body parts commonly tattooed, so that you're well prepared when someone requests a tattoo on a more curvaceous part of the body.

, Though the experience of drawing on a person's body is markedly different from operating a tattoo machine and depositing ink into the skin, this practice will get you accustomed to drawing on a living canvas. You might even seek out your more ticklish friends so that you have experience with a squirming client.

, Henna is a kind of traditional dye that has been used since ancient times.It is relatively inexpensive, can be bought online or at many general retailers, like Target or Walgreens. Due to the fact that henna remains on the skin for several days, you might want to hold off trying this until you're somewhat practiced on inanimate objects. Then, following the directions on the package:


Mix your henna dye and collect the applicator for your henna.
Apply it to the skin of your practice subject in the design desired.
Note any improvements that could be made and ask for feedback.

, Many professional tattooists first began learning the art by tracing sample tattoos and simplifying designs to be more translatable to the skin.This skill can be imitated and studied academically by enrolling in a class in Inking, which is the practice of outlining and interpreting an original pencil drawing."

Hydrate yourself.,
Avoid thinning your blood.,
Wear comfortable clothes.,
Eat before your appointment.,
Prepare your skin.",How to Prepare for a Tattoo1," Before you go to get tattooed, make sure that you are well hydrated. Drink lots of water for the 24 hours before your tattoo and avoid dehydrating yourself.How much water you need to drink to be well hydrated will depend on your specific body.While some experts recommend eight glasses a day, your body may need more than that amount.Well hydrated skin will be in better condition for getting tattooed. This means that the surface of the skin will take the ink easier, making tattoo application easier than it would be on dehydrated skin.;
, In order to limit your bleeding, you should avoid products that thin your blood for 24 hours before getting a tattoo. This means that you should avoid alcohol before getting a tattoo.Also, avoid taking aspirin for the 24 hours before a tattoo. Aspirin is a blood thinner, so being on aspirin will make your tattoo bleed more.

, Depending on the size of the tattoo, you may be at the tattoo shop for several hours. You might as well be in a comfortable outfit while you are dealing with the discomfort of the tattoo process.In addition, comfortable, loose clothing may be required in order for your tattoo artist to access the area where you are getting tattooed. If you are getting a tattoo in an area of your body that is usually covered up by clothing, make sure that you wear something to your appointment that will give the tattoo artist easy access to the area.
For example, if you are getting a tattoo on your leg, consider wearing shorts or a skirt, so that the tattooist can easily get to the area. Similarly, if you are getting a tattoo on your upper arm, wear a sleeveless shirt.

, It is important that you have enough food before your appointment so that you don't get light headed while getting a tattoo. The pain of a tattoo is bad enough, you don't want to add to it with lightheadedness or passing out into the mix.Having low blood sugar can increase the physical reaction to a tattoo, making you more likely to pass out from the pain.
Eating a solid meal before your appointment will give you the energy and stamina to withstand the pain of getting a tattoo. While it does not matter what you eat exactly, as long as it will give the the sustenance you need to get through the appointment, eating a meal high in protein instead of sugar will sustain you longer.If you are having an extremely long tattoo appointment, bring a quick snack, like a granola bar, with you. Your tattooist will be happy to take a quick break so that you can stay nourished.

, You do not need to do a lot to your skin before a tattoo. Just moisturize with your normal moisturizer for a week beforehand if you have dry skin to make sure that it is in good shape. Also, avoid getting a sunburn on the area you are getting tattooed.This means wearing sunscreen whenever you leave the house.


While the area you are getting tattooed will need to be shaved, most tattoo artists do not want you to do it ahead of time. Instead, they will do it right before the tattoo to assure that any irritation does not interfere with the tattoo process.

Purchase a cheap tattoo machine for practice.This will provide you with a way to become comfortable with the machine.,
Learn the different kinds of tattoo machines.,
Learn to compensate for the vibration of your tattoo machine.",How to Practice Tattooing2," Some tattooists recommend building hand strength by simulating the weight of the tattoo machine applicator. This machine uses an applicator heavier than a pen or pencil to drive ink into the sub-layers of the skin, leaving behind permanent skin art.


You may want to start your weighted practice by attaching about 80 grams (3 ounces) to a drawing utensil.

, Beyond understanding how its working parts operate, how to replace failed parts, and how to assess the working condition of a tattoo machine, you'll also have to become comfortable with holding the applicator for long periods of time.


You might also rig a pencil to your tattoo machine and practice drawing. This way you'll develop comfort and familiarity with machine and clip cord.
While a cheap machine is great for personal practice, you may not want to use your practice machine on clients.

, There are many different tattoo machines on the market, though coil tattoo machines are the most commonly used variety.Certain machines are used to accomplish certain effects, like shading and coloring. Altogether, you should be familiar with:


Coil tattoo machines
Rotary tattoo machines
Pneumatic tattoo machines
Shader tattoo machines
Liner tattoo machines, The force of your machine operating will cause an intense vibration that you may feel through your entire arm. Be prepared for this when you turn on your machine, dip your nip in ink, and train your hand to be steady.

Purchase pig skin for a realistic practice experience.,
Tattoo to the correct depth.",How to Practice Tattooing3," Some fruits that you should consider for tattooing practice:


Bananas
Melons
Grapefruits

, Synthetic skin is a relatively new comer to the tattooing scene. Practice skin is relatively easy to order from online sources, but many tattooists criticize this false skin as too far from the real thing. Synthetic skin can:


Be useful for starting out and getting a feel for your tattoo machine.
Provide you with practice for building your hand strength.

, Pig skin is a close approximate of human skin, and can give you a more realistic trial run than you would experience with fruit or synthetic skin. Pig skin is also the traditional practice medium used by tattoo apprentices, and due to its similarity to human skin, will train you to have better control with the depth of your needle.


Pig skin can be bought expressly for the purposes of tattooing online, but as many butchers end up throwing it out, you might find a cheaper more plentiful alternative at your local butcher.

, Human skin is comprised of three layers, with some of these layers have sub-layers. The top layer of your skin, the epidermis, is made up of a total of five layers which grow outward, which means ink deposited in the epidermis will eventually fade. Your target depth when tattooing should be the middle layer, the dermis, which is between one and two millimeters beneath the skin.Going to deep into the skin with your tattoo machine can lead to unnecessary pain for your client, and a possible risk of infection."

Think about a design.,
Consult with a tattoo artist.,
Think about placement.,
Consider the pain.,
Prepare for aftercare.",How to Prepare for a Tattoo2," A tattoo design reflects a part of you and this part of you will be presented to the world every day. With this in mind, let your imagination go wild and think of a design that will be unique and will express to the world what you want it to. For example, this design could incorporate a symbol that has a special meaning to you, an animal that you have always loved, or it could use colors that signal an important period in your life.


Have a design in mind before you make an appointment with a tattoo artist.When thinking about a design, you should also consider its size. For your first tattoo, you may want to get a small tattoo. This will allow you to understand the pain, and how you react to it over time, without the commitment of several hours in the tattoo chair.Think of a design that you will be happy with in the future. While you can have a tattoo removed, it is a very, very painful process that can be expensive and time consuming.Because of this, just think of them as permanent from the start and get a tattoo that you will be happy with in the future.
You can either have your exact design planned out or you could rely on your tattoo artist to create a custom design for you. This is up to you.

, With your design in mind, find a tattoo artist that you want to work with. You can find one via word of mouth, for instance if your friend worked with a tattoo artist that they loved, or you can look online for tattoo artists in your area. Once you identify a tattoo artist, look at online reviews and look at their tattoo portfolio, either online or in their shop. If you like their style and their reputation, and you think that their style will translate well to your design idea, then book a consultation.Most artists will draw out your tattoo design for you so that you can approve it at the beginning of your actual tattoo appointment. If there is anything about the design that you don't like, feel free to discuss it with the tattoo artist, to that they can make it exactly like you want it to be.
Some tattoo artists are highly sought after and are not available for consultations in a timely manner. Instead, you will need to book an appointment with them months in advance. However, if you like a tattoo artist's work well enough, the high quality work may be worth the wait.

, While you can put a tattoo anywhere on the skin, there are some places that are more painful than others. For your first tattoo, consider getting it placed in a location that has more flesh and is not tender. This means an area that is not right on bone and that is not sensitive.


For example, a tattoo on your foot may be more painful than a tattoo on your calf because a foot tattoo will be hitting bone more directly.
Locations that are especially tender include the foot, the inside of the arms and thighs, and the ribs. In general, avoid areas where the bones are close to the skin and areas that get little exposure to the sun. Areas that are not exposed to the sun regularly tend to be more tender, and thus a tattoo placed there will hurt more., It is best to understand what the pain should be like before you begin. This will help you to mentally prepare for the experience. Many people describe the pain as fingernails scratching on sunburned skin. The pain is mostly dull but can become acute when the needle hits a nerve, hits an area close to bone, or goes over the same area repeatedly.


There are some topical anesthetics that some tattoo artists will apply to the skin to dull the pain if the pain is too great for you. However, the anesthetic can cause the color in the tattoo to be more dull and it can cause your tattoo to take more time to heal. Ask your tattoo artist about this but be aware that not all tattoo artists will be willing to use an anesthetic at all.

, Plan to stay out of the water and keep your tattoo out of the sun for several weeks after it is applied. This means that you should plan when to get the tattoo so that you do not have to rearrange your schedule to accommodate the tattoo's healing. For example, if you have a vacation coming up that will include a lot of swimming, you may not want to get a tattoo right before it.Your tattoo artist will give you additional aftercare instructions. These may include when to remove any bandages, when to clean it, what to clean it with, and what to look for to make sure healing it progressing correctly. If you have any additional questions, feel free to as your tattoo artist while you still at the shop or call the shop if you have questions later.

Wash your hands.,
Sterilize the captive ring and your tools.,
Clean the pierced area with warm water and soap.,
Identify your type of captive ring.",How to Put on a Captive Ring1," Depending on the location of your piercing, you will need to wait at least three months before changing your ring or hardware. This allows the skin to heal and will make it possible for you to insert a new ring without tearing. If you choose to change your ring earlier or would just like some extra help, which is quite common, go visit your piercer.Many people go ahead and schedule with their piercer for the first change and then do subsequent changes themselves.;
, Don a pair of cleaning gloves and get a fresh rag or paper towels. Apply a surface disinfectant to the workspace and wipe thoroughly. A disinfectant will kill any fungi or bacteria that could infect your piercing. After the space is clean, make sure that you only place disinfected items on it from here on out.You can also opt for a disinfectant wipe.
It is best if your workspace is a flat, hard table with plenty of space for your tools.

, Remove your workspace cleaning gloves and wash your hands thoroughly under warm water. Make sure that you cover all surfaces of your hands. It should take you between 40-60 seconds to complete a solid washing. You could also apply an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if you prefer.Feel free to wash your hands as many times as you want during this process. If you do it properly, it will only lessen the possibility of infection.
You could also wear a pair of latex or medical-grade gloves. However, if they don’t fit you correctly, they may make it more difficult to handle your ring.

, If your captive ring is in a sterilized bag, then you can simply remove it and place it on your table (perhaps on a paper towel, too). If your captive ring is not sterile, then you will want to wash it with warm soap and water. Or, place it into an ultrasonic cleaner. The same goes for any tools that you’ll need to use, such as a pair of jewelry pliers.Check to make sure that the sterile package is not broken or torn in any way. If it is, make sure to fully inspect and clean the ring.

, Do not scrub and gently dry the area with a paper towel when you are finished. Then, go ahead and remove the ring or other jewelry that you are wearing. If the ring feels stuck, apply a small dot of liquid soap to the piercing area, as it will help it to slide out.If you experience any pain or irritation when trying to remove your jewelry, stop and contact your piercer for help., When you get your piercing, talk with your technician about what size of ring you will need. If you go with a heavier ring, then you will likely need to use pliers for insertions and removals. You can also opt for a traditional ring with a dimpled ball or a snap-fit style ring with springs that will require pliers to handle."

Pick up the jewelry with both hands.,
Pull the ring apart slowly.,
Twist the ring.,
Slide the ring into the piercing.,
Twist the ring closed.,
Snap the ball into place.",How to Put on a Captive Ring2," Take a moment to steady your hands. Reach down and grab the ring with the index finger and thumb of one hand. Use the index finger and thumb of your other hand to grab the bead. If you have difficulty manipulating the ring with your hands in this position, try placing both hands on the ring itself, positioning your fingers on the opposite sides of the bead or ball., Holding both pieces of the ring, twist slightly and apply measured force until the ball comes free. Make sure that you have your fingers on the ball as it comes free, or you might drop it on the ground or on the table. Once the ring and ball are separate, set the ball on the table.With traditional captive rings, tension is the reason that the ball stays in place in the ring. By twisting the ring, you loosen this tension just enough so that the ball can move or drop out.
If you accidently drop the ball or ring, make sure to sterilize the jewelry again before continuing.

, With both hands on opposite sides of the opening in the ring, carefully twist the two ends in opposite directions. Turn your right hand clockwise and your left hand counterclockwise. The ring should look like a slight spiral. When twisted into this shape, it should be easier to slide into your piercing., Insert one open end into your piercing. Glide the wire of the ring into the piercing until the center of your ring rests inside. The opening of the ring should lie directly across from the piercing itself. You may need to use your fingers to support the skin around the piercing as you slide the jewelry in place., Grab one side of the ring with the index finger and thumb of your right hand. Grab the other side of the ring with the index finger and thumb of your left hand. Apply pressure with both hands to twist the two ends back into place. Your right hand should move counterclockwise and your left hand should move clockwise.


When done, the ring should no longer look like a spiral. There will still be a slight gap in the center, but otherwise, it should be back in the shape of a solid ring.
If you have excess soap in the piercing area, now is a good time to gently wipe it off with a damp paper towel.

, Position the bead so that the dimples on the other side line up with the open ends of the ring. Use your hands to push the bead back into the ring, stopping once it clicks into place. You'll need to steady the ring by holding one side of it with the index finger and thumb of one hand. Use the other hand to push the ball back into place.


If properly inserted, the ball should spin with a little resistance. If it spins freely, the ring is too loose. Remove the ball, squeeze the opening in tighter, and re-insert the ball.

Grab the ball.,
Insert the ring into the piercing.,
Place the ball in position.,
Close the ring using pliers.",How to Put on a Captive Ring3," Slide the nose of the ring-opening jewelry pliers into the closed ring. Position the tool so that its opening lines up with the bead or ball of the captive ring. Apply a slight amount of pressure until the captive ring is no longer moveable.Specialty pliers labeled for use with captive rings are your best option, followed by generic ring expanding pliers. If you have no other option, needle nose pliers will also work well enough.
Consider covering the pliers with cloth medical tape before using them with your captive ring. Doing so can prevent the tool from scratching jewelry. The tape also adds traction, making it easier to hold the pieces in place.

, Use the index finger and thumb of your free hand to grab the captive ring bead. Or, you can use a ball grabber tool to reach out to the captive bead. Placing a slight amount of pressure on the ring pliers will cause the ball to become loose. Make sure to grab it with your free hand before it falls.Be very careful with the amount of pressure that you apply with the pliers or you will risk altering the shape of your ring.

, Continuing to use your pliers, or switching to your hands if you prefer, slide one open end of the ring into the piercing. Continue gliding the ring through the piercing until the center of the ring rests inside.


If the gap is not wide enough for you to maneuver the ring into the piercing, you should use your pliers to expand the opening further. Expand the ring only as much as absolutely needed to avoid warping the shape. For heavier gauges, you should only expand the opening instead of twisting it.
The opening of the ring should be positioned directly across from the piercing. If you feel friction or discomfort when you insert the ring, support the skin around the piercing using your fingers.

, Using your hands or a ball grabber tool, line the bead up so that the dimples on either side are aligned with the open ends of the ring. Rest one side of the ring in one of these dimples. With heavier gauges, it is very difficult to snap the bead in place when the ring is nearly closed. As a result, you will need to hold the bead in place as you close the ring instead of waiting until the ring is closed before placing the bead inside.Depending on how much you expanded the opening, you may need to close it slightly with your pliers before setting the ball inside.

, Place your open pliers around the outside of the open ring. Squeeze the nose of the pliers closed, closing the ring around the bead in the process. Continue closing the ring until both open ends snap into the dimples of the bead or ball.


When the captive ring is properly put together, you should be able to spin the ball with a little resistance. If the ball spins too freely, you should close the ring a little further.

Make sure that you have all of the supplies that you will need.,
Wash your hands thoroughly with handwash to ensure that your hands are germ free.,
Clean the area you are going to pierce.,
Decide the positioning of your piercings.,
Unwrap your piercing needle which should have come in a sterile packaging.,
Once you have pierced the lip, unscrew the ball from your sterilised lip bar and place the bar inside the hollow hole at the end of the needle, then remove the needle from the lip which will then pull the lip bar into place.,
Care for your piercings.",How to Pierce Snakebites,";
, This helps prevent infection while carrying out the piercing of your snakebites. You do not have to use gloves if your hands are clean, however if you are performing this piercing on someone else it is highly recommended you use latex gloves to prevent infection.

, You can do this by mouth washing for 60 seconds and also clean the outside of your lower lip with one of the suggested solutions and a cotton ball or bud. Once you have cleaned the area below discard of the cotton ball or bud you have just used to clean the area.

, This is easily done by lining a ballpoint pen vertical against the left and right side of your nose. Firstly, line a ballpoint pen vertical against the right side of your nose, this will help you to determine where on your lip the piercing should line, mark this point just below your lip. Do the same with the left side of your nose but also make the mark so that it is also at the same level below your lip as the other marking.

, Discard of the packaging once unwrapped. Next, line the piercing needle with your marking and pierce the skin at a direct horizontal angle piercing from the outside of the lip, inwards. It is usually best if you hold the lip either side of the marking in order to create a penetrable surface.

, Screw on the ball and repeat with the other side after sterilizing the needle with a cotton ball and cleaning solution.

, Once you have pierced your lip, clean the piercing 2-3 times everyday by mouth washing and using cleaning solution. Your piercing should take up to 6 weeks to heal, however in most cases the healing process usually takes longer. If you find that infection occurs you should remove the piercing immediately.

Sterilize your equipment.,
Locate where you want your eyebrow piercing.,
If you have a low tolerance for pain, you might want to numb the area with the aid of an ice cube or numbing gel.,
Pinch the skin between the two points that you marked, using a clamp, or your other hand.,
Poke the needle through from one point to the other.,
Gently remove the needle from your eyebrow and then insert and fasten your chosen jewelry.

,
Do not remove your jewelry for a minimum of two months.",How to Pierce Your Eyebrow," First, boil your needle for five to ten minutes on a stove. Keep your needle and your jewelry in rubbing alcohol. If you have newly bought them, this might not be necessary, as they would already be sterile, but it is highly recommended that you sterilize them too, just to be on the safe side.;
, Evenly mark two points using a pen or a marker, wherever you want your piercing to be.

, The numbing gel is a better option, as ice only numbs the first layer of skin, and in addition to that, it tightens the pores of the skin, making it harder for the hollow needle to go through.

, Pull the skin out, away from the eye.

, Push the needle out from the other point.

,, Clean it daily with rubbing alcohol or a saline solution.

Clean and disinfect the bottle you are going to use.,
After your bottle has been rinsed and dried, pour a large amount of pure sea salt into the bottle.,
Next, pour the hydrogen peroxide into the bottle with the salt.,
Now, pour water into the bottle, filling it up halfway.

,
Put the lid on your bottle, and shake it gently, paying special attention to the bottom.,
Now, open your bottle, and pour a small amount (about 2 cupfuls) of Isopropyl Alcohol into the bottle.,
Do any (or as many) of the optional additions that you see listed below.

,
After all the ingredients have been mixed together in your bottle, add water until it is completely full.

,
Replace lid firmly, shake vigorously, and enjoy your free piercing cleanser!

,
Add two small drops of Tea Tree Oil to the mixture, using a small dropper.,
Add a small amount of Vegetable Glycerin to the bottle.,
The last optional step is to add a few drops of Jojoba Oil to your cleanser.",How to Make Piercing Cleanser," Bleach is one way to disinfect it.

, You should use enough so it covers the entire bottom of the container. Salt dries out the skin and helps heal any 'open wounds', almost like scabbing over. You want this inside your piercing.

, Don't use too much, the purpose of this is to get into the piercing and foam out any infection. Peroxide is also good to use as mouthwash if you have a gum infection.

,, Make sure all the salt is dissolved. It should look cloudy.

, Isopropyl Alcohol kills germs on contact, instantly. It also adds a scent to your mixture.

,,,, The purpose for this is because tea tree oil is a natural anti-septic, and it will further kill any infection/germs/bacteria in the piercing, or on the jewelry and skin itself. Also, it adds moisture to the skin around the site, to avoid peeling and dry, itchy skin. It also adds a nice scent to your cleanser.;
, Add more than a few drops, but not as much as the alcohol. This is a more important step, although not mandatory. I strongly suggest it, because the Isopropyl Alcohol and Sea Salt are both astringents,and will severely dry out your skin in and around the piercing. Vegetable Glycerin is a all natural skin cleanser, and it adds moisture and balance to skin. It also increases skin elasticity, and is very gentle. You can even eat it to loosen your stools!

, I add this to mine because my skin becomes irritated and flaky due to the drying agents of sea salt, peroxide and isopropyl alcohol being continuously exposed to my skin 3+ times every day. Jojoba is a golden oil that is naturally found in a nut. It adds a large amount of oil to skin/hair. It is a skin softener, and if added to your mixture, will guarantee that your skin won't be damaged by the cleanser.

Try to find an alternative.,
Get a clean bowl that is fireproof.

,Get clean white paper (biodegradable is best)

,
Burn the paper in the bowl and collect the ash (make sure there is no wind)


You will have to burn a lot of paper to get enough ink for a simple tattoo.







,
Add water and mix with the ash (this is tricky - you have to use equal parts to make an ink water-like, but still thick enough to stick to your pin).

,
Dip the pin in your ink like a quill, and tattoo.

Find a motor.,
Create the tube.,
Design a brace.,
Make a needle.",How to Make a Tattoo Gun1," You'll need an electric motor or similar type rotary motor that runs on at least 12 volts; 18 volts would be ideal.


The motor will have a small shaft protruding from the center. Take a small four-hole button and attach it to that shaft with superglue. Be careful not to use so much glue that it seeps through the holes of the button and blocks them. They need to be open so that you can attach the needle. Set it aside to dry.






Instead of a button, you can use an eraser. Take the eraser from a mechanical pen and push it firmly onto the small shaft of your motor.


You can remove the motor from a VCR or remote control car, but the power will be considerably less; it's about 3.5 volts.





;
, The ""tube"" will guide the needle. It's easy to make one from a pencil or pen.


Use a mechanical pencil. An inexpensive plastic pencil will work fine, or you can choose one that's metal. Depending on your preference, you can leave the pencil as-is or cut it down to about a 3"" to 4"" length.






Alternately, you can use an everyday stick pen like a Bic and remove the ink cylinder from inside. If you want a shorter tube, cut the pen to about a 3"" or 4"" length. File down the brass tip of the pen to get the ball out and make the hole big enough to allow passage of the needle.







, The brace will support the tube when it's attached to the machine motor for the tattoo gun.


Take a teaspoon and break off the bowl (the part you eat from). Then bend the spoon back to create an ""L""-shape.






A second option would be to cut the bristles off of a toothbrush leaving about 4"" in length. Use a lighter to heat up the plastic toothbrush handle and bend it into an ""L"" shape. Hold the bent handle in place until the plastic cools, and it becomes stiff.







, Cut a metal guitar string an inch or so longer than the length of your tube. It should reach from the center of the motor to the tip of the tube after assembly. Put soap and water into a pot and bring it to a boil. Drop your needle into the pot and boil it for five minutes. Rinse it in clear water and then boil it again in water only.


You can prepare several needles in advance. If you do so, store them in a sterilized jar.

Attach the tube to the brace.,
Attach the motor to the brace.,
Insert your needle.,
Attach the needle to the motor.,
Connect your power source.,
Discard single-use items.",How to Make a Tattoo Gun2," Remove the eraser and any lead from your mechanical pencil. Hold the short end of the spoon (or toothbrush) brace in your hand the way you'd hold a gun and tape the pencil to it. The open ""eraser"" end of the pencil should line up with the bend in the spoon, and the shaft of the pencil should lay on the straight plane of the brace. The point of the pencil will extend off the edge of the brace.


Be sure to tape the pencil to the brace very securely; it should not wobble or wiggle in any way.







, Tape the motor to the short end of your brace. Be sure that it's straight and that the button is centered along the shaft of the brace.

, Place one end of the guitar string through the tip of the pencil and thread it through the tube. When it comes out the other end, pick up your pliers and bend the end of the guitar string into a 90-degree angle. Then bend the tip of the string again to create a second 90-degree angle You're basically creating a hook at the end of your needle. Snip off any extra wire from your hook; it doesn't need to be that long.

, Take the hook you just created and set it into one of the holes in your button. When you spin the button, you should see the needle going in and out of the end of your pencil tube. If necessary, trim down the needle.


If you used an eraser instead of a button, create just one 90-degree angle on the end of your guitar string and firmly press it into the eraser so that it's secure. Please note: it's important that the needle is intentionally off center. Do not line it up exactly in the middle of the eraser.







, Use a plug-in adapter from a CD player, a phone charger or other power source that's made up of two wires. Split the wires apart and attach them to the contacts of the motor.


If you don't want to repeatedly unplug and re-plug your power source when you stop to clean the skin, purchase a small On/Off switch from an electronics store and attach it to your motor connection.







, Once you've finished your tattoo, you must throw away the needle and the tube (mechanical pencil/pen). Do not under any circumstances reuse these items. They can spread diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. Even if you plan to use the materials only on yourself, it's not worth the risk, especially when guitar string and mechanical pencils and pens are so inexpensive.

Get pierced by a pro.,
Leave the post in your piercing.,
Clean the piercing regularly.",How to Heal Piercings1," In the body modification community, it's an accepted fact that there is a right way and a wrong way to get a piercing done. Rather than getting a piercing at a kiosk or chain store in the mall, invest a few extra dollars to have it done right by a professional. Your piercing will come out cleaner and heal up faster. You'll also have access to as much expert advice as you need from the person who did your piercing.


Ask for a hollow needle piercing. The proper way to pierce most parts of the body is by hand with a long, specially designed hollow-point needle. Professional body piercers use these needles because they're hygienic and easy to control, for straight and properly-placed piercings that heal quickly.
Avoid piercing guns. A common tool for piercing ears (and sometimes other parts of the body) is the piercing gun, a mechanical tool that quickly strikes a needle through the skin. Piercing guns often have hygiene problems (since the gun itself isn't always properly disinfected, even if a new needle is used each time), and are notorious for creating angles or off-center piercings. Ask to be pierced by hand instead.;
, Until the piercing has healed, taking the earring post out of the hole will only expose your raw tissue to infection. For ear piercings, the healing process typically takes 6-8 weeks. During that time, you must wear the earring you put into your new piercing at all times or risk a painful infection.


Other parts of the body, such as belly buttons, may take longer to heal. Always ask your piercer about specific healing times before you get pierced.

, Strict adherence to a daily cleaning regimen is essential to avoid infection and allow smooth, even healing. Your piercer will have specific instructions for you, which should always be followed. Generally speaking, these instructions will be similar to the method outlined here:


Purchase supplies. You won't need much; some cotton swabs and mild antibacterial liquid soap (such as Dial) should be enough. You should also have a small cup, warm running water, and sea salt.
Wash and wipe. Start by washing your hands with warm water and your mild soap. Once your hands are clean and dry, moisten a cotton swab (or a cotton ball, if necessary) with water and gently wipe around the piercing to remove any crusted buildup. Throw away the swab afterward.
Clean thoroughly. Get a good amount of your mild soap on a finger or two and gently but thoroughly begin to wash all around your piercing on both sides. Be sure to get underneath the stud (face of the earring) as well. Once you're satisfied that everything is clean, pour a cup of warm water and use it to rinse the soap away.
Soak the piercing in saline solution. Mix a few tablespoons of sea salt into several ounces of warm water and soak your piercing in it for a moment or two. This can help draw infected fluids out of an improperly healing piercing, but it serves another important purpose as well: it soothes soreness and irritation. Use a saline soak every time you clean until your piercing is no longer painful or sore.
Rinse and repeat. Rinse your piercing with cool or warm water again, and pat the area dry. Repeat this regimen twice per day to encourage proper healing.

If your piercing has become infected, you can clean it this way up to four times per day.

Know what to look for.,
Talk to a professional.,
Check for a metal allergy.,
Be gentle.,
Control your activities.",How to Heal Piercings2," Some piercing injuries and ailments are obvious; others might not be to an untrained eye. Some of the most common signs that your piercing has an infection are:


Persistent itchiness and/or redness
Soreness and tenderness
A hot, burning sensation
Seepage of liquid, such as pus or blood, from the hole
Bad odor

, As with any medical problem, the best you can do for your sore, infected, or otherwise unwell piercing is to take the details of your problem to a pro. Dermatologists and general-practice physicians are your best choice; however, if you can't afford to visit a doctor's office or clinic, speaking to the person who did your piercing is your next best choice.

, Sometimes, the problem with a piercing stems from an allergy to the metal of a recently-worn piece of jewelry. If your piercing seems irritated or tender after wearing a new earring, find out what kind of metal it's made of. You might be allergic to it. Switch to a hypoallergenic metal, such as surgical steel or niobium, instead, and see if the problem clears itself up.

, Unless directed otherwise by a medical professional, avoid using cleaning or disinfecting agents on your piercing. These may not reach the source of the infection, and in many cases will cause irritation. Instead, soak the piercing in saline solution several times a day to help gently drain it.


Most piercing infections are minor and should heal up quickly with proper care. If more than a few days pass by without any sign of improvement, see a doctor immediately.

, As you encourage your piercing to heal, take steps to avoid unnecessarily irritating it further. Don't go swimming, don't apply any lotions or creams (unless directed to do so by your dermatologist, of course), and don't dye or chemically treat your hair except to wash it with a gentle shampoo.

Know the limits.,
Be sure the piercing has healed.,
Remove your piercing.,
Clean the hole every day.,
Track your progress.,
Minimize scarring.",How to Heal Piercings3," A piercing heals by building scar tissue around the hole. As such, only very small piercing holes will ever close completely without expensive professional assistance. Even a small earring hole might never completely heal (so that there's no indication it was ever there); larger-gauge holes such as those commonly seen in tongue and belly button piercings will always be visible even if and when they close.


Holes that have been intentionally gauged to a larger size can't be closed without medical procedures involving anesthetic and cutting tools.
Don't check your piercing with an earring to see if it's closed. You might inadvertently reopen it.

, As noted above, never remove the post from a new piercing until the hole has completely healed, typically two months at most. Exposing the tissue to open air before it's healed shut invites infection and can lead to swelling, slower healing times, and even extra scarring in some cases.

, Again, don't do this until the hole has healed. Take out the jewelry from the hole and don't put anything else back into it.

, Use a routine similar to the one you used to help the piercing heal in the first place. Wash it gently with saline solution twice a day. You can also use mild antibacterial soap, but you must be careful not to get it in the piercing. Gently squeeze around the piercing when you've finished, to push water, and other gunk out of the hole. Rinse around the piercing with a clean, damp cloth or cotton swab afterward.

, After several weeks, smaller piercings should begin to close up. You can safely check this by observing whether or not any liquid comes out of the piercing when you squeeze it. Once there's no discharge from the hole, it's probably just about closed.


You should be able to notice results in less than three months, but it can take much longer than that to heal the hole completely. Expect mild redness and a dip where the piercing was for a long while afterward.

, Once the hole seems to have closed completely, it's time to fight the scarring that will happen as the hole knits itself closed again. Ask your dermatologist to recommend an anti-scarring gel or similar product to help reduce scar tissue and make your old piercing less obvious. Apply it according to their directions, or once per day for 4-6 weeks.

, Find a piercer with a good reputation at a reputable tattoo or piercing shop. Read customer reviews online to find out information about the piercer's reputation, and make sure the piercer has completed an apprenticeship with a reputable piercer.

, It is very important for a piercing/tattoo shop to be sterile and clean. If you go to the shop and it does not appear immaculately clean, don't get a piercing there.

, When you get the piercing, make sure that the piercer opens up a package of unused, sterile needles to use for your piercing. This is very important to prevent the spread of infection and disease.

, The piercing itself will hurt minimally. The initial healing and swelling are the worst part.

, For the actual piercing, the piercer will take a clamp and put it on your belly button to hold it in place. This protects you from jerking when the piercing happens.

, There will be more symptoms for the first 3-5 days immediately after getting the piercing.Expect to see swelling, light bleeding, bruising, and tenderness, especially during this initial period.

, Even if you follow these steps and do exactly what the aftercare sheet says, there could still be a whitish goo that come out of piercing hole. This is normal and is not an infection. Just make sure that it is not puss., Always wash your hands with soap before cleaning or touching the piercing or jewelry.Never touch the piercing except during moments of cleaning.

, Wash the piercing with a basic soap with no dyes or extra chemicals (that is not antibacterial soap) once or twice a day. Remove any crust on the piercing with a cotton swab or Q-Tip. Then gently clean the site with the basic soap and water.Avoid tugging on the piercing; this will be painful and slow the healing.

, The easiest, gentlest way to do this is to half-fill a cup with soapy water, gently place it over the piercing, and lightly swish it around. It may hurt a little if the piercing is fairly new, but the pain will wear off in a few days., When the piercing is wet from cleaning, gently turn the jewelry in the piercing hole. This will prevent it from scabbing over and getting too crusty., Dry the piercing after cleaning with a paper towel or napkin instead of a bath towel or a cloth. Towels can contain germs and bacteria, so it is better to use a disposable paper product instead.

, These solutions can slow the healing process and kill new, healthy cells., This will prevent oxygen, which is essential to the healing process, from reaching the piercing., Whether it’s a chlorinated pool, a hot tub with bromine, or a natural river, it’s best to avoid getting anything besides soapy water in your piercing., The only time you should touch your belly button ring is when cleaning it.Always remember to wash your hands beforehand.

, If there is clear or semi-white liquid, it means it's healing. If it's yellow, green, or smelly, it may be infected. In this case, go to a doctor,or visit your piercer and discuss the proper care.

, Occasionally, the balls on naval piercing bars can become unscrewed or loose over time. It is important that you regularly check to make sure they are tight. Use one hand to hold the bottom ball in place and use the other hand to tighten the top ball.Note: To tighten the balls, remember twisting to the right tightens and twisting to the left loosens.

, Don’t remove the jewelry during the healing process. Though many piercings heal within six weeks, others can take months and the piercing can close within minutes if the jewelry is removed too soon.Check with your piercing artist (or read the paperwork you should have gotten with the piercing) for an exact timeline.


If you want a new look, and your piercing does not hurt when you touch it, you may unscrew the balls from the barbel and change them, but leave the barbel in place at all times. Changing it will irritate the piercing and may introduce bacteria to the wound.

, Once the initial healing process is over, you can pick any of the many styles of jewelry for your belly button piercing. Just keep in mind if you have metal allergies or sensitivities to certain materials.

Decide how high the risk of rejection is with your piercing.,
Choose appropriate jewelry.,
Make sure the gauge is large enough.,
Have your piercer double check the placement for proper depth.

,
Take good care of your piercing, clean it daily with soap and water, use sea salt soaks, and never touch it with dirty hands.,
See your piercer if it seems your piercing is rejecting, if there's redness outside the holes, or it looks like the holes are getting larger.

,
If you think your body is rejecting the jewelry, do not remove the jewelry yourself.",How to Keep a Piercing from Rejecting," Check their portfolios for healed piercings in addition to fresh ones. Ask about their experience and qualifications.;
, Eyebrows, navels, lip frenulums, some genital piercings, and surface piercings all have a higher risk of rejection. Piercings through cartilage have a very low risk.

, Piercings that travel through a lot of flesh, like a rook or tragus, should be done with a straight or slightly curved barbell. Surface piercings should be done with surface bars. Navels and eyebrows need curved barbells, or surface bars. Most piercers agree that titanium or glass is less likely to reject than steel, because your body accepts it more easily.

, Most piercers use 14 or 16 gauge as the standard, smaller gauges are more likely to reject. Choose the largest gauge that is suitable. Many piercers believe certain places, like tongues and inner labia, do best with 12g or larger.

,, To make a sea salt soak use non iodized sea salt that can be purchased at any drug or grocery. Use 1/4 - 1/8th teaspoon salt to 8 oz of warm distilled or bottled water. Using more salt can cause irritation to your piercing. Don't bump or hit your piercing, and keep hair products and tight clothing away from it.

,, See a qualified piercer to remove jewelry. Removing jewelry from an infected site can seal the infection inside the skin, causing cyst.

Turn the participant over.,
Put stones on the shoulder blades, the backs of the kneecaps, and between the toes.,
Use the stones to massage rather than your hands.,
Combine the warm stones with other massage techniques.,
Alternate the hot stones with cold marble stones.",How to Do Hot Stone Massage," Stones used in this treatment are typically made of basalt, due to their ability to retain heat. The stones should also be very smooth, so they do not irritate the skin in any way. If you can't find basalt stones, however, smooth river rocks are fine.You can order a hot stone massage kit online from Amazon or eBay, however, if you do not want to buy your stones you can try going to a rock quarry.

You should have anywhere between 20-30 stones, though some professional massages may have upwards of 45-60. There should be at least two large ovals around 8” long to 6” wide, seven stones you can fit in the palm of your hand, and 8 small stones between the size of an egg or a quarter.;
, If you do not have a massage table, a bed or the floor will be fine. Once you've chosen where the massage should take place, you should lay out a clean sheet or a thick towel for the person you are massaging to lay down on. This will not only help them be more comfortable but also help absorb any excess oil from the massage.

To really create a relaxing environment, try lighting some aromatherapy candles. Soothing scents like lavender, lemongrass, eucalyptus, and vanilla will help immerse your participant in the massage experience.You can also try playing some quiet classical music, or rain sounds to add to the mood.

, Ideally, you should prepare your stones 30-60 minutes before you begin your massage. The water should be around 120° as the stones will likely cool down to 100-110° when taken out. Remember to wipe each stone down once you’ve removed it.To heat the stones, use a Crock-Pot that can hold at least 6 quarts of water or a large tabletop skillet that has sides close to 3 inches.
As you want the stones to be around 105° when you place them, try putting a candy thermometer in your crock pot or skillet to monitor the temperature. You should also keep the crockpot setting to warm or low, as you don't want the water to boil.You should also rub some massage oil on each stone before it's used.

, Before you start the massage you should check with the participant to make sure they are comfortable with the heat of the stones. Some people are going to react differently to different temperatures, and you don’t want to burn them. To prevent this, it’s best to place a sheet or towel down and then put the stones on top of that.Keep in mind it can take 3-4 minutes for the heat of the stones to penetrate to the skin.

, Before you start the massage you want to put down either a row of large stones where the participant's spine will be or 2 rows of smaller stones to sit on each side of it. You should then place an additional sheet over these stones. After that, have the participant lay down, face up, on top of them. You do not need to remove them until you turn the participant over., Once the participant has settled, take four of the smaller stones, without oil, and place them on the acupressure areas on their face. There should be one stone on their forehead, one under their lips, and one on each of their cheeks. You should avoid putting oil on these stones as it may clog their pores or irritate their skin., Depending on the height and width of the participant, the size of the stones you use may vary. However, you should try to place one stone or more on either side of their collarbone, two large ones along the breastbone, and two palm-sized stones in their hands. They do not need to clasp these, but should instead remain fully relaxed and gently cupping the stones., Once you've placed all the stones on the participant's front side, take a palm-sized stone and rub it with oil. Then follow the cords of muscles in the participant’s body from head to toe to work out any remaining knots. You should take some time to massage the stones you placed earlier into the skin as well. Once you've finished, you can remove them all., After you've finished massaging the front, have the participant turn over to lie on their stomach. This is a good time to remove the first stones you placed before the participant laid down. You can also take a moment to change the sheet or towel to keep everything clean.

You should also make sure that you are changing your stones so they stay warm.

, Pick larger stones for the shoulder blades and the backs of the kneecaps. For the toes, place a small stone between each. You should then wrap each foot in a towel to help hold in the warmth and keep the stones in place.After you've placed these, take a palm-sized, oiled stone and use it to massage the participant from head to toe while removing the stones you placed earlier.

, Do this by moving the stones gently over tense, sore areas. The pressure applied by the stones may be quite strong, but since the participant’s muscles have been sufficiently relaxed by the heating process, the procedure should virtually be painless., You can try a Swedish massage or deep tissue massage. This will help you reap the greatest benefit from the experience. While the stones heat and soothe stiff muscles, other massage techniques can be applied with little or no discomfort - either with the stones still on the skin or after the stones are removed., Most clients find that after a period of time, their bodies become so relaxed from the hot stone massage techniques, they don't even notice the temperature change to the cooler stones. This process is often recommended for soothing injuries that result in painful swelling or inflammation.

, While the water is heating, wash your face to remove makeup and dirt. Use a gentle face cleanser and warm water. Removing makeup and dirt is a must before steaming, because steaming opens up your pores, and anything on your face will be able to get inside and cause irritation or pimples to occur.


Don't exfoliate your face before steaming it. This could increase the likelihood that the steam treatment will irritate your skin.
After washing your face, pat it dry with a towel.

, Pour it into a glass or ceramic bowl resting on a folded towel or two. Part of the facial experience is to add some beauty to your day, so if you have a pretty bowl on hand, use that one! If you're in a hurry, you can also just use the pot you boiled the water in.

, You don't have to add anything to your steam, but to make it truly special you can add some fresh or dried herbs or essential oils that will release beneficial aromas. An herbal teabag will also do the trick! Try the following herbs and oils to enhance your steam:


Use lemongrass or peppermint for an energizing steam.
Use chamomile or lavender for a relaxing steam.
Use peppermint or eucalyptus for a cold-conquering steam.
Use sandalwood or bergamot for a stress-relieving steam.

, Drape a towel over your head so that it creates a sort of tent over your face, and hold your face over the water. Keep your face over the steam for about 10 minutes. Close your eyes and breathe deeply, allowing the heat to awaken your face and open your pores.


Don't steam your face for too long, or get too close to the hot water. The heat can cause inflammation if exposure is too high.

, The next step is to use a mask to pull the impurities from your now-open pores. A clay mask works well if you have one on hand. Mix the clay with some water and smooth it over your face. Let it sit on your face for about 15 minutes before gently rinsing it off with lukewarm water.


Instead of a clay mask, you can use plain honey to achieve the same effect. Also check on wikiHow on how to make your own facial masks if you so choose.
If you don't wish to do a mask, just rinse your face in fresh water after you're finished steaming it.

, Time to close up your pores again! Do this so that after your facial, dirt doesn't get into your pores. Using a toner after steaming will help your face look toned and fresh. Use a cotton ball to apply the toner of your choice to your nose, forehead, cheeks and chin.


Apple cider vinegar makes a great natural toner - try it out!
You can also use lemon juice as a toner. Try this on a small area of skin prior to using on your whole face, some individuals may be more sensitive to this than others.

, The final step in your facial is to apply a moisturizer to keep your face hydrated. Steaming it can actually dry it out, so this is an important step. Smooth on your favorite moisturizer, or try a face-softening oil like coconut oil, jojoba oil or argan oil. Pay attention to the ingredients on oils to verify that they natural and have no harsh chemical additives.

Burn wood to create ashes.,
Grind the ashes.,
Choose a clear spirit.,
Mix them together.,
Track the ash and liquid amounts.",How to Make Tattoo Ink1," In order for wood ashes to work well as a tattoo ink, you need to completely burn the wood you’re using. The ashes should be totally black, with none of the wood’s natural color still visible. They should also be completely cooled when you use them.Different types of wood will give you a slightly different shades of color when the ashes are used as ink. Lighter woods will produce a grayer pigment; darker woods will produce a blacker pigment.;
, Once you’ve burned the wood of your choice to create ashes, you’ll need to grind the burned wood. You want the ash particles as fine as possible so that they make a smooth and easily usable ink.

, To create tattoo ink from wood ashes, you’ll need to mix the ashes with a liquid. Some people recommend that you use distilled water, but this still risks some bacteria getting under your skin as you press the needle in. Instead, use a clear spirit – like vodka or gin – as your liquid base. The alcohol will kill any bacteria and the clarity of the alcohol won’t change your ink color., Mix your ashes and clear spirit together by blending them in a blender for 10 to 20 minutes. The consistency should be a slurry – a little thicker than water, but thinner than a paste – and should not have any chunks in it.It’s hard to recommend an exact proportion of ashes to liquid for this, since it will depend on how finely you grind up the ashes, the type of wood you use, and the desired pigmentation of your ink. It’s better to add liquid slowly – you can always add more, but you can’t take any out.

, If you’re creating a larger tattoo, make sure you track the ash and liquid amounts you’re using. You’ll likely have to mix up more than one batch of ink, and knowing the exact measurements keeps the pigment of the ink consistent."

Turn on the hot water in your shower.,
Rinse your face while it heats.,
Stand with your face in or close to the steam for about 5 minutes.,
Put on a mask while you finish your shower.,
Apply toner and moisturizer.",How to Do a Steam Facial2," Leave it running until it's very hot and you see and feel steam. This method will steam more than your face - you'll get a full-body steam treatment.

, Just like you would for a full-fledged facial steam, it's a good idea to cleanse your face of dirt and makeup before you begin steaming it.

, There's no need to use a towel to direct the steam to your face, since you'll be standing a column of steam trapped in by the sides of your shower. Let your face steam for about five minutes, then turn the heat down to a milder temperature to finish your shower.

, To enhance the results, you can use a drugstore face mask or a scoop of raw honey to cleanse your pores while you're finishing up your shower. Put it on after you finish steaming your face, then rinse it off at the end of your shower.

, When you finish your shower, pat your skin dry and apply toner, then moisturizer to your face. You might want to apply moisturizer to the rest of your body, too, since the hot steam can cause your skin to dry out.

Choose your pigment powder.,
Mix witch hazel with propylene glycol and medical grade glycerin.,
Add the pigment powder.,
Mix in a blender.,
Store in a sterile container.",How to Make Tattoo Ink2," Many tattoo supply companies have pigment powder available for purchase. You’ll need to decide which color or colors you want to use and purchase those colors.It's best to purchase pigment powder from a tattoo supply company since you can be sure it's safe. You don't want to accidentally use pigment ink used in car paint.

, When using pigment powder, you’ll need to add it to medical grade liquids. Mix together 2 pints (32 ounces) of witch hazel (which you can get from most holistic health stores or online), 2 ¼ teaspoons (0.38 ounces) of medical grade glycerin and 2 ¼ teaspoons propylene glycol to form a liquid base., Once your liquid base is mixed, add your pigment powder. The amount of pigment powder you use will depend on how bright or subdued you want the color to be. Add the pigment powder slowly – again, you can always add more but you can’t take any out., To mix your ink together, put it in a blender at low speed. If you find your ink is too thick, add a bit more liquid. If it’s too thin, add more pigment. Once your ink reaches your desired consistency, turn the speed up to medium and mix your ink for about an hour., Once your ink is finished, store it in a sterile, airtight container. You should place the container in a cool, dark place.

Gather your supplies.,
Wash your hands.,
Make your needle.,
Heat your needle.,
Draw your design.,
Ink your needle.,
Apply the ink to your skin.,
Take care of your tattoo.,
Touch up the design of your tattoo.",How to Make Tattoo Ink3," To apply your homemade ink at home, you'll need a few supplies: a few very fine sewing needles, a #2 pencil, a ballpoint pen, some sewing thread, matches, and alcohol swabs. You'll also need your ink!, Before you begin to give yourself a tattoo with your homemade ink, make sure you thoroughly wash your hands. This means washing your hands well, with soap, for at least two minutes.For some extra cleansing, you can also wipe your hands with an alcohol wipe after you've washed them.

, You'll want to prepare your needle for applying your homemade ink by attaching it to a longer handle. This gives you more control over the movement of the needle and makes tattooing easier. Insert the eye end of your thin needle into the eraser of the #2 pencil. Then wrap the needle and pencil with thread until the needle stays firmly in place.You might want to wrap the thread with some tape to give it extra support and make sure it doesn't move.

, Once you've got your needle put together, you'll need to heat the tip up. Light a match and hold the needle over it for ten to fifteen seconds. Make sure you turn the needle so it heats evenly. Heating the tip of the needle kills any germs on the needle. This can prevent infection when the needle goes under your skin to apply the ink.

, Use an alcohol swab to clean the area of your skin where you want to apply your tattoo. Then, using the ballpoint pen, draw on your design.


If you've never done your own tattoo before, you might want to start with a small design.You should practice your design on paper before you draw on your skin.

, Once you're satisfied with your design placement and style, it's time to ink your needle. Simply dip your needle into your homemade ink. Gently tap the needle on the side of the jar or its lid to remove any excess ink. You don't want the needle to be dripping with ink.

, Once you've got ink on your needle, poke the needle into your skin at any point in your design. To make sure the ink actually stays in your skin, you'll need to poke through the first two layers of skin. Continue this process along the lines of your design.Your skin may bleed occasionally when you poke the needle through. Some bleeding is normal, but if you notice a lot of blood, stop immediately.
You'll need to reload your needle with ink occasionally. If you notice that the ink color is fading, reload the needle.

, After you've finished your tattoo, you should wipe it down gently with water and mild soap and apply anti-bacterial ointment. If your tattoo is in a place that is likely to rub against your clothing, wrap it with clear plastic wrap. Once you unwrap it, clean it with soap and water, but don't use a cloth.In the days after your tattoo is finished, you might notice your skin dries out quite a bit. This is normal. Just use a bit of fragrance-free moisturizer and rub it gently over your tattoo.

, Your skin will swell when you repeatedly poke it with a needle. Once you've finished your tattoo and your skin has had time to heal, you might notice that you've missed a few spots. Simply go back and repeat the tattooing process to touch up the areas that you missed."

Prepare.,

Choose the primary area that you are going to work on, for example the head and neck.

,
Put your crystal sphere on your selected trigger point and apply slight pressure.,Know the components of a muscle.",How to Do Crystal Sphere Massage," Sit comfortably in a chair or in your bed before starting. Make sure you are undisturbed, and then take several deep breaths to center yourself and relax. Crystal Sphere Massage can done with yoga or meditation practice to increase relaxation and increase the pain relieving effect. Consult the following definitions related to Crystal Sphere Massage:

Trigger Points- localized tensions inside the muscle tissues that most often occur on certain locations in the muscle, and are a result of continuous contractions in the muscle fiber. When touching them, they feel like knots or strings. A trigger point is painful, but you may immediately feel release by pressing them. It is a natural reflex to touch such spots to relieve pain. They are usually along the center line of a muscle. The number one purpose of Crystal Sphere Massage is to remove muscular trigger points, which, as a result, leaves the muscle smooth, flexible, and relaxed.



 


Acupressure Points- places on the meridians that are located near the skin. The subtle energy system describes 12 or more meridians and other subtle energy organs and channels in the body. Acupuncture points are those points on the meridians that are accessed by acupuncture therapists with an acupuncture needle. Such points may not be as near the skin and not available for acupressure. Acupressure points are not the same as trigger points. Both types of points are used for applying pressure. Acupressure points is to open blocked energy channels (meridians) and remove the blocked energy stagnant in the point.






Pain: An unpleasant physical sensation caused by a noxious stimulus, an event in which bodily tissues could be harmed. Pain can be graduated along the scale of mild pain to unbearable pain. Pain can be localized or diffused all over. Pain can be temporary, intermittent or chronic. There is also mental-emotional pain and spiritual pain, which can not be healed by a Crystal Sphere Massage.






Locating points: You want to find the tense areas of your muscles that cause you pain and discomfort. Touching the skin, you may find knots or string-like tensions inside of certain muscles. They are painful to touch. Pressing on a trigger point will begin releasing the tension that causes problems.





;
, A muscle consist of muscle fibers,and those are composed of numerous microscopic units (sarcomeres) surrounded by an inter connective tissue called fascia. Muscles attach via tendons on our skeletal bones.

, For example, if you have a headache, you may suspect the trigger points are in the muscles in the head and neck. Touching your head and neck will direct you to where the accurate points are. In the case of head and neck pain, you will most likely find trigger points along the muscle that creates a V from behind your ears down to the sternum at the front of your neck (this muscle is called: Sternocleidomastoid).

,, Sometimes the entire muscle is so tense that it feels like a wall of concrete. Apply heat prior to treatment, or do a general massage to relax the area. # After finding a particular knot, press on it to notice the level of pain, and also notice if pain is felt somewhere else as well. That is called referred pain.

,, Make sure you have found the point accurately. # Increase pressure to about 70 % of your maximum pain tolerance. Yes, this can be painful but know that your muscle is screaming to release the pain burden it stores for you. The pain should be felt as a “good pain”, meaning you want to press on it as you feel that the pain is reduced or simply melts away.



Use a very slow pulsing motion up and down and as well a tiny rotation on your trigger point. Stay at least 20 seconds on each point along the muscle you are treating. (see also Massage Pressure and Length of Session below).

Be firm in your decision.",How to Handle Your Teen Wanting a Tattoo," When you speak to your teen about wanting a tattoo, you might feel tense or feel tempted to yell or lash out. However, doing so will likely only make your teen want a tattoo even more and will escalate your anxiety. Rather than being overly emotional, go into the situation calm by breathing deeply beforehand and keeping an open mind.


Remember that you can always step away from the talk if it becomes too much and revisit the conversation later.;
, Should your teen continue to bring the issue up, it can be tempting to say ‘no’ immediately, in hopes that this will end the discussion. However, an immediate ‘no’ may make your teen feel disrespected and as if their own wishes are not worth a moment’s thought to you. Acknowledge their request without affirming it by saying “We’ll talk about it later.” This will give you more time to think and calm down. If you set aside a time to talk, this will prevent your teen from constantly badgering you about it in the interim.Listening to your child shows that you care about their opinions even if you do not agree with them.

, Before you speak with your teen about this, you will want to have a fully developed reason on why you feel the way you do about them getting a tattoo. This will help you to understand your reasons and keep a level head when it's time to talk with your teen. Though you are the parent and you simply saying “because I don’t want you to” is enough, children need some level of reasoning to understand your decision, particularly if they are older. Consider all the reasons you feel so strongly about tattoos.


Some reasons might include health risks, age, future employment, maturity level or the type of tattoo they want.

, During this time of frustration for you, rely on your child’s other parent, caregiver, or godparent. If they feel similarly to you about the teen getting a tattoo, then it will be easier for the both of you to tell your teen ‘no.’ However, if they think that it should be permitted, ask them why. Their perspective might provide some clarity and peace for you.See if they would like to be a part of the talk about tattoos with your teen.
Do not allow your child to get the tattoo without their permission, as well.

, If your child is 17 and on the precipice of turning 18, then perhaps their desire to get a tattoo should be seriously considered, as they are nearing adulthood. If they are a younger teen however, maybe this could be put off for a few years. Also, if your teen has been asking about getting a tattoo for months, then you should recognize that this is something important and persistent for them and should be considered seriously.


If your child has only mentioned it once and seemed a bit flippant about it, then perhaps having the discussion about tattoos could wait until the issue seems more pressing.

, Rather than speaking after you’ve had a stressful day at work or while your child is busy studying for exams, talk during a time of mutual calm. This will allow your child to get a better understanding of your reasoning and you can get a better understanding of their understanding. Choose some time during the weekend, perhaps over dinner or while watching a movie, to discuss your teen’s desire to get a tattoo.Also, allow this to be an ongoing conversation. Don’t just talk about it once. If your teen is serious, it will require multiple discussions.

, Before making judgements or a decision, you should speak with your child about why they want to get a tattoo. Allow them to speak honestly and openly. Don’t interrupt them and avoid making negative facial expressions. Don’t cross your arms, frown, or furrow your brows. Ask them the following things about the tattoo they want:Location of the tattoo
Size
Design
Significance

, After your child is done speaking about why they want a tattoo, now is the time to air your concerns and feelings. Talk to them about the permanence of tattoos and that once you get them, they’re there forever. Tell them that it’s not like makeup or a t-shirt that they can just remove or change at their whims.Encourage your teen to try out a temporary tattoo first so they can get an idea of what they might be in for. For example, if your teen wants to get a tattoo on a visible area, then they could wear the temporary tattoo there and see how it feels.

, In addition to permanence, tattoos can also come with risks. Should the tattoo artist use an unclean needle, your teen could contract Hepatitis. In addition, an employer might not want to hire them if the tattoos are visible. Talk to them also about the regret that many feel after getting a tattoo. Tell your teen about these potential issues and encourage them to research it on their own., If you have tattoos, this can be a great time for you to bond with your teen and share the story of your tattoos. Talk to them about your regrets or your happiness with them. Tell them why you got them and what you would have done differently.


Answer any questions should they have them.

, After you both have said your peace, let your teen know that you can revisit the conversation after you have had some time to consider their case. Spend some time reflecting on both sides and encourage your teen to do the same.


Consider setting a time limit after which to reconvene and discuss the issue.

, In some states, teens who are sixteen years of age or older are allowed to get a tattoo without the permission of a parent. In other states, you must be at least eighteen. In addition, some cities have specific laws about tattoos that are more stringent than the state laws. Research the law in your state and town and communicate that to your teen., If you are still feeling uncomfortable about the idea of a tattoo, simply tell your teen that they cannot get one while in your house or while relying on your financial support.Once they are out of your house and paying their own bills, they can get a tattoo of their choice.

, Perhaps you are on the fence about allowing them to get tattooed but feel that they are not mature or serious enough about wanting one. In this instance, tell your teen that if they still want the same tattoo in a year, that they can get it. Often times, teens want things in the moment, but those desires diminish over time.If they still want the tattoo after a year has elapsed, then you will know that they are serious and this is something important to them.

, Rather than getting an actual tattoo that is permanent, suggest a temporary tattoo to your teen. You can purchase temporary tattoos online and in some stores. Have them apply it and see how they enjoy rocking that ink for a few days., If you want to allow your teen the freedom of getting a tattoo but are concerned about the placement, tell them the areas of their body that you will allow. For instance, perhaps you could allow them to have a tattoo on their upper arms, stomach, back, or thigh. These areas are easily covered by clothing.Don’t allow your children to get tattoos on the neck, face, or forearms. Talk to them about the professional implications of such tattoos.

, After you have communicated your decision or an option to your child, hold firm in your decision. Don’t allow them to guilt you into accepting more than you are comfortable with or that you find appropriate. Your child may not like it now, but later they will come to respect you for your standards."

, First, start any DIY spa treatment with squeaky clean skin. Use a gentle cleanser, not soap, with warm water. Cleansers with a soy base are less irritating to the skin. You may want to combine equal parts of rosewater and coconut milk in a small, clean jar. Shake gently and then drizzle into running bathwater. Soak for the desired amount of time and then drain. You may need to add some cleanser to the tub to remove any film left behind from the coconut milk.

, It is as simple as heating up water in a large bowl in the microwave or on the stove, draping a towel over your head, and letting your skin absorb the steam for 5 minutes. For a rejuvenating steam, add green tea and some herbs, such as rosemary, thyme, or mint to the water. Facial steamers will open up the pores, providing a deep cleansing by steaming out embedded dirt, as well as hydrating the skin.

, Use a stimulating toner rich in emollients and antioxidants.

, Once a week, give yourself a skin-enriching treatment with a moisturizing and hydrating facial mask. There are several OTC options, or you can make your own mask using common ingredients such as avocado, banana, or aloe mixed with freshly squeezed citrus juice and a drizzle of olive or nut oil.

, Do this once a week with an OTC product that contains an alpha hydroxyl acid (AHA) or beta hydroxyl acid (BHA). You can also easily make your own. Mix 30 drops of ascorbic acid, a few crushed plain aspirin, and one-half packet of unflavored gelatin into one stiffly whipped egg white.

, Doing this once or twice a week will get rid of dead skin cells and stimulate cell renewal. There are several types of microdermabrasion products to chose from, all being effective. Use an OTC microdermabrasion scrub, a microdermabrasion cloth, or a handheld microdermabrasion scrubbing wand. Studies suggest that 5 to 6 home microdermabrasion treatments are equivalent to one professional spa microdermabrasion treatment!, There are several different home facial laser devices to choose from, including the ever-popular derma wand and the oxylight. The Baby Quasar or â€ Baby Qâ€ is the newest facial laser to be introduced on the market, and it has been quite a hit. (It was originally designed to be sold as a professional spa photo rejuvenation treatment but was recently released to be sold to the home consumer.) The current correlation is that 3 to 4 home facial laser treatments are equal to the results achieved from one professional IPL treatment.

, A simple facial wrap can be achieved by either using an OTC product or by soaking nori seaweed in warm vitamin water until soft and applying it to the skin for 15 minutes.

, Mix brown sugar and honey (equal parts) in a bowl.


Wash your face using a mild cleanser, rinse it off, and then apply the scrub to your face. Using clean fingertips, gently rub the scrub into your face in a circular motion.
Don’t scrub too roughly as it could scratch your skin.
Rinse well and pat dry with a clean towel.

, Mix raw sugar with non-petroleum-based jelly. Consider adding 2 parts jelly to 1 part sugar at first in the event your lips are very sensitive. Rub scrub over lips and allow to set. Rinse well and then apply a soothing lip balm.

, Apply with a clean washcloth to clean face and gently pat. Don’t rub, as this will only encourage redness. Rinse well and pat dry.

, After completing a DIY spa treatment with an emollient-rich moisturizer, find moisturizers with Hyaluronic acid, retinol, DMAE, and alpha lipoic acid.


Also, for a more natural moisturizer, you may want to moisturize your skin by mixing honey and olive oil. Combine equal parts of each ingredient and apply after a hot shower. Smooth a small amount over the skin and allow it to soak in. For extremely dry skin, add a few coats until you find relief.

, Last, but not least, always use sunscreen to protect your skin from sun damaging UV radiation, or all your efforts on DIY spa treatments will simply be undone by overexposure to the sun.

Geranium blends well with rose oil and shares many of the same properties, like healing the skin by increasing blood flow., If you're concerned taht you may have an allergic reaction to an essential oil, test the oil on a small patch of your skin before using it in a steam facial. Mix the essential oil in a small amount of carrier oil (like baby oil) and place a few drops on the pad part of a bandage. Stick the bandage onto your forearm and leave it for 48 hours. Check your skin for any redness, irritation, or blisters which can mean an allergy or sensitivity.If you're pregnant or nursing, ask your doctor before using essential oils since many of them haven't been tested extensively.

, Have all of your facial supplies ready so you're not scrambling around hot water while the steam escapes. You can easily set up your steam facial in the kitchen (nearest the hot water) or the bathroom. You'll need:


A kettle
Water
3 to 7 drops of essential oils
A thick clean towel
A large basin or bowl

, Fill the kettle with clean water and bring it to a boil. Pour the boiled water into a heat safe bowl or basin. Add your essential oils to the water. Take care when pouring the water or moving the bowl.If you boil the water in the microwave, make sure to place a wooden spoon, utensil, or chopstick into the water. This prevents the water from super-heating which can cause an explosion.

, Place the basin on a table so you can sit in a chair and lean over the steaming bowl. With your head over the basin, place the towel so that it's draped over the back of your head and completely over the bowl. This will prevent steam from escaping.Be careful not to lean too close to the hot water.

, Deeply breathe in the steam for 5 to 10 minutes, or as long as the steam lasts. If you need to, you can re-heat the water to get it steaming again.You can reuse the water until it boils dry, adding more essential oils only if you add more water.

, Since the steam opens your pores, you'll need to rinse your face with cold water when you've finished the steam facial. Cold water acts as an astringent which closes the pores.To further moisturize your skin, apply a lotion as soon as you're done with the facial.

, Splash your face with warm (not hot) water and apply a cream cleanser. Use your fingertips to gently rub the cleanser into your skin. Choose a cleanser that contains essential oils that you enjoy using. Rinse the cleanser off with warm water and pat your face dry with a soft towel. Avoid rubbing or scrubbing your face, which can damage the skin.To get the most benefit from a steam facial, you might want to wash your face before you begin. This can remove makeup and excess oil from your skin. Or, you can wash your face after the facial in order to deep clean the pores.

, Purchase a facial mask depending on your skin type. Follow the manufacturer's instructions if you need to mix it with water. Some masks are ready to apply without mixing. Use your fingertips to apply the mask evenly over your entire face. Leave the mask on for the recommended amount of time. Gently remove the mask by wiping it with a clean cloth and warm water. Types of masks include:Clay: Clay can remove oil from combination or oily skin.
Moisturizing: A moisture mask can hydrate dry or flaky skin.
Exfoliating: Exfoliating masks contain slightly scrub your skin which can brighten dull skin.
Mineral: Minerals in a mask can help inflamed sensitive skin.

, Place toner on a cotton ball and gently swipe it over your face. Toner acts as an astringent which can get rid of extra oil, remove any cleanser that's still on your face, and balance the pH of your skin.Toners usually contain essential oils like tea tree, rose, lavender, and grapefruit.


When buying a toner, look for one that doesn't contain alcohol, which can dry out your skin.

, Always try to apply a moisturizing lotion after you've washed your face to help retain moisture. Keeping your skin hydrated is an important part of skin health. Properly moisturized skin can prevent wrinkles over time. To help you moisturize, remember to apply moisturizer at the same time every day.Your moisturizer should be formulated for your skin type (oily, dry, sensitive, or combination) and should have some sunscreen in it (like SPF 15).

Stage a fight.,
Use sexuality.,
Take advantage of a good Samaritan.,
Cut the target's purse straps.,
Grab the target's wallet from his back pocket.,
Carry as little money as possible.,
Keep your money where you can see it.,
Know where pickpockets operate.,
Beware of groups.",How to Pickpocket," The most effective way to steal from somebody is to temporarily divert the person's attention away from his or her belongings. This method requires operating in a group of at least three people. Two of them will pretend to get into a physical fight near the victim while the third will grab the victim's wallet or purse.;
, One of the most common and effective methods of theft is to use a beautiful woman to distract the target while either she or her partner steals the target's money. In one scenario, the woman may bend down in a revealing outfit in front of the target while another pickpocket steals the wallet from his back pocket. Alternatively, she might do the stealing herself, and distract the target by grabbing him or kissing him, playing off her touches as affection and then secretly grabbing the man's wallet.

, This is perhaps the most ruthless tactic employed by pickpockets, because it preys upon the good nature of the target. Again, this tactic works best in pairs or groups. One person will pretend to be in danger, summoning the attention of the target, while the other steals the money.


This tactic is commonly used at the beach, where one thief will pretend to drown in the ocean. The target will run in to save him, while the other grabs the victim's wallet and clothes that were left on the beach.
This method is also commonly employed on the streets. One thief will pretend to accidentally drop his or her belongings onto the street and the target will bend down to help while the other thief grabs his wallet. In another scenario, one thief will stop to ask the target for directions and pull out a map to distract the target while he is robbed.

, This method is commonplace in large, crowded cities with high rates of tourism. The pickpocket will use a razor blade or a pocket knife to cut the victim's purse straps and then run away with the purse.

, This method works best when standing in a crowded bus or train where peoples' bodies are already pressed against one another. This way, the victim won't notice the slight pressure he feels against his back pocket as his wallet is being lifted out by the thief.

, The less you have with you, the less damage a successful pickpocket can do. When traveling, only carry what you need with you for the day and secure the rest of your money safely in your hotel room or hostel. When possible, carry cash only so that you don't have to deal with canceling stolen credit cards.

, Money that is stored in back pockets, backpacks, and long purses can be easily accessed by pickpockets without the knowledge of the target. When you are in a crowded area, wear your purse or backpack on the front of your body, gripping it tightly.


Avoid purses with long straps, as these can easily be cut with knives or razor blades. If you do wear a long strapped purse, wear it across your body so that it is more difficult for the thief to grab.

, Crowded tourist destinations are writhing with pickpockets, mostly because locals know that tourists carry a great deal of cash while traveling. Tourists traveling to foreign countries are also easy targets because they are unfamiliar with the local language and geographics. The following cities have among the highest occurrences of street theft:Madrid, Spain.
Barcelona, Spain.
Rome, Italy.
Paris, France.
Athens, Greece.
London, England.

, Extremely skilled pickpockets do not work on their own, and instead operate in groups of two or more. This makes it easier to distract the target while one of the thieves grabs the money. Keep your eyes peeled for pairs and groups of pickpockets, who usually start off by surrounding their target in crowded areas and then communicate with one another through eye contact, nods, and other signals.

When running, try to avoid large open areas, where you will be easily spotted.,
Stay out of the line of sight.,
If you can run no further or have put enough distance between you and your pursuer, you may then want to hide.",How to Outrun a Pursuer," This obviously may be difficult if he or she is in a vehicle and you are on foot, so in this case force him or her out of the vehicle by going through dense trees or climbing over a fence, if one is available. If they are in a vehicle a sudden change of direction can give you time to put distance between you and your pursuer. Another thing to consider is the speed and stamina of the pursuer.

, When you step down on a wooden floor, keep close to the walls. This is generally the best supported part of the wall and therefore the least creaky. Nonetheless, make sure to test the floor at each step to make sure it won't creak loudly.

, Although less noisy than wooden floors, any surface can be hazardous to the careless. Another method is to walk on the outside of your foot. This may take a little practice but is a proven method.

, Likewise when closing a door.

, By opening a door slowly, you can be more sneaky because since the movement is slow, someone's eyes may not be able to pick it up very well. The only downside to this is if the door is squeaky. You must be VERY careful in this situation. If you hear the slightest squeak, close the door IMMEDIATELY, but DON'T slam it, and try not to make noise when it closes. At this point, you must open the door at a faster rate than before, but don't just rush it open. Another way squeaks may be reduced is by lifting up on the knob, as this takes pressure off of the hinges., If you are walking along a narrow area, this will help a lot.

First of all, you need to know if someone is following you for real, or if your mind is getting the better of you.,
You've recognized a tail.,
Find a bathroom.,
At this point, if you recognize someone more than once for any reason, you are being followed.,
Escape from level areas (No elevators).",How to Lose a Tail on Foot,"


You need to see behind you sometimes, and you can't just turn and look. Turning for no reason and staring at someone tends to grab their attention

Twisting your back in a stretching fashion or dropping an item behind you is a good way to turn without anyone paying much attention.
After looking at said person(s), make a mental note of things like clothing color, hair type, and shoe color.Shoe color and type is important because while a tail can remove jackets, sunglasses, wigs, and extra shirts, I've yet to see someone remove their shoes for the sake of spying.
Also, check for which hand they use more often. This will help in step 3. Just trust me.

;
, Time to get moving! Move often and don't stick around. Checking behind you is a clear sign that you know you are being followed, and more often than not results in a complete feeling of dread. Don't look back. And if you must, drop something: Dropping a pen, phone, or wallet can both grab attention to yourself, and provide an ample opportunity to turn around and look for it. When you bend down to grab it, its quite natural for someone in that situation to look up to make certain no one will run into them. Take that opportunity to see anyone that fits your above description, or at least anyone suspicious that is staring too much.


Don't look into anyone's eyes for more than a split second, and look for people that suddenly change direction. This works best in an open area as someone following you will have to either change direction in an awkward spot (Imagine walking in a giant curve towards your house instead of straight towards it), or walk straight past you allowing you time to walk the opposite direction. In either case, you can get away or recognize the person for later.

,


While your lavatory needs may seem trivial when being pursued, take a moment to think of which hand your pursuer uses more. When you exit the bathroom look at the opposite direction of whichever hand the pursuer is partial too. When you approach the bathroom, your pursuer will turn (often right for right handed and left for left handed) to wait somewhere close. Scan the area (right for left handers, and left for right handers) for anyone suspicious and continue your walk.

, Time to actually lose them.


The Elevator Escape: Simplicity plus normality equals blending in.Take a seat outside of an elevator to check a text message, fumble inside a wallet, or search a purse for some random item. This may seem stupid, but it will allow a pursuer to believe you are completely innocent in your activity. Seem interested in your actions, but before you get up: Leave something. Leave your phone, a wallet, a makeup kit. Leave something important that nobody would steal in the period of 20 seconds.After leaving something behind, walk into the elevator and press a random floor. Your pursuer will be 100% forced to follow you inside. (If they don't, then merely walk to a set of stairs after exiting on a different floor, and find your way somewhere else quick).

Before the doors close, check the elevator for shady characters, and stick your hand out to stop the doors from closing. Make your exit to the item you left behind, and turn back around to make sure nobody else stepped out.



,


Emergency phone call: Not what you think, but nevertheless most important. Text a friend and have them call you, then hang up after a few seconds. Don't put down your phone. Have a one sided conversation with an imaginary person on the other side of the phone, and describe some sort of emergency. ""Is he stable? I knew he had heart problems but at his age?"" or something similar is wonderful. After hanging up the phone, turn around or turn towards your vehicle and escape at a fast pace. Don't pause and don't do anything that would cause a real uproar. Make certain that your car isn't followed. In fact, I'm quite sure there's a few ways to lose a car tail on here as well.

Wear clothes to fit in.,
Wear dark makeup.,
Keep your head up.,
Maintain good body posture.,
Keep your phone put away.",How to Look Scary in a Rough Neighbourhood1," If you are in a rough neighborhood, most people there are probably not wearing expensive suits, lots of bright jewelry, and shiny shoes. You need to wear clothes that make you fit in, not stand out in a way that makes you a target. Choose simple clothes such as jeans, sweat pants, plain t-shirts, sweatshirts, and coats that don’t appear new. Consider wearing clothes that are kind of beat up, maybe even dirty.If you are coming or going from work or somewhere that you need to wear nice clothes, consider wearing the old clothes while you are in the rough neighborhood and changing into your nice clothes when you get to your destination.;
, This will primarily apply to women, but is not out of the question for men. If you are someone who tends to look cheery, and especially if you usually wear makeup that gives you a pleasant appearance, this can be to your disadvantage. Wearing dark lipstick, eye shadow, and avoiding any bright colored makeup can give you a tougher appearance which can discourage people from messing with you.

, When you are walking around in a rough neighborhood, it is good to keep your head up, for a couple of reasons. For one, having your head down projects weakness and tends to make you look more like a target. It gives the appearance of fear and trying not to be noticed. Secondly, you want to be able to see around yourself clearly to keep alert of your surroundings. Having your head down restricts how much you can see and keeps you from be aware., Besides keeping your head up, you want to walk with your whole body up straight. People who walk with a slouch automatically give the appearance of weakness. People who have good posture appear to be more confident. Keep your back straight and your shoulders pulled slightly back.This type of posture will show that you are not afraid to be seen, while slouching will make people think you are trying to hide.
Good posture projects strength and is more likely to keep people from bothering you.

, This has two functions: minimizing distraction and not openly revealing valuables. Someone who is talking on their phone is most likely not paying very close attention to their surroundings, so it is just another weakness. Plus, talking on a phone shows people that you have at least one valuable on you, and gives them the idea that you might have more.If you are carrying a bag of some kind, this might be a good place to store your phone. If you keep it in a pocket, try to have a loose pocket that will not highlight the outline of your phone.

"
"
Walk with a measured pace.,
Watch your surroundings at all times.,
Be a little unpredictable.,
Stay sober.",How to Look Scary in a Rough Neighbourhood2," The speed you walk at can have a significant impact on how you look to the people around you. If you are walking too quickly, you will appear to be uneasy and will be more noticeable as a potential target. You want to walk at a speed that shows you know where you are and where you are going. Take even, confident strides. If you seem to be walking too slowly, it may appear that you feel out of place and this will be noticed. Walking with a purpose will often deter people from bothering you because it shows you know what you are doing.

, This is similar to keeping your head up, but carries the behavior a bit farther. When trying to look scary, or tough, it is important to continually look around you in all directions. If you keep your head straight forward and concentrate on one thing in the distance, you’ll seem like you are scared of what is around you. Make a point of looking at specific things off to your right and left, lingering your gaze for long enough to take in the details, but not so long that you are staring.The main point of this behavior is to show anyone who may be watching you that you are fully aware of your surroundings and are not zoned out. If you look like you are spaced out, you’ll be more likely to look like an easy target.
You want to make sure to control the speed you are looking around. Twitching your head quickly in every direction will make you look paranoid rather than in control.

, This is the type of behavior that takes a little bit of extra finesse, but it can be a useful tactic. Think of the person that you see standing on the street corner yelling at no one in particular. This can actually be a useful way to seem a little bit off and keep people from bothering you. Yell “no” loudly every so often, or turn to your side and yell at an object like a tree or a bench.If you seem a little unstable, you have a better chance of being left alone. Be creative with the behavior that you exhibit and what you say, but make sure it is not directed at anyone.

, It’s not an uncommon practice in many cities for people to go to bars, drink until they can barely stand and then wander home. If you have ever been around someone who is so drunk they are stumbling, this is far from intimidating behavior. If anything, this person appears like someone you could easily take advantage of. Staying sober will help you stay alert, which is much scarier than stumbling around confused."

Grab the attacker by the shirt.,
Push the attacker away.,
Quickly pull the attacker toward you.,
Swiftly strike with right or left of the crown of your head, if you use the middle chances are you might crack your head.",How to Knock Someone Out1," Use both hands to grab the attacker by the shirt, at the center of the chest just below the collar or neckline.


The most effective way to headbutt someone is to draw him or her into a whiplash motion. In order to accomplish this, you need to push and pull the attacker away by the shirt.
Avoid grabbing the attacker behind the neck. Natural instinct is to grab the attacker behind the neck and draw the head down for a headbutt, but the problem with this is that the neck and shoulder muscles naturally tense when grabbed behind the neck, making it much more difficult to pull the person forward.;
, Use your full body weight to push forward into the attacker until his upper body leans back.


This movement causes the attacker to lose balance and causing his or her shoulders to disengage.
Since this movement is also likely to be unexpected, you will also have the element of surprise on your side.

, As soon as the attacker's shoulders disengage, use your arms to pull the attacker back toward your head.


With the shoulders disengaged in this manner, the attacker's arms will naturally swing open, preventing him or her from using the arms to block the headbutt.

, As you draw the attacker toward you, bring your head down so that the top of your head meets with the attacker's nose as his or her nose drops down.


Strike with the top of your head. Do not use your forehead.
The nose is a sensitive pressure point, and striking it with enough force will allow you to knock the other person out.

"
"
Position yourself along the center line of your attacker.,
Draw the eye with your non-dominant hand.,
Swiftly bring an open hand up to the attacker's chin.,
Strike with the palm heel of your hand.",How to Knock Someone Out2," Stand directly in front of the attacker so that the vertical center of your body lines up with the vertical center of your attacker's body.


When performing an upper-cut, you will need to bring your arm up along this center line until you reach the attacker's chin. As such, you will need to be in a position where you have access to the center line of your attacker's body.

, Use your non-dominant hand to block and swipe at your attacker's block. Keep the hand near eye level so that it draws attention.


Keeping this hand free allows you to defend yourself against your attacker's strikes and also causes your attacker to shift his or her attention away from your dominant hand.

, Swing your dominant arm up along your attacker's center line with your fingers slightly bent, exposing the heel of your palm. The palm should face your attacker's face.


Do not make a fist.
The heel of your hand is located just above the wrist and should be aimed at your attacker's chin.

, Strike just below the chin of your attacker, snapping his or her head back and knocking him out.


Striking the attacker here throws the head back and pinches the nerves at the top of the spinal column, causing the attacker to black out.
Using the palm of your hand gives you a greater surface area to work with in bare-handed fighting. It also protects your fingers, thereby saving your hand and preventing damage to the one ""weapon"" you have access to in the fight.

"
"
Assess the best way to strike depending on your position.,
Strike with the heel of your palm from the front.,
Strike with your elbow if the attacker is behind you.",How to Knock Someone Out3," You can strike the nose of your attacker if he or she is in front of you or behind you, but the movement you use will vary depending on your starting position.If your attacker is in front of you, you will need to move in a forward direction.
If your attacker is behind you, you will need to attack as you turn to face him or her.

, When standing face-to-face with your attacker, open your hand and strike straight forward, hitting the base of the nose and shoving it back.


Throw your weight into the attack in order to apply the most force.
This move causes your attacker's head to snap back, pinching the nerves of the upper spinal column and, if done with enough force, causing the opponent to black out.

, If the attacker is behind you, bend and lift your arm so that your elbow points toward the attacker's face. Rotate your upper body enough to throw your elbow into the side of the attacker's nose.


The center side of the nose, on either side, is another pressure point of the body. If you strike hard enough, you can cause the nose to break and the attacker to fall unconscious.

"
"
Align your side with your attacker's center line.,
Step forward and shift your weight as your attacker approaches.,
Aim your elbow toward the Adam's apple.",How to Knock Someone Out4," This technique works especially well when your attacker comes from the side, but if your attacker is coming from a different angle, you will need to rotate your stance until your shoulder roughly lines up with the vertical center of your attacker's body.


Note that you can use either side of your body for this attack, but you may be able to apply more force if you turn your body so that your dominant side faces your attacker.

, Once your attacker comes toward you, take a step forward with the foot nearest him or her, causing your full body weight to shift forward onto that foot.


You need to step into your assailant's attack, not draw back from it.
This move only works if your attacker is on the offensive and actively coming toward you. It uses to force of the attacker's forward motion to inflict damage.

, Lift your elbow up as you step into your opponent's attack, causing the elbow to meet the inside of the Adam's apple on either side.


If you strike the inside of the Adam's apple from a 45 degree angle, you should be able to cause your attacker to to collapse.
Even if you do not successfully strike the pressure point, the force from the impact of your elbow should be enough to throw your attacker off.

"
"
Begin in a protective stance.,
Analyze your position in relation to the attacker.,
Force your attacker's shoulders down.,
Swiftly bring your knee up as you draw your attacker down.",How to Knock Someone Out5," Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent. Your non-dominant foot should be slightly in front of your dominant foot, and your hands should be up and ready to move.


Standing in this manner keeps your center of gravity at the center of your stance, thereby allowing you to maintain perfect balance.
Note that this move can still be performed even if you are not in a protective, balanced stance, but you will have greater odds of succeeding in a knockout if you start from this stance.

, The attacker should be crouched down and no greater than half a leg's length away.


You can bring your attacker down by delivering a knee to the groin or a sharp kick to the shin.
This move generally works best of your attacker is already doubled-over and off-guard. It works less well if he or she is already facing you and attempting to rise.

, Press down on both of your attacker's shoulders with the heel of your palms.


Throw your entire upper body weight into the gesture so that you can apply maximum force.
Keep your legs in the same stance to maintain your balance as you prepare to deliver the knockout blow.

, While holding your attacker's shoulders down, bring your dominant knee forward so that it strikes your attacker in the nose or chin.


Work quickly. The force of being pushed down will automatically cause the attacker to tighten his or her shoulder muscles, making it harder to keep the attacker down.
Aim for either the nose or the chin to inflict the most damage and cause a black out.

Shadow box.",How to Learn Muay Thai," The fighting stance is crucial to maintain proper balance during Muay Thai, and a good stance will help you protect yourself from blows while delivering the strongest hits you can to your opponent. Flexibility is important in a good fighting stance, so make sure you've properly warmed up before you begin.Spread your feet between hip-width and shoulder-width apart with your knees slightly bent. Keep your more-dextrous/dominant foot slightly behind you so you have more momentum when you kick with that foot.
Tense up your abdominal muscles a little bit (but not too much). You don't want your abs so tense that it inhibits your breathing or movement, but you'll want to have some tension there in case your opponent hits you in the stomach.
Keep your dominant hand's fist guarding your face but poised to strike, and hold your non-dominant hand's fist out slightly ahead of you at about the height of your nose.
Tuck your chin down towards your collarbone and keep it there. This will help protect you somewhat from a broken nose or black eye.
Move around, and try to change up the rhythm/cadence of your movements periodically. The goal is to make sure your opponent can't predict how you'll move next.;
, If you've never had any boxing/fighting experience, you may not know how to properly throw a punch. Good form is necessary, as a sloppy punch could end up hurting you very badly. A well-executed punch should move from the shoulder all the way to the fist as it makes contact.Keep a loose fist, but let your hand and arm slightly relax when you're not yet punching. Try to keep your shoulders loose as well.
When you go in for the strike, tighten up your fist. Make sure your thumb is not wrapped up in your other fingers, or it will likely break when you strike.
Exhale sharply as you initiate a punch and rotate your torso, such that all of your upper body is moving behind your fist.
If you're hitting straight on at your opponent, rotate your fist so that it strikes with your knuckles horizontal in relation to your opponent's body (they should be parallel to the floor). If you're going for a side hook, though, it's okay to keep your knuckles vertical.
Don't overextend your punch, and don't leave yourself open to a counter attack. Withdraw your arm back immediately after you've made contact on the punch to either block an attack or prepare for your next hit.

, Roundhouse kicks are an important part of Muay Thai. The fists, knees, and feet are all utilized during combat, so it's important that you work every relevant muscle group and practice your hits extensively.Shift your weight to the foot that will remain planted on the ground. Step out at a roughly 45-degree angle as you prepare to initiate the kick, and use your more dextrous foot for the actual maneuver.
Turn into your target so that you have more inertia behind your kick.
Angle your shoulder so that it adds additional protection to your face. The last thing you want is for your opponent to get an easy head shot in while you're trying to execute a move.

, Practicing with another person is very different from developing your technique on your own or working on a punching bag. While many students may feel intimidated, though, it's important to remain calm and relaxed. The best way to prepare for a one-on-one sparring match is to focus on the basic moves and remember to keep up your guard against a counter-strike.The best times to hit an opponent are when they're punching at you, when they're not expecting it (by changing up your rhythm, for example), or when you're at an angle that would be difficult for your opponent to block.Remember to use your non-dominant hand to deliver a short, sharp jab. This sets up the bigger punch with your dominant hand, and it can also confuse or intimidate your opponent.
Don't emphasize speed, as a fast punch often lacks the body strength behind it that a slower punch can deliver. Work on your form and on delivering the best, most powerful hits you can.

, There are many techniques within Muay Thai, and mastering them all would take many years. However, even as a beginner you may be able to incorporate some traditional techniques into your training, which you can then develop and build off of.

Kao Dode (Jumping knee strike) - jump up on one leg, then use that leg's knee to strike your opponent with a direct knee hit.
Kao Loi (Jumping/Flying knee strike) - take a step forward, begin jumping off of one leg as though you were going to use the knee or foot of that leg, then switch in mid-air to deliver a knee strike with the other leg.
Kao Tone (Straight knee strike) - hit with the knee straight and upward, ideally in close proximity to your opponent.
Kao Noi (Small knee strike) - when you're grappling with an opponent in close combat, use your knee to strike the upper thigh (but not the groin) of your opponent to wear him or her down. It can also be used to block a kick or knee strike from your opponent.

, In a real combat situation, you'll need to move fast and incorporate a lot of different moves very rapidly. Strength and form should come before speed, but as you advance you can work on becoming a more proficient fighter with faster response times. You should also think of your opponent as a walnut protected by a hard shell. You have to crack through the outside shell (with hits to your opponent's lets and arms) before you can get to the nut (which in this metaphor would mean a direct, close-proximity hit to the head or abdomen).Dodging a hit and counterattacking your opponent works well at the beginning of a match, but it can quickly tire you out.
As you progress through the match, you'll want to spend less time moving around and focus your energy on blocking direct strikes from your opponent, then finding an opening in your opponent's stance.
Keep moving forward as you spar with your opponent. This puts him or her on the defensive, which can also give you more momentum as you prepare to land a direct hit.

, Training on your own is a good start, and sparring with a friend or other workout partner is a good next step. If you're serious about becoming skilled in Muay Thai, though, you may want to work with a trainer who has an extensive background in martial arts. A trainer can help you find your own weaknesses/vulnerabilities, perfect your technique, and take your training to the next level.


You can find Muay Thai trainers and gyms in your area by searching online or by checking a local phone book.
Remember that becoming proficient in Muay Thai takes time, just like any other learned skill. Be patient, and if you decide to work with a trainer, follow his/her training advice on how to improve your stance, technique, and form.

, Stretching is important before engaging in any type of physical activity. Martial arts require limber muscles and joints, as it's very easy to pull or strain a muscle if you're not careful. Spend at least 10 minutes stretching every major muscle group that you'll be using that day before moving on to any other warm up routines.Try a rotating stomach stretch. Lie face-down, keep your hips on the ground, and lift yourself by straightening your arms before rotating one shoulder (then the other) towards the floor.Stretch your hamstrings by planting one foot on the floor and one foot flat on a table or other elevated piece of furniture. Bend your knee and slowly lower your chest to that knee before switching sides.
Another hamstring stretch involves planting your feet shoulder-width apart and bending over towards the floor without bending your knees. Hold the stretch for 10 seconds, and repeat the stretch three to five times to maximize your flexibility.
Stretch your adductor by keeping one foot planted (with toes pointed forward) and bending the other leg (with toes pointed outwards, away from you). Lower your body down and slowly stretch your groin muscles before switching sides.

, Your joints will play a key role in your flexibility during Muay Thai. You'll need to be able to move fluidly, which can be difficult if your joints are stiff or locked up. By warming up your joints, you'll be more flexible and limber during your training sessions and any subsequent sparring matches.

Warm up your knees by squatting down, holding your knee caps, and rotating them in circles. Aim for 20 to 30 rotations, changing direction mid-way through.
Work your ankles by standing on the ball of one foot with your heel elevated and rotating the ankle between 10 to 20 times. Then switch to the other side.
Loosen up your hips by standing shoulder-width apart with your hands on your waist. Twist your hips in one direction 10 times, then switch to the other direction.
Work your neck by moving your chin up and down, then side to side. Move slowly and aim for about 10 to 20 repetitions for each direction.

, Muay Thai and other martial arts require fast, strong movements. One of the best ways to train for Muay Thai, including pre-session warmups, is a good cardio workout regimen. There are many ways to elevate your heart rate and increase your respiration, so try a few different routines and find one that works for you.

Jumping rope is an excellent form of cardio exercise. Aim for two rounds of intense, fast-paced jumping that last about three minutes each (six minutes total).Go for a run or sprint. You can do a longer run (around five kilometers) to burn calories and maximize your workout, or do 5 to 10 rounds of short sprints across 50 to 100 meters.
Try swimming laps if you have access to a pool. Swimming works all the major muscle groups and is an excellent form of cardio exercise.

, Shadow boxing is a great warm-up routine that helps you practice your rhythm/cadence, which you'll need for an actual match.Aim to shadow box for three rounds at three minutes each (for a total of about nine minutes), and if possible try to do it in front of a mirror so you can check your form.Just make sure you have enough room on all sides of you so you don't injure yourself or anyone else.

Start in your fighting stance, with your feet shoulder-width apart and your weight equally balanced across both feet. Stand on the balls of your feet and keep your knees aligned with the direction each foot is pointed.Keep your dominant hand's fist close to your face, level with your jaw or cheekbone, and place your other fist out slightly ahead of you. Keep the elbows bent and just slightly turned outward away from your body.
Practice hopping around front-to-back and side-to-side. Throw punches, elbows, and knee hits, and try to maintain your balance and weight distribution across both feet.

, Stand with your shoulders parallel to your hips and your abdominal muscles slightly tightened. Pretend your opponent is in front of you and position yourself so your non-dominant side is slightly facing them. This both makes you a smaller target and will give your punch more space to create momentum.

, Do not stand with your feet too close together or too far apart. Make sure to put your weight on the balls of your feet but without your heels actually leaving the ground until your punch is thrown.

, Your fist should land at the knuckles of your middle and index finger, which are the strongest and least likely to break. When inexperienced fighters land with their pinky and/or ring fingers, they can cause something called a “boxer’s fracture.” A boxer’s fracture is a break in the bones that connect the ring and pinky fingers to the wrist. , This is called shadow boxing. The advantage of this type of practice is that it can be done anywhere without any equipment. Focus on increasing your speed.

, A punching bag will let you gauge how strong your punches are. You'll also exercise your muscles more with the added resistance. Most gyms have punching bags available. There are also many inexpensive ones on the market if you want to set one up at home.

, This is the first of the two main types of punches that can land a knockout blow. Draw your arm behind you with your elbow bent and then quickly extend your arm directly in front of you. Try to put your whole body into the punch by rolling your hips. Push off your dominant foot slightly onto the ball of your foot, bending at the knee, to increase the force of your punch.

, Twist your body to one side to lower your fist and bend your knees slightly. Punch upward, rotating into your punch to gain momentum.Push upward with your dominant leg so that you end up on the ball of your dominant foot.

, The diaphragm is the sheet of muscle underneath the lungs that controls breathing. To target the diaphragm, aim for the center of your opponent’s abdomen right under their chest. The blow will cause the diaphragm to cramp and will “knock the wind out” of them. Your opponent will be incapacitated for a few minutes and will likely not lose consciousness., This type of blow is also called a “liver punch” or a “liver shot.” A liver punch will cause your opponent and extreme amount of pain and incapacitate them for quite some time. If the punch is severe enough, victims may lose consciousness., The head is the most difficult part of the body to target. Blows to the head are also the most likely to make a person pass out. These blows usually result in a brain injury called concussion, even when they don’t result in the victim losing consciousness.Aim for one of these weak spots:


Jaw: Use an uppercut to connect below the chin. This will cause your opponent’s head to twist quickly, possibly causing a loss in consciousness.Temple: A well-placed blow to the temple can easily cause a person to lose consciousness. Target this area only under extreme circumstances, as punches to the temple can cause severe internal bleeding that may kill its victim.Use a straight punch for this target.
Nose: Compared to other parts of the face, your opponent is less likely to pass out or experience serious injury. However, a nose punch causes an extreme amount of incapacitating pain and temporary vision disturbances., A knockout blow requires force. In order to be able to generate that force, you need to exercise regularly. However, you do not need to generate a massive amount of force to do this.Instead of focusing just on building your muscles, the best way to be ready for a fight is whole-body fitness.

, While you don't need to be massively strong to achieve a knockout punch, you still need to build up your core. You will need strength in your arms, legs, abdomen, shoulders, and back to throw a successful punch. Remember to exercise all of these groups, not just your arms.

, You will need to move fast to pull off a knockout punch. Aerobic exercise at least twice a week is the best way to train your agility. High intensity exercises are ideal and include running, swimming, and biking. "

If you think that you are being followed, occasionally stop as you walk around- maybe to tie a shoelace, look for something in your pocket, or admire something in a store window, etc.,
If there is, continue walking.,
Once that you are certain that you are being followed, make a note of what the person looks like.,
When you are out of sight, quickly change your clothes, or stash accessories in your clothes.,
Speed up.,
Try to shake off the tail.,
If you feel you are REALLY in danger, contact the police or an adult.

",How to Keep From Being Followed1," Casually scan people behind you, possibly on the other side of the road-and make a rough note of anyone within distance, especially things such as height, color of clothes, type of coat, etc.; also look for anyone you recognize from earlier. Stop again after a few hundred meters and take a look around, is anyone there?;
, Use your ingenuity. Stop and look in store windows, or pause to admire a shiny car or van (Choose Dark Colored ones, because you can see the reflection of anyone behind you. Or pull out a comb and peer into the side mirror of a parked car or motorbike, as though about to comb your hair-is there someone that you recognize their reflection?

, At the same time, make a plan for losing him or her.

, If you have a blue cap on, stuff it in your coat pocket; if you have sunglasses on, put them away.

, Do this not by quickening your pace, but by lengthening your strides. If your pace is 1 foot (0.3 m) long, and you lengthen it to 16 inches (40.6 cm), in 100 yards (91.4 m) you will have traveled an extra 33 1⁄3 yards (30.5 m).

, Enter a large shop and immediately leave by another exit; go down a narrow alley and, while out of sight, sprint around a corner and double up your tracks. As a last resort, hide. Wait until you're out of your tail's sight. The moment you are, duck into a deep doorway crouch behind a parked car - in short, anywhere that he or she will hurry past hoping to catch up with you again. Remember, that your tail, in his/her state of mind, will probably miss something right under his/her nose.

Try to figure out if they are actually tailing you.,
If you are being followed, don't try to run away from them, as you will most likely put innocents at risk, and possibly attract other unwanted attention (the police, specifically).,
Hide until you're sure you've lost them, perhaps even hiding your car in one area and heading to another area.",How to Keep From Being Followed2," A good way to do this is to drive in a circle around a city block and seeing if they stay behind you the entire way. If they do, you're being followed.

, Instead, drive like an idiot, randomly signaling for left turns and taking rights and vice versa, perhaps even going straight on occasion. Eventually they'll screw up and be off your tail.

, This will keep them unaware of your location.

Assess your surroundings for threats.,
Be aware of what should be normal in your situation.,
Identify and gauge the danger of elements around you.,
Use your imagination to plan for different situations.,
Don't assume abnormal behavior doesn't pose a threat.,
Don’t get distracted.,
Pay attention to time.,
Fight against complacency.,
Don’t let fatigue set in.,
Use your peripheral vision to identify threats.,
Try to predict upcoming events around you.,
Trust your gut feelings.,
Position yourself to easily identify threats.,
Immediately identify dangerous factors of those who enter your personal space.",How to Increase Your Situational Awareness," The first step to increasing your situational awareness is to assess your surroundings in full. Look around you and take account of the type of situation you are in. Different environments will require different levels of focus to maintain high situational awareness.A city environment presents very different dangers and distractions than a rural one.
By identifying the type of environment you are in, you can better prepare yourself to keep a look out for possible risks.;
, The environmental baseline is what you’ve experienced in similar environments and situations. Determine what should be considered normal sounds, behaviors and sights in your current situation so you have a frame of reference to compare unusual behavior to.The environmental baseline in a wooded area is often fairly quiet and usually interrupted only by the sounds of insects, birds, and the wind passing through the trees. It also may be dimly lit and is often sparsely populated by other people.
The environmental baseline on a busy city street would include the sounds and sights of multiple vehicles and crowds of people talking at a normal volume for the level of ambient noise.
Environmental baselines are based on your experiences. Establishing them requires you to consciously consider environments you are familiar with so as to be able to distinguish situations or behaviors that are abnormal.

, Once you have established what you feel the environmental baseline of your surrounding area is, look around to identify and consider any possible sources of dangerous situations.Look for people that are behaving in a manner that is outside the norm, based on your past experiences and by comparison to those around them.
Identify individuals that may be armed with weapons of opportunity, which are things that may not be considered a weapon, but could do serious harm to you or those around you. Common examples could be baseball bats or chains.
Look for weapon imprints on people’s clothing. When one carries a concealed weapon, it often leaves what is commonly referred to as an “imprint” or outline of parts of the weapon in the clothes. Look near the waist band of suspicious individuals to try to determine if they are carrying a concealed weapon.
Look for bags, suitcases or similar things that shouldn’t be left alone in crowded areas but have been. Leaving unattended bags in public places is a common delivery method for explosives.

, While it’s not always good to let your imagination run wild about possibly dangerous situations, you can use it to establish scenarios in your mind and plan for ways to address them.If you notice a group of suspicious individuals heading in your direction, think about what you might do if they attempted to attack you or those around you.
Look for ways out of your current environment if you needed to leave quickly.
Imagine someone drawing a weapon or attacking you in your current situation. What can you do now to make it less likely? What will you do if it happens anyway?

, Because most people live fairly safe lives, we tend to believe things are going to work out. People often wait to respond to abnormal behavior because they are unwilling to recognize it as a threat. ""Normalcy Bias"" is the act of ignoring prospective threats because it seems unlikely that a dangerous situation might occur..Take indications of danger seriously. Don’t tell yourself that what you are seeing “must be normal.”
Approach each situation as though it could become dangerous. This will help you overcome the normalcy bias.

, When you focus on one thing so hard that you are too distracted to identify potential threats around you, that is referred to as “focus lock.” Focus lock is a perfectly normal thing to do, but it can significantly hinder or reduce your situational awareness.A common example of focus lock causing a dangerous situation is looking at your phone instead of the road while driving.
On a hiking trail, you may be so distracted by the sights and sounds ahead of you that you don’t notice a snake near your feet in the brush.
When you catch yourself experiencing focus lock, draw your attention back to your environment and any potential threats around you.

, The passage of time is an important part of situational awareness. Keeping track of the time can help you identify trends in people’s behavior that may not otherwise have seemed unusual to you. It also can help you to prevent fatigue by knowing how long it’s been since you last ate or rested.If you notice someone walking laps around an area at regular intervals, they may be waiting for something to happen. There’s nothing inherently dangerous about that, but it’s an element that noticing could help you avoid dangerous situations.
Keep track of how long it has been since you last saw the people you are with. Waiting for your child outside of a public bathroom, for instance, is a situation where you may want to keep track of how long it’s been since you’ve seen them.

, In the military, a common phrase used in training is “complacency kills.” Complacency occurs when you become so comfortable in your current situation that you no longer work to actively identify possible threats around you.If you feel your mind wandering or catch yourself experiencing focus lock, bring your attention back to the present moment and the situation at hand.
Remind yourself that dangerous scenarios can occur anywhere, including environments that you feel very comfortable in like your home or a restaurant you go to often.

, Fatigue makes it extremely difficult to remain attentive and focused. When you’re hungry, dehydrated or tired you grow distracted. Reduced blood sugar levels caused by prolonged periods of not eating can make you just as groggy as a lack of sleep.Take good care of yourself by getting enough sleep and eating well and often.
Notice the signs of fatigue as they set in: you may find it harder to pay attention to things, notice your temper is shorter, or your vision may blur slightly.

, Sometimes you may draw unwanted attention by looking directly at a possible threat. In some extreme cases, a possible threat may become a real one if they interpret your looking at them as engaging them in some way. Because of this, practice looking at things from the sides of your vision.Some individuals may approach you or even become hostile if they notice you looking directly at them.
Using your peripheral vision means any dangerous individuals in your vicinity won’t know exactly what you’re looking at, allowing you a slight tactical advantage.

, By establishing a situational baseline, you create an idea in your head of what normal should look, sound, and smell like where you are. Use that baseline to predict events that will occur around you so they don’t take you by surprise.If you see a truck pull into a parking lot near you, you can predict that you may hear the sounds of its doors opening and closing or the beeping of its backup alarm.
If you are driving behind a school bus, you can predict that it may stop to let children off in front of you at some point.
If you notice people behaving in an aggressive manner toward one another, you may predict that they could fight, which may be a sign that you should exit the area.

, Sometimes you’ve identified the situational baseline in your mind, assessed any possible threats around you, have a strategy to get away from anything that may happen, but you still can’t shake a sense that something’s wrong. Trust that feeling.You may be unaware of how your body is interpreting stimuli surrounding you, but humans have evolved to sense danger. If you feel uneasy, but don’t have objective reason to, trust that feeling.
In a classic case of “it’s better to be safe than sorry,” trusting your gut about a situation and leaving may prove to have been unnecessary, but it’s better to be wrong about it a hundred times than to have been right once without acting.

, Where you stand can be extremely important to your ability to maintain situational awareness. If you are in a crowded environment with too many people to keep track of, for instance, you may want to position yourself with your back to a wall so you can see anyone approaching you as they come.Different situations may require different positioning, but always try to put yourself in a place where you would be able to identify any possible threats as they approach.
Positioning yourself near exits may make it easier for you to quickly escape a situation as it occurs.

, In crowded city streets, it will likely be more common for people to come into your personal space that it might be in a grocery store or at a park. Personal space is commonly considered to be a circle around you at arm’s length. If anyone comes into that area (close enough to make contact with you) quickly identify any possible threat they may pose.Look for signs of a weapon either in their hands or on their body if you can see one.
Look at their face to see if they are focused on you or if they are simply passing by.
Notice where their hands are and what they are doing with them. If they are going to attack you, their hands will likely be balled into fists or possibly could be carrying a weapon.

Keep important supplies in your safe room.",How to Hide from a Murderer," In order to prevent the murderer from finding you, barricade the main entry to your hiding area as best as you can. Ideally, there should be a sturdy lock on the inside of the door, and the door should open out so the murderer can't kick it down. You may also want to barricade the door with additional obstacles, like heavy pieces of furniture.If your door swings in, it's especially important to barricade it with heavy objects, as the murderer may be able to kick it in.
While it's good to be able to keep the murderer out, it's also important to think about how you will escape if the murderer does manage to get in. A hiding spot with two exits (like a door and a window) is ideal.If you're outside, you may not be able to barricade yourself, but you should still look for a secluded location that you will easily be able to escape from if necessary.;
, Once you find a hiding spot, you need to do whatever you can to make sure that the murderer does not locate you, which means staying as quiet as possible. If you are with other people, avoid talking to each other. You should also make sure your cell phone is silenced.The murderer may still be able to hear your phone if it is on vibrate!Resist the urge to yell to the murderer that you have contacted the police.

, Make it more difficult for the murderer to see the area you are hiding in by turning off all of the lights and closing all of the windows and blinds. Make the area look as unoccupied as possible.You should also turn off any other sources of light, such as computer monitors.
While calling for help should be your priority, beware of the light from your cell phone. If the murderer is right outside your door, he may be able to see it.

, If you are hiding with other people, spread out as much as you can in your hiding spot. This will increase each individual's chances of survival if the murderer gets into your hiding spot.Make sure everyone stays away from windows, as these are often the most vulnerable part of the room.

, If you want a great hiding spot within your barricaded room, find a piece of furniture or a similar item that you can use to hide in. The less obvious the hiding spot, the better.


You may want to hide behind the (floor-length) curtains, behind a desk, or behind the clothes in a closet
You could try hiding under the bed, under a pile of laundry, or under a blanket.
You could also consider hiding inside a cupboard, in the washing machine, or inside a large box.
If you are outside, you may want to hide behind a bush, under a car, in a trash can, or under a porch.

, If you are not able to run away or find a place to hide, playing dead may be an option. This will only work if the murderer has already killed a lot of victims. Simply lie down among the victims and hope that the murderer doesn't realize that he hasn't killed you.Lying face down or in an obscured location may help, as the murderer will not be able to see if you move a little bit.

, As soon as it is safe to do so, call 911 for help. If you have a cell phone with you, you might be able to do this while you are hiding, as long as you don't think that making a call will give away your location to the murderer. Stay on the line with the operator until the police get there.The operator will want to know as many details about the situation as possible, such as your location, the number of victims, and what kinds of weapons the murderer has.
When the police get there, follow their instructions and keep your hands visible at all times so that they know you are not a threat.
If calling the police is too loud, text someone who is not at the location about your situation and ask them to call the police for you. Consider texting this to several people, just in case someone doesn't see the text.
In some areas, it's also possible to text 9-1-1.

, If it's possible to get out of the building or the immediate area that the murderer is in, this is always preferable to hiding. Assess your location and decide if you would be able to escape to safety.If others don't want to run with you, leave them behind. You can't let them prevent you from escaping.
If you run, don't worry about your belongings. Leave your stuff behind.
Be sure to keep your hands visible as you flee the scene. If the police are there already, they may mistake you for the murderer.
Run in an erratic pattern. This will make it harder for the murderer to shoot you if he comes after you.
Try to put as many obstacles between you and the murder as possible.

, If you choose to run, it's important to head for a location that will be safer than the location you just left, just in case the murderer pursues you. While you may just want to get out of there, don't leave without some kind of an idea of where you will go.


If possible, get to a location where you can call for help. A secure location like a police station is the best option, but a neighbor's house is better than nothing.
Try to avoid running into your neighbor's house if the murderer is watching you. You don't want to put them in danger as well by leading a murderer into their house.
If there is nothing around the area, head for the woods instead of a clearing. This will give you many more places to hide. A full parking lot will also provide lots of good hiding opportunities.

, In some cases, you may have no choice but to fight back against the murderer. This is generally not a good idea unless your life is in immediate danger, but if it comes to it, do what you need to do to survive.If you decide to fight, you need to commit to it. A half-hearted attempt at fighting back will only put you in more danger.
Your goal should be to disarm and/or incapacitate the murderer, and then run away as fast as possible.
If you have a gun, you may want to use this to defend yourself. If not, you may also be able to incapacitate the murderer using pepper spray.If you have no other option but to attack the murderer with your bare hands, aim for the most vulnerable parts of the body: the throat, the eyes, the groin, and the stomach., If you choose to fight back and you do not have a traditional weapon, look around for ordinary objects that you might be able to use to disarm the murderer or incapacitate him. A good weapon should be easy to use and should be reasonably likely to inflict harm.You can use a backpack as a shield or to swing at the murderer.
You can use an item like a baseball bat, and umbrella, or a large flashlight as a swinging weapon.
Any heavy item can be used to knock the murderer unconscious.
a chemical fire extinguisher can effectively disable a person if you spray it in his face., If the murderer finds you and it is not possible to escape or fight back (If he has a gun and you only have a baseball bat, for example), it is important to know how to interact with him in order to increase your chances of survival. If the person's primary objective is to steal things or commit another crime, he may not really want to kill you if it's not necessary.Be as cooperative as you possibly can be. Do what the murderer asks you to do without asking questions.
Avoid making eye contact, as this can be seen as threatening.
Don't make any sudden movements that the murderer might interpret as you trying to fight.
Always be on the lookout for opportunities to run or incapacitate the murderer.

, While there's not much you can do as an individual to make public places safer, you can work to make your house more impenetrable to intruders. These measures can help prevent the need to ever have to hide from a murderer in your home.Make sure your doors and your door jambs are made of sturdy steel.
If you have glass inserts in or around any of your doors, make sure they cannot be broken.
Keep windows closed and locked at night and when you are not in the room.
Make sure your home is well-lit at night to deter intruders.

, Alarm systems can provide excellent security and peace of mind for people at home. They can automatically call for help if someone breaks into your home, and they often scare intruders off.Some alarm systems have panic modes that you can use to make the intruder think you have turned the system off, but secretly contact the police.
Ask the company that provides your monitoring services how you can alert them to dangers if there is an intruder in the home. In some cases, you may provide them with a panic word, and in others, simply providing the incorrect password will trigger a response.
You may want to invest in security cameras as well.
Whether you have an alarm system or not, put up stickers that say you do. This often deters criminals just as much as an actual alarm.

, It's a good idea to have a designated safe room in your house and to make sure that the entire family knows that this is where you will hide in the case of an emergency.The safe room should have a sturdy door and a strong lock on the inside. You can have a special steel security door installed for extra protection.
Make sure the room is somewhere that will be accessible to your family and far from the areas where an intruder is most likely to enter your home. A closet or bathroom near the bedrooms is a good choice.

, In addition to designating a specific room in your house as your safe room and making sure that the area is secure, it's also a good idea to stock the area with the supplies you will need in the event that a murderer does break into your house.It's a good idea to charge your phone in this room every night so that you will always be able to call for help if you have to hide there.
If you have weapons, you may want to keep these in the room as well. If you don't have guns at your home, keep some improvised weapons in this location

Use fake facial hair.",How to Hide in Plain Sight," Everyone has at least one physical apart that sets him apart from the rest of the crowd. A particularly distinctive facial feature, tattoo, birthmark or scar will all attract attention for the fact that they make you unique. Recognize these traits in yourself, and find ways of covering them up from view.


For instance, if you have a striking set of eyes, donning sunglasses will remove this feature from view.
If you have tattoos on your arms, wearing a long sleeved shirt will cover them up.
If you have a distinctive facial structure, you can even out your features by growing facial hair.;
, For most casual situations, it's a good idea to dress as you think a completely average person would. Avoid clothing that has distinctive logos or graphic designs on it.


Your dress should ultimately be dictated by the setting. If you are at a formal event, for example, dressing yourself down will only bring negative attention your way.
It helps to know what other people will interpret as being ""normal"".
Although bargain bin clothing is often a good choice for hiding in plain sight, there's sometimes the risk of those old clothes becoming fashionable again., While the use of camouflage is only helpful when you're trying to hide from a distance, it's the best-known way of truly hiding in plain sight.


Wearing camouflage gear in a public setting will attract a lot of unwanted attention to you. Special camouflage clothes are only recommended in instances where you have a chance at being completely hidden, and not just inconspicuous.

, If you want to avoid attention, it's a good idea to avoid these little add-ons completely. If you're in close proximity with people, wearing a watch or necklace will make you more interesting to look at, however watches are not that conspicuous.

, If you want to hide in plain sight, keep your hairstyle plain and vague. Avoid anything aesthetic like hair gels or dye. Just make sure your hair is relatively clean.


If you usually gel your hair, go without it when you don't want to attract notice. If your hair is completely natural, there won't be as much that stands out.
If you have distinctive hair and don't want to lose it for the sake of hiding, wearing a hood or hat will cover it up for you.
An uncommon hair color(usually light-colored) or texture(i.e. big hair) relative to the crowd can be a dead giveaway, so if you have either, cover it up under a hat or something

, This is especially true if you are breaking laws. On top of risking criminal charges, you'll draw all sorts of eyes in your direction. While this applies to obvious felonies such as assault, it also encompasses things you may do innocently, such as jaywalking, or treading upon park grass. Try to keep in mind what the lawful, orderly thing to do would be in every situation you're trying to hide in.

, Even if you're trying to be inconspicuous to everyone, it helps a lot to know where people are looking, and what they're occupied with. By keeping a healthy sense of situational awareness about you, you'll be able to avoid areas where people are more aware.

, If there's ever a point where you're not sure about what to do, look at the people around you for an example. Is there a common mood around? Are the people around you walking fast or slow? All of these details can be used to help you blend in.

, Try to avoid the fringes and the very center. Being halfway in radius to the center is least conspicuous., Although silence isn't always possible in some situations, it is a major part of keeping a low profile. For however long you're trying to hide, avoid unnecessary conversations and interactions with others. Make as little sound as you can, even if you're in a relatively busy environment. Even something as innocuous as a cough or sneeze can draw attention to you if left unchecked.


When you have to use your voice, make an effort to be only half as loud as normal. This quietness should still make it capable to communicate when you need to, but you won't attract attention of anyone you don't need to., If this happens to you, you should make an effort to be pleasant and agreeable, without necessarily trying to advance the conversation anywhere. Smile, nod, and agree with what's being said. If you're asked questions about yourself, keep your answers short and to the point. It is not recommended that you try to ignore or stay silent, as this will only bring unwanted attention your way.


The word ""Yes"" will be your best friend if you're trying to go unnoticed in a conversation.It can be applied as a response to questions and answers alike.

, If this is the case, it's important to keep your movements casual. Someone who is walking faster than usual will give off anxious signals to anyone watching. Be conscious of the pace and style you're moving in. Your movements should remain fluid, without coming across as hurried or nervous.


If you have time to prepare in advance, it often helps to practice in front of a mirror. That way, you'll have a better idea of the ways in which others will perceive you.

, Avert your gaze from others around you. A good trick is to keep your eyes fixed on the ground ten metres ahead of you. Although you should keep your head down, you don't want to make it look obvious that you're intentionally avoiding eye contact.


Keep in mind that there is a difference between casually avoiding eye contact, and looking like you're deliberately averting someone's gaze.You'll inadvertently attract more attention to yourself if someone gets the impression that you're trying to go undetected.

, If you're hiding in a populated environment, don't be afraid to use other people as a tool. Placing yourself in the middle of a crowd will make it more difficult to spot you. Avoid going to the front, side or back of a crowd, as these are usually the places people check first when they're looking for someone.


Avoid walking in less crowded places. People to tend to notice each other more when there aren't many people to look at.

, If you want to disguise yourself and blend in, it's a good idea to choose a hair colour that seems natural and common. Shades of black and brown are good choices in this regard.

, Accessories like hats and sunglasses work well to obscure someone's regular appearance. Sunglasses and a hat by themselves are a great casual disguise.Other accessories like jewellery and bowties won't necessarily obscure your appearance, but they'll add a different tone to your look that others may not be used to seeing from you.


If you are known to dress conservatively, putting on a bunch of jewellery or flashy colours will disguise your typical identity, even if the get-up draws attention to you otherwise.

, You can add years to your appearance by using makeup. Squint and bit, and lightly pencil in the creases caused by your squint.It's important to keep these cosmetic changes subtle. Otherwise, it will be easy to pick up on the fact that it's a disguise.


If you are elderly, smooth out your facial creases with skin foundation. Dying your hair to mask the grey or white will also help disguise your identity.

, However, you can tell a fair amount about a person's character and mood by their gait. Switch your walking style to suit the disguise. If you're trying to look older, for example, you should walk slower than you normally would.


Walk for a bit in your typical manner, and identify your walking personality. If you're typically a fast walker, for instance, you can disguise your identity by walking slowly. Likewise, you should speed up your gait if you're a more leisurely walker.

, If you are in an area with video surveillance, you may want to take measures to change the appearance of your facial structure. Puff out your cheeks and stuff your nostrils with toilet paper to change the shape of your face.This can help you escape any facial recognition technology that may be used to track you down.


Doing things like puffing your cheeks and filling your nostrils will help disguise your identity, but you may end up drawing more attention to yourself.

, Using a fake moustache is arguably the most common and famous type of disguise around. You can buy some facial hair from a costume store. Apply some spirit gum (a substance used to affix fake facial hair to actors, not SPENT gum, like chewing gum) to the area you want to have bearded, then set the disguise on your face and allow it some time to settle.


If you need to disguise yourself quickly and are known for your facial hair, quickly shaving it off will transform your appearance.
This can possibly work even if you're a female.

, If he falls, seize the chance to keep him there until he surrenders or becomes too weak to continue fighting. Hold him down for as long as you can. Hit him if necessary to keep him down.

, Although this may seem to be ineffective, it wears your opponent down. This gives you the chance to run or even fight back. Don't hesitate to frequently block or use this method the entire time.

, Opening your mouth will provide an open area for a punch to the jaw. This could result in a knockout or even a broken jaw. Ignore your enemy's taunts, and seize the chance to strike his jaw if he continues talking.

, If you're a female, tugging at your enemy's hair will give you the appearance of a sissy unless she does it first. However, do not hesitate to use this method if it gives you an advantage.

, Although it is underestimated, it is an excellent move to win fights. Do not hesitate to use your feet if the chance arises. However, beware of your enemy attempting to grab your leg or foot.

, Understand that your focus is to escape, not necessarily win the fight. The chances of beating a large group without help is low. Avoid showing your opponents that you are angry. When you fight, use your anger as energy against your enemies.


Do not hesitate to call for help if the need arises. Although your reputation as a tough person may fall, bringing harm to your social status is better than losing your life.
Beware of pride. You may convince yourself that you can fight a large group, but be realistic.

, Punch him in the side of his head. You could also push his head down and find enough strength and stability to swing him to the ground.

, Once he falls to the ground, pin him down until he surrenders. Allowing him to get up without surrendering may result in him throwing punches.

, Block your opponent's punches as best as you can. If his punches are weak enough for you to handle, attempt to hit him back.

Watch out for bigger opponents.,
Beware if your opponent threatens your life or attempts to choke you.,
Escape if you're outnumbered.",How to Win Fights at School3," Use his size against him. Attack his pressure points or groin. Aim the toe of your shoe for the area between the navel and groin. There lies a circular area of pressure points that will disable your opponent.

, Come back at him with all your strength. Keep your attacks to elbowing, kicking, or hitting pressure points and soft areas. Continue until your opponent is weakened enough for you to escape. Realize that you have a right to defend yourself if your life has been threatened. Go to the authorities as soon as possible.

, Run as fast as you can to a crowded area or even the main office. Although you may be tempted to fight multiple opponents for the glory, understand that you must be realistic. One person against a large group of enemies cannot win without severely hurting or killing himself.

Distance yourself from opponent's strikes, but make sure you are able to land strikes. This is an advantage for those with long arms.;
,, Let your eyes and strikes synchronize: your punches should land where your eyes do.

, When your opponent has tripped or fallen, use your shin bone across their throat. It's like hitting on their chest but using your shin to strangle them.

, Now, you can now cut off the right side. Do it sideways so you can hunch over to avoid being removed from legs trying to hook you off. There you have it. Aim for the side of the rib cage and the middle part of the body, it really hurts!

, You know you can't take a stomach shot or a nose shot. Don't be afraid to get hit in other parts of the body to substitute the vital areas. If the enemy throws, kick to the stomach, turn around to take them to the back, or the side of the abyss if you truly can't evade the kicks.

, Every time you move out of the opponent's strike zone, move right back in and strike once the immediate danger has passed, much like a wave as it crashes into the bank.

Have your friends and family read the finished result.",How to Write a Novel As a Kid," This is the most important action in writing a novel. If you don't have an interesting plot, then the whole story will fall apart. No one likes a story without any structure.


Be inspired by the things in your everyday life. This can be interactions with others, movies you've watched, stories you've listened to within your family, books you've read, things you see when people watching, your imagination, etc.
What do you want to write about? There are so many possibilities, including fantasy, relationships, school, exploration, personal journeys of discovery, mystery, detective work, treasure hunts, rockstar/movie fame, rich kids and poor kids, family issues, adventure, action, etc.;
, Compare ""Once upon a time..."" to ""Michael's sports car whizzed around the corner. Paulo and him were neck and neck. Who would win? It was uncertain; Paulo had trained for years, yet Michael had talent. "" Which opening was more interesting to you? Chances are, you chose the second one. It was descriptive, it set up a tension from the start and it begged you to read on and learn more.

, Keep up the level of interest throughout the story by doling out new twists, ideas, information, etc. as the novel proceeds. A good way to do this is to end chapters with a cliffhanger or a moral dilemma. 

, If you lost a loved one, write about that. If you're crushing hard, write about that.


Use thoughts and feelings: Your characters have feelings too. Try to think how you would react to being in that situation and express this through your writing.

, If it is a sad book, add enough detail to bring the reader to tears. Details attract readers to your book and keep them riveted.


Develop good, in-depth characters. Make sure to include flaws; no single person is perfect or all-good, even if they kid themselves that they're perfect. Readers will be turned off by a totally perfect character.

, How is it flowing? Does the flow seem natural or do the chapters or sections seem a little jilted? Flow is important so that the reader doesn't feel that things have come at them from left field or that there is no connection between the chapters.


Avoid using vocabulary that you're not familiar with; there can be a pressure to make it work too hard and sound out of place.

, Step away from the advice here and just get on with it. Don't rely on tutorials and other people to write the book for you, let your imagination flow through the book and watch as a simple idea becomes an entire novel, all of your own doing.

, Take constructive suggestions on board where you think they will improve the book. Print the book out, bind it and place it on the bookshelf as a family treasure. If it's really good, you might even consider getting it published, either through a publisher or by vanity publishing, but that's a whole other tale.

Remember the phrase: ""TANSTAAFF"".,
Remember, when attacked by multiple assailants who want nothing more than to hurt you, ANYTHING goes.

,
Create a solid base.,
Work your defense.,
If they are coming at you, however, do not wait to defend.,
When punching, hit with the heel of your palm, not your fist.,
To put power behind your punches, swing your hips into the punch.,
Never take the fight to the ground when multiple assailants are involved.,

If you are being confronted by multiple opponents, and they want to hurt you, here is a list of techniques outlawed in rings that are perfectly acceptable in a confrontation such as this.


Headbutts
Gouging
Biting
Hair pulling
Groin-kicking/punching/grabbing-and-pulling
Stomping the knees
Stomping the instep
Punching the kidneys
Punching the neck
Kicking a downed opponent
Small-joint manipulation;
,,

Spread your weight evenly between your feet, and stay on the balls of your feet.






Move your off-foot forward(if you're right handed, the left foot goes in front) by about six-twelve inches.
Bend your knees so they are at an angle in between 170-160 degrees, more if you train that way or feel more comfortable that way.






Keep your hands up at a level a fraction of an inch lower than your eyes, elbows tucked in slightly. An alternative guard is this:






Put your strong hand beside your chin, with your elbow tucked in, so your forearm points straight up. Put your other hand out about a foot or so in front of the other hand, the forearm at a slightly steeper angle than your strong hand.







, For purposes of this article, it is assumed you are using the first guard.


If your opponents are unarmed, deflect punches with your elbows. Twist your torso while keeping your guard tight, and your elbows will swing into any incoming strike. An adjustment of height will be required for other blocks.






If your opponents are armed, wait until they swing. While preparing, unclench your fists. If they swing or slash, make your arms into the shape of a triangle, and change forward. One elbow should make contact with the arm that has the weapon, the other elbow with their neck. From here, knee them in the groin, stomp their knee, or swing a hard back elbow into their jaw.






To block kicks at below your waist, pick up your shin and swing it into the oncoming kick. This will hurt, but it's better than getting kicked in the knee.

, Rush forward and attack. Shout or scream, forcing your breath out of your lungs by clenching your abs. A loud battle cry can shock your opponent for just long enough to land a groin-kick, knee, or elbow.

, The knuckles are far easier to injure than the heel of the palm, unless you've been training for multiple years with bare-knuckle board breaks, Muay Thai bags, etc.

, Throw the strike in as straight a line as possible. There are many ideal targets.


Jaw/ chin
Neck
Solar plexus(right below the sternum)
Groin
Inside of the arm, in between the bicep and tricep
Floating ribs
Kidneys
Knee
Instep

, If you get tangled into a grappling match, your opponent's friends can easily stomp your head and kill you. If you knock someone down while there are multiple opponents, don't follow them, but use your feet to finish them. Don't stomp their head, because that will kill them, but anything else goes. The stomach, the groin, arm, etc.

, Don't try to finish them all off if an opportunity to escape presents itself.

Send your work to a children’s magazine.",How to Write a Book As a Kid," No matter how old you are, if you want to be a great writer, you must be a great reader, too! Read as often and as much as you can. If you aren’t sure what books to read, don’t be afraid to ask your teacher or school librarian for some suggestions.


Reading is a great way to get a better idea of what sort of writing you actually enjoy reading. When you read new books and find one you really like, take a moment to think about why you like it. What is so great about the story? Does it have really fantastic characters, or setting? Use the things you like in books you read as examples of how to write those things yourself.Just like doctors must learn from other doctors, writers must learn from other writers. You might like a specific kind of book, but try to read lots of different kinds of books to learn things from different kinds of writers.;
, It might not seem like anything exciting or interesting happens in your life, but you can still use it as a place to begin your own stories. It can be as easy as taking something that might seem plain or simple, and changing it into something interesting and new.For example, if you wanted to write a story about a superhero, use the backdrop of your every day life to form your new character. Maybe your superhero is a kid just like you, and one day at school, discovers his powers.
You can also use settings and locations you are familiar with in real life and write a fictional story set in these places. For example, maybe there’s a creepy old house somewhere in your neighborhood. You could write a story about someone who goes into the creepy old house to investigate, and finds something they didn’t expect.

, Ask your mom, dad, grandma, or grandpa to tell you stories about their lives. Learn new things about what life was like when they were kids, and learn about people in your family you don’t know very well, or at all.


If you are writing fiction (a story that isn’t real or true), you can use stories from your family’s history as a starting point, but change names, places, and details to fit your ideas.If you are writing nonfiction (a story that is true), make sure your family knows you are writing about them, and that they feel comfortable sharing their stories and histories for you to write about.

, Maybe you studied something in school that really caught your interest, like a historical event, or an interesting person. Use the things you like and are interested in to find ideas for your stories.


Your hobbies count here, too. For example, if you really like horseback riding, maybe you could write a story about a character who also rides horses. Or, if you like soccer, maybe your main character could be a famous athlete.
Think of your interests and hobbies, and then do some research on these things for even more inspiration. Use your school’s library, or ask your parents permission to do an internet search on the subject.

, An outline is a tool for organizing your ideas into chronological order. By making an outline, you will be able to write your book without forgetting any ideas you had for the plot. You will also be able to have a clear idea of what will happen in your book before you write it.


You can format your outline however you want. Traditionally, you start each section with a shorthand header, and then use bullet points below that header to briefly map out what will happen in that section.
You can also write separate outlines for different parts of your book. For example, you might have one outline that explains the plot, and have another outline that organizes all the information and ideas you have for your main characters, or even your setting., Once you have your outline written, it should be easier to start writing your actual book. This will just involve taking your shorthand ideas on your outline and expanding them into full chapters and scenes.


You can try using what is called “The Snowflake Method” which means you start with one sentence—maybe the first sentence of your book, or just of a certain chapter—then work to expand that into a full paragraph, and so on, until you have a large chunk of text.The great thing about having an outline prepared is that you can make changes to it as you write and not end up confused or disorganized. So, as you expand your outline into your book, keep tracking your changes on that outline to keep yourself organized.

, A very important part of writing a good book is making sure you have a lot of action and dialogue between your characters. A great place to look for an example of good scenes and dialogue is in your favorite books.Try not to be too formal with your dialogue. Think about who your characters are—are they kids like you? Grown ups? If they’re kids, think about how you and your friends talk. Think about how your conversations sound. Try to write dialogue that sounds like a real conversation.
Use action in your scenes. Give your characters something to do. After your main character tells his mom he’s a superhero, does his mom scream? Does she jump around the room in excitement? Let your characters react physically, as well as through words.

, When writing your book, you want to try and avoid telling your readers outright every detail of the story. For example, rather than telling the reader that your characters are in a forest, take some time to describe the setting in detail, and let the reader see those characters in a forest.Be very descriptive. Rather than writing something that is flat or too simple, try going into detail about the scenes you’re writing. Describe the setting. Describe the way your character looks. Describe the weather, or even the tone of someone’s voice when they speak.
When writing descriptions, think about your five senses: taste, sight, smell, sound, and touch. What is your character tasting? What does the setting smell and sound like? What can your character feel or see? Use these senses to write interesting, effective descriptions., After you’ve written your whole first draft, you will still have a lot of work to do. Start by reading over the whole thing. Read very carefully, and use a highlighter to make a note of anything you want to fix or change.


Many writers suggest that printing out your work is the best way to edit. So, if you typed your book or story on a computer, print it out and use the paper copy to make your edits.Reading your writing out loud will help you notice mistakes you might not see when you read it silently in your head. This is because you will be forcing yourself to read every sentence very carefully.
Mark any mistakes in spelling and punctuation, and mark any problems you notice with sentences that might not sound right, or places you want to change or fix.
Make sure your writing is consistent, meaning it stays the same throughout. For example, if you start writing in past tense (“He was”) and then moved to writing in present tense (“He is”), you will want to edit this to stick to one tense throughout.

, After you’ve gone through once and marked mistakes, fix and change everything you marked in your first draft. Then, go through a second time. Try to wait a few days between each draft to give yourself a set of new eyes the second time through.Try focusing on different parts of your book each time you edit. For example, maybe the first edit you focus on the dialogue, while the second edit focuses more on the description or plot.

, You can choose to do them yourself, or even ask a friend to help! Some authors have illustrations throughout their book, while others have small drawings at the start of each chapter. You can decide to have some illustrations, or none at all.


If you ask a friend for help in drawing your illustrations, make sure you give your friend credit on the title page!
Try using different mediums when making your illustrations, should you choose to have them. For example, try drawing some by hand, and then see if creating them on a computer is better.

, There are a lot of different ways to publish your book online and then share it with your friends and family. Scribblitt is a tool for kids that allows you to write, illustrate, and design books, as well as have them printed and mailed to you. Some features of this website do cost money, though, so make sure you talk this over with your parents.You can also publish your story online and let an online community read and enjoy it. KidPub is a by kids, for kids forum where kids can post their stories and chapter books for each other to read and enjoy., Using a service like Scribblitt or LuLu.com, you can have your book professionally bound and printed, for a fee. LuLu will even let you sell copies of your book online. You will need a parent or guardian’s permission and help to access and use these services.


Keep in mind that any online services might require you to be a certain age to use their services. That’s why it’s important for you to have your parents’ help when using these websites and printing your book.

, There are magazines that specifically publish work by kids, so try sending your story to one of these magazines! Every big author had to start somewhere, and getting your story published in a magazine is a great place to begin.


Stone Soup is a popular magazine that publishes work by kids, for kids. To get an idea of what kind of stories they like, and for more information on how to submit work to them, pick up a copy from your library, or order a copy from their website. You must be 13 years old or younger to submit work to Stone Soup.NewPages.com is a website that helps writers find places to send their work for publication.

Work out.",How to Win a Fight Against a Bully1," Wrestling is great for fighting. It is probably the best way to fight in real life because you can avoid punching and kicking. Both of these things can lead to fractures, breaks, blood, and a lot of pain for both you and your bully opponent. If you know how to wrestle, you can just get in close to the guy, lock him up, take him to the ground, and then put him in a hold. There are some holds that can be pretty painful and uncomfortable for your opponent. They will be forced to submit. It will be very embarrassing for them and you won’t have harmed them very badly. Learning to wrestle is highly recommended. Wrestling is all about body weight, so you can beat someone significantly larger than you if you have the technique.;
, Playing basketball might even help you win a fight. The stance that you use to defend someone in basketball is similar to the athletic stance that you want to adopt in a fight. , There are plenty of self-defense classes available that will teach you how defend yourself and get out of the situation. You can even take a short course over the weekend that will teach you basic moves and strategies.


If you would prefer, you can take an offensive martial arts class like karate.

, Being physically fit is a great way to prevent fights and will help you when you are in one. You don’t need to be covered head to toe in muscle - just work on having more endurance and getting stronger.

Consider what you're going to write the play about.,
Talk to children you know.",How to Write a Children's Themed Screenplay1," Obviously, it must be suitable for children and must draw in their interest, curiosity and be entertaining. Some great themes for children include:


Fairy tales with twists – most children know the real fairy tale and it's old news; however, when it has a twist, a change of plot or a hilarious and realistic overlay, it can be a lot more fun for the kids (especially when they realize it's not the same old, same old). Think Frozen and Tangled for more modern incarnations.
Schooldays – none of the boring stuff, instead, all of the dastardly adventures schoolkids dream about getting up to; think Enid Blyton meets the 21st century with a technological bang!
Science fiction – kids love space and science weirdness, so make the most of it by drawing out this interest as the basis for your screenplay.
Action – action at the child's level is as thrilling as it is for adults.
Mystery – children love mystery plots, especially when the children are able to solve it before the well-meaning but harried adults.
Travel – it could be a race against time, a race of travelers, a journey of discovery, dragging along on a parental work trip or unearthing a treasure. Whatever it is, travel offers opportunities for great shots of wonderful places around the world, seen through a child's eyes.
Based on an existing novel. You'll need the rights to the novel, which can be fairly expensive depending on its popularity.;
, Ask them what they're interested in, what they like watching and what they think makes a good story. You'll get the best ideas from talking to the very people likely to watch the movie that results from your screenplay.

Recognize when you need to fight.,
Try making peace.,
Ignore them.,
Turn the tides.",How to Win a Fight Against a Bully2," Violence should always be a last resort. If you aren’t capable of winning a fight you might end up getting hurt much worse if you try to fight back. , Some bullies will see this as a form of weakness, but it’s something that you have to do. If you can stop the bullying and future confrontations, you should.


Try saying something like, “listen, I’ve got nothing against you. I’m not sure why you have something against me, but lets just let it lie. Thank you.”

, If the bullying only includes words, don’t escalate the situation. Just walk away silently. Don’t even acknowledge the situation. Don’t act scared, just never even make eye contact with the bully. Act as if they did not exist. If they can’t torture you, they probably will lose interest.


When they try to interact with you try to keep a completely blank look on your face and continue whatever you were doing. This will really frustrate them, and you’ll be putting yourself in a powerful position.

, Most people don’t like bullies. If you are in a public place and the kid is bullying you, don’t be afraid to call them out calmly and firmly. Tell them that picking on other people isn't cool, and you're not sure why they do it. Hopefully others will agree with you and let the bully know too.

Assess the situation.,
Find an escape route.,
Pack your knuckles.,
Attack unexpectedly.,
Keep your distance if the bully attacks you first.,
Go for the weak spots.,
Avoid kicking.,
Be confident and stick to the plan.",How to Win a Fight Against a Bully3," Never enter a fight that you can’t win. If the bully has a lot of his friends around don’t try to get physical. Avoid a fight at all costs.

, Even if you win the fight, you might need to leave very quickly. Take account of your surroundings and where you’ll escape to. , If you know the bully is stronger than you, try packing your hands. Keep two rolls of quarters in your backpack. When the bully confronts you, take them out and hold one in either hand. Your punch will be much more powerful with the weight of the quarters behind it. You can also throw the quarters at the person if you are in a desperate situation. Holding quarters will also prevent fractures. Make sure that you don’t grip your thumbs when you punch. You might break them.

, Don’t wait until you’re in a position of weakness. If the bully has pushed or mocked you, he probably won't have his guard up. If this is something he does commonly, you are entitled to fight back. Hit/kick him hard in a weak spot as hard as you possibly can, and then follow that up with multiple other hits. One of the biggest mistakes that people can make in a fight is throwing one punch, and then backing off. As soon as you enter the fight you have to stay on the offensive to avoid retaliation. You can end the fight quickly. Don’t pull your punch. Hitting someone isn’t a good feeling. We have a natural tendency to pull our punches, which means not following through on your momentum. You need to punch hard. , Unless you’re trained in wrestling, try to avoid going to the ground. If he rapidly punches, keep dodging. You cannot effectively block punches in a real fight. Duck his punches, or just otherwise avoid them.

, This means the gut, the groin, and the throat. Don’t throw a punch unless it will hit one of these three areas. , Unless you’re trained to kick, avoid kicking high. You’ll put yourself off balance and it will allow the other person to grab your leg and potentially put you to the ground.

, You’ll have adrenaline coursing through your body. Your legs might shake and your teeth might be chattering. Just keep telling yourself that you have to be the aggressor. Don’t pause until you’re sure you have won, and then get out of there quickly.


Do not be the aggressor so much that you seriously injure them. Just make sure that you have ended the fight and you can get away.

Create the story.,
Develop the characters.,
Learn how to write a screenplay if you don't already know how.,
Keep preaching for the pulpit.,
Get help from children.",How to Write a Children's Themed Screenplay2," Write out an initial rough outline of the screenplay's story. Depending on what the theme is, you'll need a dramatic point that the screenplay hinges on, something that needs to be resolved by the end of the film and that seems pressing throughout the film.

, Consider how many children you want in the film, as well as all of the other characters. Make the children the stars. The more it is the kids who are in control, who solve the problems, who find the problem creator, who save the day, the more empowering the screenplay will come across to them.


Don't speak down to the kids, ever. Children may be little but they're not daft.
Avoid gender generalizing. Children like to see themselves as capable of doing all the fun and exciting stuff, whatever their gender. Avoid the standard ""boys do this, girls do that"" by ensuring that all the kids do this and that. Don't recreate social conditioning that's already well past its use-by date.
Don't make parents or adults extremely stupid. Stupidity is a cliché; if you must have adults who haven't got a clue, make it for a real reason, such as being preoccupied, being too busy dealing with the house plumbing problems or having visitors over who are in the way all the time. The really dumb adult is hackneyed.

, Read How to write a screenplay for starters. When writing for children, bear the following things in mind:


While children are smart, they are not ""little adults""; they have their limitations, their fears and their need for adult support. Avoid making them all good or all bad or all-knowing. They're as complex as you are, just more frank about it.
Teens are very complex characters and should be portrayed sympathetically. It can be a time of turbulent emotions, both good and bad, so avoid creating shallow teen characters and never beat up on them.
Be careful about how you portray heavy adult issues as a problem weighing on the child. Children know that adults around them have problems but usually get piecemeal information and don't see the whole picture. This means that there is often confusion or mistaken understandings, and it is likely that these emotions would color a child's outlook, not a worldly or mature understanding of mom and dad's divorce or house foreclosure, etc.

, Using a screenplay as a vehicle to train children how to comport themselves better in society is unlikely to be a successful movie. It smacks of bossiness and children will see right through it and hate it. Again, think about the complexity of human beings, and seek to convey this in your screenplay for children too.

, If you want to improve the children's dialog in your movie, ask children around you if you're using a style of language that makes sense to them. Don't be surprised if they laugh and say ""nobody talks like that these days"". Listen to what they have to say and be humble––use their suggestions whenever you want to convey the kinds of things kids do say at this point in time.

For example, you can write about your Aunt Edna: Aunt Edna was always acting private. She wouldn’t let her daughter into her workroom, her dog in the house- she won’t even let her own husband in her room! That’s when Harry McCoy found out: his sweet, mysterious, secretive Aunt Edna was a CIA agent.;
, You could maybe just relax, do everyday stuff, and just let the idea pop up in your mind one day. Do the first step if you need to write right away.

, How do you think your favorite author gets her/his ideas? Become a detective looking for clues, a shopper searching for ham, or an old lady trying to find her glasses. Use your imagination and let your creativity flow. If you are writing a fantasy book, you can think of a character like a dragon named Mongo, or a creature’s species is a Grumaton- a creature with five tails, six fangs, eleven arms, and twenty-one legs! Be creative, that’s the whole point!

, If you love to swim, you could go for a swim, and while you are swimming, you could think about how to incorporate your love of swimming into a story. Maybe the main character of the book loves to swim, or the story could take place at a swimming pool . . . Try it out, and be creative! You never know what you can come up with!

, What if...? How would this happen? Does that make sense? Where would that happen? Write down lots of answers and choose your favorite!

, Write them down on paper in dot point form if that helps you to visualize them and play around with them.

, Simply write whatever comes to your mind, being inspired by the ideas.

, Then stop. Take a break from the work.

, Read through the work. Now get to editing it and shaping it into a real piece of writing. From the first tidy-up, things should start getting a lot easier and you'll soon be in the flow.

Hold a key as though it were a knife.,
Jab at vulnerable areas.,
Take advantage of the distraction.,
Strike downward.,
Push forward when cornered.",How to Use Car Keys for Self Defense1," The primary goal of self defense is to escape the situation safely. Throwing an object at the attacker, screaming for help, and running is often the best option. Even if you are cornered, car keys make an awkward weapon. Use them only if you happen to be holding them, and cannot reach a more effective weapon.
, Pick up your keys in your palm and wrap your fingers around them, with one key sticking out next to your thumb. Press your thumb down hard over the key, so it lies across your index finger's knuckle.This grip reduces the chance that you cut your own fingers, and holds the key steady to deliver force without bending or sliding against the target.

If you have other keys on the keyring, they should stick out the other direction, at the base of your fist., Punch hard at the attacker, with the key pointed directly at the target. The eyes, nose, groin, and hollow at the base of the throat are all targets that are likely to disorient or disable the attacker for a short time.

Warning: a strike to the eyes or the base of the throat has a chance to cause serious injury. Only target these areas if you are at risk of serious harm or death., If the attacker doubles over or falls back, immediately back away to increase the distance between you. If you can safely run to a more crowded area, do so.

One advantage to holding the key as described above is the ease of opening your car door if you manage to buy yourself time.

, If you have keys sticking out on the lower side of your fist as well, don't forget you can hammer downward at the attacker's groin or the back of his hands., If your back is against a wall, you may need to step forward and jab quickly several times to get the aggressor to fall back. If the attacker staggers or steps backward, step forward and push hard before she regains her balance. Use the opening you created to flee.

You may also need to do this if the aggressor is full of adrenaline, making it difficult to cause pain.

Aim at nerve centers and pressure points.,
Strike hard at debilitating targets.,
Train with the keys held in between the knuckles of your fist.",How to Use Car Keys for Self Defense2," This is difficult to do without training, as it takes precision and speed. The most useful target to aim for is the inner elbow joint, which can interrupt the attacker's punch or break his grip. The wrist or other inner joints can also give you a moment to escape if hit precisely., Striking at the solar plexus, kidneys, or temple with your keys or even your fist can be very effective. However, these blows require more force and correct punching form to reliably disable someone.

Only aim for the temple if you are at the side. Ideally, you want the keys or your fist to connect at a right angle to the head.

, This is probably the most commonly known defense technique involving keys, but most people are better off with the ""knife grip"" described above. Punching with the keys between your knuckles is likely to injure your hands, and the keys tend to slide against the target instead of punching through.Only attempt this if you practice it first, and are confident you have a tight grip to prevent slipping, and the precision and skill to avoid tearing up your hand.

Even if you prefer this approach, do not waste time setting it up if you are attacked. The knife grip is much faster.

Keep your head up.,
Plan your route.,
Make sure your hands are free.",How to Walk Safely at Night1," When walking alone at night, make sure to keep your head up and look forward. This will help you be alert and aware of your surroundings. Do not look down or away, and only make brief eye contact with others.To avoid looking distracted, do not walk with your cellphone in your hand. If you do, you might be tempted to look at your cellphone. If you are looking at your cellphone, then you are less aware of your surroundings and more vulnerable to surprise attacks.
Alternatively, if you feel unsafe, call a friend or family member and talk with them until you reach your destination. This way, someone knows where you are at all times.
Avoid using headphones while walking, as well. Headphones reduce your awareness of your surroundings.;
, Make sure to plan your route ahead of time. This way, you will know exactly where you will be going and you will be able to project confidence as you walk. Walk at a steady, brisk pace, and walk facing traffic to keep yourself visible.Do not wander aimlessly if you get lost. Find the nearest gas station, convenience store, or restaurant to ask for directions.

, Except for a flashlight, try to keep your hands free at all times. This way, you will be able to react if someone approaches you. Or, if you happen to trip and fall, you will be able to catch yourself by keeping your hands free.Place all of your personal items into one bag. This way, you can avoid having to carry multiple bags. If a dangerous situations arises, multiple bags will prevent you from being able to react quickly.

Carry a deterrent.,
Bring a flashlight or a bike light.,
Wear reflective clothing and comfortable footwear.",How to Walk Safely at Night2," Carry non-violent deterrents, like a whistle, pepper spray, or mace. A whistle will let others know if something is wrong, and the loud noise may deter potential attackers. If used properly, pepper spray or mace may be able to buy you enough time to evade a potential attacker, and seek help.When using pepper spray or mace, make sure the opening is facing away from you and towards your attacker.

, A flashlight or a bike light is a great accessory to carry with you as you walk at night. Even if you are walking in a well-lit area, you still may encounter dark patches. Therefore, flashlights will enable you to light up dark patches as you walk along the path.Wear a headlamp to keep your hands free at all times.

, Your walking clothes need to have reflective strips in the front, down and the sides, and on your back. Reflective clothing enables cars and other bikers to see you as you walk at night. Make sure to also wear comfortable shoes while you walk, like sneakers. Sneakers will enable you to walk confidently, or quickly escape a potential attacker.If you are walking home from the office, bring your sneakers with you in a separate bag so you can change into them before you walk home.You can also buy a reflective vest to put on over your clothes if you do not want to change into reflective clothing every time you walk home.

Use heavily traveled paths.,
Avoid dark areas.,
Steer away from suspicious people.",How to Walk Safely at Night3," When walking at night, always use heavily traveled paths. By using heavily traveled paths, you decrease your chances of being alone while walking a night. Also, try to walk in familiar places where people know you, for example a neighborhood where residents know you. This way, if you feel in danger or that someone is following you, you can always knock on a neighbor's door., Avoid dark alleyways, corners, and parking lots. Restrict your routes to well-lit areas, and always carry a flashlight in case you encounter a dark patch in your route. Also, be aware and avoid walkways that have thick shrubbery, buildings, recesses, or other objects that can conceal people.Do not be tempted to take a shortcut through a dark alleyway or parking lot.

, If you see something or someone suspicious in the direction you are heading, then change your route immediately. Cross the street to change your path in order to avoid suspicious people and situations.If you feel like someone is following you, head toward a populated area, like a gas station, convenience store, or restaurant. Do not head toward your car or your house where you can get cornered alone.

Walk with a friend.,
Notify someone.,
Trust your instincts.",How to Walk Safely at Night4," When walking at night, always try to bring a friend or a dog along with you. There is safety in numbers, and you are less likely to be approached if you are with someone., If you have to walk alone at night, let someone know that you will be walking alone. Make sure to tell them your plans, travel routes, and arrival time.There are apps that you can download, like the Companion app, that allow your friends or family members to monitor you as you walk alone at night. The app shares your departure time, your route and your current location on the route, and will notify your friends once you have safely arrived., Your instincts are your best allies when you are walking alone at night. Stop and look around if you are worried someone is following you. Let the person following you know that you are aware of their presence by looking in their direction.If you are being followed, do not walk straight to your car or house. Instead, walk to a place that is public and safe. You can either wait there until you feel that it is safe to walk again, or you can call a cab to take you to your destination.

Look for more effective weapons first.,
Grip the pencil so it can slide through your fist.,
Place your thumb against the eraser end (optional).,
Jab at vulnerable areas.,
Know the risks of permanent damage.,
Embed the pencil in the attacker.,
Escape the situation.",How to Use a Pencil for Self Defense," The advantage of using a pencil is to transfer the force of your punch to a small surface area (the pencil point). Any other narrow object can do the same job. Try to find one longer and less fragile than a pencil, or pick up a small, blunt object you can easily grip and swing. Even a rolled up magazine may be more effective at deflecting attacks and fighting back.

A pencil can still cause serious injury. Only follow these instructions below in a self-defense situation where you are at risk of major harm.;
, Hold the pencil as tightly as you can, with the sharp end extending out near your pinky finger. Besides letting you stab outward or downward, this grip may tighten your fist, which makes your punches more effective., If you have strong hands and some training in punching, you may be able to hold the blunt end of the pencil in with your thumb. This can make the pencil a steadier, more forceful weapon. However, if you have shaky hands, a weak grip, or little fighting experience, leave the pencil free to slide through your fist. The blunt end of the pencil can damage your hand on its own, and punching at a sloppy angle could cause the pencil to bend and puncture your skin., If you strike with enough force, these targets should cause significant pain or injury:

Nose
Groin
Solar plexus
Brachial plexus (nerves running down side of neck and onto shoulder)
Temples (strike from side)
If you are shorter than your attacker, striking his face will use your fist, not the downward-facing pencil point.

, All stabbing strikes have the potential to cause serious long term injury, or even death. However, the following areas are especially vulnerable to this danger. Strike them only as a last resort:

Eyes
Hollow at base of throat
Behind the ear
Under the jaw

, A direct, head-on strike at a 90º angle is most likely to puncture the skin. Hit with enough force, and the pencil may even lodge in soft tissue. If this happens, twist and tilt the pencil right away to embed it in the body, then let go. You can try this on the softer vulnerable areas mentioned above, or in an arm or leg muscle., Your number one priority in a self defense situation is to safely get away from the attacker. Your number two priority is to call for help. If your strike succeeds in winding the attacker, or causes him to stumble back, use that distraction to get away.

If the attacker is knocked off balance, give him a hard push before you run.

Be observant and alert at key times.,
Be alert when locking up your house.,
Be alert when leaving your work.,
Be alert on returning to a place you've left the next day, evening, whenever.,
Trust your intuition and memory recall.",How to Use Your Memory to Keep You Safe," There are certain regular activities in life that should be done in an alert state, so that you are keenly observing certain things around you and will be warned if things aren't as you remembered them being. Practice deliberately observing things around you and committing them to memory as a deliberate defensive strategy to keep yourself safe.;
, Take note of what you have done by way of shutting or opening windows, pulling down blinds or shutting curtains, leaving lights on or off, closing gates and putting things like the trash can away.

, Again, notice similar things about how you've left your desk, office, business in terms of lights, locked doors, open windows, items on the desk, etc.

, When you get home or back to your business, do a memory check of the things you left in place. Are they still as you left them?


Naturally, if someone else at your work or in your household could have moved or changed things, take this into account but if anything seems out of place, timed wrongly, moved inaccurately, etc., then pay heed to your memory's recall and approach with care.

, It is better to be mistaken about thinking something isn't right than to convince yourself things are okay and to walk into a dangerous situation. Naturally, if you're struggling to overcome paranoia about absolutely everything on a daily basis, your intuition and memory are both going to serve you badly and see someone for help about your constant fears. However, for an average, emotionally competent person, trusting your senses that something isn't right is an important part of remaining safe.


If things do seem wrong, different, and your memory of things is backing up your concerns, call for help. Do not proceed to enter a building or area where you are concerned about the safety of such an action. Use your cell phone to call the police, visit the neighbors, or call someone you can trust for advice.

Instruct all children and others to stay down low and hide.,
Before doing anything, be sure to call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number.,
Bring a firearm or weapon and prepare yourself to use it if necessary.,
Don't shoot the burglar at first glance!,
Note that most burglars don't come in expecting to hurt anybody.,
If you have him pinned down in a one-door room.,
Tell him to get down on the floor with his hands on his head.,
Wait for authorities to arrive.",How to Thwart a Robbery Attempt," Don't let your 10-year-old son try to be a hero, chances are they will just get in the way or they could possibly be hurt or injured.;
, This step is important even if you do manage to put down the burglar(s) it's a wasted effort if you're stuck.

, A knife, bat, or scissors will work, anything that could possibly injure the burglar(s).

, Turn the lights on and get a good look at the burglar before you write him down as a burglar. Is he your daughter that is trying to sneak out or back in late?

, Most are trying to get valuable objects, not to shoot everybody in the house. Also note though that most will be armed and there are some out there that will shoot out of fright.

, Aim your firearm or weapon in a position that could possibly injure or kill him but don't shoot. Depending on your state's or country's laws, even if it is in defense or on your property, you could still be fined or arrested.

, Police normally tell their suspect to get down on the floor, a man on his knees does have a possibility of grabbing a weapon or object and shoot or hit you. If he is on the floor he is close to immobile.

, Keep a constant eye on the burglar. When the police get there identify yourself to them and keep you hands where they can see them. Drop the weapon if you have one away from the burglar. Don't be upset when the police put you into handcuffs to for the time being. They are just trying to figure out what is going on. Once they learn you are the home owner they will let you go.

Take the proper grip.,
Line the knife up with the target.,
Raise the knife up beside your head.,
Release the knife in a smooth slinging motion.",How to Throw a Knife Without It Spinning1," Sticking a knife with no rotation is made possible by modifying the standard throwing grip. Wrap your hand loosely around the handle of the knife. Pinch the handle between your thumb and the length of your middle finger. Place your index finger flat against the spine of the blade at the knife’s center of balance. This is known as the “thumb grip,” or sometimes the “drive-finger grip,” as you’ll be using your thumb to guide the movement of the knife and your index finger to drive it forward as you release.The thumb grip is used to neutralize the rotation of the blade after it leaves the hand.
Every knife will have a slightly different center of balance. Locate the knife’s center of balance by laying it across one outstretched finger and adjusting it until it balances on its own. This is the section of the knife on which you should place the point of your finger.;
, Hold your arm straight out in front of you with the tip of the blade trained on your target. Eyeball the exact spot you’re aiming for. Pay close attention to the angle and position of your arm. This is where your arm will need to be at the moment you release the knife.Pointing the knife in the direction of the target before you throw can help muscle memory take over, giving you a sense of exactly where your arm should be when you release.
For better accuracy, make a quick initial lineup part of your throwing ritual.

, Keeping your shoulder fixed and your upper arm parallel with the ground, draw the knife back until it’s level with your head. Your elbow should be bent about 90 degrees, with the blade of the knife pointing straight up. Square your stance and take a small step forward with your opposite foot.To get an idea of what position your shoulder and forearm need to be in, hold up your throwing arm as though you were making the “goal” gesture used by fans of American football.
The Mumyou-Ryu technique was derived from a technique used by ancient Japanese warriors to throw circular projectiles (shuriken, or “throwing stars”) without rotation. It was adapted for use with straight, modern knives and spikes., Lean over your front foot as you prepare to throw. Let go of the knife while your throwing arm is at roughly a 45 degree angle—this will help compensate for gravity and create the relaxed arc that the knife will trace in the air. At the moment of release, lightly “brush” the length of the spine with your pointer finger. Straighten your arm so that you complete the throw pointing at your target. With any luck, you’ll hear the thump of a successful stick.Bring your forearm and knife hand down in a circular path, in one quick movement.
Your forearm should stay straight up and down throughout the windup and release.

Pay attention to what they're really saying and doing.,
Don't show fear or vulnerability.,
If you're facing a crazy person, especially someone who's been in and out of therapy, you can sometimes talk them down by staying calm and listening to what they have to say - and responding like a therapist.,
Make them think you're not worth it by saying something like, ""Look, we already know that you would obviously win..."" etc.,
Answer anything they say politely without insults.,
Try not to anger them to come at you.,
If it's a personal fight over something that has happened - they are jealous because someone they are attracted to, likes you more, or something you own that they wish they had, or if they feel betrayed, or if you did betray them in some way like gossip, then try conflict resolution.,
Make sure you know what they want to do with you.

,
Don't escalate it by getting back at them.,
Do not attack first.,
Take physical threats seriously.",How to Talk People Out of Fighting With You," This is not a time for denial. ""This can't be happening"" is a good way to get yourself beaten to a pulp, it's the reaction they're looking for. If you know the person, you probably understand the motive behind what they're doing.;
, People are less likely to attack confident others, bullies go after people who are already fearful. If you tend toward fearfulness or insecurity, face that as its own problem and work on building your inner strength. Learn to set your fears or grief aside in a crisis and become calm - not angry, calm. This puts you in control of the situation. It will also help, if you try to build your strength. Remember that bullies look for victims, not opponents.

, Keep it focused on their feelings and let them vent their feelings. Try to sound as if you do care about their mental health and want to help them deal with their problems. Don't say anything defensive to any accusations they make. Turn it back toward them with questions like ""How did that make you feel?"" It will trigger a habit of their dumping their feelings and you may spend half an hour being yelled at and bawled on, but this is a lot better than getting attacked by a crazy person. Try to steer the conversation toward other things that bug them besides whatever it is about you, to keep the role of ""helpful peer, crying shoulder.""


Once that ""therapy mode"" is established, you can start to introduce doubt into their accusations toward you with questions like ""Did you consider whether someone was lying about me to you?""
Be careful with this because if you do it even once in a situation where you'll run into the crazy person again, they may attach to you and try to get you to do it again. Learn to set boundaries and suggest counseling to them if they keep seeking you out. They not only need it, they're ready for it if they're doing this.

, That's one type of submissive response - and it can backfire. You have many options. Understand your opponent's motives and know which one to deliver. Some bullies just want that immediate verbal submission to the threat, will shove you a bit and move on - you know this by watching them. Others, that's what eggs them on. It's vital to understand the difference.

, This breaks the script of a typical fight. It also sets up a fear factor of its own. Remember the ""little old Japanese guy"" in any karate movie. He's always very polite no matter how many insults including racist insults the bully is shouting - if you respond like that, without a raised voice or any insulting words, it sounds as if you have some hidden defense you know is unbeatable. Showing them that you have inner strength, will often put them off.

, Put simply: do not provoke them. Do not start insulting them by group (stupid jocks, dumb whatever, racist comments, sexist comments, the list goes on.). If they are bullies, just looking for anyone who seems vulnerable, try to avoid their usual paths and hangouts. Stay out of their way.

, Remember that if a friend suddenly turns on you for no reason you can think of, the likeliest thing is that someone lied to them and the best way to solve it is to compare notes about who told you what. You would not believe how many pointless fights start because someone else was jealous of a friendship or just malicious.

,, Don't ever escalate a conflict with someone in a long term situation like school, work, family, or roommate. That's a road to blowing up your life and costs far more than the moment's satisfaction of revenge.

, Only fight back if they attack first; try to avoid getting to that point. If you fight back after they attack, then you can claim self defense. Remember that for it to be considered self-defense, you need to only do enough fighting for them to be unable to harm you. It is not legal to harm someone any further, after they are already away from your danger zone.

, Use minimal force, and escape the situation. Use all authorities and resources available to deal with the situation if you're physically threatened - police, school authorities, workplace authorities, help lines, you name it. You should be able to live without the fear of being physically attacked. If you are living with people who hit you, move out. If you're underage and it's family, there are resources, use help lines.

Hold the knife with the thumb grip.,
Raise the knife up and out to the side of your body.,
Rotate your hips and shoulders.,
Use a whip-like motion to throw the knife.",How to Throw a Knife Without It Spinning2," Assume the thumb grip. This will be the most efficient way of minimizing the knife’s rotation in flight. Press the handle of the knife snugly between your thumb and middle finger, but don’t squeeze too tight. During the throw, your wrist and forearm should move as one.With the thumb grip, the blade must be flung with the arm and shoulder using a pushing motion, rather than the snap of the wrist which usually causes the knife to spin.

, Extend your throwing arm with the knife held upright just above and behind your head. The blade should be almost vertical, hovering out at a shallow angle. When using the Russian technique, the knife should point slightly out to your dominant side before it is thrown. Bend your elbow a little so that the blade of the knife is nearly parallel to the ground. Stay loose and ready to time your throw.Holding the knife out further from your body creates additional torque, allowing you to throw the knife with more force.
The Russian technique requires a little more room to move, so be aware of your surroundings before you start waving the knife around.

, Initiate the throwing motion by winding up with your upper body. Turn your hips and shoulders a few inches away from the target in the same direction of your knife hand (right-handed knife throwers will turn clockwise, left-handed throwers should turn counterclockwise). The Russian no-spin throwing technique relies on lateral motion to generate force, which means you’ll be focusing on the movement of your midsection rather than just your arm.Don’t let your knees or feet turn as you twist your upper body. This will throw off your base, as you’ll no longer be facing the target.

, Once you’ve drawn back all the way, reverse the motion suddenly. Rotate your hips and shoulders in the opposite direction. At the same time, sling your arm out at an angle, releasing the knife just before your throwing hand lines up with the target. Follow through with the throw the way you would if you were cracking a whip, keeping your arm extended until the blade makes contact.The trickiest part of the Russian technique is timing your release correctly. It’s more difficult to gauge where the knife will end up as you’re throwing from the side and not centering the blade’s path with your line of sight like with vertical throws.
Despite the somewhat complicated mechanics, the Russian method of no-spin throwing is thought to be more consistently accurate than other techniques."

Take hold of the knife.,
Keep your shoulder relaxed.,
Pull your arm back beside your head.,
Throw the knife using your entire arm.",How to Throw a Knife Without It Spinning3," Grab the knife high up on the handle. For the Thorn technique, you can use either a thumb grip or a modified hammer grip for increased stability. Since you’ll be using your entire arm to throw, so you should make sure that you have a secure grasp in order to control the path of the blade.The Thorn method of no-spin throwing was invented by and named after knife throwing instructor Ralph Thorn.To modify a hammer grip for no-spin throwing, wrap your whole fist around the handle of the knife, the way you would a hammer. Then, uncurl your pointer finger and rest it along the spine of the blade.
Whether you choose a thumb grip or a modified hammer grip, your grasp should be firm but not too strong. The tighter you hold on, the more difficult and unreliable your release will be.

, The key to the Thorn technique is the windmill-like motion of the arm. This can put a lot of strain on the tendons and ligaments of the rotator cuff if you’re maintaining a lot of tension. Shake out your arm and loosen up a bit before you start throwing. If you’re not careful, you may be setting yourself up for injury.Warm up before your knife throwing sessions with some basic mobility exercises and a little light stretching.
If the Thorn method causes pain in any part of your shoulder or arm, stop and switch to a less strenuous technique.

, Bend your throwing arm slightly and lock it into place. Your upper arm and elbow should only form about a 35 or 40 degree angle. Raise your arm until it’s above and slightly behind your head. With the Thorn technique, you’ll use your entire arm to throw, not just the momentum of the forearm.


Stand up straight and fully extend your back as you start the windup.

, To perform the throw, drop your arm fast in a circular arc, not letting the elbow bend. Release the knife right before your hand falls level with the target. Thrust your index finger forward during the release and follow through to prevent the knife from spinning. When executed correctly, the knife should sail in a smooth, direct line toward the target.It may be helpful to practice the Thorn technique in two separate phases: the wide, looping motion of the arm and the timing of the release.
Most no-spin techniques, like the Thorn method, are a combination of a traditional knife throwing motion and the heaving action used to throw spears.

Continue to hit them.",How to Use a Broom to Chase a Criminal," If the criminal sees that you are sweaty and shifting a lot, then they will know that you are up to something. Stand still until you are ready to make your move. Staying calm also increases your ability to take punches or contact.;
, The criminal will most likely try to stop you from grabbing a poetical weapon. Grab either very swiftly or very slowly to prevent the criminal to have any time to react.

, If there is no dustpan, skip this step. The dust will either blind them or the dustpan will hit them and momentarily stun them.

, The brush part of the of the broom will enrage them more, while the handle will hurt them. Aim for the eyes, throat, and stomach.

Use a simple umbrella.,
Make a sock mace.",How to Turn Everyday Items into a Self Defense Weapon," Believe it or not, a pocket of loose change can actually be used as a weapon if you know how to use it properly. If there is an attacker in front of you, try throwing the change to his or her face. It may be sufficient to buy you time to escape or try another form of quick attack.
, This isn't really a weapon as such but is great if you use it as a shield. It doesn't have to be a backpack, it can be any type of suitcase or bag, to hold up against fists or thrown objects.



 


Just remember it's not bulletproof, so it won't do you any good if the attacker has a gun.

, If you fill up a bottle half way it can be used as an impact. That means that it is good for smacking the attacker with.






A hot drink might be useful if you need to defend yourself seriously. Remember though, that hot liquids scald and you will be inflicting injury on the other person. When defending yourself, this may be defensible but you may also get into serious trouble for causing injury too.

, You can use a flashlight to hit the attacker with.






You can also use it in a tactical way by flashing it in his or her eyes and temporarily blind the attacker.

, It's not the best but it's good if you don't have anything else to protect yourself with. It can be used to push away, hit, open out and scare, etc.






It can also be used as shield.

, This is a weapon you need to make but it is super easy to make. Just grab a sock and slip something hard it like a bar of soap, or a battery.

This weapon is mostly used in prison by the prisoners when they start a riot."

Know your limits.,
Leave your hands up in front of you.,
Kick quickly and without tells.,
Raise your knee horizontal to your body.,
Lock your ankle and pull your toes back.,
Snap your foot out.,
Kick at long or mid range.,
Strike below the hip.,
Hit the attacker's leg.,
Distract or stagger the attacker.,
Drive an attacker backward.,
Train in advanced front kicks.",How to Use a Front Kick for Self Defense," Unless you are trained, you should leave your Jackie Chan moves in the gym. The type of front kick most people imagine (flying at the attacker's torso) is more likely to bring disaster on yourself than your attacker. The average person does not have the kick speed to pull this off. Put in some time practicing and get a sense of your capabilities, asking a martial artist for advice if possible.


Besides kick speed, your opponent's reaction speed is the main factor in the kick's success. If you can catch an attacker by surprise, you may be able to get a kick in before he can defend. This is still usually a bad idea without training.;
, One common mistake is to drop your hands before you kick. This makes the kick very predictable, and leaves your face and body undefended. Keep your fists in front of you with your elbows bent. This will also improve your balance.

, Crouching or shifting your stance makes it obvious you are about to kick. Adopt a balanced fighting stance, bent at the knees, so you can shift weight and kick in one quick motion.


Try to misdirect your opponent by raising or drawing back your fist slightly.

, The front kick popular in taekwondo and some other martial arts starts in this position. By folding your leg and raising it up to your hip, you are ready to snap outward for maximum power.

, This will keep your foot stiff to deliver maximum impact.

, Extend your knee rapidly. Strike the target with the ball of your foot. Immediately retract your knee and lower your foot to the ground.


The ball of the foot is a good default to remember, but there are specialized kicks that use different techniques. The tip of your foot may be especially effective if you are wearing heels or other shoes with a hard tip.

, Long range refers to the maximum distance of your kick, while mid range refers to the maximum distance of your punch. Your attacker should be between these two distances when you kick. Any closer, and your kick will not have much momentum.


Measure these distances while standing still, not while lunging forward.

, Perhaps the worst mistake you can make with a front kick is aiming too high. Attempting this untrained can make it easy for your attacker to knock you over, either grabbing your kicking leg or sweeping your supporting leg aside. You're almost always better off aiming below the attacker's hips, or even below the knees.

, A low kick to the side of an attacker's leg, especially at the knee, may knock her off balance. However, this is only effective in a specific set of circumstances:


The attacker is off-balance, supported mostly on one leg. (This is usually the rear leg.)
The supporting leg is close enough for you to kick without moving closer or losing your own balance.
Your supporting leg is not exposed to the same tactic. (For instance, you are standing sideways to your attacker, with your back foot well back.)

, Sometimes, a kick to the attacker's leg can be used to distract his attention as you strike at the upper body. It can also be used just as any strike, causing enough pain to disorient the attacker long enough for your to escape. Neither of these tactics are all that effective without training, and have the same balance problems described above. Kick if your arms are pinned, while striking with your head, knees, and elbows as well. When your hands are free, punching or gouging sensitive areas such as the face or groin is a better tactic.

, If you are cornered, a kick to the gut may push the attacker back so you have room to get away. This is a desperate and risky move. That said, if you do not have much upper body strength, you may need to rely on kicks rather than shoving with your arms.

, The following targets are only effective if you can kick with power, balance, and precision. You must be far enough away to add power by snapping out your leg, which means you must be extra fast to avoid getting blocked or counterattacked. If you want to pull these off, you should have significant experienced with martial arts:


In a side stance, kick with your front leg at the groin or the chin (if able to strike this high).
Face the attacker and move your whole body weight forward, bringing your back leg to the solar plexus.
Face the attacker with a wide stance, Bring your knee up to your chest and launch your heel at the target's chest. This is called a ""teep.""
If very skilled, you may be able to kick the base of an attacker's hand to knock out a knife.

Look for weaknesses in the way he responds to your movement.

, Depending on the type of wrestler you are facing, different moves may provide more success for a takedown.A “Duck Under” requires you to move under your opponent’s arm as he approaches and quickly grab him around the waist from behind. Keep one arm straight out in front of your opponent as you move behind your him; wrap your other arm around his waist from behind. Once you have a hold on your opponent, flip him onto the mat by falling back and swinging him with you.
A “Double Leg” takedown involves grabbing both legs of your opponent around mid thigh and pulling them up and towards you to force your opponent onto his back. Approach your opponent from the front and grab both legs at once. Be careful not to lower your head or you become vulnerable.

Know that most bar fights never evolve into much.",How to Survive a Bar Fight," Even if the guy is being a jerk, getting into a fight with him will only cause you trouble. If you win, you will still get kicked out of the bar and could face criminal charges. If you lose, you could wind up in the hospital. Do your best to talk your potential opponent out of a physical confrontation, even if it means admitting you were partly responsible. Bar fights are simply not worth the cost.;
, Bartenders and bouncers don't want a fight any more than you do. Send a friend to get help if you can, and attempt to inch towards the nearest bouncer. There is also the possibility of making his friends see reason if your opponent won't.

, Lean forward towards the attacker and position your hands by your face. You won't look like you are in a fighting stance but you will be ready for the coming attack.

, If someone makes a move to hit you, the best thing you can do is beat them to the punch. This does not mean you should go around hitting people every time you feel threatened. However, in a situation where you are truly afraid for your safety, it is best to show that you are serious about protecting yourself. Most individuals who want to push a fight are looking for easy prey. One person who is willing to inflict harm can be effective against a number of 'huff and puff' guys. Do bear in mind that violence of this sort is often illegal and should be avoided whenever possible.

, Once you commit to fighting back, keep doing so until you perceive no more threat. When your opponent is asking you to stop and his friends have scattered, only then should you wind down.

, Often only a few blows are ever thrown before bouncers swarm in to remove the offenders from the establishment.

Know the psychology.,
Do not become a bully - Replace your anger and jealousy with pity.,
Beware of the psychopath.,
Play it cool.,
Get out of the relationship now.,
Be a bit cruel to be nice to yourself.,
Tell the simple truth.",How to Stop a Player from Hurting You,"

Players are doing it for control and immediate gratification, because they do not feel worthy of anyone's love. They need to continuously boost their ego, which is done in many ways: getting your love, making you jealous of them, pointing out your flaws and etc. They have issues from previous bad relationships and take their anger out on their victims.;
,


These people live a sad lonely existence, never making meaningful emotional connections, because no one wants to be their friend after having been chewed and spat out. They may make small calls for help by complaining that they have no true friends, that they're distant from their family or via other means. Be gentle because they are humans too. No one is perfect.

,


Some players show psychopathic tendencies (a psychological condition where they cannot feel empathy and guilt). If you take revenge on these type of people, they will actually become better at bullying their next victim rather than make a Do not do unto others... realization.

, Do not give this person compliments or insults. Limit your expression of emotions. If they make you happy, accept it, return it in moderation but know they haven't changed! Avoid giving praise because you will only rub their ego.

, You are worthy of love because you have chosen it. Your self-esteem is more important than sex, there will be other relationships even if you don't think so now.

, If you are still around each other, then playing it cool will frustrate them. When they bully you (e.g. boasting about new partners or comparing you to them), be a bit cruel to discourage negative behaviour from them.


Be inventive but be truthful. You can wait a few times for the same negative behaviour before saying a witty remark, to avoid entering into a childish competition

If they boast new partners, you could casually remark that you feel sorry for them (You can feel sorry because they are with a player).
If they compare you to a partner, you could casually remark that the partner would be better off with yourself (You can believe this rather than they be with a player)
If you can find no remark, don't respond. Leave a 2 second gap and then remark about your love for a close friend. If they insult your friend, point out their jealousy. Feel free to do this as many times as needed



, We all deserve love, even if we don't believe it. It's better to cut this negative person out of your life. As you do so, tell them that they deserve love because they are a nice person at heart (which usually they are), but that love must given as well as taken. Remind them a few times of this, then make no further contact unless they chose to do so with you. You don't want to rub their ego, if they do contact you always maintain caution. Be prepared that they probably won't, in which case let them go.

Choose your knife.,
Grip the knife with your dominant hand.,
Angle the knife.,
Choose a target.,
Assume the proper stance.,
Swing the knife forward.,
Release the knife and follow through.,
Assess what needs to be changed to throw the knife perfectly.,
Clean the blade after throwing.",How to Throw a Knife," There are three different kinds of knives that are good for throwing: blade-heavy, handle-heavy, and balanced knives. Balanced knives are generally best for beginners as they make switching to other models easier.









Keep in mind that you want the weight to be thrown first. If you are throwing a blade-heavy knife, you will want your blade to be thrown first. Hold the knife by the handle to throw it. And vice versa -- if you’re throwing a handle-heavy knife, you will throw it by the blade.;
, Though knife-throwers often develop their own gripping styles with time and experience, there are three conventional gripping methods that beginners usually choose from (depending on their knife style and/or personal preferences). Note that a firm but delicate hold is necessary for all gripping styles; too much grip will hamper your release, whereas too little might cause the knife to fly out of your hand prematurely, potentially hurting someone.Hammer Grip: Grip the handle of the knife as you would the handle of a hammer; place the handle across your open palm near your knuckles, wrap your four fingers underneath and around the handle, and place your thumb over the top. This grip is especially useful if you’re learning to throw a double-edged blade.














Pinch Grip for a Single-Edged Blade: Hold your palm out in front of you and move your thumb to create a crease between the fleshy pad of your thumb and the rest of your palm. With the handle pointing away from you, place the blunt edge of the knife blade into this crease so that the tip lines up with the bottom of your thumb crease. Place your thumb along one side of the blade and all your fingers except the pinky along the other side, thereby pinching the blade without pressing against the point or the sharpened edge.














Pinch Grip for a Double-Edged Blade: With the handle pointing away from you, grasp the tip of the knife so that the tip of your thumb is one side of the blade and the tips of all your fingers except the pinky are on the other side, thereby pinching it without pressing against the point or either sharpened edge. Note that hold will not allow for a powerful throw; if you are just learning to use a double-edged knife, you may have better luck with the hammer grip.














, How you do this will change how rapidly the knife flips through the air, which must be adjusted depending on the distance between you and your target. Note that these distances are somewhat subjective: a knife held by its handle will need to turn over at least once in the air to land point-first, whereas a knife held by its point will need to turn over at least one and a half times. Therefore, adjust the angle of your hold depending on how your knife performs for you with your chosen grip and distance.


Close-range: Bend your wrist back toward your forearm. This will allow the knife to turn over in the air more quickly, which is necessary because there is so little distance between you and your target.














Medium-range: Slightly bend your wrist back toward your forearm. This will somewhat increase the speed with which the knife turns over in the air, which is necessary because there isn’t a lot of space between you and your target.














Long-range: Keep your wrist unbent. This will keep the knife from turning over too much in the air, which is necessary because there is plenty of distance between you and your target.














, It is important to use targets that are thick enough that the knife won’t go through them, but soft enough that the knives will slide easily into them. For target practice, use cardboard or cereal boxes; these are great for determining accuracy. More established knife throwers prefer a soft wood such as willow, birch, or pine. It helps to count your paces away from the target (assuming it is stationary) so that you get a feel for how hard you have to throw the knife and can use the distance for a reference.








Your targets can be hanging, mounted, or free-standing.

, Place your weight on your dominant leg, rest your non-dominant foot in front of you (with no weight on it), raise your dominant arm in front of you so that it is perpendicular to the ground, and bend at the elbow so that the knife is raised alongside your head. Keep the knife a comfortable distance from your head so that you do not cut yourself when you swing to throw it.







, Shift your weight from your dominant to your non-dominant leg to create forward momentum. At the same time, swing your forearm forward from the elbow so that your arm is straight out in front of you; this is the point at which you will release the knife. Practice this swinging motion several times to get the hang of it.










Resist the urge to throw the knife like a baseball; when you do this, your arm swings across your body, whereas in knife-throwing, the goal is to swing your arm straight up and down so that the knife doesn’t hit at an angle. To curb this cross-swinging tendency, it may help to pretend you are chopping wood.
If you have angled the knife upwards, bring your wrist straight as you finish the swing.

, Simply allow the knife to slip from your hand once your arm is pointing toward your target and your wrist is perfectly straight. Your entire body will end up angled slightly forward (due to the weight shift) and your arm will continue swinging downwards. A well-timed release will cause the knife to fly out of your hand and stick into the target horizontally.








Knife throwing is more about finesse than strength. It is most important to keep the entire movement fluid and only apply as much force as is needed. Once you get the hang of it, you will be amazed at how little force is needed.

, If you find that you hit the target with the butt of the knife instead of the blade and changing the angle of your wrist isn’t enough to compensate, adjust one pace forward or backward. Do not change the amount of force applied in your throw; you simply need to allow for more or less rotation. A good rule of thumb is that one pace equals a half-rotation of the knife.









As always, heavier objects will require more force to propel them at the desired speed over the required distance. Instead of increasing the strength of your throw beyond the point of losing fluidity and control, you might consider aiming for a point slightly above your intended target when throwing with larger/heavier knives.

, After completing a practice session, always clean the blade of the knife. Oils from your hand can degrade the metal in the blade and cause it to rust.









It is also important to clean your knife if your target was something, such as a piece of meat, that could produce oils that could harm the blade.

, Fights move quickly so you won't have a lot of time. You need to determine how serious the situation is, if you are in danger, whether you need to call for help, and what strategies might work best to stop the fight in this particular situation.Try to determine whether anyone has a weapon or is likely to reach for an object to use as a weapon (for example, a bottle in a bar fight). If so, call the police and do not intervene. Try to move other onlookers, especially children, to safety.
Notice whether the fighters have ""back up,"" often in the form of onlookers who are egging on the fighters. Gang fights and similar situations are unpredictable and you should not try to intervene.
Look around for any large objects that you can push between the fighters, like trash cans, desks, or anything else that is big but possible for you to quickly move into place. , If either fighter has a weapon of any kind, call the police and do not try to intervene. You should also call the police if you are physically unable to restrain a fighter or fear that your safety would be in jeopardy if you intervened.


Unless a police officer happens to be in the vicinity, it may be too late by the time they arrive. If it is safe to do so, try to break up the fight yourself while you wait for them to arrive.

, If there is anyone else within hearing range, get them to help you break up the fight before attempting to do it yourself. In situations like this, onlookers don't generally stop to help unless you tell them specifically. So instead of yelling ""Someone help me!"" look someone in the eye and say ""Help me stop the fight!""If possible, choose someone who is larger than the fighters and looks strong and athletic. But in a pinch, any able-bodied adult will do!
Don't leave the scene of a fight to get help unless you have to, especially if the fighters are juveniles. If you're at school or in another setting where there are no adults present, you can always send a kid to get another adult., This recommendation is only for situations in which both fighters are unarmed and the fight has not escalated to full-on blows. Be aware getting between two fighters is a risky choice, and you may be injured. You should also know that in many schools, it is illegal for teachers to touch students, even to intervene in a fight.When two people are gearing up for a fight, they tend to confront each other with their chests puffed and their shoulders back, staring directly into each other's eyes. Put your body between them during this stage, and you can help break the invisible tension between them.

, If one of the two fighters is ""picking a fight"" or purposely antagonizing the other, this is the person you should attempt to redirect and calm. Use a soothing voice and try to reason with the person.Most people do not want to fight, but fear looking weak if they back down. For that reason, it's your job to give the antagonist an ""out"" or a reason to not fight the other person without losing face. If you know the person, use his or her name, and try phrases that will resonate like, ""What about your kids?"" or ""Do you want to go back to jail?"" If you do not know him or her, try soothing phrases like, ""It's OK, calm down,"" or ""Think about what you're doing; do you really want to face the consequences of a fight?"", This can be very difficult unless you have had training in self-defense or martial arts of some kind, or if you are out of shape or smaller than the attacker. It can also be risky, as you might get injured or be accused of hurting someone.However, there are times when you must intervene to stop someone from hurting someone else.


Get behind the attacker and use a half-nelson grip to take her down.A half-nelson is a wrestling technique designed to take an opponent to the ground. To execute this move, pass your dominant arm under the attacker's arm on the same side (that is, your right arm under her right arm, or your left under her left). Reach your arm up over her back and grip her neck.Pin her other arm using your free arm.

, You can avoid an altercation altogether by recognizing the types of situations that often lead to tense and violent interaction. These often include:


Events where people are drinking too much alcohol. Avoid bars and nightclubs late at night, especially establishments that tend to get rowdy. Leave if you sense that other people are becoming agitated.Road-rage related fights. Be courteous while driving and follow posted signs. If someone tries to confront you, avoid eye contact and drive to the nearest police station.On a school playground. Tell your parents, a teacher, or counselor if someone is threatening to hurt you or if you fear for your safety at school. If they do not do anything to help, tell someone else until you get help. If no one will help you, call the police.

, Rather than engaging with a person who wants to fight you, try to walk or run away from them to avoid a fight.


Remember that in many situations, such as at school or on the job, engaging in a fight can get you in trouble or even put into jail-- even if you think you are only engaging in self-defense.

, If you are being attacked, draw attention of onlookers and passersby to try to get help. If someone is trying to fight you, they might back down if there are more people on your side.


Scream or yell as loudly as possible.
Remember, most people who see a bad situation will not become personally involved if they can help it; it’s a psychological phenomenon known as the ""bystander effect."" Look someone in the eye and instead of asking for help, tell them to help you. If you know their name, use it. Say, ""Help me, this person is trying to attack me,"" or ""Call the police, NOW!"", If you do not have a weapon and you do not know any self defense techniques, you can try using verbal techniques to ""talk down"" your attacker.Try using soothing words. Most people who are angry are unable to think clearly, and their heightened emotional state can take several minutes to return to normal. Try talking to the attacker in a soothing tone of voice for several minutes or as long as possible to give him or her time to return to a more rational state of mind.Make empathetic statements. Often a person will try to fight you because he or she thinks you have done something wrong. While you might vehemently disagree, in order to avoid being hit or otherwise attacked, you can try making statements that show you are empathetic to how the person feels.You might try saying, ""You're right, that was a stupid thing I did. I don't know why I did that, but I'm sorry.""

, If you fear for your safety and want to be truly prepared for someone who might try to fight you or who might attack you, you need to learn how to use physical force to defend yourself.


Take classes from a trained professional in personal self defense or any number of martial art techniques such as jujitsu or tae kwon do. Look for a course that specifically teaches defensive techniques; ask the instructor before signing up if this course is right for you and how long it will take before you learn usable techniques.

, Some level of verbal disagreement is normal in intimate relationships, like that between spouses or between kids and their parents.But disagreements and conflicts should not be handled by fighting.Yelling, name-calling, belittling the other person, threatening to leave, or withholding attention or affection are not healthy ways to fight.Unfortunately, many people grow up in households where these types of fighting are commonplace, and they tend to handle their own disagreements in much the same way throughout life.
In a relationship where fighting is commonplace, it can be difficult to retrain all of the involved parties to stop fighting and instead talk through disagreements in ways that are respectful. But your goal should be a collaborative relationship where differences are resolved through dialogue and where everyone feels safe, respected, and cared for., Instead of a fight, try to understand differences of opinion or disagreements as a problem-solving challenge.


A fight is a situation where you and the other person are against each other. But you and your child, parent, or spouse are not against each other, you are partners! A disagreement is an opportunity to collaborate with your partner for a mutually-satisfying solution.
Reframing a fight as a collaborative partnership doesn't make it easier to solve, but it does change the dynamic of the interaction. It is not you against them, it is you and them against the problem. , Every healthy relationship has rules, whether spoken or unspoken, about what types of behavior are acceptable. If your relationship struggles with fighting, setting ground rules can be a first step toward a more emotionally stable and fulfilling relationship.


Agree about what is off-limits during a disagreement. For example, name-calling, threats to leave, or personal insults should be avoided.
Agree to allow the other person a ""time-out"" if a disagreement begins to become heated. Promise to revisit the issue later, when all parties are calm. Sometimes, just thirty seconds to breathe and cool down is enough; other times, it might be a good idea to go to bed and sleep on it, and resume discussions the next day., The only way to resolve a conflict is to talk through it. Learning how to discuss how you feel and why you are upset can be difficult. It is a good idea to begin practicing during smaller disagreements rather than waiting for big blow-out fights.


State why you are upset. Be clear and specific, and try using ""I"" statements rather than statements that blame the other person. For example, ""I feel frustrated when I have to take out the trash,"" rather than ""You didn't take out the trash.""Let the other person state their side. Be willing to listen and give the benefit of the doubt. Many verbal fights result from a misunderstanding or from jumping to conclusions about another person's motivations., Remember, this is a collaborative activity. Both parties likely have ideas for their own optimal solution, but the goal is to find a solution that works for everyone.Be willing to compromise, especially on issues that really aren't that important to you. It is difficult to come to a true agreement if you only give the other person one option., Remember why you love this person. As frustrating as disagreements may be, you should make a point to reconnect and reassure each other that you are still as committed to them as you were before the disagreement.Hold one another, hug, pat the person on the back, or reconnect in any way you can. Tell the person you care about him or her. , If your family's fighting is out of control or you feel like you or someone else is in danger, tell an adult you trust or call the police.In the United States, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 or 1-800-787-3224 (TTY, for deaf callers).

If they don’t receive your text, or you don’t arrive home when expected, they can check to make sure everything is OK.You can also download an app such as FindMyFriends that allows you to share your location with others, as well as find friends nearby. Several of these apps also contain ways to quickly broadcast your location in an emergency situation.;

You will also feel and appear confident, which reduces your chance of being approached by trouble makers., Always have a fully charged cell phone with you. If you are in trouble, you can quickly call for help. You might also need your phone to use mapping or other functions to get you to your destination safely., A simple whistle is often the easiest way to chase off trouble makers. Pepper spray, which will incapacitate an attacker, is also an option if it is legal in your area.Pepper spray needs a little practice to use correctly. Get comfortable using your thumb to push the button so you can hold the canister securely in the palm of your hand with the other four fingers. Learn how to unlock the safety switch quickly. Practice a few times with your canister to learn how far away you can stand and still reach your target. Some sprays can reach up to 10 feet., Keep a small flashlight on your keychain, where it will always be with you. It will provide light in extra dark areas and give you more confidence. Or learn to use the flashlight mode on your phone. You can download a flashlight app if your phone doesn't have a native flashlight option.

If you are going out alone, you can use an app such as Map My Friends to find friends nearby to meet up with. Or check your university message board to find others looking to go out.Many cities and universities provide free shuttles around town to popular restaurants and clubs. Using this option provides a safe way to get to and from your destination. Another popular option with college students is a ""call a buddy"" system that has volunteers on-call to walk you home., Enter a building or board public transportation with confidence. Walk with your head up. Not only will it help you see what is happening around you, but it will give you an air of confidence that will prevent assailants from approaching you as a weak and easy target.Be confident but don’t attract the wrong kind of attention. Flashy jewelry, large purses, expensive clothing and attention-grabbing antics can make you a target.

, Look around while you walk and pay attention to what is going on around you. It will give you an early warning if someone is looking to make trouble. You’ll want to avoid earphones and any article of clothing, such as a hoodie, that might interfere with your hearing or vision.You don’t want to be distracted by chatting on your phone when walking, but it can sometimes make you feel safer to talk to someone when you are alone so they know where you are. Just make sure the conversation allows you to keep track of those around you.

, Traveling at night, especially if you are alone, isn’t the time to try take new routes or short cuts through unfamiliar neighborhoods. If you must to venture into unfamiliar territory, make sure you have determined a route ahead of time so you don't end up lost. , Walk or drive in well-lit, highly visible areas. Even if it takes you longer, stay on a well-lit route rather than taking shortcuts down dark roads or paths. Stick to streets populated with houses and stores rather than empty lots or vacant stores.


Park in well-lit areas, as well. If it is still light when you park, visualize what the area will look like in the dark when you return. Look for overhead lights and park there.

This plan should include who you will call if you need someone to pick you up. You should also be familiar with safe places along your route that you can run to if needed.

, If confronted, stay calm and confident. Being calm will give you a chance to assess the situation. If your assailants simply want property, it is often safest to give it to them. If they want to cause harm, you need to get away. Run if you can. If you can’t get away, fight as hard as you can. Aim to inflict pain by lashing out at eyes, the bridge of the nose, knees and groin., Attackers don’t want to get caught. Do whatever it takes to attract attention. Yell for help. Scream. Blow the whistle you invested in before you left for the night.Telling people what to do is more effective than yelling something like, “Fire.” Instead, yell, “I’m being attacked – call 911!” Or yell directly at the attacker: “Get your hand off me!” or even just “Stop!”, As soon as you can, get to a safe place, such as a store or nearby house. Call the police and report your incident. Include the details of the confrontation, as well as a description of the perpetrator.

Breathe.",How to Stop Being a Victim," Many of us unwittingly place ourselves in the victim role by denying our own anger and projecting it on to others instead.When we project our anger on to others, we may unreasonably anticipate aggression from them when they’ve given no real signs of it. Instead of denying your emotions, experience them. Do so without labelling them good or bad, right or wrong.


Avoid trying to rationalize your anger. To do so may only cement you further into your victimized feelings. It's okay to feel angry, but it's more healthy to let it go and move on rather than trying to rationalize it and/or act on it.People who dwell on their anger and try to justify it will often distort the reality around them to match their thoughts, for example, by misreading other people’s facial expressions to reflect what they feel as opposed to the reality of a situation.;
, When we feel entitled and that the world owes us good things, we feel cheated when we don’t get these things. This leads to anger and feelings of helplessness (i.e. feeling victimized).Psychologists recommend removing words like “fair,” “should,” “right,” and ""wrong,"" from your vocabulary. These words suggest expectations, and when those aren’t met, you feel frustrated and victimized. Release those expectations and feelings of entitlement. Nobody owes you anything.As an example of how this might work, imagine that your best friend’s parents paid for her schooling, while you had to finance your own way through school. While you struggle to repay your enormous student loan, she is able to spend her money on things like travel, clothes, a new car — she even has a much nicer apartment than you do. Rather than feeling cheated, angry, and resentful toward her, your parents, and maybe even the rest of the world, you can choose to acknowledge the anger and move on. It’s great that she isn’t in debt; it’s not so great that you are in debt. But it’s not right or wrong. And it's not fair or unfair. It just is. You will be happier and more successful in life if you just accept both the situation and your feelings about it, and move on.

, Such thoughts are referred to by some professionals as ""the critical inner voice.”The critical inner voice includes self-destructive thoughts aimed at lowering your self-esteem. These thoughts come from an angry, sad place inside of you; their purpose is to keep you unhappy. All of us have a critical inner voice, but while many of us combat the voice with positive self talk, people who feel victimized believe their critical inner voice.


Many of us are not aware of our negative thoughts, which makes it difficult to identify and counter them. When we identify these thoughts, we can address them. One way to do so is to investigate what causes you to shift from a good mood to a bad one. Keep track of what you tell yourself while you're in that state.An example of a critical inner voice might include feelings of injustice, where you think to yourself, ""This isn't fair."" You may also find yourself generalizing behaviours of other people, for example, thinking ""No one ever asks me how I’m doing.” You may also find that you compare yourself to others, for example, asking “Why do they always get better grades than me?""When you realize that you are doing this, take a moment to ask yourself why.

For example, if your critical inner voice says “No one ever listens to what I have to say,” ask it, “Why do you say that?” Don’t just accept it as fact, because chances are, it isn’t. Even if it is true, the more important question needs to be directed inward so that you can identify and actively work on your negative emotions. After some reflection you might realize that the reason you feel as though nobody listens to you is because you think that you have nothing worth saying, and act accordingly (for example, speaking quietly or not at all in social situations).



, You are not a helpless bystander in your life. If you can change a situation that makes you unhappy or worse, do so; if you cannot change it, adapt — change the way you approach it, change your attitude.The situation that you are in may very well be unfair or horrible, but dwelling on it won't change it. Counter passive, self-victimizing brooding with constructive action.Related to this is the necessity to be proactive. Some situations are unavoidable, but by being proactive you can anticipate and gain some control over a situation rather than merely responding to it after it’s happened. You will even find that you can prevent some undesirable things from happening — for example, you can avoid that bad test score by studying and seeking the necessary help beforehand.

, Maintaining a daily journal will not only help you keep track of your moods and feelings; it will also help you come to terms with them. Again, do not try to justify your feelings. Use the journal to observe and adapt — to learn how to experience your feelings without being taken over by them. If you’re in a situation that you want to get out of, use the journal to explore ways in which you might do that.

, The more time you spend doing things you enjoy, the less time you will have for brooding on negative things that encourage you to feel like a victim. Make a commitment to actively participating in your life rather than passively, helplessly watching it go by.


Take dance classes, join a sports team, pick up a musical instrument, or learn a language.
Spend more time with people who make you feel like the best version of you. If you don’t know anyone like that, join a club or community of some sort (for example, an online community of like-minded film fans), and make some new friends.

, Part of taking control of your feelings and emotions includes taking care of your body. Regular exercise will help you release stress and gain confidence. A healthy diet will help regulate your moods — not to mention, it’s much easier to get in touch with your emotions when you’re not riding the highs and lows brought on by a poor diet.

, It will take time to adopt the habits that are necessary to gaining control over your life and learning to stop being a victim. Don’t make yourself feel worse by getting angry when you find that you’re falling back into the victim mentality. Just take a deep breath, forgive yourself, and start again.

, Communicate with others in a way that lets them know your wants and needs while still respecting theirs.


When being assertive, use “I” statements; facts rather than judgments; take ownership of your thoughts and feelings; and make clear, direct requests rather than phrasing them as questions to which people can respond “no.”An example might be to say, “I have noticed that you often leave your dishes in the sink rather than putting them into the dishwasher. When I come home from work/school I get anxious when see them there, and I feel the need to clean the kitchen up before I can start making my own dinner. Let’s come up with a timeframe for doing dishes that we can both live with.”


If assertive communication is new behaviour for you, be prepared for people who know you to be confused by the change. It may be helpful to explain to them that you are trying to change the way that you communicate., Part of being assertive means setting clear boundaries. The purpose of setting these is to protect yourself and also to give others a clear idea of what you are and are not willing to put up with.


An example of setting a boundary might be, with an alcoholic relative, to tell them that you enjoy their company, but you do not like the way that they behave when they are drunk; as a result, if they call you or come over when they are drunk, you will hang up on them or not let them into your house.

, Exuding confidence is largely about body language. When communicating with someone, some key things that you can do to appear confident include maintaining good posture, making eye contact, and being calm and positive.


When standing, good posture means keeping your shoulders straight, back and relaxed, your abdomen pulled in, your feet hip distance apart, your weight balanced evenly on both feet, and your hands hanging naturally at your sides. In addition, you’ll have a gentle bend to your knees (don’t lock them), and your head will be balanced on your neck, not tilted forward, back, or to the side.Assertive body language includes facing the person to whom you are speaking; standing or sitting tall; avoiding dismissive gestures such as rolling your eyes or waving your hand as if to wave their response away; staying serious but pleasant; and maintaining a calm and non abrasive tone of voice.Mirroring the other person can help them feel more comfortable and may create a better environment for communication., To empathize with someone is to understand and share their feelings; to sympathize with them is to feel pity and sorrow for them.Expressing or eliciting sympathetic responses only reinforces victimized thinking.When you seek or give sympathy, you are seeking/giving pity. You might find that when expressing your problems, you encourage people to feel sorry for you by emphasizing how powerless you are in the situation. You might find that they offer solutions and/or even try to rescue you. The desire to rescue someone usually comes from a good place, but it also tells the person you seek to rescue that you don't believe they can help themselves. A sympathetic response to a complaint might be, ""I feel so sorry for you. Have you tried XYZ?""When you seek or give empathy, you are seeking/giving support. Someone who offers empathy offers understanding without pity. A person who empathizes with you shares in your emotions but believes that you can help yourself. An example of an empathetic response to a complaint might be, ""I can imagine how difficult this must be for you. What do you need right now?""When we act helpless and seek sympathy, we place ourselves in the position of victim and we ask others to be our rescuers. This is unfair both to ourselves and our would-be rescuers. An empathetic approach emphasizes mutual respect and the belief that we care about each other but know that we are capable of taking care of ourselves.

, If you’re feeling angry, stressed out, anxious, or otherwise upset in some way, take a moment to calm yourself through breathing. Breathe in deeply through your nose, thinking of your breath as inflating your stomach, rather than your chest.

Go to the gas station during the day if possible.,
Look for a well-lit gas station in a reasonably safe neighborhood.,
Once you find a pump and get out of your car, turn off the vehicle and lock the doors.,
Keep your personal items by your side.,
Pump your gas and move on.",How to Stay Safe at a Gas Station," Generally speaking, incidents are more likely to occur if you go to a gas station after dark or especially in the middle of the night, when there are few others around. If you're on the road early in the morning and run out of gas, call a roadside assistance service for help or ask a friend/family member to pick you up instead.;
, Sometimes you may not have a choice, but you shouldn't have to feel nervous when stopping for gas in a dark area or an unsafe part of town if you have other options.

, Never leave your car running idle or your doors unlocked as you get gas, even for a few moments or if there is someone inside it.

, Do not leave your purse, wallet, phone, etc. in the car.

, After you've filled up and paid, close up the gas tank and return to your vehicle promptly. Don't dawdle.

The most obvious one of all time, don't make noise!,If you are hiding somewhere that's not complete (e.g a curtain, the sofa), try hard to keep your feet, elbows and knees hidden, as they are the hardest body parts to conceal completely, due to the lack of flexibility

,
Don't move a muscle.,
Make yourself two things; extremely spread out (As long as you are still well covered) or extremely small and scrunched up.,
Wear clothing that is darkly mottled, as it will break up the landscape, avoiding the problem of people seeing the basic outline of a person and at the same time camouflaging yourself.

,
If you have time, try to shift the objects to roughly the place it was before, so that the room does not look distinctly different.

,
In contrast to that, you may have to shift objects to cover you, although it's a good idea to hold back on that unless absolutely necessary, as keen eyes will pick out the differences, unless they are minute, which in that case won't help you much either.

",How to Stay Hidden in a Situation," If you have a cellphone, keep it in your hands so that you can instantly press end if someone calls you or texts you.;
,, Don't twitch, don't itch. If you are staring at someone and someone stares back, don't avert your gaze-- it could result in an involuntary move of your head. If someone's attention is diverted, don't try to make a dash for it, your cover will be instantly broken. In short, DON'T MOVE WHATSOEVER!

, This helps break up the obvious body shape of humans, causing the onlooker to believe it's not what it is.

Find a good teacher.,
Look for slow flowing movements without changes in tempo (except for the Chen form).,
Cultivate a daily practice.,
Take your time.,
Practice Yichuan (standing meditation) as well.,
Persevere.",How to Start Learning Tai Chi," They should be able to explain and show the movements well. If your teacher's movements are coarse or abrupt, that should raise questions. When explaining what certain movements are for, there should be a balance between grand concepts (cultivating chi, uniting movement and intent, etc.) and very tangible examples (opening the hips, developing balance by conditioning muscles, aligning the body to negate physical force, etc.). If the instructor spends a lot of time talking about extraordinary abilities or talents they developed but can't show you, this is again questionable.;
, A solid, always relaxed stance in another good sign. Also key is that every movement in Tai Chi should be connected, whole body movements. The waist (center, or Tan Tien) is the initiator and drive behind everything we do.

, Whether it's ten minutes or two hours, do what works but do it everyday. Your Tai Chi time should be as integral and unquestioned an activity as brushing your teeth.

, Tai Chi is a lifelong process and every step along the way is enjoyable. It's never quantity of movement that matters with the Internal Arts. Far better to deeply know a couple of postures from the form and train them several times a day than to superficially know a (or multiple) whole forms and run through them every day. You will have a much more satisfying experience from the deeper practice.

, There are specific Yichaun postures or you can use any posture from the Tai Chi form as your standing meditation. Yichaun is incredibly valuable both in priming your mind for the practice and developing the ability to relax and root your body. Try it out by holding a posture for ten minutes; smooth, long breaths into the abdomen; gaze off over the horizon; all of the joints relaxed and open; whenever a thought or distraction comes up, let it go and come back to watch the breath. Stand through discomfort but not through pain. If you start to shake that's great; it's your body shedding deep stored tension. If ten minutes is too much at first, no problem, start with five, or two. As your stand becomes easier, follow that retreating limit and let yourself stand longer.

, You should feel challenged by your practice but enjoy every minute of it.

Reframe your thinking.,
Practice talking to the person.,
Act with confidence.,
Boost your self-esteem.,
Surround yourself with people that care about you.,
Stay calm and in control when you talk.,
Keep your interactions short.",How to Stand Up to Your Enemies at School1," Thinking of someone as your ""enemy"" makes things very black-or-white — it ignores that people are complicated and not simply ""good"" or ""evil."" Ask yourself — why do you consider this person an enemy? What have they done or who are they to you that makes them your enemy? Try to view them as people, the same as the you, and shake the good vs. bad label. When someone does something rude or mean, it can help you keep your cool and not take it personally to remember that they're just a person and they are probably taking something out on you.


Developing empathy can help you ditch the black-or-white thinking. Empathy allows you to put yourself in someone else's shoes and try to understand their perspective. If, for example, a classmate is rude to you, instead of taking it personally and getting hurt or mad, you might think, ""Our teacher yelled at him earlier today, and I could tell he was embarrassed. Now he's trying to take that out on me. This has to do with him feeling embarrassed and nothing to do with me."";
, You can feel more confident standing up to the person if you practice what you are going to say and how you are going to say it.Think about what you are going to say. Write it down if you need to, so that you can get your wording just right.
Practice what you want to say at home in the mirror, or even in the bathroom mirror at school, if you need to.
For example, you might look in the mirror and say, “I am confident and I can stand up for myself.”
You can also ask a friend of yours to practice with you. You could say, “Barbara, will you help me practice what I want to say to Emile?”

, Even if you don’t feel so confident, you can stand up to someone if you act like you are confident. Whenever you are around the person, act as if you are sure of yourself.Take a deep breath or two to calm yourself down. You’ll act more confidently if you’re calm and relaxed. Stand up straight, loosen your shoulders and push them back a bit.
Relax your arms and hands. If you are carrying something, then just hold it — don’t grip it like your life depends on it.
Hold your head up and look forward and around you when you are walking.Look people in the eyes when you talk to them.
Nothing shows confidence more than a great smile. If it helps, think of something funny to make yourself smile.
For example, when you are going into the lunchroom and you know someone you don't get along with is there, take a deep breath, hold up your head and smile as you walk through the doors.

, When you feel good about yourself you will find it easier to stand up for yourself. So, make sure to do things that improve your self-image and your opinion of yourself.Use positive self-talk. Say things to yourself like, “I’m a great person. I am brave, smart, and people like me. Most important, I like me.”
Make a list or a journal entry describing all the good things about you and the things that you can do.
For example, you might write, “I’m caring, friendly, and I can play soccer, basketball, and football.”

, Being around your family and friends can give you the courage and support you need to stand up to bullies and advocate for yourself.They can help you feel good about yourself and help you figure out ways to deal with people you don't get along with.


Talk to the people close to you about what is going on. Ask them for suggestions for dealing with it. You could say, “Can I talk to you about someone at school?”
Spend time doing things that you enjoy like watching a movie or going for a bike ride. Doing things with people that care about you will improve your mood and self-esteem.
If you don’t have time to get together in person, then make the time to call or video chat your friends and family.

, If you start yelling and screaming at the person, or get physically violent, you will be giving them the reaction they want.Instead, stand up to the person by talking to them in a calm, confident, controlled voice that lets them know you are serious.


Look the person in the eyes and speak in a clear, assertive voice. You don’t have to sound mean, but you don’t want to sound scared either.
For example, if someone calls you a rude name, don’t start yelling rude things back. Instead, look them in the eyes and stay calm.
Try saying, “I’m tired of you bothering me at school. I don’t have time for it, so just leave me alone.”
Or, you might try, “This is childish. I have better things to do than waste time with you, and I’m sure you do to.”

, The less time you spend around bullies or people you don't get along with, the less time they will have to say something to get on your nerves. You can stand up for yourself if you say what you need to say and then move on.


Don’t give bullies time to say anything bad about you or give you a hard time. Act like you are busy or on the way somewhere when you see them.
For example, a bully is coming into class when you are leaving and they say something rude, just say “Whatever” or ignore them and keep walking out of the door.
If you feel threatened or like the situation is getting violent or out of hand, you should just leave. Go somewhere where other people are around or that you feel safe.

Turn them into friends.,
Apologize if you need to.,
Ignore them.",How to Stand Up to Your Enemies at School2," There are some people at your school that you may pick on and make fun of as much as they pick on you and make fun of you. You might compete against each other, but you aren’t afraid of them. These people can be called frenemies (a mix of the words ""friend"" and ""enemy""). You may want to change your thinking and your relationship to this person, turning your rivals into friends. Once you know what’s causing the conflict, you can try to resolve it and work on becoming friends.Tell the person you want to have a mature talk about the problems between you. Talk in private so other people don’t influence the conversation.
For instance, you could say, “Denise, I want to talk to you after class about the rivalry between us without being mean to each other.”
Talk about the problems between you and what you can do to solve them.
You might say, “Why do you think we don't get along? I think it’s because we act so much alike. What can we do to get along or at least stop being mean to each other?”

, Sometimes the reason that you don't get along with someone is because you did something to them that upset them. It doesn’t matter who started it, you can be the better person by apologizing. In these cases, the best way to resolve this conflict is to say that you are sorry for what you did.


Ask the person if you can talk alone. Try saying, “Eddie, can the two of us talk after school?”
Be sincere and specific when you apologize. Don’t just say “Sorry,” actually say what you are apologizing for.
For example, “I want to apologize for the rumor I started. It was really immature of me. I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings and I’m really sorry.”

, In some cases, no matter what you do, you can’t become friends with a person. That's okay — you don't have to be friends with everyone. You can deal with this person by not giving them any attention at all.Ignoring them is more mature than arguing and being mean. Also, it's very easy to mess up a comeback. They want to get a reaction from you, so don't grant them your attention.


During class, ignore whatever they say or do. Focus on your classwork or your friends. Don’t even give them a glance.
Before and after school and between classes, keep your attention on getting where you are going or whatever you are doing.
For example, if you see the person coming down the hall, just keep walking without even looking at them.
Or, for instance, if you are in the lunchroom, keep talking to your friends, eating your lunch or whatever else you were doing.

Tell an adult about bullying.,
Go places in a group.,
Tell the bullies to stop.,
Avoid a fight.",How to Stand Up to Your Enemies at School3," Although you may not really like ""frenemies,"" you are probably not afraid of them. They might do things that make you mad, but not that really hurt your feelings. A bully, on the other hand, picks on you and makes you feel bad about yourself, afraid, nervous, or anxious.You should stand up to a bully by letting an adult know what is going on.


You might do the same things to your bully that they do to you. But if someone is bullying you, you may be too afraid to stand up to them at first.
Bullies may purposely do things to humiliate or hurt you, even if it doesn’t benefit them at all.
If you are being bullied, tell a teacher, counselor, or your parents what’s going on. They can help you stand up to the bully and get the bully to stop.
You might say to your teacher, “Mr. Jordan, another student has been bullying me lately. Can we talk about it?”
Or, you could say, “Mom, can I talk to you about someone that has been bullying me at school?”

, Bullies generally like to bother people when their victim is alone, so try to always keep someone with you.Not only will having someone with you help you stand up to your bully, it will also make it less likely the bully will do anything to retaliate.


Ask a friend or someone else you trust to walk with you before school, after school, and in-between classes.
You might say to your friend, “Hey, could you walk to class with me? Dylan’s been bullying me and I’ll feel better standing up to him if I have someone with me.”
If you do find yourself alone with your bullies, try to quickly go somewhere where there are other people around.

, Telling them to stop then walking away from them lets your bullies know that you don’t like what they are doing and that you aren’t going to take it. But, it doesn’t give them anytime to respond or do anything back to you.


When the bullies say something to you, simply look them in the eyes and say, “Stop,” then walk away.
Or you could say, “Just leave me alone,” and then leave the classroom or the area.

, You may want to get physical and fight back as a way to stand up to your bullies at school.But, this isn’t a good idea. Fighting can result in someone getting seriously injured or in serious trouble — you could get suspended or even expelled. If you must, then defend yourself enough to get away from your bullies.


If you think the situation is going to turn violent or you feel threatened, then leave immediately. Go find an adult and tell them.
If possible, call emergency services, like 911, if you think you are about to be physically hurt.
If the situation is getting physical, you may need to use self-defense to protect yourself long enough to get away.

Participate in physical activities.,
Learn to deal with stress.,
Make friends outside of school.",How to Stand Up to Your Enemies at School4," It will be much easier for you to stand up for yourself if you are well rested. Lack of sleep can make you irritable, slow to react, and easily confused. So make sure that you are getting plenty of rest each night.


Teenagers need between 9 and 9 ½ hours of sleep to be healthy. Make sure you go to bed at a time that allows you to get this much sleep. (Most teenagers only get about 7 hour of sleep each night.)Do things like taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book, or sipping some tea to get ready for bed.
Turn off your phone and other electronic devices so that you can sleep without alarms and alerts waking you up.

, It will be hard for you to stand up to someone if you feel hungry, tired, or just generally bad because you aren’t eating right. Taking care of your body and eating right is one way to make sure you feel good.


Make sure you are eating enough fresh fruits and vegetables because they can give you energy.
Drink plenty of water and avoid drinks with a lot of sugar or caffeine.
Try to eat three to four meals a day and have small snacks in between. Make sure you are eating breakfast to start your day off right.

, Doing something active can help you stand up for yourself by improving your self esteem, giving you more energy, and making you healthier.It can also help you release any tension or stress that you might be feeling because of the situation.


Join a team sport like basketball, soccer, or hockey so that you can spend time around positive people.
Try something like martial arts, yoga, Zumba, or a self-defense class.
Go for a walk, jog, hike, or swim to be active and give yourself time to clear your mind.

, Being bullied or having trouble getting along with others can cause a lot of stress, which may make matters even worse. Learning healthy, productive ways to deal with stress can help in many ways — improving your health, your mindset, and may even help you stay calm in the face of conflict.


Try deep breathing to calm yourself in the moment or when you feel anxious or stressed out.
Make sure you are giving yourself enough time during the day to relax and do things you enjoy. Avoid over-scheduling yourself and that you have a few nights a week and time on the weekend to relax and just watch TV, play games, or do whatever you feel like.
Try meditation.
Remember that exercise is a great way to de-stress, too.

, Sometimes people feel like they just don't fit in with their classmates. Your school may feel like it's your entire world, but there are actually tons of people out there to befriend. See if your town or city offers clubs that draw from multiple schools, things like boy scouts or girl scouts, 4-H clubs, book clubs, or clubs based on hobbies (chess, programming, knitting, etc.). Check the YMCA for sports or activity clubs.


Try taking art classes at community centers or studios.
Reach out to people at your place of worship.
Get involved in volunteering and meet others through service.
If you like gaming and/or comic books, look for a gaming store that has events, such as trivia nights or times when people get together to play card games or board games.
Get a part-time job if you are old enough.

, Letters, notes,and photos are powerful proof that will help you later. Keep letters in a file, and possibly a list of other things you have received from your stalker.

Also, in case anything should happen to you, you will have a record of your stalker's behavior for others to find.

, Take an adult you trust and go face to face with them. Always let someone know where you are going. Or have a policeman question them as to why they are following you. This usually chases them away or establishes a reason why you do not have to fear them.

, Contact your gym teacher, or a personal trainer. They will usually help you and give you a couple of pointers. Martial arts schools are abundant these days, and if you cannot afford classes, they usually have offers for a trial period. Usually you can just observe, and try to learn a few things that way.

, Go to the nearest public place(a restaurant or store) and call for help. When this person is starting to make you feel uncomfortable, warn them that you have called for help. Give them a squirt with your perfume or scream to get attention, because you warned them and you're really getting tired of it.

, If the behavior continues for long periods of time, or you feel truly fear for your safety, contact the police department and they will tell you how to file for a restraining order, and you will have to go before a judge to plead your case. Generally you need at least three(3) pieces of evidence, such as a letter, taped phone call, and/or witnesses that will voice for your claims.

Don't engage.,
Let the angry driver pass.,
Avoid eye contact.,
Stay in your car.,
Do not lead an angry driver to your home.,
Seek a safe place.",How to Respond to a Road Raged Driver1," If you find yourself in a potential or actual conflict with another driver, back off and give them some space on the road. If the other driver begins to drive recklessly, slow down and change your route. You want to stay calm and avoid getting into a traffic accident with this person.


Remember that an angry driver is dangerous. They can cause significant harm with their car. In some cases, a driver may even be carrying a weapon. Regardless of whether you feel confident that you are in the right, it is incredibly dangerous to engage and escalate an argument in cases of road rage.;
, You can avoid road rage or reduce the chance that anger will grow by putting distance between yourself and the other driver. Let other cars into your lane to create a buffer between you and the angry driver., In the midst of a heated exchange, eye contact can escalate anger. The other driver may mistake eye contact as a taunt or a personal affront regardless of your intentions. As you allow the other driver to pass, keep your eyes on the road ahead of you., Roll-up your windows and lock your doors. This will put a fairly strong barrier between you and the other motorist. This alone does not ensure your safety, but a buffer can deter or slow an attacker.


Remember that the other driver may already be angry from another experience. Their anger may be displaced, but it can be dangerous. Do not try to reason with a person expressing road rage.

, If you are still moving and the other driver begins to follow you, do not drive to your home or place of work. Keep distance between an enraged driver and yourself and prevent them from learning where they can find you., If the other driver is aggressively pursuing you, look for a safe neutral place that will get you out of traffic. A police station or a fire department is a good option. If you cannot find one, look for a parking lot of a busy shopping center. Do not drive home or into enclosed spaces such as parking structures."

Call the police.,
Give the dispatcher your cell phone number.,
Do not embellish circumstances.,
Get the license number.,
Attract attention with your horn and lights.",How to Respond to a Road Raged Driver2," When road rage poses a danger to you or other drivers, call 911 or dial 411 and ask to be connected to the local police department dispatch. Since it can take several minutes for responders to arrive, it is important to call as soon as a dangerous situation becomes evident.


If road rage is limited to angry gestures, it is likely that you do not need to call the police. If an angry driver follows you, or directly threatens you, it is appropriate to report the incident. In these situations, you are the best authority regarding whether the other driver is a danger that should be reported to the police. Trust your instinct.
If you are regularly in heavy traffic, or anticipate being on congested roadways in a certain area, ask the local emergency responders the best way to reach them in an emergency. 911 may not be the most effective way to contact police from a cell phone., Once you connect with the dispatcher, give them your cell phone number in case you get disconnected. Give them your location, as exactly as you can., It may be tempting to exaggerate the danger that you face or to try to downplay your own wrong-doing in a case of road rage. Avoid this course of action as you could make the officers’ job harder and, in some circumstances, you can be arrested for filing a false police report., Responding police will want a description of the dangerous driver and car. If you are able, write down the license number or have a passenger do so.


Be prepared to give a description of the vehicle and the driver. It is important for the police to have accurate descriptions so that they can recognize what is happening as soon as they arrive on the scene.

, It can take time for emergency responders to reach you, so address the situation. Road rage events may be difficult to reach or low on their list of priorities. If you don't think you're getting the attention that you need, keep yourself safe. If it means using your horn and turning on your hazard lights to get the attention of other motorists, do it. Your safety is more important than keeping traffic moving."

Show remorse.,
Let the other driver win.,
Calm yourself.,
Analyze your driving.",How to Respond to a Road Raged Driver3," If your cars are still operating in traffic, signal remorse by waving or mouthing “I’m sorry.” It is possible that you did nothing wrong, but your priority should be to deescalate the situation rather than sort out blame accurately.

Apologize. If you are stopped and the driver approaches you, acknowledge you were wrong. Do this even if their anger is disproportionate, or if you do not think you were wrong.

, This is hard to do, but letting them ""win"" could quickly bring further problems to a short end. Your main goal should be to stay safe, rather than to win an argument. Avoid inflammatory statements, and allow the driver to feel like they have gotten what they wanted.

Give up a parking space even if you were there first, let the other driver merge into your lane even if isn’t their turn, give more breathing room between your cars, or leave the fast lane even if you are driving at the correct speed.
Ignore insults. The enraged driver may insult you. Remember that they are angry and that their insults do not truly apply to you. Do not reciprocate when insulted. Calmly but assertively state that a neutral authority should resolve the conflict.

, In some cases, you may be just as angry as the other driver. Before you engage in direct confrontation, take basic steps to calm your own nerves.

Breathe deeply, counting each time you inhale to ten. Remind yourself of who you are beyond the stressful moment. Think about how your family, friends, or coworkers expect you to act.Think about something that you are looking forward to. Look past the unpleasant moment and remember that it will be over soon.

, After the incident, when you've calmed down, reexamine the events that took place. Determine if you did anything wrong or if a specific action may have helped cause the other driver’s anger. Now that you are safe, it doesn't matter who was at fault. Simply determine if there is something that you can do differently next time to avoid triggering other motorist’s rage.

Avoid walking down any corridors, alleyways, or streets where there is only one or two ways in or out. The more open the street, the easier it will be for you to get to safety., If a person is moving toward you in an aggressive manner, you may want to yell or honk your horn to draw attention to the fact that you are in danger. By honking or simply yelling “help me,” you could both scare off the offender and get someone to come to your assistance.If you’re in a car, consider honking and turning on your emergency lights. This will alert passersby and emergency service personnel that you need assistance.
While making noise could alert others to the fact that you are in danger, it could also anger the person following you and cause them to hurt you.

, If your efforts to avoid them fail and they physically get ahold of you, you should seriously consider giving them your money or valuables so they don’t hurt you.

You can do this in a car or on foot. Ultimately, crossing the street will give you an idea of whether the person is actually following you.Take another turn, if the person followed you on the last turn. If they turn again, they’re likely following you.

, Do this if the situation can't simply be resolved by simply handing over said item, or it's one of your family members. Remember that police respond to emergencies that involve a weapon faster. However, if it's just you alone, you must put distance between you and the attacker to buy enough time for this step.

, Do this if police have not arrived at the scene. This can be a good way of resolving it without any hasty actions and who knows you may stall until the police arrive.


When the police arrive, the attacker will try to escape the scene. However, if you know what the attacker looks like, you must give the police this information as soon as possible or the attacker may never be taken off the streets.

, Sometimes you may have no time to call emergency services, so it's time to fight back, especially if giving the item doesn't save you or you are not being robbed and simply are a victim of domestic or street violence.


For this step, you can use any weapon that fate will throw at you, like sticks rocks and even dirt. These weapons can help you if the attacker isn't wearing glasses or a balaclava.

Go slowly at first. Your muscle memory is always recording, no matter your speed.

, Flow through each step of the technique. If you get to where you feel like you're jerking from one step to the next, slow it down.

, On the street you might be doing this to help defend against that knife slash you didn't see coming, but in the gym doing this helps dodge or parry your training partner's strikes that just fly out of them. These things happen as the body starts to learn to do certain things when ""targets"" appear (like punching to the chin if there's a sliver of a chance). Don't get mad at them - it's not a choice they make. Krav Maga trains muscles to strike when opportunities open up without conscious input from the person.

, They can be quite annoying when working on plucks, chokes, and weapon take aways, but when punching they will help keep you from rolling your wrist. Once you get the hang of punching correctly, you probably will not need these any longer.

, This involves violently folding the attacker's wrist down over itself (towards the under-side of the arm towards the elbow). It is meant to break the attacker's wrist, so go slowly and don't injure your training partner's wrist.

, In Krav Maga, it is important to be able to fight equally well with either your right hand or left. If you have a hurt hand, make it your power side and go easy with it. If punching hurts, do heel palms instead or vice-versa.

, This is a great thing to do while in a fight, but terrible for every other time.


Take some time several times each day to pinch your shoulder blades together. Hold them there with your arms out to your sides (palms up) at 90 degrees, bent at the elbow like you're imitating an angel (your hands should be about level with your shoulders), and slowly raise your arms over your head while keeping your shoulder blades together and touch your index fingers together.
You may need to back up to a wall to ensure you have your shoulders rolled as far back as you can and your back is not rolled so that your stomach is poking out. Slowly go up and down 6 to 10 times. Do this before each workout for sure, and a few times each day whether you need it or not.

, These can be bought in bulk powder and some people find they help with crummy joints."
"
Understand when this injury is likely.,
Get your nutrition right.,
Take creatine.,
Keep doing the techniques.",How to Prevent Common Krav Maga Injuries4," In Krav Maga, the 360 knife defense involves slamming the blade of your forearm into the attacker's forearm. You're going to get a bruise, and so will the attacker. When doing groin kicks or round kicks, you want to hit the attacker with your shin, not your foot. This means you will get bruises on your shins too.

, Since you're working out, you should be eating a high-protein, high-carb, low fat diet. It's trendy to not eat carbs, but they are key in muscle and tissue growth, so you want them. You can get your carbs from vegetables instead of pasta if you want, but get about a gram of protein and carbs per half-kilo or one pound of lean muscle.


Getting enough vitamins helps bruises heal.

, It helps build muscle, and you should take 4 to 6 grams each day. It forces muscles to store water, and this helps in their recovery. This reduces the time your bruises take to heal, and also helps reduce muscle soreness.

, After a great deal of repetition (and bruising), your nerves will become fairly numb and you won't even notice the bruises anymore. Your forearms and shins will go numb instead of hurting, allowing you to hit much harder. This takes about a year of constant training to achieve.

Understand the risks.,
Cut your fingernails.,
Wear soft weight lifting gloves that do not have gripping material on them, preferably without velcro either.",How to Prevent Common Krav Maga Injuries5," There is a lot of grappling that goes on when trying to wrest a knife or gun from someone, or when breaking a choke. Some gear (like striking pads) can also cause cuts or abrasions, which means wounds that have to be covered. Here's how to minimize this.

, If you can't remember to cut them, start biting. Keeping your fingernails trimmed short will prevent you from ""cat scratching"" your partners, and they will appreciate that. They certainly won't appreciate when you accidentally slice off a strip of skin when you try to control the wrist of the hand that is holding the knife up to your throat because you have a tight grip, long nails and they tried to twist away.

, Under Armor makes some great weight gloves like this, but there are probably other brands available too. These gloves will prevent straps on pads from biting into the web of your hand between the thumb and first finger, causing blisters or cuts. They also may prevent the callous you grow from taking guns away on your index fingers. This may or may not be a good thing, you decide.

"
"
Try to take care of your knees during any fitness activity.,
Squat properly.,
Don't kick your partner in the knee.,
Look into the use of Collagen and/or Glucosamine Chondroiton.",How to Prevent Common Krav Maga Injuries6," Knees don't usually get hurt from Krav Maga per-se, but more from fitness injuries acquired somewhere else. For that reason, this may be too little, too late, but it's something to watch out for.

, Your weight should be evenly distributed along the outside of your foot, and in your heels. Your legs should not be bowed in or out, but bent 90 degrees. Your knees should not go beyond your toes at any time in the squat. Sit back like you're sitting in a chair. Keep your back straight and eyes up.

, If you can't kick higher than that - start aggressively stretching. In a street fight, kicking someone in the knee and exploding it is a good way to slow down an attacker, but don't do it in the gym.

, They might help with this as well.

Prepare in advance with skills and practice before trying to immerse yourself in large groups or public situations.,
Practice pulling in the range of your feeling others while at home, or with a few trusted friends.,
Practice two cognitive exercises that seem to work well for a good amount of the Empathic population.,
Practice both exercises daily for at least one week before using them in public or in large groups.,
Create a situation after one week where you will be with many other people, and record after how you felt.

,
Stay aware of the bubble.,
Continue to do this, both the exercises and the planned group activities, and continuing taking notes as these will often demonstrate both growth in your blocking abilities, and the amount of time you have of being guarded.,
Beware of pushing feelings at others during these times.",How to Reduce Becoming Overwhelmed for Empaths,";
, Some Empaths have an extensive range, however one can pull that range back in rather the same fashion that one pushes out receptiveness out when we sense someone is in trouble.

,


Picture yourself in a bubble that is not clear where all feelings, thoughts or physical pain is muted due to the bubble. This will shorten your range, and decrease the impact of any stray feelings you do pick up.
When alone, picture yourself in a situation where you are surrounded by mirrors facing out. You can still see, but feelings, thoughts and physical challenges are reflected back at others, and do not pass through to you.

, Although these are simply cognitive constructs, the do allow us to narrow our bandwidth (as people do physically and mentally broadcast their feelings) as well allow one to pull the scanning abilities inwards.

,, Awareness of the bubble or the mirrors must be maintained during immersion in groups of people for them to work.


Erosion will happen to these defenses the longer we are in highly charged situations with others. Become aware of when others emotions begin to seep in, and record the amount of time that has passed.







,


This model of exercising and taking notes will enable you to extract yourself from the situation before you would begin to feel overwhelmed.

, Although we tend to do that often, and there is an attraction to it, it will only serve to break up the barriers you have worked to develop.

Be aware of your surroundings, always.,
Travel with someone whenever possible, especially at night.,
Act with purpose.,
Lock your car doors.,
Lock your doors and windows at home.",How to Protect Yourself from a Serial Killer1," Pay attention to where exits are located, objects and visual obstructions near you, and the people in your immediate area (or a lack of others entirely).Know where the nearest populated environment is to your current location, in case you feel threatened and need to seek a crowd.
Know where the nearest police or fire station is in areas you normally drive through.
Don’t mistake familiarity for security. Even if you are in a parking lot you often drive through or stop in during the day, do not assume it is also a safe place at night.;
, Whether you are walking down the street or to your car, driving around an unfamiliar place, or jogging in a park, it is always better to be with someone you know than alone.If you must go somewhere alone, leave a note for your family or housemates telling them where you are going and at what time.
If you live alone, text a friend or family member letting them know where you will be and when to expect to hear from you next.

, Walk confidently, looking ahead, like you know exactly where you are heading. Never look lost or unsure of what you are doing or where you are going.Don’t ask random people for directions. Go to a business and ask an employee instead.
Always park near a street lamp in lots. This will keep your car illuminated at night and also will be easier to remember where you parked so you aren’t walking aimlessly around the lot or deck looking for your car.

, Do this as soon as you get into your car. Avoid sitting in a parking lot fiddling with the radio, checking your phone, putting on your seatbelt, or anything else you tend to do before you start driving.Always keep your doors locked while driving, especially in urban areas where there are lots of stoplights and intersections., Many times criminals choose their victims by trying out doorknobs or windows in a neighborhood until they find one that is unlocked.

Beware of needy strangers.,
Trust your gut instinct.,
Never let strange people into your home.,
Avoid giving personal information to strangers.",How to Protect Yourself from a Serial Killer2," It is always nice to help people, but women, especially, tend to be extra sympathetic. Killers often prey on these sympathies to incite women to drop their guard. If someone tries to stop you for any reason—whether they need your help or are claiming to be helping you out of the goodness of their hearts—don’t automatically assume their intentions are sincere.Say “no” if someone unknown asks for your help getting to/into his or her vehicle. Whether they are limping with a cane, carrying too many packages, or whatever the reason is, if it sounds fishy, decline to help.
Avoid giving directions to unknown people in isolated areas. If they really need directions, they will drive to the nearest service station or call someone on their cell phone.

, If someone approaching you gives you the creeps, do not engage them in any way. Anyone in your surrounding area that makes you feel uncomfortable should be avoided. If you are entering into a situation that feels like it might go horribly wrong, get out of it immediately.


Be wary of getting into an elevator with a suspicious person, male or female. Wait for the next one and risk being considered rude.If a car parked next to yours looks suspicious, like a panel van, go back inside and ask someone to escort you to your car.Someone with a long story with lots of details describing how and why they need your help is likely making their story up. There is nothing wrong with saying, “No, sorry, I can’t help you.”, If someone approaches your door as a service person you were not expecting, call the company and verify before opening the door. Anyone claiming to need assistance can wait until a police patrol car arrives to help them., Make your social network profiles private and never post where you are or where you will be at any specific time. If you participate in online dating, don’t give out your home or work address without having met the person a few times.


Always schedule dates (whether romantic or “friend-dates”) with new acquaintances in well-populated public areas.

Run away.,
Hide from your attacker, if you cannot escape the scene.,
Yell “Back Off!” and push your attacker.,
Carry and learn to use pepper spray.,
Learn self-defense techniques from a trained instructor.,
Use your strongest body parts to counterattack.,
Aim for their most vulnerable body parts.,
Use everyday objects as weapons if necessary.,
Learn to escape typical grab attacks.",How to Protect Yourself from a Serial Killer3," If you feel threatened by a suspicious person or are approached by a would-be attacker, the best way to avoid getting hurt is to run away from this person and towards a well-populated public area. Escaping is the quickest way to end an attack.


Don’t rely on adrenaline to give you super speed. Engage in regular exercise so that you are physically strong enough to run quickly and far enough to get away.
Wear reasonable shoes anytime you are walking around by yourself. Unless you wear your heels to the gym, you won’t be able to run well in them. Save fashion footwear for nights out with a group of friends, or keep a pair of flats with you for walking.

, Plan a safe hiding location inside your home, preferably with 2 nearby exits. If a serial killer comes in one exit, you should be able to get out of the second one.


Make sure the put your phone on silent and hold so that it doesn’t vibrate., Keep your voice confident and authoritative and yell as loudly as possible. If anyone is within hearing distance, you might attract their attention. Even if no one hears you, you have shown your attacker that you are not an easy target and are not worth the risk.This is better than yelling “help!” Sometimes people will avoid getting involved if they sense they may also get hurt or have to deal with police after an attack is reported.
“Back off” sounds like you are capable of fighting back. Serial killers are typically methodical in making sure there is little risk of getting caught before approaching a potential victim.

, Pepper spray, extract from hot peppers, can be effective at inhibiting an attacker if used correctly. Find a class teaching proper administration and storage before buying or carrying this device.


Many users accidentally spray themselves when the canister gets lost in their bag or purse. Consider it like any other weapon you would need to learn to use correctly to avoid self-injury., There is a lot of advice on the internet for protecting yourself in a fight, but reading it is not the same as learning it. Self-defense classes like Krav Maga teach specific responses for common attacks, and attending classes provides a chance for you to practice real world advice.


Make sure to attend classes with a certified instructor to supervise you and make sure you will not injure yourself through inexperience.
Check your local government and non-profit websites. Many cities offer self-defense classes for free or on a sliding scale based on income.

, Your strongest parts are your elbows, head, and knees. Which one you use depends on your own position relative to that of your attacker.Use your elbows, hands, or head for attacking the upper body.
Use your knees or feet to attack their lower body.
Do not step in closer to use your arms or hands if you can use your legs or knees instead!

, Vulnerable places on your attacker include the eyes, neck, groin, and knee.Use your fingers or thumbs to poke or gouge your attacker’s eyes. This will cause a lot of pain and disrupt vision, giving you time to run away.Thrust your elbow into your side of your attacker’s neck, using your body weight. If you can’t use your elbow, hold your fingers straight, with your thumb tucked underneath, and hit the side of their neck like a knife strike as hard as you can.
If your attacker attempts to grab you from the front by your arms or shoulders, knee or kick them in the groin.Kick the side of your attacker’s knee to through him/her off balance and cause injury., Carry your keys sticking out between your fingers of a closed fist when walking alone at night or in scary areas. If attacked outside, throw dirt in your attacker’s eyes. Use a pen or pencil as a stabbing tool.If attacked, keys and writing utensils can be used to stab your attacker’s eyes or throat.
Don’t falter and use full force if you really feel you are in danger. A half-hearted attempt to hurt someone will fail.
Once you commit to an action, follow through with fullest intention.

, If someone tries to pull you by your wrists, lower your center of gravity, lean towards your attacker, and bend your elbow upwards towards his/her arm to get free. If someone grabs you from behind, sit down on the ground as quickly and with as much force as possible.If you cannot sit, lower your center of gravity and thrust your elbow backwards into their neck or head."

If you do not already have an editor in mind, do some research on editors that would read the work of a young adult.,
Re-type your final draft with any corrections made by your editor.

,
Find a publisher willing to read a younger author's work.,
Send in the final copy to the publisher of your choosing.",How to Become an Accomplished Young Author," Are you writing for fun? Maybe you're in it for the publicity and fame. Or perhaps you just want to earn an extra buck or two by publishing your book. Even if your intentions are not originally to write for fun, make it your goal to have fun while you write. If you aren't having fun, what makes you think your readers will?

, Reading will help you see the work of published authors, how they write, and maybe get some inspiration. Try a different variation of books - fiction, biographies, poetry etc. write down all interesting words which you think will look impressive in your writing and find out the meaning of them.

, Even if you do not have the entire plot line figured out, you should be able to decide what kind of genre you're writing for, and who the characters are. You should also have at least the big idea about the problem that your main character will encounter. Make sure you write this information down-- it's very easy to lose your way while writing.

, So, you may not be the best in making reports because of your grammar. That's completely okay. You can learn. Not the best speller? Grab a dictionary and look for some random words. It may not sound completely appealing at first, but if you want to become a published author, you have to know the difference between ""your"" and ""you're"".

, You don't have to include every single little detail, but it's a good idea to have an idea of what will be going on in each chapter. Try dividing your event line into sections, this will help you decide where to put chapter breaks and the like later on in your writing.

, You can't write about nothing. An article on plastic cups and lint may be exciting to others, but most of us prefer an interesting topic over gibberish about that weird-looking hairball your neighbor's cat left on your front porch. Be interesting and creative, and think about any message you are trying to get across.

, Wrong punctuation is annoying. You see that post your classmate left on your wall on Facebook that looks like it was written by toddler? No one likes that.

, Your age won't define how advanced you may be at writing. So what if you're just eleven years old? Or even ten? If you can write like you're a college grad, that's all that matters. There are so many young writers on the New York Times Best Seller List.

, This can be handwritten, or typed, depending on your preferences. Don't stop writing, whatever you do. Sometimes, the hardest part of the process is not giving up on a story. Remember; this is not going to take a day, or even a week. Writing your entire story down may take months on end. When you write something, do not reread it until the next step. For now, just get everything written down.

, You want your readers to feel like they're in the scene themselves. Every chapter of your book should be like a chapter of their lives. If your writing isn't descriptive and well written then it doesn't particularly make yourself stand out from other people in your class.


However, by all means, do not go overboard and make your writing flowery and fill it with purple prose. You want your readers to be able to feel like they're in the book, but too many details clog up the writing.





, They're the ones that make the book. You could base one on someone you know, or make a mash up of a few of your friends to make a completely unique person. Most importantly, make them likable. Who wants to read a book about someone they would find annoying if they were real? Would they care if they died or if something terrible happened to them?

, Want to be known as the rom-com writer? That's alright. But how about you try writing a thriller? Or even an adventure? Don't just stick to the stuff you know you're good at, try out something new and you might be even better at something else. The good thing about being a kid writer is that you can write about people your age and you'll relate to them better than Jacqueline Wilson ever will, so you have an advantage.

, Although you can decide to fix any spelling or grammatical errors, the purpose of this step is to decide whether it makes sense. Also, check for overused words. If you notice that you've used the same word or phrase, make a note to yourself, and head over to a thesaurus to find more ""interesting"" words that will appeal to your readers.

, This person will be a ""beta reader"" of sorts. Ask them to take notes on what they liked or didn't like, and how they would change it. They can also fix any errors you missed, although this wouldn't need to be required. Read each and every one of their notes when you are done, and take their ideas to heart. Even though you may love a certain part, chances are that your reader's won't.

, Keep in mind that this will not be your final draft, as your editor may decide to change something else.

, Make sure you use large margins, so that they can make notes. Also, make sure that you include the page number and your surname in the footer of each page, just in case a page gets separated from the rest.

, Make some sort of connection with them, and send in your manuscript if they show interest.

,, A quick Google search can help you find publishers who have, in the past, published the work of child authors.

, Be sure to check if they will publish work by kids.

These operate via electromagnetic coils, which control an armature bar, moving a grouping of needles up and down rapidly. The needles are dipped in tattooing ink, which is applied under the skin. Tattoo starter kits with sterile supplies are available for around a hundred dollars.


It's true that tattoo machines and supplies cost about the same as getting a small tattoo professionally done at a parlor, making a shop tattoo a much better option if you don't have any work done yet. But if you do, and you're interested in learning on yourself, it's important to invest in a good-quality tattooing machine.
If you want to make your own tattoo gun, you can also save a bit of money. If you want to give yourself a stick 'n poke tattoo, without the use of a tattoo gun, check out Give Yourself a Tattoo Without a Gun to learn to do it safely.;
, Tattoos should only be made from specialized tattoo ink, or carbon-based India ink. These inks are natural and react gently with your body, making the process safe and sterile. Never use other types of ink for tattoos.Some people have allergies to specific ink ingredients and pigments, but this is usually only true of colored inks. It's generally not a good idea to start messing around with colors anyway, unless you're an experienced tattoo artist.
Never use pen ink or other varieties of ink to make a tattoo, unless you want an infection and terrible-looking art on your body. Do it right.

, Because the risk of blood-borne infection is much higher in tattoos done outside the parlor, it's absolutely essential that you take your tattoo seriously and only use brand-new, just-out-of-the-package, sterilized supplies to give yourself a tattoo. The best way to get everything you'll need is to invest in a starter kit, again, which are available for about a hundred bucks. To get started, you'll need:


New tattooing needles
A disposable container for the ink
Isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol)
Cotton balls or soft batting
Rubber gloves
Tattoo goo, A&D, or Bacitracin for aftercare

, When you're giving yourself your first tattoo, it's probably not the time to ink that sick panther wearing a camo bandana and slashing through the outline of Uranus across your arm. Go with a simple outline-style tattoo, something that you'll be able to add to later if necessary. A few words, or a simple line drawing? Now you're talking. Good first-tattoo ideas include:


Hand-print style lettering
Small line-drawings of animals
Stars
Crosses
Anchors
Hearts

, To make the tattoo process as easy as possible, you need to be clean and prepare the tattoo area. Be sure you haven't drunk any alcohol for several hours, and that you aren't on any blood-thinning painkillers (such as aspirin) or other drugs when you're ready to start inking.


Shower, dry yourself, and change into clean clothes, so that you're as clean as possible before you begin.

, Using clean strokes with a fresh blade, shave the area you'll be tattooing, plus a decent margin of skin in the surrounding area. Shave even if there doesn't seem to be any hair. The razor is more accurate than your eyes.

, Choose a clean, flat surface with plenty of light, where you'll be able to work. Wash the surface thoroughly with soap and water and let it dry for a few minutes. Then, lay down a thick layer of paper towels all over your work area, to prevent staining any furniture or flooring.


Ventilate the room by opening a window or turning on a fan. The pain can make it kind of a sweaty process, so it's good to keep the room cool.

, Depending on the design that you're trying to tattoo, you might want to go freehand, although this is pretty uncommon, or (more likely) work from a stencil, which is basically like a temporary tattoo.This is the most common way that professional tattoo artists provide a guide from which to work:


Draw the design on a sheet of paper or print it out from your computer, then place the design on the stencil paper. Use a stencil liquid, like StencilStuff or StencilPro, and spread the liquid over the area.
Place the stencil on the skin with the purple side down, smoothing the stencil out flat. Let it sit before carefully removing the stencil from the skin. Allow the skin to dry completely.

, The main risk of a home tattoo is the risk of infection. Take steps to keep everything as clean as possible, only using absolutely new, sterile equipment to complete your tattoo.


Sterilize your needle. Just before you plan to give yourself a tattoo, drop your needle in a pot of water and boil it for five minutes. Spoon it out and let it cool on a clean paper towel for a moment, then soak it in rubbing alcohol and carefully wipe it down with a new towel.
Pour your ink cleanly. Wipe down the ink container with a rubbing alcohol-soaked paper towel, then pour in a small amount of ink in gently. Lay another towel across it to prevent dust from falling into it.
Use less ink than you think you'll need. A little tattoo ink goes a long way, and you can always pour more if you need it. Also keep a clean glass of water handy for cleaning your needle during the process.
Put on clean rubber gloves. Have the box on hand and be ready to change them regularly, as your hands get sweaty.

, When you're ready to start tattooing, dip your needle into the ink and position the stylus so that your hand is steady. Turn on the tattoo gun, line up the needle with the guide line, and get started.


You need to start the machine to get the needle moving before you attempt to start the tattoo. Never stick the needle into the skin before turning it on.
Using your other hand, keep the skin to be tattooed as tight and flat as possible. It's very important to give yourself a good canvas on which to tattoo. The flatter the better.
Some tattoo guns can be auto-loaded with ink by screwing a canister of tattoo ink directly into the gun. If you have access to one of these guns, you don't need to dip the needle, obviously.

, It's very difficult to push a tattooing needle in too deeply because of the design of the needle will keep it from happening, but you do need to make sure it goes deep enough, at least a few millimeters. As you do, start moving it along the outline of your design.Your skin should tug just a bit on the needle when you pull it out, but bleeding should be minimal. If your skin doesn't resist when you pull the needle out, it's probably too shallow. If there is a lot of blood, the needle is too deep.
Because the needle is difficult to see, it's usually better to tilt the needle at a diagonal to the skin, resting the tube rests on the skin.

, Move the needle slowly down your stencil line. Don't go farther than a few centimeters along your outline before you remove the needle, wipe the excess ink off, and keep going. Take your time and look closely at the line quality to make sure you're giving an even tattoo.









The needle will be moving, so it's sometimes difficult to see exactly where it's going into the skin. Keep it moving along the line, then remove it and wipe away the excess ink to stay on track. It's a slow process.

, Continue tracing along the lines of your tattoo, wiping the excess ink off as you go, and re-upping the ink on the needle as you work. Keep a close eye on what you're doing and the thickness of the line. High-quality tattoos will have very even line-work, making it important that you use consistent pressure and evenness.









Filling in the tattoo is generally done with a slightly larger needle, and instead of moving in straight lines, you move in gentle, tiny circles to fill in the area. For your first tattoo, this may be unnecessary, but feel free to experiment.

, Wet the needle periodically, before putting more ink onto it. Cleaning the excess ink off the needle is absolutely essential for cleanliness and a good tattoo job. If you set your needle anywhere other than the ink dish and your skin, stop and sterilize again it with a clean paper towel and rubbing alcohol. Be sure it's dry before you continue.


Wipe away the excess ink regularly. Every few repetitions, use a soft paper towel to wipe away excess ink and seeping blood from your tattoo. Use a fresh towel each time.

, As soon as you're done, apply a thin layer of Tattoo ointment, typically called A&D or Tattoo Goo, and cover the tattoo with clean gauze. Fresh tattoo work needs to be protected as soon as you're finished, to minimize the risk of infection.









Never put lotion or petroleum jelly on a fresh tattoo. These clog the pores, draw the ink out, and keep the tattoo from healing effectively. It's a common misconception that Vaseline or petroleum jelly is used on new tattoos. The ointment used does resemble the consistency of Vaseline, but it's not the same thing.
Don't slather ointment onto the tattoo. You only need a small, pea-sized amount for most tattoos. It's important to let the tattoo heal as quickly and naturally as possible, which it can't do if its constantly covered in goop.
Don't immediately wash your tattoo. If you used sterile products, you should let the tattoo alone and let the inflammation calm down a bit before you try to clean it. Cover the tattoo and leave it alone.

, Use a clean, soft gauze bandage to completely cover the tattoo. Be gentle, as the area will likely be somewhat tender from the tattooing process. Bind it in place with medical tape or stretch wrapping, loosely.


Leave the bandage on the tattoo for at least the first two hours, if not the rest of the day. This is a very important part of the process. Don't start messing with it, just because you want to see your work. Wait.

, Throw away the ink in your vessel, the needle from the gun, the gloves, and the rest of the equipment that you used. This stuff cannot be reused, if you want to give yourself sterile, clean, and effective tattoos. Only use new, clean products when you're giving a tattoo.

, The first time you clean your tattoo, use a small amount of cool water to gently clean the surface of the tattoo using your hand. Don't soak the tattoo, or run it under water. This is very important.


Avoid soaking the tattoo for the first 48 hours of the job. After the first rinse, use soap and warm water to clean the tattoo gently that night before you go to bed. After two days, you can start cleaning it normally, when you shower.
Keep a thin layer of ointment on the tattoo 2-3 times a day for about two weeks. Keep a close eye on things to make sure there are no signs of infection, and visit a medical professional immediately if you think your tattoo may be infected.

Have the confidence that this is possible.,
Start with an idea, passion and an inspiration.,
Choose your genre.,
Decide your topic.,
Write your blurb.,
Outline your chapters.,
Consider the following things when creating your novel:


More than likely, you are writing about a teen or preteen stuck in some situation.,
Find your writing style.,
Try to write a little every day.,
Go gradually.,
Edit and revise your first draft.,
Get outside editing help.,
Look for an agent.,
Send your finished product straight to the publisher, or your literary agent.,
When your agent finds you a publisher, you will be able to work from there with the publishing company.,
Get your book out there.",How to Create and Publish a Novel as a Teenager," Don't be intimidated. You are competent. Your age does not matter. In fact, if you're writing a teen novel, your age connects you to your readers.

, Write what you care about. You need a good idea of what your novel will be like, and you need enough passion and drive to get through it. You don't have to have a full idea to get started; you can start with just a few characters and a setting, or maybe just an opening sentence. There are many less general articles that can help you decide what to write about if you're unsure (see ""related wikiHows"").;
, There are novels of romance, fantasy, fiction, sci-fi, action, mystery, non-fiction, horror, etc.


If you wish, you can mix genres. A very popular mixed genre is romance-fantasy.

, Here is were you create your characters, title, plot, etc. This step is where you make your ""Prompt"".

, That is the thing on the back of the book that tells you what it is about. You can also write things like the prologue or intro. This isn't absolutely necessary but the nice thing about doing it is that it keeps you focused on the nub of your story and the hoped-for outcome.

, List your proposed chapters and decide the main thing that happens in each chapter. Don't put minor things in your chapter outline.


Create an outline for Chapter One. List the things that are going to happen in it. You are basically summarizing the chapter, so that when it comes to the actual writing, it's already in skeleton form and you begin fleshing out the detail.

, Some things you want to remember are:
Don't use confusing words and long paragraphs. Your reader will get turned off immediately.
Terms that preteens and teens use grow old over time. If you use these words, this is also a turnoff. Don't use the same terms over and over. Your readers will get bored.
Make sure it is appropriate for the age you are writing for. For example, don't write a teenage novel called ""Rainbow, the Magic Pony Saves the Day.""
When you're done, show your work to a friend, parent, or teacher. Have them give you feedback on what you should edit.
Throw the advice and go with what feels right and downright original. New ways of seeing the world have to emerge from somewhere plus a dose of courage. On the very young and the very old can afford to be that daring, so risk it.

, You'll have to play around a bit to figure out what feels comfortable for the story you're writing. Different styles can include past and present tense, first and third person, prose and verse. It will depend on the voice of your characters and what you are trying to express. Try taking your first chapter and re-writing it in different styles until you hit the one that fits best.

, However, don't be afraid to put your book aside for a few days, as doing this is better than you hating the chore of writing. Writing a book is going to take you a long time and a lot of hard work. When you get stuck, and hit writer's block, don't freak out. There are about a hundred different ways to, and the most practiced is just to wait it out. It'll pass. Every writer has a different way of getting through a novel, so nobody can really tell you the best way to go about it. Some write straight from beginning to end, and others skip around; some write a chapter a day, and others write only when the inspiration hits; there is really no definitive way to arrive at the end of your novel. But in the end, if you give it time, and if you have the passion, you will get there.

, If it's hard for you to write in sequential order, and you're more interested in one part and then another the next day, then write in pieces. Hopefully, you will know your plot well enough to be able to work in pieces and then go back and stitch those pieces together. Writing in sequential order can get boring, so write what interests you that day. Even if it's another idea, it will all come together eventually. However, there is the danger of getting lazy and not wanting to go back and fill in the parts that are more boring to write. Don't get to that spot, fellow teen writer — if even you aren't interested in a certain part of your book, what makes you think readers will be?


Take your time. If you reach a point in the novel where you are stuck, take a break and come back to it later. Frustration will be your only reward if you just sit there struggling and trying to do something you can't. A good book or series takes time to make. J.K Rowling and her books (Harry Potter) took her over 17 years to complete. Take your time and in the long run it will be worth it.
Don't stay up late, all night, trying to get the whole thing finished in a month. It's doubtful that's going to happen and it will only make you really tired. This, in turn, will make it harder for you to think and work on what you have. Get enough sleep, eat breakfast, do well in school, etc. You will get it finished; even if it takes a year, you will get it finished if you work on it. Rushing through things isn't going to improve your writing, if anything it's going to make it worse.

, Your first critic is yourself; you will need to go back over everything you have written and revise it to make it better. Especially if this is your first novel, you will have a lot to fix. It's hard to let go, but sometimes even good writing needs to be deleted to move the story in the right direction. There might be huge changes that need to be made before you get to the next step.

, Get a few friends or family members to read it and give you direction, and then you may want a professional literary editor. You can find one online, even in the phone book, and they can be really helpful. However, they can also be expensive, so if you're confident, you can skip the pro editor. Besides, you should know that your publisher will probably want their own editor to look at it before it's published, anyway. Still, you should at least send it to a teacher or another adult with literary experience that you trust. Teens and friends, though helpful, will miss things that teachers and other adults will pick up their first time through, and / or will be gentle to spare your feelings. Do not be afraid of criticism, as sometimes it's downright embarrassing, but most of the time it really helps you to grow as a writer.

, Sending your manuscript straight to the publisher might save agent expenses, but it takes a very long time for those nice and capable and busy publishers and editors to get through what is commonly known as ""The Slush Pile"". There is a reason why it's called that. Get a literary agent. They're not cheap, but they make a writer's work easy. Many publishing houses (as stated above) only work through literary agents. Send your work to them, they're nice and they really help. But, make sure that you give them exactly what they ask for, if you don't they are disinclined from the start to represent you. And that will only make things harder.


When you look for an agent, find one who is interested in the genre of book that you're writing in. Read a good article on writing query letters, get some practice, don't go over a page, and follow the agent's preferences. If they say to only send snail mail, then send snail mail. If they want the first chapter, don't give them the whole book. Try agentquery.com for a first look.
It may be hard to find an agent. However, it can be really useful, so persevere. Your agent will bring your book to publishers that he/she thinks are likely to publish it, and many publishers nowadays will only deal with authors through a literary agent. You will have to find one who is available and send a query letter. Don't be afraid if one rejects you, just go on to the next one. Even J.K. Rowling was rejected, twelve times, when she tried to publish Harry Potter.
As honest as you want to be with the agents that you're querying, it is best not to tell them your age. You'd be surprised how many authors (even the adult ones) don't tell the agents how old they are. If you write your query and manuscript well enough, the agents will let the writing speak for itself, and they won't even realize that you're thirteen, or fourteen, or one hundred and seventeen. If they like it they'll call, regardless of your age and past credentials.
If the agent makes you feel uncomfortable in any way, then you end the conversation as quickly as possible. Don't be taken advantage of. ""Yes, thank you so very much. But I've had a few other offers (even if you haven't, still use this. It's polite, it's a white lie, and it's better to put off a bad agent and wait for a good one, bad agents won't help you.) and I'd like to think about them. I thank you very much for your time. Should I contact you if I decide that I would like you to represent me, or should we work out something else?"" Or something like that. A bad agent gets you nowhere.

, Send your work to multiple agents at a time. They're good, but few are miracle workers, and they're very busy. They've got dozens upon dozens of manuscripts to read besides yours. In your query, don't forget to thank the agent(s) for their valuable time: the time that might interest them in your work and get you published. Besides, it's common courtesy.


Note that not every publishing company online is safe and true.

, Don't let them look down on you for your age; get your royalties settled, talk about what you want for cover art, express your opinion. You'll probably want to bring an experienced adult friend to be your advisor with royalties and such. Different companies will work in different ways and expect different things, but they will keep you in the loop. Enjoy the process, although it takes time.


When an agent calls - and gives you the call - then be happy. Be polite, and courteous, and thank them very much for reading what you've written. Be humble; do not compare your work to best sellers or other books that they've represented or any other works at all. It's bad form. You can ask questions; even literary agents don't know everything. Be professional and when they ask your age, if they ask your age, be very mature and tell them exactly how old you are. Lying will not help, you cannot sign a contract when you are under eighteen - it's illegal - and lying will only come back and bite you in the butt.

, You are a published author. Sign up for public readings, author and book events in the neighborhood. Do a book signing at your library. And be proud of yourself. You worked hard.

Home tattoo kits are the safer option and include both supplies and instructions.Make sure you only use black India ink. Colored inks can be toxic.You can use any type of needle you like. Sewing needles, straight pins, and even safety pins will all work just fine. The most important thing is to make sure they are fresh and clean.Don't use old needles. Don't share needles. Doing either of these will put you at serious risk for infection.;
, You'll need a few other things before you start putting needle to flesh. Grab some cotton thread, a cup for water, rubbing alcohol, and some clean rags.

Keep a non-permanent marker around for drawing potential tattoo ideas.It's a good idea to keep a shallow bowl or saucer handy to pour India ink into.
It's important to make sure everything you use is clean. Wash any bowls or saucers you'll be using in hot, soapy water. For extra protection, wear gloves when handling any of the supplies you'll be using.

, Wherever you decide to tattoo yourself, clean it with soap and warm water. Shave the hair off in the area about an inch larger than you want your tattoo to be.


After you shave, sterilise your skin with rubbing alcohol. Dab it on with a cotton ball and make sure it's evaporated before continuing.

, Trace or draw your desired tattoo in the place you want it to go. You can have someone else do it for you if you want, but take the time to get it how you want it. This image is all you'll have to go on once you start.


Since you'll be tattooing yourself, make sure the place you choose is easily accessible. Depending on your design, you could be poking for a few hours. Awkward or hard to reach places on the body, such as your chest or shoulders, may not be the best idea for stick 'n' pokes.
Stick 'n' pokes work much better with simple and tiny tattoos. If you want a complex tattoo, you're better off going to a parlour., The best way to sterilise the needle before using it is with flame. Hold the needle over the flame of a candle or a lighter until it glows. Make sure you hold the other end with a cloth, or you'll burn your fingertips.

Once the needle is sterile, wrap it in cotton thread. Start about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) away from the tip and wrap the thread back and forth about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) up the needle until the thread has formed an oval shape. This will absorb some of the ink as you dip your needle into the saucer.For added stability, try attaching the needle to the end of a pencil. Stab the eye of the needle into the eraser side of the pencil and wrap it tightly with thread., Dip the needle into the India ink and then poke it through your skin, leaving a small dot. There may be some blood, but there shouldn't be much. You're only trying to poke through the first couple layers of skin.

If you're doing it the right way, your skin should stick with the needle a little as you pull out. You may also be able to hear a faint ""pop"" as it goes through each layer., Stay inside the line of the tattoo design you've drawn, filling it in with tiny punctures. Use a Q-tip or a rag to wipe away any blood or excess ink.

The skin will puff up as you poke it which may cause the resulting tattoo to appear spotty. You may have to do touch-ups when the swelling goes down if you want smooth lines throughout the tattoo., When you finish the tattoo, wipe down the area with rubbing alcohol. Throw away any remaining India ink or needles. They are no longer sterile. Use a new needle and a new saucer of ink if you plan on doing any touch-ups in the future.

, Apply a thin layer of A+D Ointment to the area, just enough to make the skin look shiny. Cover your tattoo in a sterile absorbing pad.

Only use A+D Ointment for the first couple of days to start the healing process of your tattoo. Going too long could have adverse affects on your skin.A+D Ointment is a topical ointment containing vitamins A and D, used to treat minor cuts and burns, and dry skin. You can find it at most drugstores.Leave the bandage on for 2-4 hours, but no longer than 8., Remove the initial bandage and gently wash the area with warm water and non-scented soap. Don't scrub, and only wash the tattoo with your clean hand.

Don't soak your tattoo and don't run it under hot water. It won't feel nice, and it could cause your tattoo to become splotchy.Avoid picking at the tattoo as this could cause some of the ink to bleed out, causing messy lines and even scarring., After the first couple of days, switch to a plain, unscented lotion. Most professionals recommend Lubriderm or Aquaphor. Keep the layers thin. Your skin needs to breathe so it can heal properly.

Moisturize your tattoo 3-5 times a day depending on the size of the tattoo. If your skin starts to look dried out, use a small amount of lotion., For the first week or so be mindful of your tattoo. It's going to scab over and you'll need to take extra care to keep it clean. In addition to washing it and keeping it moisturized, you'll need to avoid certain activities.

Avoid swimming. Natural bodies of water are full of bacteria, which can lead to infection. Swimming pools are cleaned with chlorine, which is also not good for your tattoo.Avoid any activity that is high-contact or induces excessive sweating. Wear loose clothing so your tattoo can breathe. Tight clothing prevents this., Be on the look out for redness or excessive scabbing around your tattoo, as well as any oozing, or swelling. These are all signs of possible infection.You can minimize the risk of infection by keeping your supplies clean and taking care of your tattoo. Still, it is possible your tattoo could become infected. If you suspect that your tattoo has become infected, consult your physician."

Piercing establishments are often found in urban areas, but you'll come across them in even the remotest of places. Google, as with most things, is a good way to start your search for a parlor. The website should be professional and well-organized, with plenty of helpful information.


They may also provide a gallery of images so you can see photos of the shop, along with pictures of previous customer's piercings.
Make sure to read plenty of customer reviews to see if they had a good experience with the piercing parlor and whether they would return to the place again.;
, It is always a good idea to visit the piercing parlor in person before making an appointment. That way you can see for yourself whether the place is clean, safe and professional looking. They should be willing to show you an operating license from the local Health Department, along with their autoclave (machine for sterilizing jewelry and equipment) and spore test results (proof that the autoclave is working properly).


Get to know some of the people working there, consult with them about your decision, and take a look at some of the work they've done in the past. Clearly, if they don't have many success stories, you should find a different place to get pierced.
Ask if you can watch one of the piercers set up and complete a piercing. Make sure that the piercer washes his hands before putting on clean gloves. From that point on, he should only touch the equipment and the person being pierced.
All of the equipment and needles should be laid out in individual sterile packages and should be opened in front of you. The needles should be disposed of in a container labeled ""biohazard"" after use.If you are confident that the premise is clean and that the piercer is an experienced professional who follows the correct health and safety procedures, you can go ahead and make your appointment.

, Before going through with the appointment, make sure that you weigh up all the pros and cons of getting a nipple piercing one last time. Think about whether this specific piercing is something you will still want in years to come and whether it will affect your life or relationships in any way. Getting your nipple pierced is not a decision to be taken lightly.



Pros: A nipple piercing not only looks great, but it can also increase sensitivity in the nipple as it is frequently stimulated by the piercing. A nipple piercing can also increase the size of a small nipple and prevent it from becoming inverted. This can be useful for breastfeeding, which is not hindered by a nipple piercing in any way.

Cons: Nipple piercings can be somewhat painful and can take up to a year to completely heal. They require a strict cleaning routine to prevent infection and are therefore a big commitment. If the piercing is not properly cared for infections may occur, which can be serious, especially for breastfeeding mothers.

, It is possible to get both of your nipples pierced at the same time. This is usually done if the reason for piercing is to increase the size of the nipples; however, many people just find it easier to go through the healing process for both nipples simultaneously.


In addition, it is often slightly cheaper to have both nipples pierced in one sitting, rather than making two separate appointments.

, The two types of nipple piercings are ring piercings and barbell piercings. Rings are the more popular option, but barbells are best for those involved in contact sports, as they are less likely to be ripped out. The type of piercing you can get will also depend on the size and shape of your nipple, so you will need to consult with your piercer before making a final decision.


The nipple can be pierced in any direction, but horizontal piercings are most common, followed by vertical piercings. It is also possible, in some cases, to have one nipple pierced multiple times though the first piercing will need to have healed completely before successive ones are added.
In terms of jewelry, the safest type for nipple piercings are implantation steel captive bead rings or implantation steel barbells. Jewelry containing high amounts of nickel should never be used, as these may cause infections and allergic reactions., How painful you find getting your nipple pierced will depend on your individual pain threshold. Some people find it very painful while others think it's a breeze. Most people describe the sensation as similar to being pinched or bitten hard. The nipple will also feel very hot.


Luckily, nipple piercings are very quick, and there will only be a couple of seconds of pain before the feeling passes.
Afterwards, the nipple will feel warm and tender to the touch, but will not be painful.

, The most important thing you need to do while your nipple piercing heals is to keep the area clean. The first time you wash your piercing should be 4 to 5 hours after you get it done. Gently remove the bandage from the nipple, cup your hand under the piercing and immerse it in water for 3 to 4 minutes, allowing any dried blood to wash off.


This can be done in the shower or the bath, but if you soak in the bath, make sure to rinse the piercing with fresh water before getting out.
If there is any dried blood remaining on the nipple or jewelry, use a dampened q-tip to gently wipe it off.
You should not use any cleaning solution during this initial cleaning; you should only use water.

, After the initial cleaning, you will need to wash the piercing once a day using a mild antibacterial cleanser. This is best done in the shower. Do your regular shower routine first, including shampooing and washing, as you want your nipple piercing to be the last thing you clean. To clean:


Soak the nipple piercing in water for a few minutes, then squirt a drop or two of the cleanser into your hand and rub to make a lather.
Apply the lathered cleanser to the nipple and work it into the piercing by gently rotating the ring or sliding the barbell back and forth.
Let the lather sit on the nipple for a minute or two before rinsing off with fresh water. Towel dry your body as normal but use a piece of paper towel to gently pat your piercing dry. Towels can harbor bacteria and may cause the piercing to become infected.
After the first four weeks have passed; you can limit this cleaning routine to once every 2 to 3 days for the next four months. This is important, as over-cleaning the piercing can cause it to dry out and become irritated., Another thing you can do to encourage the piercing to heal is to soak it in a salt solution once or twice a day. This is done by dissolving half a teaspoon of sea salt in boiling water (approximately half a cup). Do NOT use table salt, which has iodine. Iodine can irritate the wound, slowing the healing process. Once cooled slightly, this solution can then be poured into a clean glass or Styrofoam cup.


The cup can then be firmly pressed around the nipple, so the piercing is immersed in the solution. Keep it there for 10 to 15 minutes, and then rinse with fresh water and pat dry with paper towel.
Instead of making your salt solution, you can buy a saline solution at a drugstore that will serve the same purpose.
You can repeat this process once or twice a day for as long as you like -- the more frequently you do it, the faster your piercing will heal.

, You should cover your nipple piercing at night, so it doesn't become tangled in clothing or sheets and get pulled or ripped out. Women can protect their piercing by wearing a bra (or a sports bra) to bed while men can cover the piercing with a strip of surgical tape ( available at most drug stores).


Men should only use this surgical tape to cover their piercings at night. The rest of the time the piercing should be exposed to the air, as this will speed up healing time.
Women should avoid wearing lacy bras with new nipple piercings, as the ring/barbell can become caught in the lace. Regular, padded, or sports bras are safer options.

, There are certain products that you should avoid using on your new nipple piercing, as they will either irritate the wounds or prevent the piercing from healing properly. Such products include:


Rubbing alcohol or methylated spirits: these are very astringent and are too harsh to be used on sensitive nipple piercings.
Hydrogen peroxide or iodine products: these prevent scar tissue from forming and prolong the healing process.
Anti-bacterial creams and gels: creams such as Neosporin or Bacitracin should not be used on nipple piercings as they cause the piercing to become moist and prevent the piercing from healing quickly.
You should also avoid putting products like sun tan lotion, baby oil or tea tree oil on the nipple, as they can cause the skin to become irritated., It is important that you avoid touching or playing with the piercing as much as possible during the healing process. Bacteria from your hands can easily enter the wound and cause the piercing to become infected, which is the last thing you want. This includes not allowing your partner to touch or lick your pierced nipple(s). If you absolutely have to touch the piercing, remember to wash your hands thoroughly with antibacterial soap first or wear gloves.


You should avoid twisting or turning the ring in the piercing for the first couple of months, except when cleaning. Twisting the ring aggravates the piercing and slows down healing.
You should also be careful when playing sports or during any physical activity, as the ring may be torn from the piercing if knocked against too roughly.
You can cover the piercing with a bandage or some surgical tape to protect it during physical activity, but you must remove the tape immediately afterward and wash the piercing thoroughly.
Do not remove the ring or barbell from the piercing until it has fully healed. In particular, you should avoid replacing your nipple ring with silver sleeper studs, as these can damage the wound and cause an allergic reaction.

, Nine times out of ten, infections are the result of poor hygiene or neglectful cleaning practices, so they are easy to avoid as long as you are diligent about caring for your piercing. However, if you begin to notice symptoms such as nipple soreness, redness, and swelling, or a discharge of blood or pus, chances are your piercing has become infected.


Most minor infections can be cleared up within 24 hours by cleaning the piercing thoroughly with an antibacterial cleanser and flushing it with plenty of fresh water. If you have any questions, call or visit your piercer.
If the infection does not clear up within 24 hours, it is important that you see a doctor as soon as possible. They can prescribe antibiotics that will effectively clear up the infections.
Never remove a piercing when dealing with an infection (even though some doctors may tell you to do so) as this may cause the infection to become trapped in the nipple and can turn into an abscess.
If you develop a fever and chills as a result of the infection, you need to see your doctor immediately. A condition known as toxic shock syndrome may have developed which is severe and can lead to death if left untreated., Nipple piercings usually take between 6 to 10 weeks to heal, if the piercing is properly cared for and there are no complications. The nipple (or nipples) will be tender for the first few days, but this will more or less subside.


Be aware that although the initial healing should take less than three months, it can take over a year for the piercing to heal completely and for scar tissue to form. Each person is different and therefore healing times vary.

If they can deliver a wonderful tattoo that is YOUR original concept (best describing how you feel) then you will not only be extremely pleased but also have a tattoo that stands head and shoulders above the rest!;
, At work, friends, family and online searches will disclose the shops nearest to you. If you found an artist, then call the shop and ask if you can come in and view their work.

, Make sure to study the shop in whole as well. What do you think of the photos? These ARE the best representations that the artist could muster. You are looking for creativity, range in subject matter, and clean work that looks appealing. Things to look for specifically is good drawing, clean lines, solid filled in color, NO bleeding, and a clear representation of the tattoo. Lastly: Would you want any of those pieces? If not these exact pieces, a tattoo in a similar style?

, Some work looks better photographed and some suffer with a photo. It is a matter of the artist, their photographic capabilities and lighting and the design of the tattoo. For example, a piece that goes around the arm will be harder to photograph and understand from the photos.

, Tattoo pictures may have been taken very soon after the tattoo was done: the artist may not be able to call the customer back or the customer may not return. The look of the unhealed work may be deceiving. You are going to wear your tattoo for decades. Look for freshness and consistency in the photos. Are some tattoos bleeding? Are some very red and swollen? This may mean the tattooist does not have a mastery of their equipment. They may be scarring or doing tattoos too lightly so the actual image may fade a week after the photo. Look for good quality of tattoos through the photos. Are the lines sharp, even, clean? Is the color solid? Is the shading steady and consistent? How are the points on the edges? Are they sharp and clear? If you can clearly see the image does it captivate your imagination?

, Research each site and artist. What do you see? What do you like? Bear in mind that photos online may have been enhanced with software so you may not be seeing the reality of the piece. Contact only your few choice or so. Don't be afraid to travel to get the tattoo you really want.

, Ask them about their experience, their background and what other art they do as well. Do they own a shop? Do they have other artists? These questions reveal how busy they are and how much they might be able to deliver for you. Ask about how long they take. If an artist spends 5-10 hours on you that might sway your opinion. Do you want that much suffering?

, See their work healed. Talk to them. You may get a great tattoo but how was the experience? Did they enjoy it? Those are factors that will affect how YOU feel about your tattoo. Others that admire your piece will feel your apprehension and respond.

, You don't want them to hold back some talent for a few bucks so be prepared. If you can't afford their price, either save money or ask if they can work with you by possibly doing sessions for the tattoo and dividing up the payment with the session. Not all artists are willing to do this. If you can't afford the tattoo fee, but really want THAT artist to do your work, constantly contact the artist and try to help them any way you can. Often in this field, service is just as good as cash.

, Contact them and request your image to be drawn by them and to send it to you by email. If you paid the ORIGINAL artist for their time, creativity and originality, you can then take their drawing to the best tattoo artist in your area. Make sure to study photos for line quality, even shading and solid color.

If you're thinking about getting a tattoo, there is one very important thing you have to keep in mind — getting it done safely.,
Think of a design you want to get.,
Make a rough sketch of your design.,
Find the location on your body that you want to put it.,
Touch up your design.,
Find an artist.,
Pick a few and check them out.,
If the studio looks unclean, if anything looks out of the ordinary, or if you feel in any way uncomfortable, find a better place to get your tattoo.

,
Have a bit of knowledge of the overview.,
Choose the artist whose work you like best and tell him or her you want a tattoo.,
Negotiate your price.,
Pay attention to the location where you will be tattooed.,
When you get there, go over the new and improved picture, and make sure it's OK.,
Relax.,
Take a final look when it's finished.,
Take care of your tattoo as instructed.,
Even after it's fully healed, a tattoo is more susceptible to the sun's rays, so it's a good idea to always keep it protected from direct sunlight.",How to Get Your First Tattoo," Although it might look a whole lot cooler than a big scab, a new tattoo is also a wound. Like any other slice, scrape, puncture, cut, or penetration to your skin, a tattoo is at risk for infections and disease.


Make sure you're up to date with your immunizations (especially hepatitis and tetanus shots) and plan where you'll get medical care if your tattoo becomes infected (signs of infection include excessive redness or tenderness around the tattoo, prolonged bleeding, pus, or changes in your skin color around the tattoo).
If you have a medical problem such as heart disease, allergies, diabetes, skin disorders, a condition that affects your immune system, or infections — or if you are pregnant — ask your doctor if there are any special concerns you should have or precautions you should take beforehand. Also, if you're prone to getting keloids (an overgrowth of scar tissue in the area of the wound), it's probably best to avoid getting a tattoo altogether.;
, Make sure it is something you feel comfortable showing off, and that you want on your body until you die.

, It doesn't have to be perfect. Tattoo artists are just that: artists. If you can give a good idea of what you want, your artist can really fly with it.

, Make sure it fits. Not too big, and not too small.

, Smooth out the lines, add a basic color scheme, and make it fit to your desired location.

, The recommendation of a friend who has a tattoo you like a lot can help. Look around to find somewhere that really excels in the style you want. Don't be afraid to travel- a few hours in a car or train is worth it to ensure that your art is the best standard it can be.

, It's very important to make sure the tattoo studio is clean and safe, and that all equipment used is disposable (in the case of needles, gloves, masks, etc.) and sterilized (everything else). Some states, cities, and communities set up standards for tattoo studios, but others don't. You can call your state, county, or local health department to find out about the laws in your community, ask for recommendations on licensed tattoo shops, or check for any complaints about a particular studio. Professional studios usually take pride in their cleanliness. Here are some things to check for:


Make sure the tattoo studio has an autoclave (a device that uses steam, pressure, and heat for sterilization). You may be allowed to watch as equipment is sterilized in the autoclave.
Check that the tattoo artist is a licensed practitioner. If so, the tattoo artist should be able to provide you with references.
Be sure that the tattoo studio follows the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Universal Precautions. These are regulations that outline procedures to be followed when dealing with bodily fluids (in this case, blood).

,, Here's an example of what to expect:


The tattoo artist will first wash his or her hands with a germicidal soap.
The to-be-tattooed area on your body will be cleaned and disinfected.
The tattoo artist will put on clean, fresh gloves (and possibly a surgical mask).
The tattoo artist will explain the sterilization procedure to you and open up the single-use, sterilized equipment (such as needles, etc.).
Using the tattoo machine (with a sterile, single-use needle attached), the tattoo artist will begin drawing an outline of the tattoo under your skin.
The outline will be cleaned with antiseptic soap and water.
Sterile, thicker needles will be installed on the tattoo machine, and the tattoo artist will start shading the design. After cleaning the area again, color will be injected. A new bottle of ink should be opened for each individual.
Any blood will be removed by a sterile, disposable cloth or towel.
When finished, the area, now sporting a finished tattoo, will be cleaned once again and a bandage will be applied.

, Tell your artist everything you know. What it is, where it's going, how big, etc.

, Ask how much it will cost; that way you can get the money the day of the tattoo, or transfer it from account to account, however you want to do it. Once you discuss the tattoo you will usually be asked to leave a deposit ($50 or so) and make an appointment. The deposit goes to the total price of your tattoo, so don't worry. Leave the rough drawing with them so they can improve upon it, and make it unique, just for you.

, The tattoo artist will shave the location where you are getting the tattoo. You do not want to shave the area yourself, because you may end up damaging the skin. Let the professional handle it. .

, Remember, this is forever inked into your skin. If there's anything - any little thing - about it that isn't what you want, stop right there, and let your artist know. You don't have to have a fit about it, or get panicked. Just say, ""Hey, this part right here? I'm not crazy about it. I would like a little more/less...."" whatever it is. The artist will probably not get upset or take it personally - after all, he/she is trying to read your mind a little bit, and if it's not exactly the thing, he or she is a pro who knows it can be easily tweaked. If the artist does get defensive, angry, or belligerent about the changes you want, thank him or her and go elsewhere. You are the one who will wear this image for life, and if the artist isn't willing to make it wonderful for you, he/she's not the one for you.

, You are going to be nervous, but calm down as much as you can. The tattoo artist will make sure it doesn't hurt a lot. When you get in the chair, sing something to yourself in your head, or talk to the artist. Make sure you do everything he/she says, move this, sit back, etc.

, Make sure they didn't miss anything. They'll be happy to touch it up, if they need to.

, Follow all of the instructions the studio gives you for caring for your tattoo to make sure it heals properly. Also, keep in mind that it's very important to call your doctor right away if you see or feel any signs of infection such as pain, spreading redness, swelling, or drainage of pus. To make sure your tattoo heals properly: (Also read Care for a New Tattoo)


Keep a bandage on the area for up to one or two hours.
Avoid touching the tattooed area and don't pick at any scabs that may form.
Wash the tattoo with an antibacterial soap (don't use alcohol or peroxide — they'll dry out the tattoo). Use a soft towel to dry the tattoo — just pat it dry and be sure not to rub it.
If you don't have an allergy to antibiotic ointment, rub some into the tattoo. Don't use petroleum jelly — it may cause the tattoo to fade.
Put an ice pack on the tattooed area if you see any redness or swelling.
Try not to get the tattoo wet until it fully heals. Stay away from pools, hot tubs, or long, hot baths.
Keep your tattoo away from the sun until it's fully healed.

, If you're outside often or hang out at the beach, it's recommended that you always wear a sunscreen with a minimum sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 on the tattoo. This not only protects your skin, but keeps the tattoo from fading.

Take care of your tattoo.",How to Get a Watercolor Tattoo," Getting a watercolor tattoo isn't all that different than getting a regular tattoo. The same processes are used. The only difference is the design. The tattoo artist copies the style of a watercolor painting, but they still ink the tattoo in much the same way., Though there is some disagreement about using black lines in a water color tattoo, some tattoo artists think using black holds the tattoo together better. It may also keep the tattoo from fading as badly., Most tattoos need to be touched up over the years, so remember that getting a tattoo is a process, not a one-time appointment. Watercolor tattoos, in particular, may fade a bit more than regular tattoos, though not too much., If you're not even sure where to begin, spend some time looking up watercolor tattoos on the internet. Save pictures of tattoos that you like, as that will give you some idea of where you want your tattoo to go.

, Often, people get tattoos of things or people that are close to their hearts. You'll be less likely to regret a tattoo if it has a significant meaning to you. Think about the things that are most important to you, and then try to figure out how to incorporate that into a watercolor tattoo.Your tattoos don't have to be literal. That is, you may want to incorporate your children into your tattoo. However, you don't have to just get their face tattooed on your arm. You can use a symbol to represent them. For instance, if you often call your child ""Peach,"" you could get a tattoo that incorporates a peach.
However, your tattoo doesn't have to have a meaning. It can just be something pretty that you like.

, Often, when doing a watercolor tattoo, the artist will need a bit of space, as the blending of colors takes some room. In other words, you need to pick an area on your body where there's room to work, and you'll need to be flexible on the size., Usually, the tattoo artist will come up with the design for you if you give them an idea of what you want. Of course, you need to work with someone whose work you admire so that you know you'll end up with a piece you're happy with., You can also bring your own sketch or painting, if you're an artist, that the tattooer can base your tattoo on. If you're not an artist, you could ask a friend to paint it for you before you go in.

, When getting a watercolor tattoo, you want to make sure you pick someone who is well versed in the style.Check for artists in your area. Ask around for recommendations from people you know who have tattoos. Once you've narrowed it down to a few tattoo artists, ask to see samples of their work before deciding on one person.

, When picking a tattoo studio, you want to choose one that follows hygienic standards. The needles that are used in tattooing can introduce infection to your body if the studio is not up to snuff.You should visit the shop in person before getting the tattoo, so you can check it out and talk with the people there. The studio should look clean, and it should have differentiated areas for tattooing and piercing.
Make sure the business uses an autoclave to disinfect instruments. If it doesn't, go somewhere else. However, needles should be new with each customer.
Also, tattoo artists should wear gloves when working on clients.

, Tattoos are expensive in general, but if you're getting a design from a quality tattoo artist, it's likely to run you even more. Get an estimate from your tattoo artist so you have an idea of how much money you'll need to have on hand, likely several hundred dollars or more for an extensive tattoo.Often, tattoo artists charge by the hour, meaning the more work your tattoo is, the more it will cost.
In addition, it's customary to tip your tattoo artist about 20%, preferably in cash., The tattoo artist will sketch or transfer the tattoo on your body before they ink it in. Make sure it's exactly the size you want. Also, make sure the placement is where you want it. Now is the time to change your mind if you're going to., A watercolor tattoo, like any tattoo, needs to be taken care of. Treat it like a wound because that's basically what it is. You can remove your bandage as early as an hour after getting the tattoo. You'll need to use antibacterial soap on it while it's healing, making sure you pat it dry after washing (don't scrub it). Also, you'll need to apply an ointment, which you can likely buy at the tattoo parlor. Make sure to follow all the care instructions offered by your tattoo parlor.Wait to swim until the tattoo has healed, and be sure to use a moisturizer on it once it's healed.

Also see if the work will be done in a private room away from other contaminates circling in the air.Additionally, see if the technicians are following standard health and safety regulations such as having a clean and neat workspace, using gloves while they work, and using new equipment for each client.

, See how long the company’s technicians have been in the industry and how many procedures they have done. Also ask to see proof of certificates of training, as well as continuing education.Unless they have been in the field for more than a year, a two-day course does not qualify as training.

, Look at the pictures and ask if it is the technician’s own work. Additionally, see if their work matches your personal style; for example, is it too dramatic or not dramatic enough?You can ask for references from clients who have had work done by a specific technician.

Decide on placement.,
Choose a design for the tattoo.,
Find a tattoo shop and artist.,
Test out a design before you get it permanently.,
Consider career limitations.",How to Get a Tattoo on Your Fingers1," Determine where on the fingers and on which finger you’d like to place a tattoo, as you have several options.


Knuckle tattoos are generally placed between either the first and second or second and third knuckles of any finger, on the flat back surface. Lettering across multiple “knuckles” is commonly suited to this placement, which is more likely to hold ink well than anywhere else on the finger, given that it is less often in contact with other fingers.
Tattoos can be placed on the side of any finger, as in where two fingers might touch when together. Small images and even words are commonly inked here.
Ring tattoos mimic the band of a metal ring by going all the way around a finger. Note that this and any other finger tattoo that has ink on the inside of the hand can more easily blur and fade because it is frequently exposed to movement, sweat, sun, and washing.;
, Come to a sure decision about the design of your tattoo and whether it will be in color or black and white.


Consider popular designs for finger tattoos, which include simple lettering, symbols, and sentimental or marital themed pieces for a creative alternative to traditional rings and wedding bands.
Avoid very intricate, detailed, or precise designs, as a finger affords very little space for tattoo art, and the ink may not hold color and detail as well as other areas due to the nature of the skin.With any tattoo, it’s a good idea to visit a tattoo artist in your process of deciding on a design, whether you are familiar with their art and want to leave more creative control to them, or you want to see how they’ll interpret a very specific design that you want.

, If you are getting a permanent tattoo done, do your research into any tattoo parlor you’re interested in, as well as the specific artist who will work on you.


Note that there are some tattoo shops and artists who will not perform finger tattoos as a general rule, usually because they believe ink does not take as well to the skin on the fingers. Definitely be sure to check with the shop about their policies ahead of time.
Examine the shop itself for cleanliness and proper disposal methods, as well as looking into the license and certifications of any artist. Be willing to pay more for a quality shop or an artist with more experience.If you are opting for a henna tattoo or other temporary method, search for shops that apply henna or buy your own online or in stores.

, Get used to having a finger tattoo design by creating a temporary one and continuing to redo it to determine if you still like it over time.


Get a henna tattoo with your design for something that will last for up to a couple weeks. You can have the tattoo redone or do it yourself to test it out for an even longer period.
Try a premade temporary tattoo from any store, or make your own using Sharpies or pens, eyeliner, or nail polish. Reapply as it wears off to test the tattoo for a longer period of time.

, Remember that many job industries and those hiring you may prohibit visible tattoos, or visible tattoos may hurt your chances at a job. Consider this before getting a permanent finger tattoo, as they are nearly impossible to cover or hide.


Those in the medical industry, law, corporate offices, etc. are more likely to have restrictions on visible tattoos like finger tattoos. Retail, service, creative, and physical labor industries are more likely to be accepting of body ink.
Keep in mind that even if there are no written restrictions in your current industry or one you plan to pursue a job in, any unexpected job interview in the future may be negatively impacted by tattoos. About 60 percent of human resource managers surveyed in 2012 said a tattoo could hinder the chance of getting hired."

Get the tattoo done by a professional.,
Follow care instructions.,
Be prepared for upkeep with touch-ups.",How to Get a Tattoo on Your Fingers2," Go to the shop you researched and decided on, allowing plenty of time for the process of getting the tattoo.


Be prepared for the tattoo to hurt while getting it done, as any tattoo does. Finger tattoos can be particularly painful, as there is very little muscle to pad between bones and tendons, through which the vibrations of the tattoo machine will then resonate.Remember to hold still and be patient, as a finger tattoo is very small and requires the artist’s attention to detail to complete it carefully.

, Always listen to your tattoo artist and follow any guidelines for cleaning, moisturizing, and otherwise dealing with your tattoo after application.


Because the skin of the hands and fingers regenerates quickly, it’s typically advised that you moisturize frequently with an unscented lotion and refrain from exfoliants or harsh soaps, especially in the initial healing period.
Keep hands clean, and wrap the tattoo with your aftercare cream and plastic wrap if you must cover your hands with gloves of any sort during healing.

, Know that a finger tattoo is nearly guaranteed to need touching up by a tattoo artist later on in the life of the tattoo, due to “fall out,” bleeding, fading, or any of the other common issues associated with tattoos on sensitive skin such as this.


If you see blurring in the lines of your tattoo, or parts of the color didn’t take right away after getting your tattoo, notify your tattoo artist and make an appointment for two to four weeks later to go back in and get it cleaned up.It’s always a good idea to return to the same artist that did your initial tattoo to get touch-ups done, whenever possible, unless you had a negative experience with him or her.

"
"
Use decal or “waterslide” paper.,
Try a henna or airbrush tattoo.,
Apply a simple pen drawing.",How to Get a Tattoo on Your Fingers3," Purchase paper meant for applying decals or temporary tattoos and design your finger tattoo on it before transferring it to your skin.


Remember that any design you create on paper will appear flipped as in a mirror image when you transfer it to your skin.
Make sure that you place paper decals exactly where you want the image to end up, as the finger is a tricky surface to place the flat paper on before it is made wet for the transfer.
It’s best to use non-toxic markers or inks for designing temporary tattoos on paper.

, Visit a shop, ask a friend, or apply your own temporary tattoo using natural henna ink or airbrushed paint.


Get an airbrush tattoo, which uses stencils to create crisp designs, usually in a gradient of colors. This is typically done by an artist with the airbrushing equipment, unless you already own the correct materials.
Get a henna tattoo by visiting a professional mehndi artist who can create beautiful designs by freehand, or apply your own, for a lasting temporary tattoo. Make sure to allow the ink to dry before rinsing, and follow any other care instructions your artist or kit recommends., Use a permanent marker or an eyeliner pencil, or another similar tool, to create a temporary design on yourself.


Avoid toxic inks for use on your skin, especially if you continue to reapply when your design wears off.
Keep the finger with the temporary design as dry and undisturbed as possible. This may be difficult due to the frequent and varied use of the hands.

Doing your homework can lead you to an artist whom you trust as well as offers the aesthetic you want for your tattoo.Ask family, friends, and acquaintances for recommendations of tattoo artists in your local area or beyond.
Check tattoo magazines and social media accounts of different tattoo artists to see examples of their work. Most artists regularly update their accounts. You can also look up reviews of artists online.;
, It’s important to feel comfortable and safe with your tattoo artist.You also want to ensure that they practice in a hygienic environment with single-use needles.Scheduling a consultation with potential artists can help you locate the best choice for the tattoo you want behind your ear.Discuss your wishes for the tattoo, including color options such as grayscale. Ask about things such as cost, suggestions to optimize the artwork, and pain factor., Tattoo artists should have autoclave sterilization as well as single-use, sterilized, and pre-packaged needles. Artists should also use gloves any time they are tattooing or touching another person.Let the artist know of any skin conditions or other medical issues you have, both of which can increase your risk of infection. This may also affect how the artist tattoos you or if they feel comfortable proceeding.

, After you meet several different artists, make an appointment in the near future with the one you like best. This allows the artist to draw the tattoo and consider the placement behind your ear. It can also help ensure that you don’t change your mind about the tattoo design or placement.Clarify costs and the time it will take to get inked with your artist. You may require one or two sessions to finish the tattoo. This often depends on how elaborate your design is.
Ask if there are any pre-ink instructions you should follow. This may include not shaving or drinking a glass of orange juice., You may be excited to get your tattoo, but it’s important to get a good night’s sleep. This will help you sit calmly while the artist inks behind your ear., Take a shower and wear clean, comfortable clothes to your appointment.Getting a tattoo is an intimate experience and being clean for your appointment can help prevent potential infection and not offend your artist.Wash your hair and use a gentle cloth to clean behind your ear. Pull up longer hair. The artist will clean the area again before your appointment.

, Have a full meal of protein-rich foods and some simple sugars before your tattooing session. This can give you energy and keep your blood sugar from plummeting during the appointment. It can also help you to sit more calmly.Choose heavier foods such as bison burger, guacamole, or an omelet for your meal. A glass of fruit juice or even soda will provide some simple sugar. Take a non-alcoholic drink and snack to eat during your appointment., Tattoo artists will not tattoo any person who arrives at their appointment under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This is illegal because you are neither in the mindset to make a serious decision, nor are you able to legally sign the liability waiver and consent forms that all artists require.Recognize that alcohol, caffeine, and drugs can thin your blood, increase bleeding, and make it hard to tattoo behind your ear. They may also make it difficult for you to sit still during the appointment.Provide the artist a doctor’s permission note if you are using medical marijuana or another controlled substance for medical reasons. They may not ink you without one for liability reasons.

, Getting a tattoo can cause pain, though every person reacts differently to it.The area behind your ear may be more sensitive than other places. Talk to your tattoo artist about taking an over-the-counter pain medication or using a numbing cream before your appointment.Recognize that pain relievers or numbing creams may not dull pain for everyone. They can also thin your blood, which may make it harder to tattoo you.Follow the directions for taking a small amount of pain medication such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or naproxen sodium if you feel the need to take something.

, You may have some fear or anxiety about pain when getting your tattoo. Listening to music or talking to the tattoo artist can help you relax. This may also help you get through the appointment more quickly.Try breathing exercises to help you relax. You can also do positive reframing to distract yourself from the buzzing needle sounds.
Talk to your tattoo artist if you like. Some artists may be more talkative than others.

, Because the area behind your ear is so sensitive, you may have slightly more discomfort than usual. If any pain becomes unbearable, ask your artist if taking a short break is possible.

Check the environment.,
After you get pierced, make sure that your piercer gives you specific aftercare instructions.,
Try not to touch, rub, or hit your piercing.",How to Get a Body Piercing," Make sure that it is in a place that is going to suit you, and also a place where it won’t interfere with your workplace if you work. But then again, you can always get a clear retainer to minimize the sight of your piercing so you won’t have to take out your piercing.


A retainer is a clear piece of body jewelry that you replace your metal jewelry with so that the hole won’t close, while making the piercing virtually invisible.





;
, Always be sure to go to a professional to get your piercings. Any piercer you go to should be working in a studio certified by the Association of Professional Piercers (safepiercing.org) and not Claire's, Walmart, Piercing Pagoda or your friend. Make sure that the studio has an Autoclave, which the piercer should use to sterilize his tools and the jewelry. Alcohol wipes are not a form of sterilization. All needles should be single use. Make sure that your piercer is wearing gloves. You can get HIV or other infections from unsterilized needles and jewelry. You do not want this to happen! Watch carefully. Do not be afraid to speak up if something is not right. Also, pick the correct type of jewelry in case you are allergic to metals of any kind.

, Does it look clean? Do you feel safe? Are you seconding guessing anything? These are questions to ask yourself. You can always back out of a piercing if you don’t feel right. Or you can go to another parlor if the current parlor is doesn't “feel right”. Follow your gut instinct.

, Do whatever they tell you to do, and don’t divert from it. Do it for the recommended time so that your piercing will heal properly.

, If you touch your piercing, bacteria from your hands might get into your piercing and infect it. Rubbing and hitting your fresh piercing can cause irritation and possibly infection.

Follow after-care instructions.",How to Get a Medical Tattoo," A “medical alert” tattoo is a tattoo that communicates important medical information about a patient, such as a severe allergy or the presence of a disease. These tattoos are meant to replace traditional medical alert bracelets, which can get lost. Although these tattoos are growing in popularity, there is still no consensus about the design or placement of such tattoos. This can make them more difficult for medical professionals to detect., A “meat tag” is a tattoo on a member of the US military, meant to indicate essential identification data. These tattoos—which perform the same function and often mimic the appearance of traditional “dog tags”—are growing in popularity within the armed forces., External radiotherapy (sometimes called external beam radiotherapy) is a form of cancer treatment that uses a machine to aim beams of radiation at cancer cells. A series of marks must be made on the patient’s skin—either small tattoos or dots of permanent marker—to guide the radiotherapy process. Radiotherapy tattoos are preferable to marks made by permanent marker because they cannot be accidentally washed off.Unlike other medical tattoos, you may have this done directly by your radiographer.
If you prefer to have these tattoos done at a studio, your radiographer can draw marks for your tattoo artist to follow.

, Following breast surgery (usually a mastectomy, but sometimes also breast reductions) many patients opt to have tattoos done. These may be cosmetic—tattooing on an areola or replacing lost pigment—or aesthetic—an elaborate design to cover scars and/or signify one’s journey. Sometimes women opt to have a post-mastectomy tattoo instead of breast implants or other cosmetic surgery. Other times, these tattoos are in addition to cosmetic reconstruction., With the exception of radiotherapy tattoos (which will be small dots), you will need to select a design for your tattoo. Even if you want something simple (such as plain text for a medical alert or meat tag tattoo, or the replacement of an areola), you will still need to make some decisions (such as selecting a font, size, and/or color). If you want your tattoo to be more elaborate, begin by doing some internet searches to get ideas. Then, meet with a tattoo artist to discuss details. Many artists will do a custom design for you, though some may charge a fee for this service.

, The location of your tattoo will vary depending on the type of tattoo you need, and how large you want your tattoo to be. A tattoo artist can help you to make this decision. Be aware that some areas of the body are more painful to tattoo than others (such as the rib cage).


A post-mastectomy tattoo will appear on the chest.
Meat tag tattoos are traditionally done on the upper rib cage, although sometimes these appear on the chest.
Work with your doctor to determine the proper placement of radiotherapy tattoos.
Medical alert tattoos appear on a variety of bodily locations. To increase the likelihood that a medical professional will see and recognize your tattoo, consider placing it on your wrist or forearm, where you’d normally wear a medical alert bracelet.

, Getting any kind of medical tattoo is a big decision. As such, it is good to discuss it with your doctor. If you have a disease or have recently had a medical procedure (like a mastectomy), your doctor can determine whether or not you are well enough to have a tattoo done.

, Begin by doing an internet search for tattoo studios in your area and/or by getting recommendations from friends. Plan to go visit a few shops. There are several things you will want to look for in a reputable shop:


A clean environment.
Tattoo artists wearing gloves.
Certificates hanging on the wall, such as a certificate for a “blood borne pathogens” training course, and a CPR certification.
Artists portfolios (to see the quality of their work).

, Once you have chosen an artist, a design, and a location on your body, all that is left is to show up for your appointment and receive your tattoo. Your tattoo artist should be able to give you a rough estimate of how long the tattoo will take. Be aware that depending on the location of the tattoo, and your own tolerance for pain, getting that tattoo may be a painful experience.


Be aware that tattoos can be expensive.
Get a price from your tattoo artist before you begin and be sure you will be able to pay.

, After your tattoo is finished, it is important to take good care of it. A tattoo is essentially an open wound. Improper care can result in infection, and poor healing which can damage the tattoo.


When the tattoo is finished, leave the bandage on for at least one hour.
After one hour, remove the bandage and wash your tattoo with unscented antibacterial soap.
After washing, apply a thin layer of unscented body lotion.
Repeat this regimen once or twice per day, but no more than this.
Avoid scratching, direct sunlight, swimming for 3-4 weeks until your tattoo is healed.

Talk to the artist.,
Ask for the paperwork.,
Look for good safety practices.,
Listen to your gut.",How to Find a Tattoo Artist," Ask friends and relatives with tattoos for the name of the artist who did the art you particularly enjoy, or for recommendations in general. Even complete strangers are often happy to talk about their ink.;
, Visit local tattoo parlors to check out catalogs of their artists' previous work. You can often find their portfolios online as well, curated on blogs or Instagram accounts dedicated to a particular type of tattoo work.

, The best tattoo artists generally attend these conventions. You can have work done here, or just use the opportunity to browse.

, If a deal seems too good to be true, it is. A cheap artist is almost always a bad one.


In the United States, you can expect a decent artist to charge between $50 and $300 per hour, depending on skill level.

, Search for the artist's name online, as well as the name of the tattoo parlor she works at. Avoid the place if you find reviews or reports of infections or sub-par health and safety practices.


Don't believe the parlor's personal website when it comes to customer testimony.

, The artist you feel most comfortable with generally gives you the best result. Make sure he pays attention and understands what you're going for. He should also be experienced with the style of tattoo you're paying him to do. Many artists specialize either in color or line work, and may have further specialization within those categories.

, Always ask to see a blood-borne pathogen course certificate, as well as some sort of license. Check the expiration dates to make sure they're still valid.


These are usually displayed in the artist's work area.

, The following practices provide the highest assurance that the parlor knows what it's doing. Quality artists should never act rude or insulted if you ask them to do the following:


The artist should show you the date on the package containing the needles, and open it in front of you. (Even reusable needles are kept in a pouch during the autoclave sterilization process.)
Reusable needles and grips should be fresh from the autoclave, which should be visible on request.
The shop and artists should be free of dirt and obvious sanitation issues.

, If anything makes you feel uneasy or unsure, leave the parlor. ""It's probably nothing"" could lead to a nasty skin infection, or even a blood-borne illness such as hepatitis or HIV.

If you’re not ready to go the more permanent (and costly) route of getting a cover-up tattoo or getting laser-removal done, using clothing to cover the tattoo is a relatively easy temporary measure.
Flesh-colored tattoo-covering sleeves are available from online retailers, including sizes to cover the whole arm, lower or upper arm, wrist, and ankle.;
, Find a heavy-coverage foundation that matches the tone of your skin near the tattoo.


Certain makeup products are even designed specifically for covering tattoos and can be found online or at many beauty supply stores.
Though also not ideal for the long-term, covering your tattoo with makeup can help you deal with it in the short-term.

, Cover-ups typically involve covering the old tattoo with a new, larger one.


Find a tattoo artist or shop that specializes in cover-ups and can show you a portfolio of quality work. If it wasn’t done right the last time, you want to make sure it will be this time.
You’ll need a design that’s larger than the original tattoo--and sometimes significantly so.
Work with your artist to create a design that will work with the features of the old one. Because it’s often hard to completely cover over a new tattoo, you’ll want a design that can integrate and then camouflage the old one.
Most cover-up tattoos will be done in color in order to better cover the old one. Tribal-style tattoos tend to be the exception."

Look into laser removal.,
Determine if you’re a good candidate.,
Research reputable dermatologists.,
Research the technology.,
Understand the procedure.,
Know the potential side effects.",How to Fix a Bad Tattoo2," Laser removal for tattoos is usually a lengthy and expensive process, and one that’s not guaranteed to work.Depending on the location, type of ink, and depth of the tattoo, it may not be possible to remove it completely.

, Laser removal won’t work for everyone, so be sure you’re a good candidate before you sign on. Set up a consultation before committing.


If your tattoo has been previously treated with other tattoo-removal procedures that have resulted in scarring, laser removal may only cause more scarring.If, however, your tattoo has been treated before with minimal scarring, it may respond well to laser treatment., Make sure that the person who would be performing the removal has an established track record of strong work with minimal side effects.Ask your family doctor or dermatologist to refer you to someone who specializes in tattoo removal and whose work they know and trust.

, Be sure to research exactly what a laser treatment does before committing to laser removal.


Laser treatments use pulsed Q-switched lasers to break the ink particles apart so they can be absorbed by the body’s immune system. Once the ink particles have been broken up, they’ll go to the lymph nodes, where they’ll remain.
It generally takes between 5-10 treatments over a span of many weeks to remove a tattoo. Costs vary, but on average will run about $200 per session. Most insurance companies won’t cover the cost of tattoo removal unless it’s medically necessary., Be sure you know not only what the technology is, but what the actual procedure will be so there won’t be any unfortunate surprises after you’ve committed to it.


In general, a laser tattoo removal session will run as follows:You’ll be given protective eye shields, and the doctor may administer either topical anesthesia or painkiller injections before beginning.
The doctor will use hand-held device will up against your skin to direct the laser. You can expect each pulse of the laser to feel something like being snapped with a rubber band or spattered with hot grease.
After the laser has been applied to the entire area, the doctor will likely apply ice or a cold compress before covering the area with a bandage.
The doctor may give then you a topical cream to apply periodically to the site.

, Though laser removal is generally a safe procedure, there are certain risks for side effects, includingInfection: If not treated properly, the tattoo site can be subject to infection.
Scarring: There is a small chance that the treatment could leave you with permanent scarring.
Hypo- or hyperpigmentation: There’s a risk that the skin in the treated area will either become lighter or darker than the surrounding skin.

If you do not see such a compartment, check your owner's manual to locate the filter., As the parts of spa systems work together to achieve filtration, you should not run the spa without a filter cartridge present., Move slowly and gently to prevent damage. As you rotate, examine the filter for bottom threads that may also need to be unscrewed. If this loosens the filter, pull it up and out of the compartment., While many styles of cartridge filters are easily removed with a counterclockwise turn, not all are removed so simply. If a gentle twist does not loosen your filter, allow your owner's manual to walk you through the removal process., If you see rips, tears, or feel as though the center core element is loose, do not move forward with cleaning the filter. Be sure to replace damaged filters to avoid damaging other spa elements, such as jet lines, that may become prone to debris build-up., Look for a cleaning wand that attaches to your garden hose and comes equipped with soft comb-like teeth. Hold the nozzle at a 45 degree angle and use the comb to gently open and rinse debris from the pleats of the spa filter., Enzymes prevent biofilm—the sticky, tar-like film of bacteria that sometimes grows in pools and spas—by breaking up oils and other contaminants that create conditions for bacteria to grow.Adding a weekly dose of cleaner directly to the water thus keeps your filter clean by preventing a scummy ring of oils from building around the filter core., Gently part the pleats of the filter and examine for dirt build-up or large debris. Remove and throw away any large pieces of debris.

, Typically, five gallons is the amount of water necessary to fully immerse a spa filter. Do not worry about water temperature—hot water cleans more rapidly, but cold water will clean the filter just as well., Follow the instructions on your brand of spa filter cleanser to determine how much should be added per gallon of water.Do not use anything other than filter cleanser to clean your filter. Some people choose to use bleach or detergent to clean filters, but these harsh chemicals may actually damage filters or trigger issues with water chemistry., Before you treat the spa filter with cleanser, be sure to protect your spa by turning it off and visually inspecting your filter for damage. Spray with your hose-head cleaning wand to remove any lingering debris., If you used hot water, soak for roughly an hour. If you filled your bucket with cold water, allow the filter to soak overnight.Remember to keep your pool off while your filter is soaking.

, After it has soaked, be sure to thoroughly rinse it to remove chemicals or remaining debris. Remember to hold the cleaning wand at a 45 degree angle to prevent dirt from being driven into the core., Follow the sanitation instructions outlined in your spa's owner manual by adding cleansing chemicals directly into the water. Improper cleaning and water chemistry may lead to the growth of algae and bacteria that can make you sick. Excess residue may damage the components of your spa system and shorten the life of your filter., Taking your time to carefully clean a cartridge will ensure that you remove as much debris as possible, which will in turn lengthen the life of your filter. Plus, providing a thorough cleaning this time will make the next round of cleaning even easier., If you are putting back a recently cleaned filter, it should be white and free of debris. If it is tinted black or coated in a slimy residue, do not put in back in your spa system.A new filter should be installed every one to three years, so you will likely encounter an unusable filter at some point. It is a good idea to keep an extra filter in storage for when replacement becomes necessary.

, Simply reverse the removal process to replace a filter. For most filters, sliding it back into its compartment will require twisting it to the right., Once the filter has been installed, allow the spa to run for one full cycle before you use it. This will deplete any debris that may have collected while your spa system was not actively filtering the water.

Getting a referral for an artist who does constellation piercings well will increase your chances of getting a piercing that you like.;
, Once you have a few names of artists, you should look them up online and see if they have a portfolio or samples of their past work. A good piercing artist will usually have an official website or web page that showcases their style and their designs. You should review their past work to see if their artistic style matches what you want for your piercing.Check if their portfolio includes constellation piercings they have done in the past. Bookmark any examples that you like, as you can use them later as a reference point during your consultation with the artist.
If the artist works out of a piercing and tattoo parlor or studio, which they should if they are reputable, they may have online reviews of their work that you can read. Check that the artist is highly rated and has mostly positive reviews online from past customers.

, You can find reputable artists at piercing conventions in your area. Piercing conventions are a good way to see the work of many different artists and talk directly to the artists about their work. You may end up seeing an artist’s work that you like and chatting with them about getting a constellation piercing.


For example, you may ask the piercing artist, “Have you done constellation piercings before?”, “Can I see samples of your work?” and “How much do you charge for your work?”

, Many piercers are self taught, but this does not mean you cannot still confirm their skills and training. A reputable piercer will be willing to have a consultation with you before they pierce you to examine the area you want to get pierced, discuss your jewellery options for the piercing, and to outline any possible risks or complications.Make sure you have a consultation with the piercer at the studio or parlor they work out of. Check that the studio looks clean, sterile, and well stocked with the necessary tools for the piercing.
You should ask the piercer how long they have been piercing, how they learned to do piercing, and if they have any formal education or training.

, One option for your constellation piercing is to use your astrological sign for the design. Each astrological sign is derived from a constellation in the night sky. You can pick the constellation that represents your astrological sign for a piercing that is personal to you.You can find a list of the constellation for each astrological sign on Space.com.

, Another option for the design of your piercing is to pick a specific constellation that you like. You may look at maps of the night sky online or in a book and pick a constellation that you find interesting or pretty. There may be a specific constellation that you have always found beautiful, such as Orion’s Belt, that you pick for your piercing.The International Astronomy Union recognizes 88 constellations in the night sky, giving you lots of options to choose from.
Many constellation piercings are done on the ears and you may go for a design that creates a unique shape, such as a long constellation that dots your ear lobe or a constellation that curves up your ear.

, If you are not sure what type of design you are looking for, you can have the piercing artist create one for you. Many constellation piercings done on the ear have a free form design that illustrate stars hanging in the sky. Your piercer may suggest several different types of stars or a mixture of star earrings and small stud earrings to create a unique design.Ask the piercer to create a sketch of their design so you can look at it before you get it done. The sketch should be drawn on a sketch of the area you are going to get pierced, such as your ear. You should understand exactly what you are getting done on the area before you agree to the design.

, Once you have settled on a design for your constellation piercing, you should make a formal appointment for the piercing with the piercer. The piercer should tell you how long the piercing will take and allot enough time for the session.You should be aware of how much the piercing is going to cost beforehand so you are prepared to pay for the piercing at your appointment. Some piercers may require a portion of the payment upfront to confirm the appointment.
Be wary of a cheap price for the piercing, as this may indicate the piercer is not of quality. You should get a breakdown of the costs for the piercing, from the piercer’s services to the jewellery used for the piercing, so you know what you are paying for.

, You should arrive for your appointment with the piercer on time, with the area you are getting pierced clean and free of any jewellery. For example, if you were getting constellation piercings on your ear, you should take out any jewellery in your ear and pull your hair back so your ear is exposed.


Depending on your pain threshold, you may take over-the-counter pain medication before the appointment to help with any pain or discomfort.
The piercer should walk through each step of the process during the session so you know exactly what is happening.

, Once the piercing is done, you should look at it in the mirror to make sure it is what you want. The piercer should then outline how to take care of the piercing so it heals safely. Always wash your hands before touching the area. You should clean the piercing three times a day using an aftercare formula. Remember to turn the earrings one full rotation at least three times a day to make sure the holes heal properly.For the first six months of healing, you should always leave your earrings in or take them out for no longer than 24 hours as time. This will prevent the piercings from closing.
Depending on the type of piercing you have, you may have a healing time of six to twelve weeks. Your piercer can give you a more specific healing time based on your piercing.

, Loofahs start out hygienic, but the accumulation of dead skin cells and storage in humid environments turns it into a bacteria haven. Soak your loofah in diluted bleach for five minutes each week to kill bacteria and germs., Essential oils have antimicrobial properties that help deter bacterial growth. They also contain no irritants or harsh chemicals, which is good for both your skin and the environment.On a weekly basis, soak your loofah in a solution made up of warm water and a few drops of pure essential oils. You can purchase essential oils from most health food stores.

There is no dermatological definition of sensitive skin, but you should consider your experience. Exfoliating creams can be harsh on those with sensitive skin, so you should take this into account. Your skin may be sensitive if:


You easily break out in rashes.
Your skin often gets blotchy and itchy after using skincare products or in response to the weather.
Your skin sometimes stings after washing, or being outside., If you are prone to breakouts and you often have pimples, you may have acne-prone skin. It’s important to think about this and take it account when you are choosing an exfoliating cream. Exfoliating products can aggravate acne-prone skin, especially if they are courser or rougher creams., If you are having serious problems with your skin, and you are struggling to determine which kind of products are best for you, make an appointment with a doctor or dermatologist. A medical expert will be able to give you fully informed advice about what to try. In some instances you may be prescribed particular treatments.


Speak to a medic if you skin is not responding to over-the-counter treatments., Before you go ahead and try to get the right exfoliating cream for you, it’s a good idea to find out about the different types of products available. Generally exfoliating products can be divided into the two categories of physical (sometimes known as mechanical), and chemical.


Physical products are grainy, with abrasive ingredients designed to physically remove dead skin cells.
Physical exfoliants are generally scrubs, or microdermabrasion pads.
Chemical exfoliants use enzymes or acids to remove dead skin cells.
Chemical exfoliants can be creams, gels and scrubs.
They often contain either alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs).

, Before using the exfoliator you should do a sensitivity test. Use a small amount of the product on the area of the neck behind the ear. Look for signs of hypersensitivity within 24 hours. If everything seems to be fine, you can then use it on your face. Use it only once a twice a week at the start and monitor the reaction.


Be sure that you have the right texture for your skin. You want to get a product that is not too harsh on your skin.
The scrub should feel grainy, yet not sharp so as not to harm your skin.
You may like to follow exfoliation with a moisturiser to tackle any dryness you experience.
If you have a darker complexion be extra careful, because an exfoliant may provoke post-inflammatory pigmentation, which can be hard to reverse., If you have oily skin, you should try a chemical exfoliant that has BHA. These products can be the most effective at exfoliating the surface of your skin and inside your pores. You can also add a gentle physical exfoliant into your skincare routine. Try a small amount of a new product first to see how your skin reacts.


If you have oily skin, you may be able to exfoliate once a day.
If your skin becomes sore or irritated, exfoliate less often., If you have dry skin, you will need something a little less severe than if you had oily skin. Look for an exfoliating cream that has AHA. AHA is a softer option than BHA, and is generally appropriate for those with dry skin. You will only need surface exfoliation, and a harsher product could cause more dryness and discomfort.


If you have dry skin, it’s best to exfoliate less frequently.
Start by only exfoliating once a week and then see how your skin responds.Experiment with how often you exfoliate and see what works best for you and your skin., If you have acne-prone skin, you should take care and ensure that you do not use an exfoliant that is too rough or harsh. Doing so may cause inflammation and aggravate your acne.Exfoliation can help you to clear out dead skin, and clear your pores.


Try a BHA product that is designed for everyday use.
This should mean that it is gentle enough not to irritate or inflame your skin, but you will still benefit from the deeper exfoliation without the physical aggravation.
If you are struggling to cope with oily and acne-prone skin, talk to your doctor about prescription retinoids.

, If you have normal or combination skin, you should try a BHA product, and a mild physical exfoliant. Normal or combination skin should enable you to use a BHA product which exfoliates more deeply than one you would use if you had dry or sensitive skin.


People with Normal and combination skin can generally exfoliate twice a week.
Always monitor your skin and note how it responds to the product you use.

, For sensitive skin you should be extra careful not to use a harsh exfoliant. Avoid anything that has a high content of glycolic acid, and look for gentle exfoliants that are specifically designated as suitable for sensitive skin. Use a very gentle scrub, and be modest with your usage.


Avoid all strong peels and scrubs, but consider something softer like an enzymatic peel.
Products with bromelain, papain or ficain can be good for sensitive skin.Don’t exfoliate more than once a week, and stop if you experience pain or irritation.
Use a moisturiser after exfoliating, to ease dryness.

Periodically pressure wash the exterior.,
Perform general maintenance.",How to Clean a Sauna," Dip a hand brush into a bucket of water and scrub down all the areas where you, or any other people, sat during the steaming. 30 seconds of scrubbing should be enough for regular cleaning.Rinse the wood down with clean water when you are finished.Keep your brush and bucket near the door to remind you to clean as you leave the sauna.;
, If you notice stains on the wood from sweat, you don’t want those to stay. Dip your hand brush into a solution of warm water and a mild detergent and Use towels in the sauna to prevent stains. You don’t necessarily want to wear one during the steam, but at least lay one down on the bench where you will be sitting. This will prevent too much sweat, dirt, and dead skin from getting into the wood, which is what causes stains.If stains are particularly difficult to get out, use a light sandpaper to sand down that part of the wood.

, If you tracked dirt, hair, or other stuff on to the floor, use a vacuum to pick up any loose particles. Even if you don’t see any dirt, vacuum every few weeks to get anything that might be in there., These include drains or ventilation where moisture may gather, places that might not dry as quickly and can breed pathogens. Take them out of the sauna, and scrub down with a disinfectant to prevent mold and bacteria., Clean out your sauna with soap and a hose to rinse it down. You don’t want anything stronger than a mild cleaner, so avoid stronger chemicals like ammonia. You should do this every few days if you use the sauna everyday, though you can do it less if you don’t use it as often., At least once a year, make sure to sand down your benches with a fine sandpaper. This will help get rid of any impurities that may have gathered over the year, as well as smooth out the surface again. When you are finished, the wood should be a “like new” white color., If you notice mold, go after it immediately. A bleach solution is probably your best bet to get rid of it, though certain saunas make their own chemical cleaners., It can be beneficial to mop the floor with a deodorizing cleaner to get rid of any odors left over. Remember to avoid harsher chemical cleaners, and stick to soap and water, or cleaners supplied by your sauna’s manufacturers., If your sauna is a separate building outdoors, use a pressure washer to clean off the outside. This will keep your sauna looking nice.Be very careful not to use the pressure washer on the interior. The wood inside the sauna is softer, and the pressure washer can damage it.

, Like any room or building, your sauna will probably also have little things that need work. Make sure to tighten any loose screws and brush out water spots as they appear.This will keep your sauna in good condition, and prevent you from having to do more work later.


If your sauna has a wooden door, the humidity may cause the door to swell. Keep an eye on the door’s hinges to make sure it opens and closes properly."

Use good body mechanics while you work; this will not only help you to avoid injury but enables you to use a more sensitive and powerful touch.,
Point your stomach towards the subject of your work.,
Do not bend.,
Use your body weight, not muscular strength, to work deeper.,
Breathe into your belly.,
Choose a proper stance.,
Take the opportunity to move and dance while you work.,
Use breath to remain calm.,
Use breath to focus.,
Learn to recognize strain.,
Use the principles of “less is more."",
Engage properly.,
Vary things.,
Know which techniques to avoid.,
Include still work as part of the massage.",How to Avoid Injury (Massage Therapists)," Good body mechanics require having a strong energetic connection with the ground through your feet, legs and hara (belly).;
, Your hara should usually be pointed in the direction of your work. Imagine your hara as a strong light that shines where you are working.

, Never bend your back to carry out a move. Lunge forwards in a tai chi stance, or kneel down if necessary.

, Always remember “lean don’t press.""

, Always find the quiet part within yourself by re-connecting with the breath.

, While working, your body should mainly be in one of the four stances described below. Using a massage stance should be a dynamic dance, allowing you to flow from one position to the other, depending on what is best for your body at that time.


Forward Tai Chi stance: Similar to a lunge. Particularly useful for effleurage based strokes. Weight can transfer between the front and back leg to give power.
Horse stance: Feet hip width apart and legs bent. Make sure knees roll outwards rather than medially to prevent strain.
Kneeling Tai Chi stance: This can be used to maintain good body mechanics when you need to be at a lower level than standing would allow.
Seated: Have legs wide apart and both feet firmly connected to the ground. Make sure that your own spine is not slumped.

, Put on some great music, move your hips, and enjoy yourself!

, The breath is a great tool for helping you to calm down, ground yourself, and deepen your intention and pressure while working. Get into the habit of regularly checking into your breath and body while treating; you will find that at moments of stress, you will tend to hold your breath and tense up your whole body. Check into the “space between breaths”, namely, the slight pause after you breathe out and before you breathe in, to remind yourself of the power of “less is more.""


You can deepen your pressure simply by breathing energy up from the earth through your legs and down your arms and hands.

, When you feel anxious or not good enough, take a few deep breaths into your belly – this will calm you and slow you down. Remind yourself you are good enough.

, During treatments, use your breath to regularly check into your body. Scan yourself from head to foot to see if anything is feeling strained or tired. If you are hurt, change what you are doing! Also, listen to your body between treatments. If you feel tired, in pain, weepy or irritable after a day's work, you need to change something about what you are doing – less massages per day, or longer gaps between treatments.

, Remember that the best treatments are not those with the most techniques crammed in,the deepest pressure, or the fanciest strokes. Your goal should always be to achieve the outcome that the client desires in the most elegant and energy efficient way. One thoughtful, slow, focused stroke executed with a listening touch is more effective than ten hasty ones. This feels much better too!

, Working deeply is not simply the application of deep pressure to the body. It is not a ‘harder’ massage or a more rigorous treatment. It is an experience of engaging the body’s tissue and its structures in a manner that is connected on a ‘deeper’ level. ‘Deeper’ in connection, contact, and awareness. It is not about strength or force but about focus.


You are able to work deeper by using your body weight to lean into the tissues and having the intention and breath to penetrate deeper into the tissues.

, The more techniques you have in your toolbox, the less chance of having repetitive motion on the same poor muscles. Go on more courses – expand your repertoire.

, There are many techniques commonly taught in qualifying courses that are best avoided altogether if you are intending to make a living out of massage. These include:


Petrissage: “Open c closed c” – This technique uses the hands in the shape of a “C” to lift and push the tissues between them. This is very stressful to the thumbs, hands, and forearm flexors. There are many other ways of creating the outcome of this stroke.
Thumb work: Most therapists have been taught to overuse their fingers and thumbs. Your thumbs should be thought of as the most precious tool you have. Only bring them out when absolutely necessary – approximately 10 percent of the time. Your forearms can do so much of your broad strokes and knuckles and elbows may be employed to get into the specific points.
When you do use your thumbs, make sure they are supported by your loose fist or are flat on the body. Never use your thumb with the MCP joint unsupported.
Effleurage with deviated wrists: Some therapists have been taught to massage the limbs with hands turned inwards to mould to the contours of the body. As far as possible, wrists and hands should always be kept in line or injury may occur.
Effleurage from the side of the table: Many therapists learn to massage the back with strokes towards the client’s head from the side of the table. This leads to unnecessary twisting and back strain.
Effleurage from the head of the table feels just as good to the client and is so much better for your body!

, It feels great. And it doesn’t hurt your hands. Give yourself permission to spend time holding your clients feet, head, back, or anywhere you feel needs it.


Focus and breathe energy into the area.

If you shop online, be sure to check user reviews to see what customers are saying. Only buy a chemical peel from a reputable company with excellent user reviews.Choose a product made in an FDA-regulated lab that is certified to be 99% pure or better.Make sure the product contains a phone number for customer service. You should be able to call and ask questions if you need to.;
, Different chemical peels are better for different needs and skin types. Choose the right peel for you:Glycolic acid peels: improve acne, blackheads, and dark spots; can decrease the appearance of fine lines and make skin smoother; are a light peel with little or no down time, but are harsher than lactic acid

Lactic acid peels: the best choice for hyperpigmentation, and good for first time users because it’s the gentlest option; fades dark marks and smoothes skin; can be used on all skin types, and better than glycolic acid for dry skin

TCA (trichloroacetic acid) peels: stronger and more painful, will cause peeling, and requires 7-10 days of recovery; can improve shallow acne scars, stretch marks, skin tags, sun damage, fine lines and wrinkles

, If this is your first time using a chemical peel, use the lowest concentration of chemical possible. Gradually increase the strength as your skin gets used to it, if you want to. Choose a formula that contains this low percent of the active ingredient:30% lactic acid
30% glycolic acid
8% TCA

, Stop using any products that contain tretinoin, like Retin-A or Differin, at least a week before your chemical peel. These products can irritate your skin, which could impact the outcome of your peel.For glycolic acid and lactic acid peels, discontinue there products for 3-4 days before and after your peel.
For TCA peels, stop using them for 5 days before and 10 days after your peel.

, Perform a mild exfoliation treatment 24 hours prior to your treatment, using a gentle facial scrub. After washing your skin, apply a pH solution to prepare your skin for the peel.

, Apply a dab of the chemical peel to your forearm or to the area of skin below your ear at the hairline. Leave the solution on for at least a minute before washing it off. Check the patch test after 24 hours to make sure your skin doesn’t react negatively to the peel.If your skin looks normal around the test area, proceed with your chemical peel. If your skin is irritated, red, or tender, lower the concentration of the active ingredient (glycolic, lactic or trichloroacetic acid) in the peel solution and try another test. If you get to the lowest concentration of chemicals and still see a reaction, do not do the chemical peel.
If you have any signs of an allergic reaction, like itching or hives, do not use the chemical peel.
Apply the peel with a Q-tip – using your fingers may make your fingers peel.

, Use water and a soap-free cleanser to wash your face.Finish with an application of a mild astringent such as witch hazel, or the prep solution that came with your chemical peel kit. Let the prep solution dry before you apply your peel.

, Avoid applying the peel to sensitive areas of your skin such as around your eyes, your nostrils, and the corners of your lips. Before applying your peel, dab some petroleum jelly onto these areas to help protect them from the acid., Use a cotton ball, cotton swab, small brush or Q-tip for the application process. Start with the less sensitive areas of skin around the forehead, chin and cheeks. Continue to apply the chemical peel to the lower eyelids, nose and neck area.


Make sure the solution is applied evenly, or your chemical peel results will be inconsistent.

, Most chemical peel kits recommend no more than 1 to 2 minutes, depending on the type of peel and the concentration of chemicals in the solution. Read the label before applying your peel so you know how long to wait. If your skin starts turning pink, wash the peel off.Watch your skin for signs of irritation. While some burning is normal, if your skin begins to sting intensely, remove the peel solution right away.
Use the spot test to determine how long to leave your peel on your face. If your spot test burns after two minutes, only apply it to your face for one minute.

, Many kits come with a neutralizing solution that stops the work of the chemicals so they do not continue to burn your skin. If your kit does not come with a neutralizer, that means your peel is designed to stop working as soon as it is washed off, and an additional solution is not needed.Read the instructions in your chemical peel kit to confirm if a neutralizer is needed.
To be safe, you can prepare your own mixture of water and baking soda to use as a neutralizer, in case the peel becomes too irritating. Mix this into a paste and apply it to your skin after you wash off your peel, if needed.

, If your peel goes well and you want to use a stronger peel in the future, you have some options. Always do a spot test before applying your full peel. Try one of these options to strengthen your peel:Use a formula with a higher percentage of the active ingredient
Layer your peels – apply a layer, wait 5 minutes, and apply another layer

, Liberally apply some facial moisturizer to your skin after you remove your chemical peel. Use your normal face moisturizer, or get a thoroughly hydrating solution for this purpose. Re-apply this 10-20 times throughout the day – don’t let your skin dry out.If you peel, don’t pick at it! Let your skin heal naturally or you might damage it. Dab Vaseline or Aquaphor over areas that are very dry.

, It’s normal for your skin to be red and to sting after your peel. This may only last a few hours, or the whole day. Soothe redness by wrapping a cold wet towel over your face. You can also try aloe vera gel, a cooling mask, ice packs, or putting a cool mist humidifier in your room., Your skin will be sensitive and tender after your chemical peel. Stay out of the sun until this subsides. If you do go in the sun, wear sunscreen on your face., Rinse your face twice a day with soap-less cleanser or water, for 10-30 seconds.Rinse your face with lukewarm water by splashing water onto your face over the sink. Pat your skin dry with a clean towel. Do NOT rub your skin., Avoid pressing your face into anything or rubbing your face until the skin heals. Sleep on your back so you don’t rub your cheek or forehead on the pillow., See your doctor right away if you have signs of an infection. This can be an area of skin that looks especially crusty and tender, yellow, or that oozes fluid."

Soreness in the toes, heels, or balls of your feet
Bumps or protrusions on any part of your feet
Difficulty walking or feeling uncomfortable while walking
Tenderness to the touch on any part of your feet;
, There are many things that can cause pain in your heel. Here are some of the most common causes:


Plantar fasciitis is the most common reason people have heel pain. It is caused by an irritated plantar fascia, which is the tough tissue that connects the toes to the heel bone.It can cause discomfort in the heel or arches.

Treatment for plantar fasciitis includes rest, over the counter pain relievers, or heel/toe stretches.


Heel spurs are extra bone growths on the bottom of the heel bone that can cause discomfort. They are usually caused by poor posture, inappropriate shoes, or by activities like running.Treatment for heel spurs includes choosing better shoes with a more supportive arch, rest, or over the counter pain relievers.



, There are many possible reasons that your foot might hurt in areas other than the heel. Here are some of them:


Metatarsalgia is pain that occurs from inflammation in the ball of the foot.It is usually caused by strenuous activities or by shoes that fit poorly.

Treatment includes icing or resting the foot, choosing more appropriate shoes, or pain relievers.


Bunions are bony protrusions on the edge of the foot, usually next to the base of the big toe.They are often caused by shoes that don't fit properly.

Treatment includes wearing more comfortable shoes or surgery, if the case is severe.



, Before doing any foot stretches, try to identify if it is your toes, heels, arches, balls of your feet or any other part that is hurting. Does it hurt worse when you are moving or bearing weight? Are you forced to change your gait?

, Many people walk with their feet bowed slightly out. This is known as being duck-toed. Other people walk with their feet turned slightly in. This is called being pigeon-toed. Although this may be a comfortable position, the muscles, bones and tendons are not being used properly. Bad foot alignment can be responsible for pain in the feet, knees, hips, and back.

, Stand with your feet facing forward and use a straight surface like the edge of a rug, a wall, or a yoga mat to align one foot and then the other so that the feet are facing straight forward. This may feel strange at first. Try to adjust your foot position whenever you can remember.

, Schedule some time at home to walk around barefoot.This can increase foot dexterity and stretch the muscles.

, Sit with your legs strait and your feet flat against the wall. Place a pillow underneath your buttocks.Lean forward with your back straight. Hold for 10 seconds. Rest for 10 seconds and repeat 3 times. This stretch is especially important for people who wear high heels.

, Lie on your back with your buttocks a few inches from the wall. Place your legs in a ""V"" and straighten them. You should feel a stretch in your inner thighs and help your arches. Lying with your feet above your chest can also help to reduce swelling.

, Stand up and step forward with your right foot and transfer weight to your right foot. Curl your left toes under so that the tops of the toes touch the floor. Lean forward slightly until you feel a stretch on the top of your feet. Hold for 10 seconds. Repeat the stretch 2 to 3 times on each side.

, Sit down and put your right leg on top of your left thigh. Place the fingers of your left hand between the toes on your right foot. This helps to widen your toes and stretch them. Do this stretch for 1 to 5 minutes, and then repeat it on the opposite side.

, Rub sore feet with a topical gel that contains an anti-inflammatory aid. The act of rubbing feet may also relieve muscle tension.

, Treat foot soreness with the Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation (RICE) method if your foot pain is acute. Rest your feet when they start to hurt. Place an ice pack or a bag of ice wrapped in a towel on the most painful parts of your feet and wrap them with a bandage or towel. Elevate your feet so that they are above your heart in order to reduce inflammation.

, High heels and shoes with little or no arch support may be the reason your feet are hurting. Invest in a few pairs of shoes that are designed to cushion your foot bed and alleviate pain.

, These shoes place the heel slightly lower than the ball of the foot and take pressure off the ball of the foot. They can also stretch the calf muscles. This can help alleviate pain especially for people who have intense pain in the front or ball of the foot.

, Many people do not address the muscles in their feet when they stretch. Develop a routine to help alleviate day to day pain.

, If your pain continues after you have consistently tried all of the stretching and home remedies, there may be something further wrong with your feet that is causing the pain and you should visit a doctor to get their opinion. Even if the outcome is that you have chronic pain and need to take pain relievers, it's important to rule out other possibilities first.

, If bunions become severe (meaning that they cause continuous pain, limit mobility, or cause foot deformity), you need to seek medical attention to get them removed. A doctor will either cut the bunion offor drill several holes in the protruding bones and anchor them with a type of mesh that can be tightened to correct the bone movement over time., If you have extreme pain in your feet because of arthritis, you may need to get a fusion surgery.This type of surgery involves removing all of the cartilage from the joint and then using screws and plates to join two bones together so that they no longer move. This can help alleviate the pain caused by arthritis and increase mobility.

, If you are a healthy athletic person and have injured yourself doing an athletic activity, you should see the doctor. You may have pulled a tendon or fractured a bone and it may need surgery to be repaired.

Be in good health and avoid saunas if you have any high-risk medical conditions.,
Drink two to four glasses of water before going into a sauna.,
Bring a clean, cotton towel to sit on.,
Do not wear anything dirty or tight-fitting to a sauna, including things that you wore throughout the day.,
Skip on the creams, lotions, and jewelry.,
Be well-rested and don't go in after a big meal.,
Bring a friend with you.,
Read the instructions to the sauna that you're using.,
Use a lower temperature, especially if you are new to using saunas.The maximum allowed temperature in Canada and the United States is 194°F (90°C).Some European countries allow much higher temperatures, which can be unsafe, especially after longer periods of time.,
Limit your experience to 15 to 20 minutes at the most.It's okay to get out sooner if you start to feel uncomfortable.,
Get out immediately if you start to feel dizzy, nauseous, or lightheaded.,
Cool down slowly after the sauna.,
Rest for at least ten minutes after getting out of a sauna.,
Follow up with a shower, but skip on the soap.,
Drink two to four glasses of water after getting out of the sauna.Your body loses a lot of water through sweating, so you will need to replenish that water quickly.

,
Consider eating a salty snack after leaving the sauna.,
Keep your sauna clean to prevent the buildup and spread of bacteria.",How to Use a Sauna Safely," Saunas are considered safe for most users, but some people need to take extra precautions. Others might have to avoid saunas altogether. If you are taking medications, or have any medical conditions, ask your doctor for advice. Some illnesses, such as a cold, might benefit from a short visit. Others might get worse. You should reconsider using a sauna if:


You have unstable angina pectoris, poor blood pressure, abnormal heart beats, advanced heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or severe aortic stenosis.
You have other high-risk medical conditions, such as: kidney disease, liver failure, or other cardiac conditions.You are a child, pregnant, or trying to conceive. Many places won't allow children under a certain age to use the sauna. Saunas may also affect the developing fetus, or reduce sperm count.
You are feeling sick, faint easily, have cramps, suffering from heat exhaustion or heat stroke.
You are taking medications that prevent you from sweating or cause you to overheat very quickly.;
, Saunas cause the body to sweat, and thus lose water. Because of this, is vital that you stay hydrated. If you don't drink enough water before getting in, you can get dehydrated. This can lead to heat strokes, or worse. Water is the best, but isotonic drinks are also suitable.


Avoid drinking alcohol before (and during) using a sauna. Alcohol dehydrates the body, which can become a big problem in a sauna. If you did drink alcohol and have a hangover, wait until it is over., This will help keep you clean, as well as protect the benches from body oils. If you are going into a coed sauna, consider bringing a cotton sarong or wrap to cover yourself with. Whatever you bring into the sauna must be dry and clean.Ideally, you should clean your sauna attire using water, and if needed, a little bit of white vinegar. A mild detergent intended for baby clothes is also a good substitute.

, Clothes pick up lots of dust and dirt throughout the day. The sauna's heat will loosen this dirt, and release it into the air and onto your skin. You also should not wear tight-fitting clothes, as your skin also needs to breath. Listed below are things that are not appropriate to bring into a sauna:Clothes you wore throughout the day are bad for saunas.
Shoes are bad choices for the same reason as your day clothes. Shower sandals are okay to wear to the sauna, but should be taken off once you get inside, especially before you get up on the benches.
Sweat suits and workout clothes are bad choices, especially if you just wore them to a workout.
Sauna suits made out of PVC are dangerous. They keep the skin from breathing, and can actually melt in the sauna. The high temperatures will cause them to give off toxic fumes, chemicals, and residue.
Old, loose-fitting swimsuits are okay, so long as they are colorfast, and contain no slimming panels or metal parts.
Anything that has metal on it. Saunas get hot, and metal heats up easily. If that metal is against your skin, you could end up with bad burns.

, Metal heats up fast in saunas, so while you might go in looking fashionable, you'll leave with painful burns. If you have any jewelry, take it off, and put it in a safe place. Do not take it into the sauna with you.You also don't want to wear any creams or lotions. If they don't run with your sweat and make an oily mess, they will clog up your pores and keep your skin from breathing and sweating., If you just ate, wait one to two hours before heading into the sauna.This is because your body will be using a lot of energy to digest and process that food. If you just finished working out, wait until your heart rate slows down and you regain some energy. Your body will need this energy in the sauna.

, Not only can a friend help you feel more relaxed, but he or she can help you if something goes wrong. If you go into a sauna alone and pass out, no one will be there to help you. A friend can help you in such a situation, and get you to safety., Each sauna will have slightly different instructions, so it is best to review them and not make assumptions. Most saunas will carry their own, specific health guidelines and warnings. If you are going to a public sauna, the instructions will be posted on the wall. If you don't see any instructions, ask the person in charge of caring for the sauna for more information.

,


If the temperature feels too hot, ask that it be turned down, or keep out.

, The human body is not made to withstand such high temperatures for long periods of time.

, Don't try to suck it up and deal with it, or stick it out. Proving your endurance is not worth passing out in a sauna, which can be very dangerous.Headaches, nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness are all signs that something is not right. You should take these signs your body is giving you very seriously, and get out.

, Some people like to have a warm shower before getting dressed after a sauna. Other people like to jump into a cold pool or shower right afterwards to stimulate their body. While this can be invigorating, it can send your body into shock, and it not a good idea, especially for those with heart problems.

, Don't jump straight to your next work out.Instead, find a cool place where you can sit still or lay down. This will give your body some time to recuperate and your heart rate to slow down.

, Start off using warm water. Once the sweat is all gone, lower the temperature to a pleasantly cool one. This will help your body cool down further.If you must use soap, go for a mild, natural soap. Saunas cause your pores to open up, and harsh soaps can irritate your skin.

,, This is especially important if you happen to sweat a lot.Pretzels or salty crackers would be ideal, so long as they don't contain too many fats. These salty snacks will help restore any sodium you lost in the sauna. Other foods that are good post-sauna (that go well with pretzels or salty crackers) include:Cheese, which will restore protein.
Fresh fruits, such as apples, which will restore any vitamins and fiber.

, If you have a personal sauna and use it regularly, you'll want to clean it once a week using a natural cleaning product, such as vinegar. Never use anything with chemicals. Here is what you should do:Vacuum the sauna to get rid of dust, hair, and dead skin cells.
Wipe down the benches and backrests with diluted white vinegar. This will disinfect the sauna.
Use baking soda on stubborn stains, especially oil-based ones.

, When pampering yourself, you don’t have to ask anyone’s opinion on what to watch, or argue with anyone about your pick. Instead, watch the movie you’ve been wanting to watch for ages that keeps getting vetoed by your partner or family.


Watch a chick-flick without guilt, or a documentary without being afraid you’re going to bore your friends. This day is all about you after all.

, Meditation is about releasing your worries and allowing yourself to mentally decompress. Find a quiet, calm place, sit down, and close your eyes. Focus on your breathing and let your worries float away from you.


If meditating isn’t really working, practice some breathing exercises. These can help you to release the tension that has built up in your body and will help you to destress.

, Thinking about the things that you are really passionate about can often get swept aside in the madness of the present. When pampering yourself, set aside sometime to consider your life and what you hope to attain.


Create a bucket list, or revisit a past bucket list that you made and consider how your goals have changed (if, indeed, they have).

, Look in the mirror and list everything about yourself that you love. Tell yourself that you are amazing, and that you deserve to be loved. Think of the things you have accomplished, and the experiences you have had.

Use gentle circular motions to slough off the dead skin.
If you’d like, shave your legs and other body parts after you exfoliate.

, Use a towel to pat your skin dry, then seal in the moisture by applying a lotion or body cream to your arms, legs, and torso. After your body is covered in lotion, put on your bathrobe to give it time to absorb into your skin before you get dressed.








, Wet it with warm water and use a washcloth or a facial brush to scrub away the dead skin. Be sure to use a gentle circular motion instead of applying pressure, since your facial skin is sensitive and could stretch and wrinkle if you handle it roughly.









Facial scrubs also work well. Buy one at the store or make your own by mixing up the following ingredients: 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) olive oil, 1 tablespoon ground almonds or ground oatmeal, and 1 teaspoon water. Use it to scrub your face, then rinse it off with warm water.

, Fill a small pot with water and heat it on the stove until it begins to steam. Drape a towel over the back of your head and hold your head over the pot to allow the steam to caress your face. Hold it there for two to three minutes to get the full benefits of the steam.









Be sure not to hold your face so close that it feels extremely hot. Your face should feel very warm, but not uncomfortably hot.
Increase the pleasure of a facial steam by adding a few drops of essential oil to the pot. Lavender, tea tree oil and rose water all have a relaxing effect.

, Doing masks at home is a lot of fun, and they leave your face as soft as a baby’s skin. Use a facial mask from the store or mix up a recipe using household ingredients. Apply it to your face for fifteen minutes, then wash it away. Here are a few popular mask options:









For dry skin: Mix 1 teaspoon honey and 1 teaspoon olive oil and
For regular skin: Mix 1 teaspoon honey and 1 smashed banana
For oily skin: Mix 1 teaspoon honey and 1 teaspoon cosmetic clay

, Trap in the moisture from your facial treatments using a good cream on your face to end the process. You can use either a storebought cream or a little facial oil, like jojoba, argan, or almond oil. These oils balance your skin without causing acne.









If your skin is very dry, use coconut oil. However, if you’re prone to getting clogged pores, coconut oil might lead to pimples.

, Start with a clean slate by removing the old nail polish from your fingernails and toenails. Use acetone-free nail polish remover if possible, since acetone dries out your nails.








, Prepare a bowl of warm water and soak them for five minutes with your nails completely submerged. This will soften the nails and cuticles to make them easier to shape.









Don’t use oils or soaps in the bowl of warm water. It’s better to use plain water so there won’t be residue on your fingers when you paint them.

, Use fingernail clippers or scissors to shape each of your nails into crescent shapes, rounding off the edges. Use a nail file to smooth rough spots and even out the shapes, so that all of your nails look professionally trimmed.








, Take a cuticle pusher or orange stick and gently push back your cuticles so they’re no longer visible on your nails. Be very gentle, and do not rip or trim the cuticles, since you need them in place to protect your fingers from infection.








, A good manicure has at least three coats: a base coat, a color, and a topcoat. Some people like to apply more than one color coat to ensure maximum coverage. Let your nails dry completely between coats to prevent smudging.









The best method for painting your nails neatly is to paint one stroke on either side, then fill in the middle.
If you want to paint a design on your nails, do it after the color coat, then add the top coat last to seal it in.

, Feet often get neglected in daily care, but this is your spa day, so take the time to do it right! Soak your feet in the tub or in a bowl filled with warm water. If your feet are dry or callused, use a pumice stone to remove the rough spots.









Some tough calluses need extra help coming off. Try a callus shaver or another instrument designed to remove dry skin.

, Shape your toenails with clippers, making sure to round off the edges to prevent ingrown toenails. Either go all out and do a three-coat pedicure, or simply apply a coat of clear polish to protect and enhance your toenails.

Peppermint oil is good for reviving feet, while lavender oil is good for soothing them.
Almond and milk soak is a good choice if you want soft feet. Make sure your feet are very clean in order to benefit more from this great treatment. Add one cup of powdered milk (dairy or soy) and one tablespoon of almond oil. Mix through. Soak your feet for at least ten minutes. Do not rinse.
If your feet are swollen, add one handful of Epsom salts or baking powder to the bowl.;
, If using the almond and milk soak (or any other luxurious foot soaking product), soak for fifteen minutes to get the softer feel.

, Remove any dirt under your toenails, and clip your toenails to a suitable length. If wished, slightly push back the cuticles, as the cuticles will be soft., Use a rich balm or cream, or exfoliate. You can make your own as follows: 1 spoon each each of unscented body oil, aloe vera gel, kosher salts and whole oats. Use this to exfoliate each foot.


If your feet do not quite feel smooth on the bottom or sides, use a hand held foot rubber with a rough surface.
As you massage your feet, take this opportunity to notice how they are; are there any bumps, warts, growths, cracks, peeling areas, etc. that need special attention?

Finish with a quick drying top coat.
It's recommended that you wait at least 45 minutes before wearing any closed toe shoes after polish application. Also, make sure that your feet are dry before doing any nail work or pedicure to your feet!

Turn your head toward your attacker.,
Stun your attacker.,
Reach to your attacker’s head.,
Stand up and attack.",How to Get out of a Headlock1," Turn into your opponent’s body so your airway is no longer constricted.This will allow you to breathe so you can escape the headlock.;
, Use your hand closest to the front of your attacker’s body to strike his testicles (if your attacker is male). Also try to strike your opponent in the gut or ribs with your elbow. Striking your attacker in the gut and ribs works for both male and female attackers.


Keep your outside hand free to attack his testicles, or to protect your face if your attacker tries to hit you.If it is a life-or-death situation, biting is totally on the table and it is an excellent way to injure an attacker if he is not set up properly.
However, do be aware that if he has you in a proper chokehold (elbow joint is aligned vertically with your esophagus, and his choking-arm hand is on his opposite bicep, with his opposite hand on the base of your skull), attempting to bite will give him an easy chance to pull your neck towards him, rendering you unconsciousness.

, Use your outer arm to reach around and up to your attacker’s face. If this is a life-or-death situation, use your fingers to try and gouge her eyes, reach underneath her nose with your hand or fingers to pull her head back, or reach underneath her chin with your hand to pull her head back.Keep your other hand on the arm or hand that was head-locking you.


The body has to follow the head. That is why pulling her head back will render her unbalanced., As you pull back your attacker’s head, stand straight up to disarm him even more (his back will be curved). Use the hand that was holding onto his head-locking hand and arm to attack him again in the ribs or groin and push him away from you.This would be your time to run and escape.

Protect your airway.,
Tuck your chin.,
Step back.,
Turn out and throw him down.",How to Get out of a Headlock2," Turn your head toward the side from which your attacker is choking you. This will ensure that your airway doesn’t get cut off. Use your hands to grab onto your attacker’s arm, with your fingers on the inside of her arm, near your chin., Raise or shrug your shoulders so you create a space where you can tuck your chin down to your body and get your fingers into the space between his arm and your chin. Aim to tuck your chin into the crook of his elbow; that is where there will be the most wiggle room.Sink down in his hold by bending your knees.


This will make it more difficult for your attacker to lock his arm onto your neck.

, On the side that your attacker is choking you, step your foot back behind her foot to lock in her leg.Don’t arch your back backward. Instead, keep your back curved forward. If you lean back, you render yourself defenseless with no balance.
Do not step out to the side, but back, behind her foot so your legs are calf-to-calf.

, Bend your knees and turn 180° toward your stepped foot.Your hands should still be on his arm, in between your chin and his arm. Once out of the headlock, pull diagonally across your body to throw your attacker to the ground.


Keep your opposite foot (the foot that didn’t lock behind your attacker’s leg) strong so as to trip your opponent as you throw him to the ground across your body.

Look twice, save a life.,
Look out for any cautions.,
Never take anything from strangers.,
NEVER accept rides from strangers.,
Get out of the way of cars.,
Remember where you're going.,
Don't approach strangers.",How to Have Street Sense," Everybody knows this rule but many people don't actually do it! Some people just run across, or cross without looking. Look both ways to save your life.;
, So, it's fine to say hello when that cute guy says hi, but what if a 53 year old man tells you he knows you from when you were really little and would you like a ride home? Have five flags for conversing with strangers. Flag 1 means no problems. Flag 2 means no problems except for maybe one comment that made you uncomfortable. Flag 3 tells you that this person is a little strange and making you a little uncomfortable. Flag 4 means to consider turning back, this person is really weird and making you feel uncomfortable. Flag 5 means you're really uncomfortable and to run.

, Street sense applies to cars, too! If you're about to pull out of a parking lot onto a street, then look before you go flying on out! It happens many times that you just fly right out and almost crash. Also check before people pull out and try to just let them out.

, Cautions to watch out for are trees, anything on the road such as bottles, and anything else that's dangerous. Make sure that you don't trip or bump into anything.

, They may say, ""Oh, hey! I have leftover Halloween candy! Here, have some,"" but what if they inserted razor blades or even poison? Don't even take it and don't eat it, just run away if you don't know them. If they live down the street, it's different. But if you're in a different neighborhood and don't know them, just don't take it!

, They might say they know where your house is and could take you home to avoid the long walk, but what if that ride home has you ending up in their basement, all roped up. Never accept rides from strangers!

, Many people ""don't care"" and will stay in the middle of the street when a car comes. Well, they probably will care when they're in a hospital bed and in court later.

, Don't try new routes unless you know how to get back home.

, Just stay away, or maybe they'll think you're a weirdo and call the Emergency Services, you never know.

De-escalate the situation.,
Apologize to the hostile party.,
Introduce yourself.,
Inspire sympathy from the hostile person.,
Confuse the other person.,
Intimidate the aggressor.",How to Get out of a Fight Unharmed1," De-escalation means reducing tensions between you and the person who is fighting you or wishing to fight you. To de-escalate the situation, don’t antagonize the hostile person. Express your disinterest in fighting.For instance, you might say, “I am not interested in fighting. Let’s go about our business.”
If someone pushes you, do not push back. If they stare you down, do not stare back. If they call you a derogatory name, do not call them a name back.;
, Even when you haven’t done anything wrong, apologizing to the person who wants to fight you can help you exit the fight without injury. Just say, “I’m very sorry for offending you.”If the hostile party cites a particular cause of offense, apologize in reference to the perceived offense. For example, if the hostile party says, “My friend doesn’t like you. I don’t like you either!”, you might say, “I am very sorry.”
If you’re in a bar, you might close your apology by offering to buy the aggressor a drink.

, If, after apologizing to the hostile party, they continue to act belligerent, you could catch them off guard by showing them you’re a friendly sort. Say, “Hello, my name is ____. What’s your name?” This will show them you are respectful and want no part of a fight., If introducing yourself and apologizing don’t work out, you could try to elicit a sympathetic response from the hostile party. You might, for instance, excuse your behavior (even if you’ve done nothing wrong) by saying, “I’ve just had a rough night, I broke up with my partner,” “Sorry, mate, my mom just passed away,” or “My mind isn’t right, I was just diagnosed with cancer.”Under normal circumstances, you should not lie. But in order to gain sympathy from the hostile party and exit a fight without injury, you might choose to resort to some mild deception.

, Instead of calling the hostile party names or cussing them out, you could disarm them by saying something zany and unexpected. Your non-sequitur will catch them unawares, thereby deflating tension and allowing you to exit the fight without being harmed. For instance, you might say:The cows sometimes have black and white spots.
My house is blue and red. This house is blue and green.
Yesterday it was rainy, but tomorrow it will be sunny.

, If being a nice person hasn’t helped you de-escalate the situation, take the opposite tack and try to look strong and unafraid. Throw your shoulders back and look them straight in the eye, shouting ""Get away!"" or “Back off!” as loudly as possible. This will let the aggressor know you are willing to fight if necessary, and hopefully make them think twice about taking you on."

Position your feet properly.,
Position your torso correctly.,
Position your arms for defense.,
Position your head defensively.",How to Get Into a Fighting Stance1," Think of your feet as the roots that keep your body in place. If you have a solid, well-balanced stance, you will be much harder to knock over. First, extend your non-dominant foot towards your opponent. Rotate your leg slightly towards your body so that your toes and knee point just to the side of your opponent. Extend your dominant foot behind you, about a shoulders-width apart from your dominant foot. Rotate your dominant leg so that your toes and knee are pointing away from your opponent. Your dominant leg shouldn’t be at a right angle to your dominant foot. Turn your leg in towards your body slightly if you find yourself doing this.
Stay on the balls of your feet. If you stand flatfooted you might be slower than your opponent.;
, Your feet are pointing to the side of your opponent; therefore, you will have to twist your shoulders slightly to face them. Keeping your body positioned at this angle gives your opponents a much smaller target to hit. Make sure to keep your stomach muscles tight and your back straight. Otherwise, you may be overbalanced easily. Once you’re in position, bend your knees slightly and rock your weight back and forth to test your balance.


Keeping your stomach muscles clenched improves your balance but it also protects your stomach if you get hit. Getting hit in a relaxed stomach is painful!, The placement of your arms is extremely important. They are your first line of defense and protect your face and body from attacks. Curl your hands into loose fists and raise them in front of your face.Your dominant arm should be close to your body while your non-dominant arm should be slightly in front of your body. Extend your non-dominant arm forward but not so far forward that you exhaust your shoulder.


Keep your elbows close to your body, but not so close that they touch your sides. In fact, if you flare out your elbows just an inch or two this will discourage your opponent from kicking.

, Keep your chin down and your mouth closed. By keeping your chin down you make the delicate bones around your eyes and nose a harder target to hit. Similarly, a hard punch to an open mouth can lead to severe jaw and teeth injuries. Therefore, keep your mouth closed even if your opponent is yelling insults at you. Make sure your fists are hovering near your face to protect yourself from attacks.Staying quiet in the face of insults has an added benefit. Confident people don’t feel the need to jeer at their opponents so staying quiet will make you appear more confident. This may spook your opponent and end the fight.

Run away from the fight.,
Perform “the fence.” If you’re not able to immediately escape the fight, or if you doubt your ability to strike your aggressor with enough force to distract or destabilize them, you should take action to keep them at bay.,
Call for help.",How to Get out of a Fight Unharmed2," While the number of people you're up against will affect your ability to escape from a fight without injury, your first instinct should be to escape whenever possible. If necessary, shove, disable, or distract your attacker in some way and run for it.Potential distracting or disabling maneuvers you might need to utilize include punching your opponent in the nose, shoving them away, or delivering a swift kick to the groin (if facing a male aggressor).

, The fence is a maneuver that both demonstrates a disinterest in fighting and prepares you to defend yourself if necessary. Show the hostile party your hands with the palms facing outward and fingers pointed up.At the same time, take a deep breath and breathe out slowly to help you relax.
You could also reiterate your unwillingness to fight by saying, “I do not wish to fight. Let’s go about our business.”

, If you’re in an area with security or police, get their attention so they can diffuse the situation. At the very least, attract the attention of passers-by so they can intervene on your behalf. Sometimes an aggressor can be dissuaded from pursuing the fight simply by having another set of eyes on them.When getting help from others, usually a simple ""Help me!"" will suffice. You might also try, “Over here!” or “Police!”

Strike the aggressor’s nose.,
Blind your opponent.,
Box the aggressor’s ears.,
Strike the neck or throat.,
Use pepper spray.,
Block incoming punches.",How to Get out of a Fight Unharmed3," Aim the heel of your palm at the aggressor’s nose and push upward. Move your entire body into the movement. The attack should knock them off balance temporarily.When punching, aim the knuckle of your middle finger at your aggressor’s nose (or whatever you’re targeting).Additionally, keep the top of your hand aligned with your wrist when throwing a punch. This will prevent injury to your hand and wrist.

, Your opponent will be unable to fight you when they cannot see. Try to poke or scratch the aggressor’s eyes with your fingers or fist. If you have any sand, dirt, or other debris around, you could grab a handful and throw it in your opponent’s face., If your opponent has grabbed your arm or neck, curl your hand slightly, then smack one of their ears with the flat part of your palm. Your aggressor’s head will jerk to the side. Use your other hand to strike them immediately in their eyes or nose., Use the blade of your hand – the area between your pinkie finger and wrist – to strike your attacker’s neck, stunning them. Hold your hand as straight and firm as possible. Pull your hand back as if you’re scratching your ear, then rotate it forward, extending at the elbow, and finally snapping your wrist into their neck.Alternately, push your whole outer forearm into your aggressor’s throat. This will knock them back and cause them to lose their balance.

, Pepper spray is a handheld canister filled with a noxious gas that irritates the eyes and lungs. If you have pepper spray on hand, you can spray it at the aggressor, then escape the fight before they recover., The exact technique needed to block an incoming punch varies slightly depending on the sort of punch your aggressor has decided to use.Generally, however, blocks fall into three different categories.To perform a ""guard"" block, cover your face and neck by bringing your forearms up in front of your face while tucking your chin. This block is good for blocking against wide punches.
To perform a ""catch,"" swat your the aggressor's hand away from your body or face just before they make contact. Your reflexes will need to be fast in order to perform a catch.
Finally, you could perform an interception. This involves raising your arm in an ""L"" shape on the side of your body the attacker is targeting. For instance, if your attacker strikes with their right fist, raise your left arm in an ""L"" to deflect the blow.

Use a groin strike to escape.,
Cripple your opponent’s knee.,
Stomp your aggressor’s foot when grabbed from behind.",How to Get out of a Fight Unharmed4," If you’re grappling with your attacker and unable to use your hands to land a strike, slam your foot or knee upward into your opponent’s groin. The pain of the impact will cause them to release you, allowing you to make your escape., Send a swift kick with the bottom of your foot into your opponent’s knee. You can aim at the front, side, or back of their knee. Don't stop when you simply make contact. Instead, push your whole weight through the attacker's knee. The impact will throw them off balance and allow you to escape., If the person you’re fighting has their arms around you from behind, bring up one foot as high as it will go. Slam the foot down on the top of your attacker’s toes. In their pain, they will loosen their grip, allowing you to escape."
"
Identify a potential attacker.,
Keep moving.,
Maintain your confidence.,
Defend yourself from attacks.,
Throw punches properly.",How to Get Into a Fighting Stance2," A person who is considering violence will usually grit their teeth and clench their fists. If they have any training, they may move a foot forward or turn their body to the side. They may also drop their chin as this is a natural reaction to protect one’s throat. Keep your guard up and be wary of warning signs. If you notice any of these signs, be ready to position yourself in a fighting stance.Always try to diffuse a bad situation with words before resorting to violence. Similarly, never initiate the fight; you should only engage in violence when you’re defending yourself or someone else.
If you’ve practiced getting into a fighting stance you will find it easy to do when you’re in a stressful situation. Practice as often as you can!

, Stay up on the balls of your feet. Bounce around to create movement. Keep your arms stiff and your knees slightly bent. This distracts your opponent and makes it harder for them to predict your movements. Take care not to move so much that you break your form. Move randomly. If you move with rhythm your opponent can time their attacks to your movements.

, Stay balanced, keep your stomach tight, and look your opponent in the eye. Make sure your back is straight and your shoulders are back. This pose suggests self-awareness and confidence. If your opponent thinks you’re unafraid, they may back down. Even if they don’t, your attitude will shake their own confidence and cause them to make mistakes when fighting.


If someone tries to leave a fight, let them. However, don’t turn your back on a defeated opponent as they may choose to attack when you’re not looking.

, Block your opponent’s punches using your hands. Keep your arms in the fighting position and loosely cup your hands at eye-level. When your opponent strikes out, quickly hit his arm away with one of your cupped hands. This action will unbalance your opponent and use their own strength against them. If you’re stance is well balanced, you won’t need a large amount of strength to do this.








If someone lands a punch on your head try to move towards the punch and clench your jaw. Make your forehead the biggest target. Your forehead is a very hard surface and your attacker may injure their hand.
If someone lands a punch on your body make sure to tighten your stomach muscles. Move your body so that the punch lands on your sides instead of your stomach., Extend your arm in front of your body. Make sure your wrist is straight and your thumb is on the outside of your fist. If not, you may injure your wrist or break your thumb. While extending your arm, twist your body into the punch. When you punch with your non-dominant arm you will pivot with your non-dominant leg, and vice versa. Aim for a spot just beyond the place you’re trying to hit to ensure that you give the punch the maximum force.








If you don’t use your whole body to punch, your hit won’t have very much force. Make sure your shoulders are moving into the punch with the rest of your body.

Watch good fighters fight.,
Join a self-defense gym.",How to Get Into a Fighting Stance3," Shadowboxing is a term for practicing without an opponent. This exercise can increase your speed and improve your form. To shadowbox properly, imagine your opponent standing in front of you. Next, imagine the different types of attacks they may use on you. React to these attacks with the same speed and force you would use on a real opponent.Begin your workout from a fighting stance. Everything you do needs to start from that position.
Once you get good at shadowboxing increase your workout by shadowboxing while holding weights. This will improve your arm strength and speed.

, If you have a favorite fighter watch their movements during their fights. Take notes on what they do and try to mirror your actions to theirs. Record the fights so you can watch them over and over. After a few viewings, stand up while you watch and try to mimic their movements as they move.


Make sure you’re watching the right kind of martial arts tournament for your goals. For example, wrestling is a great form of fighting but isn’t necessarily helpful for beginners trying to learn self-defense.
Pay attention to the different fighting stances that professional fighters use. If you notice something useful, incorporate it into your own fighting stance.

, There are many kinds of self-defense classes that you can take. For example, you could take a martial arts class such as Karate or Taekwondo. All martial art forms have different fighting stances. For example, the most popular Taekwondo fighting stance involves holding your open hands in front of your face to protect your head.However, all of these fighting stances have something in common: positioning your feet slightly apart and centering your body for strength and balance.


If you’re not interested in the strict tenants of a martial arts class consider taking a less structured course such as kickboxing or boxing. These courses are great ways to learn powerful self-defense techniques quickly.

Also they will have an inclination to lean forward. This will leave them open to uppercuts and affect their overall balance.;
, Both parties are likely to be injured and it is not a good way to act, so finding a way not to fight is the best way. Talking is a better way out or making distance or space so it is harder for them to attack you is always better than using your fists.

, You will need to have learned this in a class and have spent a lot of time doing it till you feel and understand that fighting someone bigger, smaller or taller doesn't matter; it is all just fear of being hurt or killed and this is normal.

, Most taller fighters are unable to really ""fight tall"", or truly take advantage of their height. Scan your opponent's face and eyes. Look at their stance (foot position), body language and distance away from you. Is your opponent nervous? Angry? If you move in aggressively does the opponent instinctively shift or move back and keep distance? If not they are probably unaware of how to use their height. You can use this to give yourself a chance to take them by surprise.

, You must motion to the other fighter that you don't want any trouble - even if a fight is imminent. Do this by holding your hands up by your face, palms outward, in a backing away motion - waving your hands slightly. This is the first set up to strike. Tell them you don't want any trouble - and regardless of what they say or do prepare yourself for a fight.

, In any street fight - especially against a larger or taller opponent you must get them first. The old adage ""never swing first"" does not apply. Use the open hand gesture above to launch a surprise first punch either to the throat or nose (never hit the jaw - this can be absorbed by most strong men and can hurt your hands). Speed is essential here. One punch is good but more punches are better. A combination of attacks or quick strikes will do more damage than one single strike, so if you can hit your opponent with more hits, do so. However, do not leave yourself open to a counter attack. Launch your fastest strike possible and immediately step back and return your hands to your face area for protection. While stepping back, circle around your opponent.

, If your opponent is still active you must make sure you keep your hands by your face at all times. This will allow you to use your hands, elbows, and shoulders to deflect punches and strikes from your opponent because they can launch strikes from a distance. Most fighters who are immature or inexperienced will try to hit the head area 90 per cent of the time. Use this to your advantage by keeping the hands up and moving your head and shoulders from side to side and up and down in a bobbing and weaving type motion. Your opponent will fire away at your head out of habit - but will connect on much less of his strikes. You will be harder to hit and confusing to defend when you launch strikes of your own. All the while you are ready to shuffle backwards, in a circle motion, on the feet to create space between you and your opponent while they advance.

, Your opponent will come at you with a combination or attack of some kind and once you avoid it, or block it, you will notice a moment when they pull back for an instant and regroup for another attack. As SOON AS your opponent has thrown the last of their strikes in a particular attack you must immediately step into their personal space - close to them - and attack viciously. You get close-in on them where their reach is negated. Using speed and a close-in attack will force them to retreat or back pedal. Throw with speed and ferocity - NOT PANIC - as many shots to their face and exposed areas as possible. Right before exhaustion you step out of their reach - not just a step back - but two or three steps back and regain your strength and stamina. DO NOT clutch or grab your opponent if they have a significant size or strength advantage. This will only turn out bad for you. This close-in attack approach is THE RULE for fighting taller guys. You can wait for them to finish an attack, as stated above, or you can get them by beating them to the punch when they come in. Either way you must close the gap and get inside of their long reach to do damage.

, This is important to look for because you can use these patterns to hurt your opponent with a counter strike. Let's say your opponent is always throwing a long jab punch and then letting their hands drop down to their waist area before returning their fist to their facial area. You could wait until the timing is right on their next jab and, after you avoid it, throw a power punch right over the top of their outstretched arm (as it begins its drop to their waist) and hit them square in the face. Or if you see a wild, winging power-punch coming from their right hand you could duck it and throw a counter-punch combo of your own. These counter strikes are lethal because they usually combine your power with the momentum of your opponents to hurt them extra bad!

, How do you do this? You simply step at an angle to one side while coming in - so you are facing your opponent, ready to attack - but you are not directly in front of them. You are at an angle - and therefore the usual instinctive indicators that we use to judge a target are slightly less effective here for your opponent. Also you will notice new opportunities to hit areas of weakness in your opponents defense from these angles. Also notice that you should preferably be working angles that position you away from their power. So if your opponent is throwing hard right crosses and hooks, you should be working angles that position you towards their left hand - away from the power.

, You must set up your combos and strikes by throwing out a solid jab. Each jab thrown requires a step forward with the lead foot. Use several jabs in succession with your step footwork in order to close in on your taller opponent and smother their long reach. Get deep into their personal space by setting them up with the jab and drop power shots to their ribs when they bring their defensive guard up to protect the face.

Go after the leader.,
Be strategic in how you plan your defense.,
Always know where all of your opponents are.,
Keep your opponents in a line in front of you.,
Use a weapon if you are skilled with it.,
Plan to go on offense aggressively.,
Use the objects around you to ward off your opponents.,
Keep moving.,
Attack first.,
Strike incisive blows.,
Use cheap shots.,
Avoid being flanked at all costs.,
Escape as soon as you can.",How to Fight off Multiple Opponents1," Many groups of attackers have a known leader. Try to draw this person into a one-on-one fight or attack him first. If he's down, the rest of the group is likely to be immobilized.;
, Try to avoid being caught in a triangle between multiple attackers. This situation almost certainly means you will lose, and fast.

, Even if you're fighting one of them at a time, you should know where the other opponents are and be ready to approach them as soon as you need to. Don't just blindly fight without observing your surroundings, or you'll quickly be outwitted.

, Keeping your opponents in a line (e.g., by backing away from them) can allow you to attack one person without being exposed to attack by others.

, Drawing a weapon may end the fight before it begins; it's also a way to equalize things when numbers are not on your side, or if the other side is also armed. If you are not highly skilled, know that your weapon may end up being turned against you, leading to death or serious injury.

, Don't threaten or give away your intentions once you have committed to fighting. If you've committed to fighting, you have to follow through or find a safe way to escape.

, Throwing a chair at one opponent, for example, while turning around to fight another opponent, can help you get the job done.

, Once you are planted in a location, it is easier to surround you. Take many small, quick steps with your feet to stay agile and to keep moving around in small increments.

, It is nearly impossible to defend from multiple angles; you need to be the first to act.

, You need to reduce your opponents' numerical advantage by any means necessary. Target weak spots such as the temples, groin, knees, and solar plexus. Even the nose can be useful because it will blind and disorient your opponents for a short time. And, if you know how to use pressure points, make sure you use them to your full advantage.

, There is no shame in using your teeth, knees and or nails at any time. Pride will cost you your life. Don't be afraid to kick your opponent in the crotch, to pull his hair if it's longer, or to scratch his eyes.

, Once one or more opponents have their hands on you, you are in deep trouble and will be unable to defend yourself.

, This is less likely going to be a fight you are going to win, and will more likely be a fight you are going to have to escape. If they're are no near by escape routes, then follow these fighting techniques.

Stop or prevent the fight before it starts.,
Run if you can.",How to Fight off Multiple Opponents2," Conflict starts long before a fight develops. Positive and assertive interaction with the group may off-set any violence. Do your best to minimize conflict by being good-natured, not picking arguments with volatile people you don't know very well, or making off-color comments that could deeply offend the people around you.

, Unless you are a skilled fighter or are in a situation where you cannot escape, your best bet is to run away, fast. Head to somewhere public and call for help. Running is also likely to separate your attackers, making it more likely to be able to confront them individually. Be extra careful when you're running so you avoid getting surrounded or running right in to a trap.

Hit the kidnapper's chin.,
Scream for help.,
Scratch the kidnapper.,
Fight hard.,
Bite the kidnapper.,
Headbutt the kidnapper.,
Claw your kidnapper.,
Escape.",How to Fight Off a Kidnapper," Since there is a nerve around the jawline, it will increase your chances of being able to knock out your attacker in one blow. By gathering all your strength into one hit, you may be able to render him unconscious. Even if you fail to knock him out, you have a high chance of dislocating his jaw and causing him severe pain.;
, Attracting attention with cries for help may cause the kidnapper to attempt an escape. Although his goal may be to kidnap you, he might not want to be caught in the act, especially since there is a risk of a crowd gathering. Scream, ""I am being kidnapped!"" or ""Call the police!"" For a higher chance of receiving help, you could also scream, ""Fire!""

, Nails can be extremely painful, especially if you use them in the right areas. Always aim for the eyes, as you may be able to temporarily or permanently blind him. Dig your nails into his flesh as hard as you can because your life may depend on it.

, Understand that your main objective is to escape. By hurting the kidnapper, you may be able to buy yourself some time to run. Attack vulnerable parts of the body, such as the groin, throat, and face. Use your elbow, as it is one of the strongest points in your body.

, Your teeth can be a powerful weapon against your kidnapper, as your jaw is a strong point in your body. Sink your teeth deep into available flesh while punching or kicking as hard as you can. However, avoid lingering into areas for long periods of time. Strike hard and quickly before retreating for another rapid attack. Your goal is to confuse the kidnapper and make unpredictable moves so that he is overwhelmed by your pain and speed.

, Aim for the area around the nose, as it is a quick way to render him unconscious. Prepare yourself by clenching your teeth, keeping your mouth closed, and tilting your head down in order to prevent damage to yourself. Then, grasp his shirt before pushing him away from you, causing him to become off balance. In the same move, yank him forward into the crown of your head. However, beware when using this move, as you could also knock yourself out or cause severe damage to your head.

, The digging of your fingernails into his flesh will cause severe pain and perhaps surprise him into releasing you or loosening his grip. As soon as you feel him succumbing to the pain, break free and run as fast as you can.

, Your main objective is to break free of the kidnapper. Although you may be tempted to knock him out in order to prevent him following you, avoid lingering once he has released you. He may have accomplices waiting to support him, so you must escape as soon as you see an opportunity. Run into a public area while screaming for help, and contact the police as soon as possible.

If you're in the hall and some dude is threatening you or trying to get in a fight, AVOID it!,
First, keep a neutral face while he's threatening.,
Say something creepy like, ""Hurt me, and I'll skin you alive with a cheese grater."",
Now, there's a possibility you'll be walking around town at night and some hobo or whatever grabs you.",How to Freak out Your Enemy," And don't rationalize. For example, don't say ""Why don't we just talk this out?"", or ""You don't really wanna fight, right?"". Chances are, they'd expect you to say something like that. The key is to freak out or scare your opponent off with words and creepy facial expressions. Oh, and don't forget, STAY CALM! In this technique, you have to flip things around and gain the upper hand, BE the bad guy! Okay, so here's the way you do it:;
, When he finally shuts up, stare him in the eye, and give the freakiest smirk or smile you can get. You might wanna practice this in the mirror first, then try it out sometime on a friend or family member. If they look disturbed, then you know it's working. If they look amused, then you know you need to work on it. Anyway, make sure they look a little shocked or surprised, then continue.

, He may look more shocked, but then retaliate with another threat, or even make fun of you and your threat. Remember, don't smile when he's talking, just look bored. Grin when he stops rambling, cause he's waiting to hear what you say next. Say some along the lines of, ""Just leave me alone, or I'll rip out your throat."" Then walk away. Chances are, if you're in school, he won't have the frozen balls to come after you, but if you're in town or something, he may go after you, mainly to show off, or save his pride. Then, you have an excuse for self defense. If he grabs you or something, quickly reach up and grab onto his Adam's apple, then say something like ""I keep my word."" If you must, go ahead and rip it out. Preferably, just wait till he gives in.

, Do the same thing. It may be more dangerous, especially if he has a weapon, but just keep confidence, and reason/threaten the dude.

Keep your eyes on your opponent(s).,
Keep a strong base.,
Tuck in your chin.,
Keep your hands up.,
Make a solid fist.",How to Fight if You're Not Strong1," This prevents a surprise attack, and if you can maintain eye contact, you come across as confident and intimidating. Keep in mind where your exits are, and if there’s an opening, take it.;
, Keep your knees slightly bent (and ready to spring), feet shoulder width apart and staggered—weak foot forward. Be on the balls of your feet, and keep them moving—nothing showy, but make your opponent work to hit you. Remember, your punches come from this base (more specifically, your back, strong foot).

, A well-placed uppercut will knock you out in a hurry—and possibly break your jaw. Minimizing this crucial target will minimize the chances of you not walking away.

, Guard your face—weak hand closest, guarding your chin, and strong hand farther out, guarding your face. Elbows should be at a slight angle, protecting your ribs. A good guard will also help defend from a headlock., Making a good fist is crucial. If you have something to hold on to (pen, key fob, or even calluses at the bottom of your fingers), do it—it will support your fist when you strike. Keep your thumb on the outside, and keep your wrist in line with your forearm, otherwise it very well may break.

Taking a punch.,
Throwing a punch.,
Kicks.,
Knees.,
Elbows.,
Grappling.",How to Fight if You're Not Strong2," If you’re in a fight, you’ll need to know how to take a punch. Strangely, moving toward the punch is your best bet—not only does it throw off your aggressor’s aim, but it decreases their momentum as well. If you get hit at full extension of the arm, it will do much more damage than if you catch the punch before the full extension is reached., Throwing a punch starts at your base; your energy comes from your strong, back foot, which should transfer power through your shoulder. Don’t punch from your elbow, unless you want to throw a quick jab. Hooks should only be used when you’re in close, otherwise they are slower, easier to block, and harder to throw., Kicks should be executed with caution. Balance is key in a fight, and losing your base from a kick is probable and very dangerous. That being said, if you do find opportunity for a kick, a sweeping kick to the knees, shins, calves, ankles, or quads could damage your opponent’s base. Don’t kick with your toes; instead, kick with the top of your foot or kick straight on with the bottom of your foot (like a stomp)., Knees can also be used to great effect if your fight gets close. A knee to the core of your opponent can be very painful and temporarily debilitating, and a knee to their quad will help weaken your opponent’s base., Elbows should be used with caution, and should never be the primary means of an attack. They should be used when in close, and not in a flying, pile-driver sort of way. That can hurt everyone involved very badly.

, This is when things turn into much more of a wrestling match. Although terrifying (especially when facing someone stronger than you), it’s crucial that you don’t panic. Your primary goal (as always) should be the exit.


If someone attempts to take you down from behind, try stomping on their instep, reverse headbutting, and, if you can get a hold of them, twisting (and maybe breaking) their fingers.
If they tackle you, try to land on your side so that you can easily break away when you hit the ground (when grip is at its weakest).
They may also shove you, but a good stance should prevent falling. If you do fall, roll to the side and get up as soon as possible. Getting up while they are coming straight on makes you a much easier target.

"
"
Find your superior trait.,
Confidence.",How to Fight if You're Not Strong3," Even though you may not be as physically strong as your aggressor, you probably have some kind of upper hand—whether that’s agility, compact size, or smarts, it depends on your situation. In any case, place yourself in a position where you have at least some kind of advantage.


Example: If you’re smaller, get some place where you’re difficult to reach (behind the bar, on top of the monkey bars, under or on the other side of the pool table). Distance will allow you to wear out your opponent and will keep you out of the way of any blows.
Example: If you can continue to talk your aggressor out of a situation, you should to do so. Use shame and try to get the crowd (if there is one) on your side—if your attacker knows that the crowd disapproves of their actions, the likelihood of an attack will decrease greatly.

, Whatever you do, be confident, and go a little crazy. If you don’t think you’re going to win the fight, who will? Also, feel free to make some noise. At the very least, it will throw off or annoy your opponent, and it will also draw attention to the situation—hopefully bringing in an authority figure."
"
Friends and Foes.,
Weapons.,
Physical surroundings.",How to Fight if You're Not Strong4," Potential allies to look for include bouncers, bar tenders, teachers, or any authority figure who happens to be around. If your aggressor arrived or was interacting with other people in the crowd, keep an eye on their actions as well.

, If you’re outside, look for sticks and rocks, and if you’re inside, look for a chair or stool to break (and use as a club/shield), or even silverware or glassware to use. If you can use them, your belt and keys may also prove valuable as weapons or deterrents., Mind your physical surroundings as well—you can use them defensively (to hide behind, or climb on) or offensively (to turn into weapons). If you’re ever faced with more than one aggressor, try to get to a place where you’re harder to get at, and where only one person is able to attack you at once.

Put in the time.,
Practice some dynamic stretches.,
Get your head in the game.,
Come prepared to practice.",How to Fight Fast1," Practice makes perfect with everything, including fighting. If you’re not willing to put in the time to practice, you’ll never get faster. The point of practicing is to do the movement so many times over that you can do it without thought and it becomes automatic.Become an autopilot fighter by having drills to really ground the movement into your mind., Dynamic stretches are different from static stretches. Static stretches are meant to pull and hold your muscle in place. Dynamic stretches move your muscles and warm them up by getting them working.When you think dynamic stretches, think about jump rope, squats, lunges and jumping jacks.For your arms, try hugging motions and arm rotation. If it feels like you are getting your body up and moving, it is likely a dynamic stretch.


Compare your muscles to rubberbands. When it’s cold or your movement is constricted, they are tightly wound. By warming them up, you’re allowing your body to prepare itself for some big time movement.Once you feel like your muscles are loosened, your warm up is done., Visualize the ideal outcome to the fight.Envision how you want to win and imagine each movement in each moment. Are you going to give a knock-out punch? Are you going to throw out 30 punches in a minute? Hype yourself up and get your adrenaline pumping.It’s important to build up your confidence. If you’re scared to get into a fight, analyze your fear. Yes, you may get injured. Yes, you may get punched in the nose. Remind yourself, you are going to win and it’s going to be the highlight of your week. While building yourself up, understand that you are good at other physical activity too., You wouldn’t show up to a job interview wearing slippers and pajamas so don’t practice fighting when you’re not prepared. Putting on your gym shorts and tightly lacing your running shoes will help you get in the mood. It also ensures proper movement when practicing.Make sure you don’t have a heavy meal or an empty stomach before practice, either. Have a healthy light snack beforehand to ensure you can be held over till you post-workout snack, without being lethargic from your cheeseburger and fries. Don’t forget to stay hydrated, either.

Practice your jab stance.,
Punch with your entire body.,
Take a break.",How to Fight Fast2," You should be slightly hunched with knees bent, with your elbows inwards toward the body and your fists close to your face.Keep your chin tucked to protect your jaw and stay nimble on your feet. Depending on your dominant hand, keep that side of your body tilted in behind of the rest.


For example, if you throw a right-handed punch, the left side of your body should be slightly ahead of the left.Keep your dominant side slightly veered to behind you.
Remember when throwing punches to have proper hand form as well. Close your fingers and keep your thumb outside of your fist. Tucking your thumb in can lead to broken digits., If you only punch with your arm muscles, it will be weak and empty.Instead, use the force and weight in your body to spiral your punch forward. When you throw your jab, twist your body and step forward towards your opponent. This uses the strength in your strongest muscles in your legs to propel your punch forward.After throwing a jab, quickly jump and snap back into your stance to protect yourself from a counter-attack.Extend your arm to its fullest when throwing your jab. This creates a strong, stabbing motion., Don’t practice punching by throwing punch after punch. Instead, allow your muscles to breathe and relax after a punch.After the tiredness fades, practice again. Letting your muscles take a break will allow every punch to be your best punch. Practicing this way will teach your body only to have the best, complete punches, rather than ineffective and weak throws.Don’t worry about speed at first. It is more important to throw a proper punch. Think of it this way: If you can’t throw a proper punch, it doesn’t matter how fast the poor punch is.

Do 10 quick sets of 10-15 repetitions of extended push-ups.,
Shadowbox at 100% speed wearing gloves.,
Use a speed bag and double-end speed bag.",How to Fight Fast3," Extended push-ups only go 1/3 of the way a full push up does. This works out your triceps and builds the muscle memory to create a quick punch. Maximize the speed and explosion of your punches by utilizing this exercise., Shadowbox in front of a mirror to focus on technique and speed. Don't use weights and focus on technique. Time yourself to see how long you can go at full speed. As you build your endurance and your strength and coordination begin to improve, you'll be able to throw more punches at a shorter amount of time., This boxing equipment is true to its name. While it not only increases the speed of your punches, it will also help you focus on your accuracy, timing, and coordination. When you punch a speed bag it immediately bounces back at you, forcing you to punch again. This repetition strengthens your shoulders and arms while creating a fast response time."
"
Perfect your form.,
Point your knee at the target.,
Follow through with a full kick.",How to Fight Fast4," Like with punches, without the proper form you can’t throw a strong kick. Get in the stance for a Muay Thai kick by putting your left foot in front of the other, and your hands up close to your face similar to the jab stance.This will open your hip and allow you to have a powerful swing. When you’re ready to practice moving, you will lean on your toes of the forward foot and swing your back leg partially forward. Practicing the movement will help make you comfortable with it.


When you lean onto your toes, your lead hand will come up to protect your face. Meanwhile, your dominant hand will begin to swing backwards behind your body., When you move towards your toes and lift your leg towards your opponent, you need to point your dominant knee directly at the target.Think of it like lifting to give off the impression of a false kick.


The importance of putting your weight on your toes, not your heels, comes into effect here. By keeping your weight on your toes, you allow the rest of your body to follow through into full turn.

, After you’ve given the knee lift, come back down to the ground. Without losing your momentum, lean forward onto your toes, twist your body and kick your leg towards your opponent. Remember that you want your shin to have the contact, not your foot.You should apply enough force that your body does a complete 180 spin.


Be fast about your kick. A slow kick will leave you open and vulnerable to your enemy. Keep it quick to keep your muscles engaged, your kick powerful, and your opponent at bay.At the end of your 180 spin, lift your lead knee up against your side with your lead hand. This will protect your body from any jabs or returned kicks from your opponent.
When done correctly, the Muay Thai kick can be the most devastating fighting move. Keep practicing to develop a sure-way to end the fight."

Act tough.,
Trash talk.,
Pushing.,
Wait for them to punch you.,
Jab at the head or gut.,
Save yourself.,
Switch it up.,
Hold your ground.",How to Fight Like a Man," Even if you feel pretty crappy, you need to look like you don't. Even if you're scared, you need to look like you're not. If you look intimidated, your opponent will walk all over you without even thinking twice. You might not even need a fight if you act tough enough, you could scare your opponent into laying off. If you think about it logically, your opponent might just be acting tough and scaring you, why can't you do the same?;
, A good fight doesn't start with just a punch in the face, it starts with trash talking. If there's an audience (a bunch of people watching), you can get them on your side with some trash talking. This will motivate you to win and probably make your target feel pretty bad about themselves. Think of some good comebacks before the fight but make sure it doesn't seem too scripted when you use them. Let everything flow.

, After the trash talking, it's the pushing. A good, strong push will make your opponent look weak and possibly push them to the floor, knocking a bunch of wind out of them. However, an even stronger push can knock you to the floor so be warned. At first, you don't really want to push your opponent down, just rough them up and tire them out. Be careful! Everything you throw can, and probably will, be returned to you. Try not to move or fall if you do get a shove.

, If you throw the first punch, you can be held responsible for everything. You don't want that, do you? However, if they throw the first punch, you can claim that you were defending yourself and not trying to start a fight. You opponent will probably be waiting for you to punch them so this can take some time but don't give in. You could end up paying a hefty fine or worse, prison.

, These places hurt the most and a good punch to the head or gut can wind your opponent or possibly knock them out. Even if you can't do either of the two, it will still hurt them a bunch. A weak punch can make you look a bit weak so get straight in there with the hardest punch you've got. They'll probably be protecting their head so go for the gut if you can.

, If you're getting battered, don't run. Just protect wherever you're getting hit by blocking their shots. Every time you get hit, you will definitely get more tired so you won't be able to fight for much longer. Try using this to your advantage, batter your opponent so they can't batter you. Also, if you keep blocking their shots, they'll get tired and you won't.

, If you use the same kick-punch pattern, your opponent will figure it out and use it against you. To avoid this, switch up the way you fight and where you throw your punches and kicks. Even though you know their weak spots, if you keep punching them in the gut they'll just protect their gut. However, if you switch it up, they'll find it hard to block every part of their body and attack you at the same time, right?

, The fight is only going to end if a really brave person breaks it up or if someone's on the ground. Don't try to run, no matter how long it goes on for. Running will make you seem really weak and probably get you beaten up even more. Also, make sure it looks like you're not tired and you can go for much longer. If the fight finally gets broken up, just walk off. If you lose, at least you can say you fought until the end.

We know that you don't want to seem lame to the other girls, but if the other girls only like you for being tough then they don't really like you at all. They aren't your true friends and they never could be.


Fighting can have lots of bad consequences for you. If you really, seriously hurt the other girl, even if she started the fight, you could go to jail or get in trouble with the police. This can happen even by accident, so it's better to steer away if you can.;
, Plan to have the fight outside the school grounds. Fighting on school grounds could further increase your chances of getting suspended or even expelled. However its important to note that even if you choose to fight away from the school, you are still very likely to get into trouble with your school for fighting as it is an unacceptable way to behave and solve a problem.

, Chances are if the girl is a good fighter, her friends will jump in so you need some to do the same. This can keep you from getting seriously hurt. With a few friends in tow, the fight will probably stay smaller, since no one will let it get really out of control. Just make sure to tell your friends that you want to keep the fighting to a minimum. They're there to protect you only!

, You want to avoid fighting if at all possible. Argue with her or try to talk her down: whatever you do just don't be the first one to start fighting. If you hold your ground and don't say anything too angering, you might not have to fight at all.


Try using dialogue (talking) to shut the fight down. Say something like, ""I'm tired of all this arguing. It's not going to change anything. Can't we just stay out of each others way?"" or ""Is this really going to fix this problem? I want us both to walk away happy.""

, While she's talking, stay calm and assess how you think she's vulnerable. If she's shorter - bear down on her. If she's taller go for her legs and her midsection. If she has long hair grab a handful and pull her head down so she can't see.

, You should angle your head if you see she's about to punch you so that your forehead or top of your head gets hit instead. This will hurt her hands and could help in discouraging further punching. Furthermore, it will do less damage to your body. Your skull is very strong!

, If she's trying to punch your stomach, move your body so that she hits your side instead. This will protect your body and keep you form getting too badly injured.

, Absolutely avoid getting on the ground but if you fall to the ground, kick at your attacker to keep them away from you. Look for an opportunity to get up but don't turn away from the other girl. Roll into a ball to protect yourself if this doesn't work out.

, Most people hold their fist wrong and you can end up hurting yourself. Instead, hold your fist in one hand and hit with your elbow.

, Try to hit in sensitive areas if you're going to hit. The chest, stomach, face, knees, feet and hands are all easy to hurt.

, Dodge as many hits as you can. Let her move and keep her moving. This will make her tired and help end the fight sooner.

, You want to get her onto the ground to try to bring the fight to an end. The best way to do this is to use her own body against her. Grab her pinky, and pull it back towards her elbow. Her arm will follow. Guide the arm so that it goes behind her back and then push her down to the ground. Place your knee at the center of her back and hold her arm in place until she calms down.

, The best thing to do in a fight, is trick the opponent. Throw your arms out, as if to punch her, and when she grabs your hands, kick her where it hurts, In a fight, if you get punched or kicked, but it didn't really hurt, act. Fall to the ground screaming and crying, shell laugh and laugh, when she least expects it, get up and do what you need to do, this is a fight, after all!"

If you've ever been punched in the nose, you know how much it hurts - it makes you bleed and your eyes tear up.",How to Fight Dirty and Win," Do everything you can to avoid them. ;
, If you can't go thirty seconds without stopping for breath start working out and getting some endurance training. You need to be able to last a good 3 minutes of solid fighting/grappling/wrestling.

, No one fights to get the other person to submit. You fight to hurt people. Do you want to get hurt or go home safely?

, Unless you're a cage fighter and you can fight on the ground, avoid it. We will touch on this later

, Keep your elbows in and your fists near eye level away from your face to block side attacks.

,,,, Get close to your target. Don’t stand arm's width apart from target. That’s where the punch will hurt the most. Get close. Try this, for example: walk up to a wall, put your fist about 2 inches (5.1 cm) away and punch the wall. Not bad, didn’t kill you right? Now, step back and punch the wall as hard as you can with a full extension of your arm. You didn’t do it, did you? It would have hurt like hell.

, They come off with a little bit of force. The psychological effect of having an ear ripped off will stop most fights.

, If they can't see. . . well, you get the point.

, If you can't breathe, you can't fight.

, They may be harder to control and have shorter reach, but they are strong, hard for an opponent to grab, and they pack a lot of force.

, Don't pull on the hair because one, you aren't protecting your body, hence, them being able to punch you out, and two, they could push you down to the ground because with your arms up in the air and all the moving you aren't stable.

, If you can break an extremity at the joint, you can plan on a fight being over right then and there.

, A solid foot stomp on the top of your opponent’s foot will result in the immediate breaking of bones and you will almost certainly cause their foot to swell to the point of no return.

, If you can, grab a hand, take a hold of it, the flip it in a big circle and twist it 180 degrees. Once in that position, you can manipulate the arm and break it easily.

, Your collar bone has very little strength. About 7 pounds of pressure will snap a collar bone and the entire arm will drop like a load of potatoes.

, It's a common misconception that groin attacks are only effective on men. On both men and women, this will cause severe pain. If it doesn't take your opponent down, it surely will reduce their fighting efficiency. However, beware of your opponent groin attacking you back.

, A little tougher to break, but when they do, this really ends a fight.

, Try to grab a hold of an arm, when you have it, use your forearm or palm to throw a sort of inverted punch. Try to land your blow onto the weaker underside of the arm, where your veins and arteries are. If you use your palm, keep your fingers pointed up.

, A lot of people like to bite when they fight. Bad call. You can catch any number of diseases. If you should happen to get bit on your fingers, you can literally rip the bottom jaw off of an attacker with your own strength. Imagine your fingers are being bitten from the side, covering your smallest fingers. Manipulate your whole hand into the attacker's mouth and push your fingers down into the bedding of the tongue. That alone will warrant an attacker to let go. Don’t let them. Dig your fingers under their teeth in the small pocket your tongue hides in. Pull down and to the side. You will notice they forgot about fighting and are desperately trying to get your hand out of their mouth. Often times, they will focus both hands on pulling your one hand out. Use your free hand to grab a fist full of testicle or an ear. If you can give sharp jerks in a downward and outside motion, thrust away from their face. The bottom jaw might be able to handle three of those before it unhinges.

, Not the best place to attack, but it's a preference from behind. If you can get a hold of the attacker’s neck, grab on for dear life and don’t stop squeezing until they pass out. This can kill them if you punch them.

, A mild blow to the base of the back near the beltline will temporarily disable an attacker. A severe blow to the same spot will permanently incapacitate them from that point down on their body.

, If you can grab the nose, do it. Snap it to the side. Punch it straight into the brain. Don’t worry, you won't kill anyone. That’s an Old Wives' tale. Also, a sharp thrust of the palm in a downward motion will have the same effect.

, Act quick, you won't fight them off for long with only one hand.

, The beverage you use will have different effects on the eyes (i.e. if you spit hard liquor into the eyes, you will have more time than if you used ordinary water). If you use chewing tobacco, the same effect can be achieved by spitting tobacco juice into your opponent's eyes.

Remember that every part of your body and everything on your person has the potential to be used as a weapon.,
Open your hands and keep them in front of you in a pleading position when confronted by a potential attacker.,
Scream.,
Block or dodge an oncoming attack.,
Strike with the heel of your hand, or with the meaty little-finger side of your fist.,
Aim for sensitive areas such as face, stomach, groin, knee, shin and instep.,
If you are in close proximity to your attacker, jabbing with your elbows and fingers can be an effective method of defense.,
If necessary, use any hard item available to poke, jab or scratch your assailant's face: a stick, a brick, a pen, a piece of glass, etc.,
NEVER kick your attacker in the groin, this gives them a chance to grab hold of your leg.,
Using the heel of your palm, hit the attacker's nose upwards.,
Squirm.,
Once you have taken your attacker down and they are no longer a threat, stop attacking.,
Call police once your attacker is no longer a threat.

",How to Fend off an Attacker," This includes items you may carry in your pockets such as pens, keys, or small pistols.;
, Clenched fists give away your readiness to strike. Open hands present a non-threatening appearance that will cause an attacker to let his guard down, while still leaving you the options to suddenly strike or grab.

, Screaming may draw attention and scare the attacker away.

, What use is any other defense tactic if you get knocked out?

, To form the hand for a palm-heel strike, bend the wrist back at a 90 degree angle and spread and claw the fingers. For an edge of hand blow, straighten the fingers and press them together, and strike with the muscle in the side of the hand. When striking down into an assailant's face, clench the fist and strike with the little finger side. Closed fist punches rely on wrist strength and stability to deliver a proper strike, and the knuckles are easily broken in the confusion of a fight.

, These areas are easy to hit and will probably knock the enemy down for your chance to escape. Remember that a heavy strike to a person's face is highly effective at making them lose their senses. A broken nose or strike to the eyes will greatly hinder your opponent's ability to observe and react. Do not strike a person in the mouth--this will damage your hand.

, So can headbutting.

, The eyes and throat are especially vulnerable areas.

, Instead, use your knee repeatedly.

, Not only could this cause their nose to bleed, but it will cause their eyes to water, giving you a chance of escape.

, If an attacker gets a hold of you and doesn't have a firearm pointed to your head or a knife to your neck, squirm. Squirming and pinching the attacker can help you get out of his or her clutches. If the attacker has a weapon, keep it away from you.

, Kicking the jaw off of an unconscious person isn't self defense, it's a lack of self control.

Grab onto the wrist holding your hair with both hands.,
Hold the wrist close to your head to limit an attacker's control on you.,
Slide one hand up and grip their pinky.,
Quickly pull the pinky back towards the assailants wrist.",How to Escape if Someone Grabs Your Hair1," This is essential step one, as it prevents someone from taking complete control of your body. If someone has a big handful of your hair you pretty much have to go where they pull you, as they have a lot of leverage.









You want to allow them to move your head, slightly, but not your hair.;
, Both hands should grab either side of their wrist with the thumbs below the and fingers meeting, but not interlocked, above. Take some of the advantages away by gripping their wrists and holding it close to your head, limiting their control of you.









Step forward, towards the pull, to use the attacker's energy against them.

, This is the weakest finger and the easiest way to get in and pry the grip off. Luckily, you don't even have to be that strong, as a broken little finger will more than likely cause them to let go.









Do not try to peel all of their fingers off at once. The pinky is small and weak -- no match for the strength of your whole arm.

, Use your body weight and other hand to help to get more strength. You want to push their wrist away with the one hand, peel back the pinkie with the other, and simultaneously step away to remove their hand from your hair.







"
"
Grip the wrist holding your hair with one hand.,
Reach up with the other hand and to slide your fingers around the attacker's pinkie, using your hair to get under their hand.,
Peel the pinkie back to the back of the assailant's hand.,
Slide away from the attacker's free arm as you bend the fingers back.,
Step back immediately to create space and escape.",How to Escape if Someone Grabs Your Hair2," Again, this prevents someone from controlling your body and movement completely. Set your feet so that you're on balance, and use this hand to resist their movement. Even if they are stronger than you and ultimately could pull you around, this is just the first move meant to force them off balance.








, Grab their little finger with as many of your fingers as you can. The more leverage you can get on this finger, the better.








, The quicker you can do this motion, the better. The pain and shock will open up his/her hand, allowing you to get free.









If he/she doesn't let go, keep bending until the finger breaks.
Keep your elbow up in front of your face to protect yourself from his free arm, which can still hit you.

, If you're using both hands to cut off his hair hold, then he still has one arm left to attack with. To avoid this, roll into the pinkie bend. By also following his movement (the way he is pulling your hair) you prevent damage and force him to swing or turn his body before he can strike you with his far off arm. Even if he can get small blows in, he won't have the power to do much in the few seconds before you break his pinkie.









Rolling your body along the attacker's arm also puts him in front of you, allowing you to get away once you get his hand free.

, You want to move forward into the counter-attack, and then immediately move off once the hands are out of your hair. Use the few seconds of time to get away immediately.







"
"
Always grab their wrists or the hand on your hair to limit control.,
Strike right above their elbow joint with a fist or karate chop as you pull them close.,
Simultaneously, strike with the knee into the groin area.,
Immediately step back to create space.",How to Escape if Someone Grabs Your Hair3," Grabbing a hold of them is always the first response to someone grabbing your hair. Get control of their wrist and hold it close to your head to prevent damage and loss of bodily control.

, Your one hand grabs theirs, pulling closer to prevent them from yanking you around. As you do, strike out with the other hand right at their elbow. Aim just a little higher up, where the joint meets the bicep, for the best response.


Hit with you knuckles for the hardest, most successful strike.
Press against the inside of your bicep, moving up until your find a sensitive spot that causes your arm to curl slightly when pressed. This is your target.

, As you pull close, you'll be taking a step with your outside foot. Over-exaggerate this step into a knee at your attacker, letting your knee hit soon after you punch their arm.

, Once they let go and the knee connects, step back and use this time to escape."

Sanitize your hands and the area to be pierced.,
Disinfect the piercing needle.,

Mark your skin where you want your piercing.,
Line the needle up with the dot.,
Take a deep breath and push the needle.,
Remove the needle and quickly replace with your jewelry.,
Clean your ear piercing with a saline solution.,

Keep your original jewelry in while you heal.,
Know that your piercing may bleed.,
Understand you might get unwanted scar tissue.,
Be aware that serious infections can occur.",How to Do a Self Piercing at Home," Scrub your hands well with an antibacterial soap, and dry them with a clean towel. After your hands are clean, you must clean the area you are piercing. Pour some rubbing alcohol onto a tissue, and clean the skin thoroughly. Alcohol wipes also work for this.After you’ve cleaned the area, don’t touch it again to avoid contamination.


The easiest piercing to do at home is your earlobes, and nose and belly button piercings can also be done at home with minimal risk. When it comes to doing a piercing near your mouth (such as tongue or lip), near your eye, or at the top of your ear, it is best to see a professional. You can end up with permanent scarring, damage to the body part, and even deformities. Do not risk it.;
, Ideally, you should use a piercing needle that has never been used. Take it out of the packaging only when you are ready to use it.If you have a piercing needle that’s been opened or used, you will need to sanitize it well. Soak it in rubbing alcohol before you use it to pierce. The more you disinfect the area and the needle, the lower the chance of infection.


You must use a piercing needle for this, not a sewing needle or any other type. Piercing needles are the proper size and sharpness for the task, and anything else can cause unnecessary pain or damage to your skin.
You can purchase piercing needles on Amazon.

, It is important that you use a high quality piece of jewelry to reduce the risk of infection, irritation, or allergic reaction. Professional piercers suggest choosing a piece that is made of surgical steel, 14-karat or 18-karat yellow gold, 18-karat white gold, niobium, or titanium.Don’t buy a cheap piece of jewelry in an effort to cut costs. Invest in a good piece of jewelry for your immediate wear after piercing, and you may be able to tolerate lower-quality jewelry once you are all healed.


Clean your jewelry with rubbing alcohol.

, Use a pen to draw a little dot where you want your piercing to go, and make sure you know exactly where it will look best. If you’re piercing your ears, make sure that they’re symmetrical. Look at the mark from all angles and make sure that it’s in the exact place you want it. You’ll use this mark as a guide for your piercing needle.If you’re not quite sure if you want the piercing or the position of the piercing, use a permanent marker and just keep a mark there for a few days. See how you react when you see it in the mirror. This will help you determine if you like the look of a potential piercing before taking the leap.
If you’re piercing your belly button, pinch your skin above it. Draw your dot on the topside of this skin fold. When you’re actually piercing it, it’s best to do it from the bottom. In other words, poke the needle up through this fold of skin, and line it up so it goes through the dot you’ve drawn.It’s obviously tricky to draw a dot on your tongue. Take this as a sign that you really shouldn’t pierce your own tongue. It can be tempting to try to save money and time, but it is not worth it when it comes to the organ you need for speaking and tasting.

, Make sure you have a steady grip on the needle. It should be at the same angle that you want your jewelry to go. In other words, the needle should go through your ear like an earring would, or through your belly button like a belly ring would. Piercing your skin at an odd angle will make it difficult to get jewelry inserted, so take your time lining the needle up.


If you want, you can apply a bit of numbing gel onto your ear before you pierce. Make sure you give it time to start working., It should be one fast, fluid motion. If you push a little, stop, push a little again, and so on, you’re more likely to rip the skin. One, smooth puncture will make a smooth hole and also make the healing process easier.Push the needle until it is halfway through your ear. Leave it in for about 20 minutes to ensure that the hole remains there long enough to get an earring in when the needle is removed.

, After the needle has been in the hole for about 20 minutes, it’s time to put something much better looking in. The hole will heal up quickly, so it’s important to have the jewelry ready to go before you remove the needle. Pop your clean jewelry into the new hole you created. It’s OK to use a little bit of pressure to get the jewelry through your skin, but don’t force it.

, While it was appropriate to clean your piercing equipment and skin with rubbing alcohol prior to piercing, it can dry out your new piercing now. A saline solution is gentler and won’t dry the hole out. You can purchase a saline solution at the drug store, or make your own. Try to physically let your pierced body part soak in the solution, like in a shallow bowl or cup.If you’re unable, use a tissue or Q-tip to apply the solution to the piercing.


If you choose to make your own solution, use non-iodized, fine-grain sea salt. Some grocery stores stock this with the regular table salt, or you may need to buy it online.
Mix 1/4 teaspoon of salt into one cup of filtered or bottled water. Reduce the amount of salt if your skin becomes dry.

, It can be tempting to fiddle with your new jewelry, but this greatly increases your chance of infection. Try not to touch it at all unless you’re doing one of your daily cleanings. Never touch your piercing at all unless your hands have been thoroughly washed.

, Even if you have an entire collection of awesome, high-quality body jewelry, changing your jewelry while the hole is still healing will increase your chances of getting an infection. Depending on the area that you’ve pierced, this can take anywhere from one month to a year.You can learn more about your specific piercing area by doing a Google search.

, The tongue contains blood vessels and a large vein near the front that will bleed excessively if punctured. Do not pierce your tongue yourself. While the tongue may bleed the most, other areas will still certainly bleed.Again, it is best to go to a professional who can ensure that the blood loss is minimal.

, If you pierce yourself, you are at a higher risk for infection and unsightly scarring.Even if you remove the piercing later, the scar can last forever. Consider this before you go at your nose, ear, eyebrow, lip, tongue, or belly button with a needle. While seeing a professional piercer will cost time and money, it will have your risk of getting a permanent scar.

, There are severe complications that can arise from a piercing. Piercings can cause an array of nasty infections. Infections that aren’t treated can lead to sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, and blood poisoning.It is incredibly important to understand potential consequences before you pierce yourself.


Whether you pierced yourself or got it done professionally, it’s important to know what issues to look for. If your piercing is producing discharge, you should see a medical professional. If your piercing is red, painful, and swollen for longer than 3 days, you should also see a medical professional. If something seems wrong with your piercing, don’t wait long to get it checked out..

Look online for tattoo ideas and themes.,
Look through tattoo magazines.,
Shuffle through the pages of art books.,
Brainstorm what is meaningful to you.,
Jot your ideas down in a journal.,
Sketch the design.,
Opt for timelessness.,
Order a temporary custom tattoo.,
Narrow down potential artists.,
Schedule a design consultation.,
Explain your vision.,
Decide where on the body you want the tattoo.,
Consider the pain factor.,
Decide what type of coloring you want.",How to Design Your Own Tattoo," Do a quick Google search of tattoos in a similar vein to the tattoo that you might like to get. For example, if you think you want to get a travel-themed or geometric tattoo, search specifically for images of these types of tattoos. Seeing images of tattoos other people have can serve as inspiration, even if you decide to go a different route with your own design.;
, These are a fantastic way to learn about innovations in the tattoo world as well as to get inspiration for your own tattoo. You can find popular tattoo magazines like INKED, TATTOO, and Skin Deep online or at your local bookstore or newsstand., Spend a couple of hours doing this at a local bookstore or library. Art books, specifically books that focus on tattoo art, are a great way to get exposure to different types of designs as well as to learn about the history of many artistic developments, which can in turn add meaning and depth to your own art.If allowed, take a picture of the images that grab your attention or make a photocopy of the pages they’re on so that you can refer to the images at home.

, While you may just want to get a tattoo because you like the design, creating a tattoo that has personal significance to you can be an extremely rewarding experience. Consider tattooing significant dates, like birthdates or wedding dates, your zodiac sign, a portrait of somebody important to you, or a favorite quotation.

, Now is the time to get creative! Cut up magazines to make a collage that represents the color scheme or mood you would like to recreate with your tattoo. Make an inspiration board that evokes the feeling you want to convey with your design. You might also jot down words in a diary that come to mind when thinking of the design you want.

, If you can draw, sketching the tattoo is a fantastic way to give your tattoo artist a more accurate picture of just what exactly you want to get inked when you go into the parlor. Get out a piece of paper and draw the tattoo to scale. Don’t be afraid to go through multiple drafts - you are drawing something that will go on your body permanently, so take your time and work on the sketch until it’s just right.You can draft a rough sketch and bring it to the tattoo artist. The artist can, in turn, refine your vision and bring the design closer to what you had envisioned, as well as advise you on feasibility and cost.
If you don’t know how to draw, get a friend or hire a freelancer to draw your vision for you. You can even collaborate with a tattoo artist by explaining to them the design you want and having them advise you on location, coloring, and type of ink. You will have to explain very carefully what you envision and likely go through multiple drafts until the drawing is just right.

, Trends come and go, but a tattoo is forever. Determine whether the tattoo you have will age well by asking yourself questions such as: What is the likelihood that I’ll have the same interests and beliefs in 10, 20 years? Am I making this decision based on impulse, or have I given it time and careful thought?


Examples of timeless tattoos include tattoos of animals, flowers, skulls, maps, or nautical symbols.Another way to test timelessness is to tape up the design you have created to a wall and look at it every day for a few months. While that may seem like a long time, if you get tired of looking at the design you will be able to reconsider whether this is really something you want inked on your body permanently.

, If you would like to try out your idea before committing to the design, you can order a temporary custom tattoo online on a site like Etsy or Momentary Ink. Submit your design online and the seller will make you a temporary tattoo.You can also ask your tattoo artist if they can do a transfer of the design on your skin first. Ask for this during your initial design consultation.

, Visit the websites of local tattoo parlors and look at the portfolio of work of various artists in your area. Every tattoo artist will have their own individual style, and you want to make sure that your needs align with the expertise of the artist.Ensure the artists are licensed. Licensing and certifications vary by state, and you should only choose a tattoo artist who has a practitioner permit. Ask to see the license when you visit the tattoo parlor.Whittle down the artists by area of expertise. For example, if you know you want to get a portrait tattooed, include in your list only artists who have experience in portraiture.

, Most tattoo parlors offer free consultations by appointment, so use this as an opportunity to get to the know the artist and gauge whether you feel comfortable getting tattooed by them. Trust in the artist is of utmost importance when getting a tattoo, since you want the artist to focus their full attention on you and not get easily distracted.Ask the tattoo artist any questions you may have, from pain factor to how many sessions your tattoo will require. You want to choose an artist who is willing to patiently answer all of your questions.
After the visit, reflect on how comfortable you felt at the parlor as well as on the artist’s attitude. Think about whether the artist was enthusiastic and agreed with your vision for the tattoo, and also consider the cleanliness of the parlor.

, It’s important to go into a design consultation with a clear idea of the tattoo you would like to get or at least with a concept that you would like to bring to life. Otherwise, it can be easy to be persuaded by what an artist might want to design and end up with a tattoo that wasn’t really what you intended to get. During the consultation, show the artist your inspiration board, sketches, and your word diary.


Find somebody who understands your vision and is willing to bring it to life. The last thing you want is to be butting heads with an artist who doesn’t share the same vision as you.

, When choosing where to get inked, you will want to consider visibility, sensitivity, and discretion. This will set limitations, such as size, on your tattoo design. Think hard about whether you want the tattoo to be visible to everyone, in which case you can consider tattooing your arms or legs, or whether you want it to be more private, in which case you would want to consider tattooing your lower back, shoulders, or stomach., A larger or more intricate tattoo made with different sizes of needles will also likely hurt more, especially given that thicker needles tend to hurt more than thinner ones since they pierce more skin. Also keep in mind that different spots on the body have varying sensitivities. Bonier parts of the body and parts with little fat tend to be more painful. The wrists, for example, are highly sensitive, so it could hurt more to get inked there.Pain is subjective. Some claim that the initial outline of the tattoo is more painful, especially if this is your first experience getting inked, and others claim that the shading is more uncomfortable since the artist is going over the same areas over and over, packing color or ink. If you want to avoid shading, however, you should pick a simple, minimalistic tattoo design., Tattoo color can affect the design you create - color tattoos, for example, may be better suited for smaller designs so that you have fewer touch-ups to do. Black and gray tattoos age better than color tattoos over time, are typically less expensive, and take less time to complete. Color tattoos allow for more creativity, are great for covering existing tattoos, and contrast strongly with light to medium skin tones.Ask your tattoo artist for their recommendation on the type of coloring you should get.
You might also want to consider getting a tattoo made out of white ink, depending on the type of design that you want to create and on the visibility you want the tattoo to have. White ink tattoos will often be less visible than monochrome or color ones."

Find a can or metal container.,
Put cotton inside the can.,
Douse the cotton with baby oil.,
Build a ""soot collector"".",How to Create Prison Tattoo Ink1," It should be able to hold 4-6 ounces of baby oil, along with a bit of balled-up cotton. Try using a clean, empty boot polish can. If you don't have access to a pre-made container: use a sharp implement to shear a 12-ounce aluminum can in half, and use the bottom half as your container.


You may be able to buy a boot polish can from the prison commissary.If you can't find boot polish, look for another suitable can that you can buy. It's important that you don't arouse suspicion from the guards, so don't buy a can of something that you would never normally use.;

Make sure to leave at least a bit of the cotton dry and oil-free so that it will be easier to light. Use cotton balls, if you can, or tear a small strip of cotton from a shirt or pillowcase. If you don't have cotton, you can use paper or tissue paper in a pinch – anything flammable.


Try cutting the sleeves off your shirt. This way, you can use the cotton without arousing suspicion or completely ruining the shirt., You should be able to buy this oil from the prison commissary. Use enough baby oil to completely saturate the cotton, and make sure not to spill. You will burn this oil to create a black, sooty powder: the base ingredient of your tattoo ink.


In the absence of baby oil, you may be able to use Vaseline or another petroleum-based substance.Do not melt poly fiber plastics, as these chemicals will irritate your skin., Find a flat, clean piece of metal that will fit over the opening of the can without covering it completely. If you can't find anything else, try cutting a sheet from the top half of the aluminum can, then pressing it until it is flat. This piece will collect the sooty powder so that you can mix it into ink.

"
"
Make fire.,
Burn the baby oil and cotton.,
Save the black powder.",How to Create Prison Tattoo Ink2," Use a lighter or matches, if possible. If you are in prison, however, you may not have access to a traditional fire-starter. Find a way to make fire without a lighter. You will need fire both to make the ink and to disinfect the needle.


Try ""popping a socket"". Open up an electrical socket, then hold a pencil tip and a wire up to the charged interior. This will create a spark. Hold a piece of paper or tissue against the spark until it catches flame.Be very careful when handling flame. On one hand, you might badly burn yourself or start a fire that you can't control. You also run the risk of attracting the attention of the guards.

, Use the cotton (or paper) as a wick: light a dry corner of the flammable material, and let it ignite the oil. Arrange the metal sheet or ""soot collector"" so that the smoke hits it. As the baby oil burns, the metal sheet will blacken with soot. Let the baby oil burn until it is spent, and let the metal cool before handling it directly.


Be prepared to burn the baby oil several times. The burning process does not produce a lot of powder, so you may need to burn the oil several times until you have enough to harvest.

, Use a paper or plastic card to scrape the black powder from the metal sheet. Do not use a razor or another metal scraper to remove the soot – the metal might leave shards in the powder, which will then wind up in your skin. Start by scraping the powder onto a clean, smooth surface or a white piece of paper.


Do not expose the powder to any moisture until you're ready to mix your ink.
The metal sheet and canister will be hot from the flame. Do not handle the metal directly until you've given it time to cool. Avoid using a credit card to scrape soot from hot metal, as the edge of the card might melt into the powder.

"
"
Put the tattoo powder into a small cap or container.,
Add water.,
Finish mixing the ink.",How to Create Prison Tattoo Ink3," Many prison tattooists use a clean toothpaste cap. Fill the cap about halfway with the sooty powder, and leave enough room in the container to mix in water. If you collected the soot on a sheet of paper, you can fold the paper and let the soot slide directly into the cap.

, Mix the soot with a drop of clean water. Be very sparing with the liquid-to-soot ratio; a bit of water goes a long way. Start with a small dose, and mix the soot together with the water in the toothpaste cap. Consider adding a bit of clear, scentless baby oil to thicken the mixture.


Remember: the soot is much harder to come by than water or baby oil. It is a limited resource. Be very careful with your mixing so that you don't need to make more soot.

, Stir the soot-and-water mixture until it is about the consistency of a pen's ink. If anything, the ink should be slightly thicker. Adjust the portions of each ingredient until the texture is just right. To thin your ink, add a dash of water or baby oil. To thicken it up, add more soot.

Listen to your artist's care instructions.",How to Deal With Tattoo Pain," If you've never had a tattoo, the best way to mentally prepare yourself is to get rid of the mystery surrounding it. Ideally, you want to walk into your tattoo appointment without too much anxiety — the more relaxed you are, the easier your experience will be. Try talking to people who have many tattoos or the staff at your local tattoo parlor about their experiences getting tattoos. Most will be happy to talk.


Everyone's pain tolerance is different. While tattoos are uncomfortable for most people, they aren't anywhere near things like childbirth and kidney stones. Most people you talk to should confirm this.;
, A good amount of the pain from your tattoo is affected by the location on your body where you get it. If you're looking to minimize your pain, you may want to move it to one of the less-painful areas. While everyone's body is different, in general:Areas with lots of muscle (arms, legs, upper pectorals) and areas with lots of fatty padding (glutes, hips, etc.) tend to hurt the least.

Sensitive areas (breasts, underarms, face, groin) and ""hard"" areas close to bones (scalp, face, collarbone, ribs, hands, feet) tend to hurt the most.This article has a handy diagram that shows the pain levels for different parts of the body., All tattoos are not created equally. The pain level of your tattoo experience can also be affected by what, exactly, you're getting put onto your body. While some exceptions exist, in general:


The smaller and simpler a tattoo is, the less painful it will be. Large, detailed designs hurt much more.
One-color tattoos are less painful (and take less time) than multi-color tattoos.
Areas of solid color hurt the most because they require the artist to go over her work several times.

, You don't have to endure your tattoo experience alone. If you can, try taking a friend or family member whose company you enjoy. Having someone who cares for you makes the experience much easier — you'll have someone to talk to about your jitters beforehand and someone to give words of encouragement when you run into pain.


If you aren't too shy, try making a social event out of your tattoo appointment. Many tattoo parlors allow small groups to hang out in the lobby or even in the room where the tattoo is being done if they aren't unruly. Having a group of people to encourage you — even cheer for you — can make getting a tattoo a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

, A modern tattoo gun is essentially a small set of needles that go in and out of the skin very quickly, leaving a little ink each time.This basically has the effect of making lots of tiny cuts in the area where the tattoo is. Almost everyone who gets a tattoo bleeds a little bit from this. If any of this process makes you feel faint or nauseous, you should plan not to watch.


Don't be afraid to explain your situation to your tattoo artist. A good one will be more than happy to help you get through your tattoo with minimal discomfort.

, It's hard to relax right before the tattoo artist starts drawing, but if you can, your experience will be easier. Try taking a few deep breaths, talking to your friend or family member, or even chatting with the tattoo artist. These things will help you relax and quit focusing on what's about to happen.


If you're very worried going into your appointment, call ahead of time and ask whether you might be allowed to bring items that help you relax. For instance, you might try bringing an MP3 player to listen to your favorite relaxing tunes during your appointment. Many parlors will give you a good deal of freedom as long as your items don't interfere with the tattoo artist's job.

, Depending on the size and detail level of your tattoo, you may be in the parlor for up to a few hours. While you'll get breaks to get up and move around, a little bit of preparation can make your appointment much more comfortable. Below are a just a few things you may want to consider:


Have a meal before your appointment. Have a glass or two of water to avoid dehydration.
Wear loose, comfortable clothing you won't mind sitting in for a long time.
Bring anything you'll need to entertain yourself during your appointment (music player, reading material, etc.)
Go to the bathroom before your appointment starts.

, Tensing your muscles by squeezing something in your hand or biting down on something can actually reduce pain significantly. In fact, it's a technique that's use to reduce pain for women during labor — and it works quite well.Many tattoo parlors will have something for you to use, but if yours doesn't, consider bringing one of the following:


Stress ball
Grip exerciser
Protective mouthpiece
Gum
Soft candy
Towel, wooden spoon, etc.
Don't bite down if there's nothing soft in your mouth. Simply gritting your teeth can cause dental damage., Even something as simple as controlling your breathing can make getting a tattoo more bearable. Try to exhale when you feel the worst pain. You can do this either by breathing out or by making a gentle noise (like a low hum). Exhaling during stress or exertion makes it easier to ""power through"" the pain. This is why most fitness resources will recommend exhalation on the ""up"" phase of a weightlifting exercise.On the other hand, it's possible to make tattoo pain worse if you breathe incorrectly. Try to resist the urge to hold your breath during painful moments. This can make tattoo pain more distracting.

, It can be tempting to squirm during particularly painful stretches of your tattoo appointment. Try your best not to. The less you move, the more precise the artist can be and the quicker your appointment will go. After all, it's harder for an artist to draw on a canvas that won't sit still.


If you do have to move, warn your artist beforehand so that he has a chance to remove the tattoo gun from your skin. You do not want to accidentally cause him to make a mistake — tattoos are permanent.

, Almost every tattoo artist will tell you this before she starts, but it bears repeating: you should ask your artist to take a break if the pain ever becomes too much. Most don't mind, and would prefer not to make your experience an unnecessarily painful one. Don't hesitate to take a two minute break and then go back to your tattoo.


Don't be embarrassed to ask for a break. Most tattoo artists work on clients with a wide variety of pain tolerances and have ""seen it all"" when it comes to painful reactions. Remember, you are paying for this, so do what you need to do for you!

, If you're finding the pain really uncomfortable, you may want to try taking a small dose of an over-the-counter (OTC) painkiller. However, you won't want to take a pain medication that contains blood-thinning agents or causes blood thinning as a side effect. These aren't especially dangerous for tattoos in small doses, but they can make you bleed more.


One great OTC painkiller that doesn't contain blood thinners is acetaminophen (also called Tylenol or paracetamol). Other common OTC painkillers like Ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen sodium do act as blood thinners.

, While it can be tempting to show up to your tattoo appointment inebriated (especially if you're treating it as a social event), this is a very bad idea. Most reputable tattoo parlors won't agree to do work on someone who is obviously drunk. This is for good reason — drunk customers have a tendency to be louder, more unruly, and make tattoo decisions that they regret later.In addition, alcohol is known to act as a mild blood thinner, leaving you bloodier than you normally would be., It's normal for your new tattoo to be sore for a few days after it's finished. As soon as the appointment is over, your artist will give you detailed instructions on how to care for your tattoo. Follow these carefully and the pain you experience will be minimal and short-lived.


See our article on caring for new tattoos for detailed instructions. The exact steps your artist tells you to follow may vary slightly from the ones in this article. In general, you will want to keep your new tattoo clean, protect it from irritation, and frequently apply antibiotic ointments until it heals.
Avoid touching the fresh tattoo with unwashed hands or anything else non-sterile. If you accidentally touch it, wash it gently with soap and water. Accidentally transferring bacteria into a tattoo wound can lead to a painful infection (plus, it may change the way your tattoo looks)."

Consider the visibility of the piercing.,
Use a temporary piercing.,
Take a picture.,
Think about your flaws.,
Sleep on it.,
Consult an experienced APP-certified piercer.,
Talk to your parents, if necessary.",How to Decide Which Piercing Is Best for You1," Ear and facial piercings are very visible, which can cause problems at school or work for some people. If you're thinking about getting a piercing, make sure you won't have to take it out at school or at your job.


If you're set on getting one, give some thought to covering your piercing in the meantime. Sometimes, schools will allow piercings to be covered with a small bandage while it heals.;
, Temporary rings can be gently clipped onto the place you're considering piercing, allowing you to get used to the sight.


If you don't have a clip-on piercing, you can use a small sticker-backed bead, or small plastic jewel and stick it to your face with non-toxic white glue. It might seem silly, but you can look at yourself in the mirror from different angles.
Go out in public if you want. Get other peoples' opinions. Keep looking at yourself in the mirror throughout the day in different lighting. At the end of the day, did you ever have any doubts about the placement? If so, you can always do this step again.

, Take a picture of yourself from the front and from different sides. See how it looks. Upload it online to see what your friends think. Make sure that it shows your whole face, head-on, in good lighting.


Upload the picture to an image editor. It can be as simple as Paint or you can use an advanced editor like Photoshop, or you can use an online editor like pixlr.com.
Place a black dot (or a picture of a ring or stud) on your face to represent the piercing, if you don't have a clip-on. Step back from your computer and look at it. Adjust the placement until you have a good idea of where you want it. Experiment.

, As backwards as it may sound, you an use piercings to distract or augment certain things you might think of as flaws. For example, a bumpy or squat nose can easily be covered up with a nostril piercing. Don't like the shape of your brow? Try adding a ring, or drawing attention to other parts of your face, with a lip piercing.

, Don't make any snap decisions. Take a couple weeks to think about it. Keep trying on your fake piercings and making sure you like how it looks. Think about how much work it will take to keep clean. Make sure you really want it.

, The best person to talk to about any of your piercing questions and concerns is a piercer certified with the Association of Professional Piercers (APP), who are required to attend at least a year-long apprenticeship program, and stay up to date on blood borne pathogen safety. When you get pierced, make sure you get pierced by a professional., You may need to acquire your parents' consent before you get any part of your body pierced. In some areas, you can be 16 and get pierced without consent, while other areas require you to be 18 to get a piercing. In some areas, you must be at least 14 to get pierced, with or without your parents' consent.

Consider a basic lobe piercing.,
Consider a helix cartilage piercing.,
Mix it up with a tragus piercing.,
Consider a conch.,
Consider other cartilage piercings.",How to Decide Which Piercing Is Best for You2," Ear piercings are the most common type of body piercing. You'll see pierced ears at church and at a punk rock concert. Most schools and jobs allow pierced ears, but they can also be be covered with hairstyles quite easily.



Pros: Stylish and simple, a basic ear-lobe piercing is a good intro. If you want something a little more wild, you can get your lobes pierced multiple times, or stretch your piercings with gauges after they heal.

Cons: Lobe piercings aren't the most exciting choice, if you're looking for something a little more ""out there."" Still, it is a good introduction.

, The cartilage high on your ear is commonly pierced, versatile, and relatively painless. This area of the ear makes for an excellent and trendy piercing option.



Pros: You're piercing through thin cartilage, and helix piercings are relatively simple and easy to clean. It's also versatile enough to connect to other piercings, though it stands out from a traditional lobe piercing. You can pierce the helix or the antihelix, slightly lower on the ear.

Cons: This piercing sticks out a little more on your face, though it is easy to cover with certain hairstyles.

, The tragus is the cartilage in front of the ear canal, which partially covers it like a small flap. While this is a somewhat difficult piercing, it stands out a lot and offers a unique piercing option.



Pros: This advanced piercing stands out from the crowd. A small, tasteful stud or ring in the tragus can be a big statement. It's also a little painful, which can be a good way to show off your tolerance.

Cons: Because the cartilage is a little thicker than the top of the ear, this piercing hurts. Tragus earrings are also susceptible to wax build up, making frequent cleaning a necessity. This piercing can also be somewhat uncomfortable when wearing headphones, especially ear-buds.

The fold just about the tragus is the ""daith,"" which is usually a little easier and less painful to pierce, but looks quite similar to the tragus piercing. Think about a daith, if you're concerned about the pain and aftercare.



, Conch piercings go between the helix and the lobe, along the back ridge of your ear. These make for another common ear piercing.



Pros: Like any ear piercing, the conch is relatively safe, quick to heal, and generally easy to care for compared to facial or body piercings. It looks great with bar-style piercings.

Cons: This is one of the more big-statement ear piercings. You'll definitely notice it.

, There are lots of cartilage folds in the ear, and most of them have been pierced at one time or another successfully, by experienced and licensed piercers at tattoo parlors.


If you want to get your ears pierced, get a temporary ring that you can clip onto different parts of your ear to experiment. Leave it there for a day or two and see how much you like it, then talk to the piercer for advice.

Consider a nostril piercing.,
Consider a septum piercing.,
Think about a lip piercing.,
Consider getting your eyebrow pierced.,
Think about a tongue piercing.",How to Decide Which Piercing Is Best for You3," Perhaps the most common facial piercing aside from the ears is the nostril. It's a stylish and increasingly well-accepted facial piercing in most communities, amenable for both studs and rings.



Pros: Nostril piercings are much more common than they used to be, making them a good foray into a facial piercing. They're easy to care for and relatively quick to heal.

Cons: It's mostly impossible to hide a nostril piercing, and you won't be able to take it out for several months while it heals. Corkscrew-style studs are also somewhat difficult to remove.

, The septum is the center wall that separates your nostrils, just under the cartilage. The septum is an increasingly popular choice for a variety of reasons.



Pros: Septum piercings are very versatile and easy to hide. Rings can be twisted up into the nostrils to make them practically invisible.

Cons: Septum piercings look really stylish with the right jewelry, but can look a lot like boogers with the wrong choices. It's also sometimes a painful piercing, depending on the make-up and size of your septum.

, Typically, the lip is pierced just below the lip-line of the bottom lip, in the middle, to the left or right side, or some combination. The top lip is also sometimes pierced, which is called a ""Madonna"" to one side and a ""Monroe"" to the other. Whether solo or combination, lip piercings are both hip and very common.



Pros: There are lots of combinations and variations of lip piercings, which means you can start with one and evolve your piercings as you grow. If you want to end up with snakebites, or fangs, you can try out a single piercing and see how it works for you, then go back for more.

Cons: Any lip piercing comes with some measure of dental risk, including chipped teeth and enamel wear. Like any facial piercing, lip piercings need to be performed by safe and experienced piercers., Eyebrow piercing used to be completed to show courage and virility.It's a punky and stylish selection.



Pros: Eyebrow piercings are powerful and commanding in their presence. Both bars and rings look cool on the eyebrow.

Cons: These are possibly the most difficult piercings to hide, and can't usually be hidden without removal or using a bandage. They're also somewhat less popular than they once were.

, Tongue piercings are a more advanced type of facial piercing that some people choose to work up to when they're ready. It's not usually a first piercing, but tongue piercings are popular for a variety of reasons.



Pros: For some people, tongue piercings offer both style and sexual advantages. They're also easy to conceal.

Cons: Tongue piercings are one of the more dangerous and painful facial piercings you can get. There is some risk of nerve damage and vascular damage, if piercings aren't done by a professional. They also bring some danger of dental problems.

Consider piercing your naval.,
Consider piercing your nipple(s).,
Consider surface piercings.,
Consider getting your genitals pierced.",How to Decide Which Piercing Is Best for You4," One of the more common and easily concealed body piercings is the naval, or bellybutton. Probably more common for women, bellybutton piercings typically look best on fairly trim figures.



Pros: Bellybutton piercings are definitely the most common and socially acceptable body piercing.

Cons: These piercings are typically somewhat painful, and require lots of aftercare to keep them healthy.

, Supposedly, Roman soldiers used to pierce their nipples to show their bravery. For both men and women, nipple piercings are a common and sexy body piercing.



Pros: Many people like the stimulation and added sexual benefits of nipple piercings. They're easy to hide and quite trendy.

Cons: The nipples are extremely sensitive, and the piercing can be quite painful and sore in the short term. Long term, piercings may also affect milk production and the ability of some women to breastfeed., The hips, the back, the nape of the neck, and the wrist have all been pierced at one time or another. Corset-style piercings are popular among body-mod enthusiasts and people looking for something different.



Pros: These are the most eye-catching and spectacular types of body piercing, because of the difficulty of pulling them off. Piercing designs can also be made on the surfaces of the skin.

Cons: These piercings are usually quite advanced, and are prone to rejection. They can also easily rip out of the skin if you make any wrong movements.

, For some advanced piercing enthusiasts, genital piercing is the biggest thrill and the most stimulating experience that piercing offers. For others, it's a terrifying prospect. While piercing can offer added stimulation and excitement sexually, it can also come with the risk of infection, permanent nerve damage, and a loss of feeling in your most private parts. Always consult with an experienced and licensed piercer to get your genitals pierced.



Women often get a vertical clitoral hood piercing, although a horizontal piercing can also be performed. While other types of genital piercings exist such as a fourchette, done to the rear rim of the vulva, or the clitoris itself, many women do not have the anatomy required for these piercings or, like the clitoris piercing, they carry a considerable amount of risk.

Men typically pierce the underside of the frenulum, through the urethra, or pierce across the head of the penis to complete a ""Prince Albert."" Other piercings exist such as the hafada, performed on the scrotum, or a foreskin piercing. However, the piercer will have to evaluate the anatomy of each individual, as certain factors such as whether or not the penis is circumcised can play an important role in whether or not the piercing can be performed.

Wash the piercing with antibacterial soap once or twice a day.,
Clean any crusting with a cotton swab.,
Apply lavender oil.,
Do not over clean the piercing.,
Avoid using rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide.,
Don't use bacitracin or other antibacterial ointments.,
Avoid moving the ring around inside the piercing.,
Avoid wearing tight clothing.,
Don't remove the ring during healing.,
Identify signs of infection.,
Apply a warm compress.,
Clean with antiseptic cleaner and apply an antibacterial cream.,
Do not remove the navel ring.,
See a doctor if symptoms persist.",How to Clean Navel Piercings," A new navel piercing needs to be cleaned thoroughly at least once, and preferably twice a day.


The easiest way to clean your new piercing is in the shower. Cup your hand under the piercing and allow clean, warm water to run over it for a minute or two. Try to avoid getting soap or other cleaners into or around your piercing as this can lead to infection and drying of the skin around the piercing.
Take a gentle basic liquid soap with no dyes and squirt a drop or two into the palm of your hand. Lather it up, then apply the lather to the piercing and the suing, preventing infection and promoting healing. They should be done once or twice a day while the piercing heals.






To make a salt soak, dissolve a teaspoon of sea salt in half a cup of boiled water. Allow the water to cool slightly, then transfer it to a clean glass or medicine cup.
Do not use iodized salt, kosher salt or Epsom salts, as these can irritate the piercing. However, you can use a store-bought saline solution instead of the sea salt.
Rest the edge of the glass beneath your navel piercing, then quickly flip it over, pressing firmly to prevent any water from leaking out.
Lie down on a sofa or bed to allow the piercing to soak in the salt solution for 10 to 15 minutes. Place a towel beneath you if you're afraid of spills.
Rinse the piercing thoroughly with clean water, then dry completely with paper towel or tissue. Don't use a cloth towel, as these can harbor bacteria.;
, As your piercing heals, it will secrete a white to off-white fluid. This is part of the healing process and is perfectly healthy and normal. However, this fluid may build-up and cause crusting around the piercing. If you do see crust around your belly ring, do not panic as this is perfectly normal.


To remove the crusting, dip a cotton swab in some warm water and use it to gently rub away any crusting from the piercing. Never pick the crusting off with your fingers as this can lead to infection.
If the crust around the piercing is left to build up, it can harden around the ring, tearing at the wound when the ring moves. This can be painful and delays the healing process.

, Lavender oil is a great natural product which promotes healing and reduces swelling and tenderness around the piercing.


Thoroughly wash your hands with antibacterial soap, then apply a couple of drops of the lavender oil to a clean cotton bud and rub gently around the piercing.
Gently rotate the ring or move the barbell up and down to make sure the lavender oil reaches inside the piercing. Use a tissue to wipe any excess oil from the skin.
Lavender oil can be purchased at the supermarket or chemist's. Just make sure it is clearly marked as being ""medicinal grade"" -- this guarantees the purity of the oil and reduces the chance of irritation.

, Although it may seem like a good idea to clean the piercing more than twice a day, over-cleaning can actually strip natural oils from the skin, causing the piercing to become dried out and irritated.


However, it is important that you always clean your piercing after exercise or periods of intense sweating (even if you've already cleaned it that day), as sweat can irritate the piercing.

, It is a bad idea to use either rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide to clean your piercing, as these substances dry out the skin which leads to irritation.


In addition, these substances prevent the growth of healthy new cells within the piercing, which slows down the healing process.

, These types of ointments are not meant for puncture wounds (like piercings) as they keep the wound too moist, which cuts off oxygen supply to the tissue and slows down the healing process.

, Avoid turning, twisting or rotating the ring or barbell for the first 3 to 4 weeks, as this aggravates the wound and slows down the healing process.


Twisting the ring also means that you are touching the piercing more than necessary, which increases the risk of bacteria from your hands being transferred to the navel and causing infection.

, For the first few weeks after a navel piercing you should avoid tight clothing such as high-waited jeans, skirts and pantyhose. The jewelry may get caught in the clothing and tug at the wound, which is painful and slows down healing time.


You may also want to cover your navel piercing with a large bandage when playing contact sports and in bed, when there is an increased risk of tugging or pulling on the wound.

, You should never remove the navel ring or barbell while the piercing is still healing. Navel piercings can close up very rapidly so if you remove the jewelry (even for short periods of time) you may be unable to get it back in again.

, Sometimes, despite your best efforts, the piercing will still become infected. When an infection develops, it's important that you deal with it immediately, to prevent it from becoming worse. The main symptoms of an infected piercing are as follows:


Excessive redness and swelling around the piercing.
Pain or tenderness whenever the area is touched or the jewelry moves.
Green or blood-streaked pus seeping from the piercing.

, A warm compress can help to draw infection from the piercing. Soak a clean washcloth in warm water, wring out the excess, then press against the piercing for three minutes. Repeat 3 to 4 times a day.

, After applying the compress, clean the piercing with an antiseptic cleanser, remembering to thoroughly rinse with running water. Dry completely with paper towel, then apply a thin layer of topical antibacterial cream.

, Do not under any circumstances remove the jewelry from the piercing. If you do, the piercing may close up, thus sealing the infection inside the navel. This makes it very difficult to treat. It's much safer to leave the jewelry in the piercing until the infection has cleared.

, If the infection has not improved after 24 hours, or you begin to develop fever or chills, it is important that you see a doctor immediately. They can prescribe antibiotics to clear up the infection.

Include a page, or even a few pages, of flash tattoo designs that you have created at the pack of your portfolio.,
Create a visual CV.,
Your portfolio is now complete!",How to Create an Impressive Tattoo Artist Portfolio," While you might have a website or a Pinterest page this probably isn’t going to be enough to really impress an artist. Make sure you have something that is big enough to hold your drawings and sketches. Something with a hard cover will help to protect your artwork, and either leather bound or with some sort of attractive decoration; as these make them more visually appealing. The more professional looking your presentation the more the tattoo studios are going to take you seriously as a potential artist.;
, Offer some artwork using pencils, chalks, crayons, felt tips, inks, charcoal, paints and digital tools at the very least. You should aim to have a minimum to two pieces of artwork in each medium within your portfolio – bonus points if you produce the same piece in more than one medium (for example reproducing the same portrait image three or four different times, using charcoal for one, pencil for another and water colours or inks for another one or two). Watercolours or inks and pencils should have more examples, and the mediums you are most confident using can be an opportunity to show off a wider variety of your artwork.

, As a tattoo artist you will have to create and design all sorts of images for all sorts of customers. There will be some who just want a portrait replicated from a photo reference, and others who want you to create huge, colourful and imaginative pieces from scratch. You should be capable of demonstrating a variety of different artworks, not just the mediums but the subjects too. Ensure that your portfolio contains artwork of people, animals, flowers, skulls, and a variety of decoratively created symbols, both with colour and without. Skulls, dragons, butterflies, stars, hearts, roses, pinup girls and so on are all very commonly requested tattoo designs – so think ahead and demonstrate an ability to produce these designs.

, You should have a well-developed artistic style if you’re looking to be a tattoo artist. However, you should be able to produce tattoos in a variety of styles. Try creating a page in your portfolio that offers a tattoo design you have created; something fairly simple like perhaps a skull or dragon. Then demonstrate how this might be recreated in different styles to suit different customer preferences; commons styles include Celtic, neo traditional, tribal, realistic, Japanese, black and white, colourful – there are no shortage of ways you can demonstrate different tattoo styles. Spend some time playing with them.

, If you’ve created a portrait piece include the photo reference you worked from. If you’ve created a completely new fantasy piece include your initial sketch work. For a tattoo artist it is important to see how you have built your work up and how you arrived at the final results. This can help them to identify your strong points, and may help them give you pointers as to where you might be making mistakes in the process. It also allows them to see how you might adapt to creating work on the skin. Show some unfinished work and pages of anatomy sketches within your portfolio, as well as completed work – this allows the tattooists you’re applying to work for to see that you take every aspect of the art seriously, and demonstrates a desire to improve – artists love that.

, Flash designs are generally simpler tattoo designs that will be reproduced again and again on any customer who wants them. This not only allows the artist to see what sort of tattoo designs you might produce if you started working for them, but it also gives you the opportunity to leave some of your work with the artist. For example – if you leave a page of flash with the artist, and they suddenly get a lot of customers wanting the designs that you have produced, chances are you’re going to get a call, and they’re going to want you to work with them.

, You’re not going to get offered a job while you’re there showing your portfolio, chances are they will want a CV from you, which will sit to one side until they are ready to take on an apprentice or new artist. The CV, like a CV for any other job, should include your name, experience, educational history, employment history, contact information, a little bit about yourself and a few smaller images (photos, scans or copies) or your best work.

, Get yourself out there and share it with tattoo artists around you. You may want to look up some information regarding how to become a tattoo artist – which will help you to understand the right way to approach artists and present yourself as a prospective tattoo artist.

Wash your hands.,
Take off your bandage after four to six hours.,
Turn the faucet on.,
Use your hands to cup the water.,
Rub a mild soap onto your tattoo.,
Rinse with water.,
Dry your tattoo.,
Apply a cream.,
Clean two to three times per day.,
Contact your tattoo artist.",How to Clean a New Tattoo," Place your hands under clean, running water to get them wet. Squeeze soap into the palm of your hand. Rub your hands together until a lather forms. Scrub your palms, the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your fingernails for at least 20 seconds. Rinse your hands with clean water and let them air dry, or dry them with a clean paper towel.Use the paper towel to turn the faucet off as well.;
, Do not leave your bandage on for more than eight hours. You will need to clean your tattoo immediately after removing the bandage., Use a paper towel to do this so you can avoid contaminating your hands. Let the faucet run until the water is lukewarm (about 87 to 89 degrees Fahrenheit or 30 to 32 degrees Celsius).Make sure the water is not hot. Hot water can be painful. It can also cause your pores to open up, which can cause the ink to drain from your tattoo.

, Pour the water over your tattoo. Using a circular motion, gently rub your finger over your tattoo to wet the entire area.Do not place your tattoo directly under the running water.
Since too much water can cause the ink to drain from your tattoo, only pour water over it once.

, Make sure to use an alcohol and fragrance-free soap. Using your finger, gently rub the soap onto your tattoo in a circular motion. Lightly massage the soap into your tattoo until the majority of blood, ointment and plasma are removed.Do not force off pieces of blood and ink, as well as scabs that cannot be removed with gentle rubbing.
Do not use a towel or washcloth to rub the soap into your tattoo. These are too abrasive and may contain bacteria that can infect it.

, Do this once your tattoo looks and feels clean. Use your hands to cup the water again. Pour the water over your tattoo. Make sure to rinse the area thoroughly until all soap and residue are removed., Gently blot your tattoo with a clean paper towel. If the paper towel sticks to your tattoo, wet the area to remove it. Do not use a cloth or bath towel to do this. These may contain bacteria that can infect your tattoo.Alternatively, you can let your tattoo air dry for 30 to 45 minutes.

, Do this once your tattoo is thoroughly dry. Using a small amount of cream, gently rub it over your tattoo with your fingers in a circular motion. Only apply a thin layer of cream so that your tattoo shines. Try to avoid applying cream over any scabs.If you applied too much cream, use a clean paper towel to blot and remove the excess cream.
Plain, unscented creams are generally used to treat tattoos. Your tattoo artist can recommend you a cream. Try to avoid antibiotic creams like Neosporin; these may cause the ink to drain from your tattoo.

, Do this for the first three to five days. After the fifth day, you can gradually reduce the cleaning to once or twice per day, or when you shower., Do this if you suspect an infection. Your tattoo artist will advise you to contact your doctor if they think you have an infection. Your doctor will most likely prescribe a steroid or an antibiotic to treat the infection. Signs of an infection are:A very painful or hot to the touch tattoo after seven to ten days.
A pimply or bumpy rash surrounding your tattoo.
An extremely red, itchy and/or swollen tattoo after seven to ten days.
Blistering or unusual scabbing.
Pimples or boils that exude pus.
Continued bleeding after three nights, or red streaking.
A fever and/or swollen lymph nodes.

Wash your hands.,
Remove the piece of jewelry.,
Soak in warm water with antibacterial soap.,
Rinse the jewelry in hot water.,
Dry the jewelry before putting it back in.,
Clean the site of the piercing.",How to Clean Body Jewelry1," Anytime you touch your jewelry, it’s possible you are transferring germs to the piercing site. While you should avoid touching it in general, it is especially important to only handle body jewelry with clean hands when you are about to clean it. Use a basic antibacterial soap and dry your hands with paper towel or a clean towel. A towel that you already dry your hands on frequently can have bacteria that has accumulated on it., If the piercing has been in place for a long time without being removed, be sure to take the jewelry out slowly as it might be stuck to your skin. You don’t want to damage the piercing by pulling the jewelry out too quickly.

, Take a clean cup or bowl and fill it with warm water. Squirt or pour about a palm full of soap into the water. Swirl it around to make sure the soap doesn’t glob in one spot. Place the jewelry in the water and allow to soak for about 3 minutes.Perform this soak on a regular basis to keep the jewelry clean and keep the piercing healthy. It is best to clean your jewelry every day, but you should do it least every 2-3 days.
A good alternative to soapy water, if you want to buy something extra, is to get saline wash that is specifically made for cleaning piercings.

, You want to make sure that all of the soap residue is off the piece of jewelry before putting it back in. Soap can dry your skin and possibly cause irritation if it sits in the piercing for a long time.


While you are rinsing, it is good to inspect the piece of jewelry and make sure there is no dirt or debris left on the piece. If there is, further cleaning will be necessary.

, Either allow the piece of jewelry to air dry or gently dry it with a paper towel or gauze pad before putting it back in. If you dry it with a towel, make sure the towel hasn’t been used since it was washed because used towels tend to have bacteria on them, so you will be counteracting the cleaning you just did.If you plan to clean your jewelry regularly, you could cut paper towels into small squares and store them in a sealed plastic baggie for drying purposes. Since jewelry is small and doesn’t need a whole paper towel, you can avoid waste doing it this way.

, Now that you have a clean piece of jewelry, you need to make sure the site of the piercing itself is also clean. You can use a little more soap and water and dip a Q-tip in it to gently swab out the piercing. It is good to do this every couple days anyway to maintain a clean piercing.It's best to avoid the use of rubbing alcohol when cleaning jewelry or piercings because it can cause damage to the jewelry.
Allow the piercing to dry before replacing the jewelry.

Use a soft toothbrush.,
Use a Q-tip.,
Place jewelry in boiling water.,
Buy an ultrasonic cleaner.,
Soak oral pieces in alcohol-free mouthwash.",How to Clean Body Jewelry2," If soaking in warm, soapy water is not enough to dislodge any particles from your jewelry, you can lightly brush it clean with a soft brush. A toothbrush is a good option for this, but make sure that it is clean and sterile. Designate this brush as only for cleaning your jewelry. Dip the brush in new soapy water and lightly brush the piece clean of debris.This will most likely be necessary for pieces that have been in longer, for times when you have gotten dirtier than usual, or for jewelry with extra crevices.

, If your jewelry has a complicated shape or small spots that a toothbrush can’t reach, a cotton swab is a great tool for cleaning jewelry. Again, you can dip the swab into soapy water and gently brush away any any remaining dirt.

, If you don’t want to use soap, or you already did and the piece needs further cleaning, boil a small pot of water and place your jewelry in it for about 5 minutes. This acts both to loosen any dirt or debris on the piece and kill bacteria and sanitize the piece. Remove from water with a clean utensil like tongs or a fork to avoid burning your hands.Dry with paper towel or gauze as you would with basic cleaning.
This is a good cleaning method for intricate pieces that accumulate more dirt than basic pieces.

, If you have multiple piercings and you want to invest in a more efficient cleaning system, it is recommended that you purchase an ultrasonic cleaner. This is an electronic cleaning basin that uses vibration to dislodge dirt from trickier pieces. This is a good choice if you have multiple piercings as it can save time in the cleaning process.You can purchase one at Walmart or on Amazon, and some other stores like Bed Bath & Beyond. Standard models cost between $30 and $40, but an advanced model could cost up to $200 or $300.

, If you have tongue, cheek, or lip piercings, you may not want the taste of soap in your mouth. You can soak these in mouthwash to give them a good clean as well. It is good to follow the other steps from the routine cleaning section.To clean oral piercings, it is also good to swish your mouth with mouthwash to keep the piercings clean.
It is important that the mouthwash is alcohol-free because alcohol can damage some jewelry.

Metal
Acrylic and dental acrylic
Silicone
Glass

, Wooden jewelry should never be submerged in water. Instead, wipe wooden pieces of jewelry down with a damp cloth, then apply a drop of oil to condition them.Good oils for this purpose include:


Jojoba

Wash your hands.,
Use cotton swaps to remove dried skin.,
Wash your ears with anti-bacterial soap.,
Perform a salt water soak.,
Avoid infections.",How to Clean Ear Gauges2," Anytime you receive a new piercing--or move to a larger size gauge--it is important to refrain from touching the area for at least 24 hours. After this, you will need to clean the area several times a day. Before touching your piercings it is important to wash your hands with hot water and soap.

, Your fresh ear piercing may accumulate some dried skin or other crust. With clean hands, moisten a cotton swab with water and use it to carefully removed any dried matter from the front and back of each piercing., Once the dry matter has been removed, lather a drop of unscented antibacterial soap and water, and work this around each piercing (front and back). Rinse each piercing with cool water and dry them with a clean paper towel.Do this at least once, but not more than twice per day.

, In addition to cleansing with antibacterial soap, you may want to perform a salt water soak. In order to do this, moisten a clean cotton ball with saline solution, and press it up to your ear piercing.You can do this for 10 minutes at a time, 2-3 times per day.
Perform a salt water soak if your piercing feels swollen, irritated, or otherwise painful.
Use this practice sparingly with bone, stone, or wooden jewelry.

, A piercing is essentially an open wound, and as such, is prone to infection. You can prevent infections in your ear piercings by avoiding risky activities. For at least 3 weeks after getting a new piercing (or sizing up your gauges), avoid:


Removing or changing jewelry
Saunas, swimming pools, lakes, and other bodies of water
Wearing hats or dirty clothes
Touching the piercing unnecessarily
Touching the piercing with dirty hands

Wash your hands.,
Soak your piercing.,
Gently remove loosened buildup.,
Dry the pierced area.",How to Clean a Cartilage Piercing1," Always wash your hands thoroughly with an antibacterial soap before handling a cartilage piercing. Touching the pierced area can introduce bacteria or other pathogens to the body.
, Dissolve 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt in an egg cup of warm water. Place the pierced part of your ear in the water. Remove it after 2-3 minutes of soaking., Wipe away any buildup of discharge that may have loosened around the piercing. Wet a piece of gauze and gently dab at the debris to remove it. If the crusted formation does not remove easily, leave it alone and do not use force to loosen it.Always avoid using cotton balls or Q-tips when cleaning your cartilage piercing, as they may leave behind lint. They may also get caught on the piercing itself, which could cause injury to your ear.

, Gently dab the pierced area dry with a paper towel. Avoid using a shared towel, which may spread bacteria and cause an infection. Don't rub the piercing, which could aggravate it while it heals."
"
Avoid playing with the piercing.,
Make sure that your clothing and sheets are clean.,
Do not use harsh chemicals on the site of the piercing.",How to Clean a Cartilage Piercing2," While it is healing, avoid handling your cartilage piercing for any reason other than cleaning it. Turning or twisting the jewelry could cause an infection. The piercing should only be touched with freshly washed hands., To avoid infection, make sure that your clothing and sheets are clean. During the healing process, clothing that may touch your ear (e.g. a hooded sweatshirt) should be washed after each occasion that you wear it. Make sure that bed sheets (pillow cases in particular) are laundered at least once a week., Avoid using rubbing alcohol or peroxide on your piercing as they can be very drying and damage your skin. Antibacterial soaps and moisturizing bar soaps may leave behind a residue that might contribute to an infection or longer time to heal."
"
Keep an eye on the color of the piercing site.,
Look for green or yellow pus.,
Check for bleeding or swelling.,
Contact a doctor if signs of infection appear.",How to Clean a Cartilage Piercing3," It's normal for the skin around your piercing to be red for the first few days after it is pierced, but redness after 3-4 days is a sign of possible infection. Similarly, changes in color of the skin around the piercing (e.g., to a yellowish tint) can indicate that it is infected. Check the color of your piercing site twice a day in the mirror, preferably before cleaning it., During the healing process, a slight, white discharge is normal. If you see pus with a yellow or green tinge, your piercing is probably infected. Check your ear for pus before cleaning the piercing, given that you might wash away traces of discharge., Prolonged bleeding of the piercing site is not normal and is a cause for concern. Similarly, swelling that does not go down after 3-4 days may be a sign of infection. Check the pierced area daily., If your piercing develops signs of a bacterial infection, contact your physician or visit a walk-in clinic immediately. A doctor may prescribe antibiotics or an anti-bacterial ointment to treat the problem. Left untreated, a cartilage piercing infection may lead to an abscess, which usually requires surgery and may leave ears deformed."

Wash your hands.,
Remove any crust that forms.,
Make a sea salt mixture.,
Avoid contact with the piercing.,
Use a mild soap in the shower.,
Pat your piercing dry.,
Consult a doctor if you suspect infection.,
Use a ring.,
Choose surgical steel.,
Ask the advice of a professional piercer.",How to Clean a Nipple Piercing," Always wash your hands with antibacterial soap before touching your nipple piercing (even after it’s completely healed). The easiest way to cause an infection in your nipple piercing is to touch it without washing your hands first.Thoroughly wash your hands with antibacterial soap and water in the sink before cleaning or touching your piercing for any reason.
Avoid touching your nipple piercing except to clean it for the first few weeks.;
, If your nipple piercing becomes crusty around the edges of the open wound, you need to carefully remove the scabby crust. It’s best to do this in the shower so the crust gets wet and is easier to remove. Use your finger or a Q-tip to gently dab away any crust that has formed around the nipple piercing.Be careful not to twist the ring too much while removing the crust. Only move the ring enough to get the scab off; don’t rotate it all the way through the piercing.
Be very gentle during this procedure, as removing the crust too forcefully could cause a tear in the skin around the piercing and require a new healing process, or even result in infection.

, Pour ¼ teaspoon of non-iodized sea salt into one cup of warm distilled water. Let the sea salt dissolve in the cup. Use a paper towel to soak up the sea salt water and place it on top of your nipple. Let your nipple absorb the liquid for 5-10 minutes each day.You can also try inverting the cup with the sea salt mixture on top of your nipple so that it creates a kind of vacuum seal and lie back while your nipple soaks. But be careful not to spill the water.
Do this every day for the first two weeks after piercing. After the first two weeks, you can switch to regular cleaning in the shower. But use return to this method if you develop an infection or any irritation.
Make sure to use distilled water, as tap water contains impurities that can promote infection.
You can also use packaged sterile saline (this is different than saline solution for contact lenses) to soak your nipple piercing and clean it. Usually the packaging for this kind of saline indicates that it is intended for wound care.
Do not use rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or antibiotic ointments.

, For the first few days (maybe even for a couple of weeks) after you get your nipple pierced, it will be tender and swollen. In order to help the healing process along, you should avoid bumping it on anything or rubbing it on things.Try to wear loose fitting clothing and avoid tight, scratchy bras. Don’t wear constrictive clothing.
If you need a little extra padding, consider using nipple pads intended for nursing mothers. This can help protect your piercing while it is healing.

, Each time you shower, you should use a gentle liquid soap to clean your nipple piercing. Pour some soap on your fingers and gently work it through the piercing by slowly rotating the ring (or sliding the barbell). Be sure to rinse it out completely while in the shower, as leftover soap residue can cause irritation.Avoid soaps that have fragrance, dye, or other added ingredients that could irritate your nipple piercing.
Again, do not use alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or antibiotic ointments.

, Use a paper towel to pat your nipple piercing after you finish showering. Leaving your nipple piercing wet and moist can create a breeding ground for bacteria, especially if you confine your piercing in tight clothes after you shower. Make sure your piercing is completely dry before you put clothes on.Be sure to use a disposable paper towel to pat your nipple piercing dry each time. Towels can be a host for bacteria, so using your towel to dry the piercing could cause an unwanted infection.

, If you see any signs of infection, it’s important for you to seek medical attention from a doctor as soon as possible. An infected nipple could cause a lot of problems for you and your body. Some symptoms to watch for include:Green or yellow pus coming out of the piercing
Swelling that won’t go away after several weeks (or returns later)
Excessive redness or pain
A large lump in the breast or around the nipple

, When you first get your piercing done, ask the piercer to use a ring instead of a barbell. Swelling will occur around the nipple piercing, which can make the barbell feel tight in the beginning. A ring is also easier to clean since you can rotate it through the piercing.After a couple months, you can switch to a barbell if you would like. Just wait until the piercing is completely done healing.

, It’s very important to use sterile, surgical steel piercing jewelry when you first get the nipple piercing. This will help stave off infection and promote a quicker healing process. Your nipple is a very sensitive area and needs to be cared for properly.Jewelry made out of other materials may irritate your new piercing and may even lead to infection.

, Make sure that the person doing your nipple piercing is a professional, licensed piercer. This usually means that they have apprenticed under a master piercer and been given a certification of training completed. They will usually operate out of a tattoo or piercing shop.Ask your piercer for advice on what kind of jewelry to choose for your nipple piercing and be sure to follow all of their aftercare instructions.

Finish by going back over each area once more.",How to Give Yourself a Facial Massage1," Complete your face-washing routine before conducting your massage. Cleanse your face using a gentle cleanser or oil, rinse it with lukewarm water, then pat your face dry with a towel.






;
, Using a bit of oil helps your fingers move smoothly across your face, rather than dragging on your skin. It also leaves your face bright and glowing when you're through with the massage. You may use a blend of oils formulated especially for the face, or choose a single oil that works best with your skin type. Almond, argan, and jojoba oil all work well as face massage oils that won't clog your pores.

For very dry skin, choose argan or almond oil.
For medium to oily skin, choose jojoba or a blend of jojoba and castor oil.
If you're concerned about using oil on your skin, use your favorite moisturizer.

, Many believe that toxins drain from the face to the lymph nodes, located under your ears on the sides of your neck. Massaging this area helps to release the toxins and prevent them from building up in your face. Using the tips of your fingers, massage your lymph area in a circular motion for one minute.









Use wide circles, sweeping from under your ears, down toward your throat, and up along your jaw line.
You want a firm touch, but don't massage too hard. A facial massage is different from a deep tissue massage, since the skin on your face is more sensitive.

, Using the same wide circular strokes, massage along the sides of your jaw, past the corners of your mouth, next to your nostrils, an over your cheekbones. Push your skin up, then out; never down, since this can cause sagging to occur. Continue for one minute.

, Tension often builds up in the jaw and neck area, and massaging here will help loosen your muscles. Using the tips of your fingers, massage the area in a circular motion for one minute.









Use wide circles, sweeping from under your ears, down toward your throat, and up along your jaw line.
Press more firmly in areas where the muscles feel tight.

, Using the same wide circular strokes, massage along the sides of your jaw, past the corners of your mouth, next to your nostrils, an over your cheekbones. Close your eyes and focus on the relaxing motion of your hands on your face.

If you don't have access to a massage table, then you can try using the floor, a couch, a bed, or even a kitchen table if it’s sturdy enough for the person to lie on. Each option has drawbacks that make it less ideal than a massage table, mostly due to comfort issues for the person receiving the massage and height issues requiring the person giving the massage to lean over in uncomfortable ways.If a bed is the best option available, make sure that the suggestion doesn’t come across as inappropriate. Consider the relationship you have with the person and discuss that the massage will take place on a bed beforehand.;
, If you don’t have access to a massage table, and you’re opting for one of the harder-surfaced alternatives, then lay down a soft mat. Use a mat that is at least two inches thick to provide the proper comfort for the person receiving the massage., Since the person will dress down most or all of the way for his or her massage, a clean sheet over the mat or table will be both more hygienic and more comfortable for the person. It will also catch any excess oil.

, Make sure the room is warm without being hot.This is the ideal atmosphere for the person to relax the muscles you’re trying to massage.


Play some uneventful music. New age, ambient music, quiet classical music, or even soundscapes will help the person relax to their fullest. Pulsing, driving music won't help. Keep the volume low.Turn the lights down just enough so there's no glare in the room.Light scented aromatherapy candles. This is optional, and you should ask the person before lighting the candles since some people enjoy the smells while others are too sensitive to them.

, Massage is best given and received without clothing on the area being massaged, especially if you are using oil or lotion. Request that the person undresses as much as he or she is comfortable with.


Always provide an additional towel or sheet above and beyond the one covering the table. This way the person can lie down and cover the parts of his or her body not being massaged. This will make the environment both more comfortable and warmer, which is relaxing.
If privacy is a concern, step out of the room as you have the person dress down and cover himself/herself with the additional towel or sheet. Knock and ensure that the person is ready for reentering the room.
If the person left pants or underwear on, you could tuck the edge of the towel or sheet into the waistband to ensure no oil from the massage stains the material.

, If you have a proper massage table, this means the person’s face will rest in the face cradle.


If it’s comfortable for the person, you can also use a pillow or folded towel beneath the ankles. This will support the person's lower back.

, If the person wrapped a towel while undressing or pulled the additional sheet all the way up, then fold the material down to expose the person’s back.

, Tell them to let you know if anything you are doing is painful or uncomfortable. Part of them being comfortable is having a feeling of trust in you. This is not the time to make jokes or suggestive comments.


Periodically remind the person to take a slow, deep breath. It will help with relaxation.

, Start with about one teaspoon, which is roughly the size of a quarter. Warm it by rubbing it between your hands before applying it to the person.








Good oils to use are organic coconut oil, grape seed oil, jojoba oil, or almond oil. There are many expensive scented and speciality massage oils on the market you can try too.

, The main technique for spreading the warmed oil across the person’s back is called effleurage, which means “light friction.”Use gliding movements in long, even strokes.








Use the whole of your hands and start at the bottom of the person’s back, moving upward. Always upward toward the heart (the direction of blood flow) while applying pressure, and then lightly bring the hands down the outside of the back lightly. Maintain contact without applying pressure as you bring your hands back down.Repeat this technique for 3-5 minutes while gradually increasing from light to medium pressure to warm up the back muscles.Don’t forget the shoulders and neck area.

, Petrissage uses shorter, circular strokes with more pressure than effleurage.You can think of this as a kneading technique that uses rolling and pressing to enhance deeper circulation.








This technique can use the palm, fingertips, or even the knuckles in the short, circular motions.The movement should come from the waist—your core—rather than from the shoulders. This will help keep you from becoming fatigued.
Go across the entire back for 2-5 minutes. You can alternate between this and lighter effleurage movements to diversify techniques.Without professional training, use only light to medium pressure while applying petrissage movements.

, Percussive strokes (also known as tapotement) are collections of brief, repetitive contacts with parts of the hand.You can use your cupped hands, your fingertips all gathered to an even point, or even the flat of your fingers on the knuckle side of your hands to make the contacts.These movements have a stimulating, compressive effect on the tissue.








Keep your wrists relaxed and flex at the wrists, using quick movements to perform tapotement techniques.This ensures that you don’t apply too much pressure.
Spend 2-3 minutes applying the techniques across the person’s entire back.

, To perform this, close your fingers and hold out your thumb (in a “lobster claw” shape). Apply pressure in a twisting, lifting motion. Keep alternating hands in a “windshield wiper” movement.








Move up and down the back 2-3 times.

, Position yourself at the head of the table. Position your thumbs at the top of the back, just below the neck and on either side of the spine. Using a ""fanning"" motion with your thumbs extended, push gently down toward the lower back with your pressure angled at the person’s feet, not down towards the ground. Alternate your pressure on either thumb, moving from the top of the back all the way down to the person's hips.









Make sure you are massaging the muscles on either side of the spine, not directly on the spine itself. Massaging over the spine can be very uncomfortable and dangerous if you are not trained properly.

, Come back around to the person's side. Reach around the far hip with one hand, while the other hand rests on the near hip. With a fluid motion, pull one hand towards you as the other one pushes away; in the middle, they should slide against each other, in opposite directions. Repeat this stroke up the back until you reach the shoulder area, then come back down. Repeat three times.

If you use a chair, make sure the back of the chair is low enough to give you access to the back of his shoulders.
If you don't have an appropriate chair or stool available, place a comfortable cushion on the ground. Have your partner sit cross-legged on the ground while you kneel behind him.;
, It uses long, gentle motions along the surface of the muscles instead of the intense pressure of a style like the deep tissue massage.

When you find tension knots, you can apply focused pressure.
For the most part, though, keep the pressure firm but not intense.

, Rushing into intense massaging before warming up the muscles can cause your partner to tense up even more under your touch. Ease into the massage by using your fingertips to loosen up and prepare the neck and shoulders. This will put him in the frame of mind to relax into the experience.


Place the ring, middle, and index fingertips of your hands where the base of your partner's head meets the neck. Apply light but firm pressure.
If that feels uncomfortable, use whichever fingertips feel right to you. You might use just index and middle fingers.
Slide your fingers down the sides of his neck, sweeping over onto the shoulders.
Make sure to apply even pressure throughout, running your fingers over the muscles.

, In the previous step, you may have felt hard knots in the muscles. These knots indicate tension, and they need focused pressure from your thumbs.
/images/thumb/3/37/Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-4-Version-7.jpg/v4-550px-Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-4-Version-7.jpg
/images/thumb/3/37/Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-4-Version-7.jpg/v4-300px-Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-4-Version-7.jpg









Place your thumbs on the tension knot.
Place your other four fingers on each hand on the front of your partner's shoulder to stabilize your thumbs when you apply pressure.
Apply firm pressure with your thumbs in a kneading, circular motion to release the tension in the muscles.
Do this throughout the shoulder muscles, but especially on tension knots.

, The muscles in the back and sides of the neck also carry a great deal of stress. You will use one hand to warm up the neck muscles for more focused attention.
/images/thumb/5/5c/Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-5-Version-7.jpg/v4-550px-Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-5-Version-7.jpg
/images/thumb/5/5c/Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-5-Version-7.jpg/v4-300px-Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-5-Version-7.jpg









Place your thumb on one side of the neck, and the tips of your other four fingers on the other side of the neck.
Apply and maintain firm but gentle pressure.
Glide you hand up and down the length of the neck.
Move along the width of the neck as well. Glide along the muscles along either sides of the spinal column on the back of the neck. Widen your hand to loosen the muscles on the sides of the neck as well.

, But, you need your other four fingers to stabilize the pressure you're applying with your thumb. Working with both hands at once would force you to wrap your other fingers around the front of the throat. This would cause your partner pain and discomfort. Instead, work with one hand at a time.

Stand behind and slightly to his right.
Place the thumb of your left hand on the right side of his neck.
Wrap your other four fingers around to the left side of his neck to stabilize your thumb's pressure.
Just as you did on the shoulders, knead your thumb in circular motions up and down the length of the neck.
Focus attention on any tension knots you encounter.
When you've finished the right side of your partner's neck, move to stand behind and slightly to the left of him. Repeat the process with your right thumb on the left side of the neck.

, It can be difficult to massage the sides of the neck without bothering your partner's throat. To do this, you will glide your hand in a downward motion from the top of the neck to the front of the shoulder. Begin on the left side of his body.
/images/thumb/e/ee/Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-7-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-7-Version-5.jpg

Place your left hand on his left shoulder to stabilize him.
With the fingers on your right hand facing downward, place your thumb on the back of the neck and your remaining fingers on the side of it.

, Because the spine is in the center of the back, it can be difficult to massage that area. Applying focused pressure to the spine will cause pain. Instead, use your palm to apply broad pressure.
/images/thumb/d/d5/Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-9-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-9-Version-5.jpg

Move so you're standing at your partner's side.
Place one hand on the front of their shoulder to stabilize him.
Place the heel of your palm between his shoulder blades.
Apply firm pressure in a long, deliberate stroke from one shoulder blade to the other.

, Although most of the massage focuses on the shoulders, neck, and upper back, a little attention to the upper chest can help relieve neck pain.
/images/thumb/0/02/Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-10-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-10-Version-5.jpg
/images/thumb/0/02/Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-10-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-10-Version-5.jpg









Standing at your partner's side, place on hand on their back to stabilize him.
Use your fingertips to rub firmly in circular motions just under his collar bone.
Make sure not to press on the bone itself, as this will cause pain.

, The arms may seem unrelated to the tension felt in the neck and shoulders, but they’re not. The muscles in the arms, shoulders, and neck all work closely in the movement of the arms. So, relieving tension in the upper arms will also benefit the neck.
/images/thumb/2/2f/Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-11-Version-7.jpg/v4-550px-Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-11-Version-7.jpg
/images/thumb/2/2f/Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-11-Version-7.jpg/v4-300px-Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-11-Version-7.jpg









Place your hands on his shoulders, applying gentle but firm pressure.
Maintaining that pressure, run your hands down from the shoulders to his upper arms, then back up. Repeat this a few times.
Rub up and down the upper arms, loosening those muscles.

, If you focus too long on one area with one massaging motion, your partner will grow acclimated to the sensation. Move from muscle group to muscle group and vary your hands' motions to make the experience more pleasurable for him. The less he can predict the sensations, the better the massage will feel.

The muscles in the shoulders, neck, back, and arms are closely related. By paying attention to a wide area of muscles instead of the few muscles that may hurt, you are more likely to ease his muscle pain.

, Many amateur massagers use their thumbs exclusively when giving massages. While the thumbs are excellent for focused pressure, you can cause pain and discomfort to yourself by over-using them. Instead, use all parts of your hand while giving a massage. Use your thumbs for focused pressure to tension knots.


Use your palms to apply light pressure over larger areas of skin and muscle.
Use your fingertips for firmer pressure.
Use your knuckles on particularly tight muscles.

, Applying pressure to bones — the spine especially — can cause pain. Apply pressure only to muscles.

, A massage does not have to be long to be effective. A quick five-minute massage can make a world of difference. But, a long massage of half an hour to an hour will make him feel pampered and cared for.

Ideally, you can find an elevated surface for him to lay on which allows you to stand or sit in a chair at his head. If he lays on the ground, you’ll have to bend over quite a bit, and this could hurt your back. .


Tie long hair back so it doesn’t hang in your partner's face.
If he has long hair, sweep it back and over the side of the table or bed so you don’t accidentally pull it during the massage.
Ask him to either remove their shirt or to wear a top that exposes his chest from the collarbone up.
You should provide a towel or blanket if he's uncomfortable with exposing his chest.

, You can sometimes find massage oils at department stores, but if not, they can be purchased online.


Some household oils, like coconut oil, also make wonderful massage oils.
Olive oil, almond oil, and sesame oil can work well, but they tend to be heavy and thick. Use smaller amounts of these oils for a massage.
Make sure your partner doesn't have any nut allergies before using almond or sesame oil.
Work the oil or lotion through your hands by rubbing them together. This warms the product up to make it more comfortable for him.

, Standing behind his head, place the heels of your palms against the sides of the neck. Use long, gentle Swedish strokes to apply pressure down the neck and over the shoulders./images/thumb/a/a4/Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-18-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-18-Version-6.jpg

Loosen the muscles further by pulling your fingers up and away from the table or mat. In doing so, his head head should almost be lifted from the surface.
Repeat this motion with your fingers all along the length of the neck.

, Lifting your index through pinky fingers in the air, place your thumbs on the sides of the neck, just below the ears. Applying firm pressure, glide your thumbs down the sides of the neck. Slide them over the the shoulders, all the way to the edges where they meet the arms.

Use the length of your thumb, not just the tip. This applies diffused pressure rather than focused pressure.
Stay away from the exposed front of the throat. Applying pressure there will cause a good deal of pain.

, The muscles in the front of the chest work in concert with those in the neck, so it’s important you give them some attention.
/images/thumb/8/8f/Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-21-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-21-Version-6.jpg

Place your thumbs lightly against the back of the shoulders.
Place your other four fingers along the front of the shoulders.
Apply kneading pressure both to the front of the shoulders and to the upper chest, under the collarbone.
Make sure not to apply pressure directly to the collarbone, or any bone. This can be very painful.

, Place your index, middle, and ring fingers under both sides of your partner's neck. Beginning up by the ears, apply pressure in a rolling motion away from the head, toward the shoulders.

Be firm, but not rough. Your motion might lift his shoulders a little bit off the surface, but he should not be flinching.

, Turn his head to the side to expose the side of his neck to you. Support his head by keeping one hand placed under it. When you’ve finished working one side of the neck, gently turn his head the other way and work the other side.

With your free hand, use your fingertips to apply long, firm strokes from the earlobe down to the chest.
Use your thumb to knead the side of the neck in small circles.

, Deep tissue techniques can cause pain, so you need to be alert to your partner's reactions while doing this. However, the muscles behind the ears can become very tense, so you must apply more intense pressure there to break up the knots. For this technique, the head should still be turned to the side, with one of your hands cradling it from below.
/images/thumb/e/e5/Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-24-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Give-a-Neck-Massage-Step-24-Version-6.jpg

Make a loose fist with your free hand and push the side of your fist into the side of the neck, just behind the ear.
Apply intense pressure and move your fist very slowly down the side of your neck. Work your way down to where the neck meets the chest.
The intense pressure can be very painful if you move your hand too quickly down the neck, so move at a glacial pace.
Be careful to watch for signs of pain. Deep tissue massage, while relaxing in the long run, can be uncomfortable in the moment.
Give him a break and have him take deep breaths if he feel pain. Begin again when he's ready.

, The muscles behind the ear, just below where your head meets your neck, tend to grow quite tense. Return your partner's head to an upright position for this technique, so you can work both sides of the neck at the same time.

Place your fingertips on those muscles and apply firm (but not painful) pressure.
Move your fingertips in a circular motion to break up the tension in that area.

, You'll feel a small dent right above the collarbone. Use your fingertips to gently massage the muscles in that area using both circular and kneading motions.

Wash your hands before cleaning your piercing.,
Use mainly the aftercare spray provided by your piercer.,
Treat crust with a sea salt solution.,
Keep soap away from your piercing.",How to Clean an Eyebrow Piercing1," Never attempt to clean a piercing without washing your hands first. Bacteria from your hands can easily rub off onto the piercing, so wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before beginning the cleaning process.Wash your hands with clean, running water and soap for 20 seconds. To keep track of time, hum the ""Happy Birthday"" song to yourself twice.Make sure to wash your hands completely. Do not forget to wash under your fingernails, between your fingers, and the backs of your hands.;
, Your piercer should provide you with an aftercare spray used to clean your piercing. For most sprays, you only need to mist them on your piercing three to six times a day. This minimizes the need to touch the area around your piercing, which can increase your risk for an infection.If your piercer did not provide you with an aftercare spray, buy one online or from another piercer in the area.
Use your spray as instructed on the bottle or by your piercer. If you have any questions about the spray, call your piercer.

, Crust sometimes builds up around an eyebrow piercing. This should be removed promptly to prevent infection. A simple sea salt solution is used to remove salt.Dissolve a quarter cup of sea salt in a cup of warm water. Then, soak a cotton ball in the solution.Place the cotton ball over your piercing. Hold it in place for two to three minutes. This should dissolve any crust built up around the piercing.

, Soap is not a good option to clean an eyebrow piercing. It can cause irritation, especially when a piercing is fresh. Stick to sea salt and the cleaner your piercing provided."

Warm the oil or cream.",How to Give a Foot Massage1," Begin with having them lay in the supine position, on their back with face up, then have him or her remove his or her shoes and socks. Over the course of the massage they will rotate onto their stomach to allow for different movements of the feet and ankles to take place.;
, This will help to prevent any cream or massage oil from staining the work area.








, Allow feet to soak in a tub of warm to hot water for up to ten minutes.









Add scented essential oils or foaming gel to the water if preferred.
Softly rub the feet after soaking to remove any dirt while helping the person to relax.
Towel dry feet when finished.

, Creams tend to be thicker than lotions and work well for foot massages. Oils work to soften the rough calluses on the bottom of feet.









You can purchase creams and oils that are created for the purpose of foot massages at many beauty supply stores.
Create your own unique combination of creams and oils to use for the foot massage. Combine scents to your liking; some favorite combinations are lemon and eucalyptus, lavender, or almond and vanilla.

, This will make it more comfortable for the person receiving the massage.

Keep soap and shampoo away from your piercing in the shower.,
Do not get moisturizers or makeup in the piercing.,
Keep the piercing clean while sleeping.",How to Clean an Eyebrow Piercing2," Be extra cautious during your regular shower routine. Minimize using soap and shampoo near your face. Getting these products in your eyebrow piercing can cause irritation.When shampooing your hair, it can help to tilt your head back while applying the shampoo. Leave your head tilted backwards throughout the entire shampooing process to keep shampoo away from your piercing.
It may be best to refrain from washing your face for a few days after getting your piercing.

, If you use makeup or facial moisturizers, do not apply them near the piercing. These products can irritate or contaminate a piercing. Makeup brushes also may contain bacteria, so applying makeup near your piercing poses a risk.Try taking a break from makeup for a few days after getting your eyebrow pierced.

, Keep all bedding clean, especially pillows, while the piercing is new. Change your sheets more often than normal as your piercing heals. For the most part, sleep on the opposite side of the piercing to prevent contamination."

Practice basic self care.,
Leave the jewelry in place for the first six months.,
Stay away from swimming pools.,
Avoid nicotine and alcohol.",How to Clean an Eyebrow Piercing3," The best way to keep your piercing from becoming infected is to build up your own immune system. A basic healthy lifestyle is the best offense to prevent an infection. Eat a healthy diet and get enough sleep while your piercing is healing. This will help your body fight off potential infections., Do not remove your piercing prematurely. This can cause an infection. Leave the piercing in place for the first six months before changing out your jewelry.In the event you notice an infection, do not remove the jewelry on your own. While this may seem like it makes sense, it can make an infection worse. Contact your piercer for guidance if you suspect an infection. If it's necessary to remove the piercing, they will do so for you.

, Do not go swimming in a pool or lake while the piercing is healing. Bodies of water contain a lot of bacteria. Your piercing will be extra susceptible to bacteria while it's healing. , Nicotine and alcohol lower your immune system. This lessens your body's natural ability to fight infections. While your piercing is healing, limit your use of alcohol and nicotine products."

Hold the bottom of the foot with both hands.,
Rub the heel of the foot.,
Use cross-fiber friction on the heels of the feet.,
Massage around the ankle bone.,
Use a fist to massage the arch of the foot.,
Massage the toes.",How to Give a Foot Massage2," Begin rubbing the top of the foot, slowly working your way down to the sole of the foot. Apply more pressure as you get closer to the sole. Reverse directions and rub the foot moving slowly towards the top, reducing pressure as you go.

, Use your thumbs for this, making small circles with medium to heavy pressure. Work your way around the entire heel. Repeat this action on the ball of the foot.







, This means you use your thumbs to push up and down on the heel. While one thumb is pushing up, the other should be pushing down.








, Use both hands to rub in a circular motion around the bone on either side, and gently rub your fingers over the top of the bone.








, With your hand closed in a fist, use the tops of your fingers to apply pressure to the arch. Roll your hand back and forth to knead the skin gently.







, Spend time on each individual toe.









Go to each toe and gently pull on it. This may cause the joint to pop, but unless it causes the person discomfort, continue to do this to each toe.
Slide your index finger in the gap between each toe. Spend time moving it back and forth, rubbing the base of each toe with your index and thumb if desired.
Gently slide all five fingers between each of the toes simultaneously, while rubbing a small amount of massage oil or cream between each one. "

Try petrissage on the achilles tendon and lower foot.,
Massage the long muscle of the foot.,
Perform ankle rotations.,
Give a foot massage using an electric massager.",How to Give a Foot Massage3," To do this, hold the foot in both hands and give ten short, strong pulls on one side and then the other. Imagine the pulling motion of milking a cow while doing this.








, Hold the side of the foot with both thumbs placed on the inside center of the arch. Move your hands back and forth as if you were wringing out a wet towel. Allow a lot of movement of the foot while applying this technique.








, Petrissage is a type of massage that involves lifting and squeezing muscles to stimulate them.









Starting at the back of the heel and ankle around the achilles tendon, use one hand to gently squeeze and pull the foot. Start softly, but apply more pressure and speed the longer you do it.
Push the muscles starting at the achilles tendon and working towards the toes. Doing this will lift the muscles of the foot, helping to work out impurities.
Slowly work your way up to the lower calf using this technique. The muscles here attach to those in the foot, and using petrissage in this area can help to further relax the foot.

, The long muscle begins near the achilles tendon and ends at the knee, and is closely tied to muscle movements in the foot.









Have your partner straighten their leg vertically, and use your forearm to apply pressure downward into the foot. Slowly move your arm so as to use your elbow to apply more pressure into the foot.
With your partner laying down, grab their foot with one hand at the heel, with the foot running up your forearm. Push their whole foot towards the knee, applying light pressure at first and slowly adding more.

, Hold the foot up, and use one hand to rotate the foot around the ankle. Move the foot in circles ten times in one direction, and then ten times in the opposite direction. The ankle joints may pop, but unless this causes the person any discomfort there is no need to stop. 







, Add the usual requirements (see manufacturer's instructions) and also put a little Epsom salts and spa oil in the foot massager's base. Leave feet in for 20 minutes. They should feel wonderfully rejuvenated; finish up with a friend or family member massaging your nicely cleaned feet.

Clear your schedule.,
Let everyone know you're not available.,
Turn your phone on emergency only.,
Take a moment to clear your head.,
Close the screens down.,
Skip the clocks.,
Choose some good music.,
Choose your main focus for the day.",How to Devote a Day to Relaxing and Pampering Yourself at Home1," Obviously, you don't want to have to run to the dentist during your relaxation day. Move any appointments you have that day. That way, the day is completely free for you to relax.;
, Take the day off from work if it's a week day, and create an ""Out of Office"" message for your email to let people know you'll be back tomorrow. Tell friends and family you won't be around much that day, unless you want to pamper yourself with some friends around, which can be fun, too.


How you take the day off is up to you. You may want to schedule it a couple of weeks in advance and use one of you paid vacation days. However, you can also take a sick day as a mental health day, if your boss is amenable to that idea., Many smartphones have an option to only let certain calls through (from your close friends and family) or to only let calls through from people who've called multiple times (like people do when it's an emergency). Try putting your phone on one of these settings so people can't get a hold of you unless they really need you.

, At the start of the day, you need to make sure you're in a good head space to relax. That means letting go of your worries. One way to de-stress is to take a moment to do some deep breathing.Try closing your eyes and focusing all your attention on your breathing. Breathe in slowly, counting to four before breathing out. As you breathe out, you should also count to four. Make sure you are breathing deeply, from your diaphragm. Keep your attention on your breathing until you feel your stress melting away.

, Of course, you may want to watch television or a movie on a relaxing day. However, try turning off your other technology, such as your laptop and tablet. When you're on technology, you have access to your email. If you can get on your email, you have the potential to stress yourself out. In addition, you will also be able to view things like the news, which may let stress intrude on your day. Try taking a break from the internet just for today., If possible, turn off or cover all your clocks. Spend your day away from a schedule. Just enjoy the day at leisure, doing what you want when you want.Don't hold yourself to a plan. If you decide ahead of time that you want to work in the garden but you really don't feel like it when the day rolls around, don't worry about it. Just do what your heart desires., It doesn't really matter what it is, as long as it puts you in a good mood. Let it play in the background while you're going about your day., Decide how you want to spend the majority of the day. You can have a spa day and pamper yourself through spa treatments. Alternatively, you can have a veg-out day, where you just watch your favorite movies and eat your favorite snacks. Just pick what you most feel like doing and what will relax you the most.

Set the scene.,
Lay a towel on the bed.,
Make sure the temperature in the room is comfortable.,
Choose the music you will play.,
Add candles for atmosphere.,
Choose a scented oil to rub and massage deep in to your partner's muscles.,
Prepare yourself.,
Use massage techniques that will ensure the romantic massage succeeds in relaxing your partner and helps to connect you both intimately.,
When you have finished your romantic massage, complete the night with a romantic bubble bath for two.,
Consider sitting on your partner's buttocks when massaging his or her back and neck areas.,
Relieve neck and shoulder stress.,
Linger over the vertebrae.,
Knead the buttocks.,
Be sure to massage the deeply erogenous inner thigh area.",How to Give a Romantic Massage," Ensure the room is clean, tidy and welcoming. Make the bed, shut the curtains if need be and remove any distractions such as electronic devices, piles of papers, or your phone.

, Alternatively, if you have a large floorspace, consider laying the towel on the floor. The surface chosen should be firm but comfortable.


Make sure it's not a shabby old towel; choose a bath sheet that is big, soft and fluffy. The feel must be perfect for comfort and for romance.
If you have colored towels, these may be even better than just plain white. Color choice will depend on the impression you're seeking to create and if you're seeking to make a matching theme, then colors are probably ideal.
Have additional towels or a cover ready to keep over your partner during the massage. Unless it is warm enough to leave your partner's body uncovered, a little cover for warmth on the parts of the body not being massaged is usually appreciated.

, You don't want either of you to be shivering in the cold and wishing the massage was over! You want your massage partner to be super comfortable and deeply relaxed; and the same goes for you too!

, Select music that feels sexy and soothing when you listen to it. The music will be a large part of setting the mood for romance, so avoid anything too jarring, loud or energetic. Set up the music in an out-of-way corner and have it gently playing throughout the massage.


Ensure that there is enough music that you won't have to get up and change it during the massage.

, A romantic massage is never complete without a room filled with candles. Strategically place as many candles as possible in the room to create a seductive glow. Choose coloured or scented candles for maximum effect.


Tea light candles make a good choice as they're in a container and you have less worries about the wax dripping.
You may prefer to use scentless candles and have an electric oil burner on as well as the candles.
Always be in attendance when candles are alight. Also, think ahead to where you and your partner may tread, sit, roll, or whatever and keep candles away from anywhere that you might potentially end up.
If you don't like candles, you can even hang fairy lights in the room to give the same luminous effect.

,


Choose a massage oil that reflects the energy or atmosphere you'd like to create. Read up on the different oil fragrances and properties to learn more about their effects. Always have more than enough massage oil; the more you have, the more sensual the massage experience.
Most essential oils must be diluted in a ""carrier oil"" before placing on skin. Suitable oils include sweet almond oil, olive oil, warmed coconut oil, rose hip oil, grapeseed oil, avocado oil, jojoba oil, etc.
Never pour massage oil straight onto the person's body; it will cause a cold shock. Pour it into your hands first, relying on your own body heat to warm it up.
Oils often used for romantic massages include:Lavender oil – for relaxation
Ylang ylang oil – a purported aphrodisiac
Patchouli oil – earthy, musky, helps focus
Jasmine oil – another purported aphrodisiac
Sandalwood oil – for improved libido
Cardamom oil – increases intimacy
Juniper oil – promotes self-assurance
Ginger oil – spicy and hot, just like your romance
Rose oil – for romance.



, Ensure that your fingernails are short and remove all jewelry prior to the massage. Wear comfortable clothing and if your hair is long, tie it back out of the way. Wash your hands both before and after the massage. Also, take care to warm your hands before applying them on your partner's body.


As the masseur, be completely relaxed prior to giving the massage. It requires your full attention, focus and care; a tense masseur or masseuse is not going to promote a romantic feel! Take some deep breathes and sit down and relax to clear your mind before starting.
Whoever is receiving the massage should avoid having a heavy meal 2 hours prior to the romantic massage; it's also best to avoid alcohol 6 hours prior to and after the massage.It's often a good idea to try massage techniques on yourself before trying them on your partner. That way you'll know how the technique feels, if it's comfortable or not and you can make suitable adjustments when massaging your partner.
Bear in mind your own posture during the massage. It won't stay romantic if you're crippled up in pain from poor posture or an uncomfortable position.
If you plan on both of you being naked for the massage, ensure that the room is warm enough, or you risk the romantic sparks dissembling into a fit of shivering.

, While you can––and should––read up on different massage techniques, don't be held back by trying to perfect them. It is more useful to trust in the natural, healing and comforting power of your hands and follow your intuition about what feels best than to be hung up on using the exact right strokes.


Begin by warming the oil in your hands, then spreading it over the skin area to be massaged using smooth strokes to spread the oil for a few minutes before massaging. This is both sensuous and important for creating a suitable massage surface, so don't skip over it.
Use long languid strokes to work knots and to help relax the muscles. Imagine yourself getting the movements to flow together. Avoid heavy downward pressure on bony areas or organs, namely the spine, ribs, knees, elbows, abdomen or kidneys.
Decide where you will begin. This is basically up to you and your partner but a traditional approach is to begin with the back, buttocks and back of the legs, then work on the feet, front of the legs and progress up the body. Finish with the face and head.
Always completely finish one area of the body before moving on to the next.
Try not to talk. Keeping it quiet is part of the relaxing, sensuous atmosphere you're aiming to create.

, What you do after this is entirely up to you both!


Note that some people prefer the bath before the massage. Or, you might like to have one before and after––whatever floats your boat!

, This increases the intimacy, especially if you're both naked (but that's totally optional).


Use your knees on the bed to avoid placing too much weight on your partner.;
, Highly sensitive to tension, the shoulders and neck tend to knot up quickly. It can be a great place to start a romantic massage so that your partner's tension is eased from the outset, allowing him or her to really enjoy the remainder of the massage experience. Be careful as to how much pressure you apply in this area; use gentle circular motions with your thumbs and only slowly increase pressure.


Small karate chops can help to release pressure around the shoulder blade area. However, only do this if your partner doesn't mind; for some it's too painful on their sensitive skin.

, The spine is a wonderfully sensuous area and you can heighten the sense of relaxation by slowly working up the spine, starting with large sweeps up from the buttocks first, then pressing each vertebrae with your thumbs.

, There is plenty of flesh here and touching attention can be both relaxing and intimate. Use your palms to knead the flesh––this is one area where you don't need to be so concerned about a light touch because the flesh will buffer any kneading pressure.


The sacrum, the little part just above the buttocks, is very sensitive. Don't neglect it, just be very gentle.

, Be gentle as this area is quite sensitive.

Take a bath.,
Apply a face mask.,
Try a hot oil hair treatment.,
Make a sugar scrub.,
Try a foot treatment.,
Paint your nails.",How to Devote a Day to Relaxing and Pampering Yourself at Home2," The warm water will help relax your muscles, as you let your cares drift away. You can even add a bath bomb or two to help pamper your skin while you're soaking.Try lighting some candles in your bathroom to create a soothing ambiance., A face mask can be relaxing in and of itself, but it will also make your skin feel nice. The easiest solution is to use a store-bought version. However, you can also make a simple face mask at home with a few ingredients. Mash up a couple of strawberries. Add a dollop of both honey and plain yogurt. Mix the ingredients together, and apply it to your face. Wash it off after 15 minutes.For store-bought versions, follow the directions on the bottle for how long you should leave it on.

, This treatment can relax you just because it feels soothing on your head. In addition, it will also help moisturize and rejuvenate your hair. Afterwards, your hair will be silkier and shinier.To create a hot oil treatment, simply pour a little olive oil in a small bowl, a couple of tablespoons or so. Add a dollop of coconut oil and a tablespoon or two of honey. Heat it up in the microwave for about 15 seconds, but don't let it overheat. Mix the ingredients together.Use a pastry brush to apply the mixture to your hair from roots to tips. Tuck your hair into a shower cap, or wrap it in plastic wrap. Leave it on for several hours, if possible, then wash it out.You don't need all three ingredients if you don't have them. You can just use one of the oils (without honey) if that's all you have.

, Sugar scrubs are easy to make with ingredients you have on hand. You use these scrubs to exfoliate your skin, sloughing off dry, dead skin cells. To make sugar scrub, just mix one part oil (such as coconut oil or olive oil) with two parts brown sugar (white will do in a pinch). You can also add in a scent with essential oils or even just a dash or two of cinnamon from your cupboard.If you use coconut oil, heat it in the microwave for a minute or two to help it melt before adding the sugar.
To use the scrub, simply rub it into your skin with your hands and then wash it off.

, Get a thick foot cream. Wet a towel, making sure to shake or wring out excess water. Microwave it for about 60 seconds. Once it's done, apply the cream to your feet, and wrap up your feet in the towel. Leave it on for about 15 minutes., Of course, one of the best things about going to the spa is ending up with pretty nails, which you can do at home. Just take some time at the end of the day to paint your nails and toenails. Don't forget to add a base coat and a top coat for a longer-lasting effect."

Get some tasty snacks.,
Have a glass of wine.,
Try a cozy beverage.,
Pick some movies or television shows to watch.,
Curl up with a good book.",How to Devote a Day to Relaxing and Pampering Yourself at Home3," One of the keys to a veg-out day is to have some of your favorite snacks on hand. Pick whatever you like, from chips and dips to ice cream. If you prefer, try ordering a pizza.

, Most people associate having a drink with relaxing, and certainly having a drink or two isn't going to hurt. Open up a bottle of your favorite chardonnay, and enjoy a glass or two if you'd like.Don't overdo it, though. You don't want to ruin the effects of a relaxing day by having a hangover the next morning.

, If you don't drink, don't worry. Try coffee, tea, or hot chocolate instead of the alcohol. It can be just as comforting, especially if you treat yourself to something you don't normally drink., One good way to relax at home is to have a marathon of your favorite movies or television shows. Make sure you have them available before you start your day. You can try streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Hulu.Don't be afraid to pull out a sad movie. Sometimes, having a good cry over a movie can help you deal with the reality of what's going on in your life., If movies aren't your thing, get yourself a new book that you know you'll love. Curl up with it all day under a warm blanket.You don't need to buy a book. Borrow one from a friend, or check one out from the library. In fact, you can check out digital books from most libraries if you have an e-reader.

Take some time on your pampering day to enjoy doing a hobby you love. Not only will it make you happier, it can help you de-stress from the week., If you love yoga, take a few minutes during your day to do some stretching. It will help you relax and feel rejuvenated., Spend some time in your backyard. Sunlight can help reset your body's schedule, helping you feel more relaxed the rest of the week. Plus, just being outside in nature can help you relax., Flowers can help you relax and feel pampered, but you don't have to wait for someone to send them to you. Set up some to be delivered on your pampering day.For a cheaper method, pick some up at a grocery store the day before.

, Most cities have delivery services now that deliver food from even high-end places. Look at services available in your city, such as GrubHub or Postmates, to see what restaurants they deliver from. Pick one of your favorites to pamper yourself., Let's face it, sometimes you just don't get to spend enough time with your family, and pampering yourself can mean focusing solely on being with the ones you love. If that's the case, break out the family games, movies, and coloring books, and enjoy some time at home with your family.

, Maybe instead of your whole family, you want to spend time with just your significant other. If that's true for you, try taking a bath together, reading to each other, or just curling up on the couch together to watch a movie.

Be assertive.,
Keep your secrets to yourself.,
Make efforts to be low-key.,
Do not put complete trust in friends.,
Understand and value security.,
Listen to your gut.,
Put your safety first, even when you're out having fun.,
Don't randomly accept transportation.,
Don't let other people hurt your feelings.,
Be smart about sex.",How to Emotionally and Physically Protect Yourself," Communicate your personal boundaries in a clear, courteous and consistent manner. Then, follow through with them and take measures to ensure that you are respected and safe. Don't give in to any manipulation, or let others bend your values. Stand your ground, defend yourself and others against bullying and mistreatment and simply don't let others walk all over you! Assertiveness involves reminding others when they are manipulating you, saying no without feeling guilty about it and staying true to who you are, even when others aren't of the same opinion. You need to have faith in your abilities and take it all in stride, even when you have the urge to break down and give in.;
, Betrayal and disloyalty are increasingly common in the modern world. Follow the three-out-of-seven rule. If you have seven secrets, let's say, only tell three of them to your best friends. If you would not want everyone to know about something, do not say it to anyone at all. People change very quickly, and the very person who seemed like your loyal, trustworthy best friend last night could suddenly turn into a ruthless gossip and manipulator the next morning.

, Be reserved and discreet, and observe your environment constantly. Be low-key, because the less people know of your ambitions, passions and secrets, the less they will be able to hinder you or target you. If you tell everyone your life plan and difficulties in the home, they can and will be used against you. You can't control anyone else's words or actions, so it is better not to give them a chance to act or speak in a detrimental way in the first place.

, When you're in school, the social group that you're with will probably change. Don't completely cut yourself off from your closest friends, but be careful. If you have a friend that you hang out with sometimes, but aren't really close with, don't tell her or him anything that you wouldn't want the whole school knowing. If you have a friend that likes to talk behind their other friend's backs, keep in mind that she can be talking about you behind your own back, too. Once you run out of things to provide, those who were formerly close to you may take up manipulative behaviours and bully you.

, Do not leave personal or valuable objects lying around, even for a single instant. People can and will steal, violate your privacy, and read or use what they find. If you use makeup and don't want the whole school to know, or if you didn't finish your homework, or if your favourite soccer cleats are in there, don't leave your bag lying around. Whatever it is that you value or need, or want to hide and conceal, do it completely. Keep a lock on your locker and, if necessary, your bags.

, When with others, observe and listen to your conscience. Uphold your values, even if it means missing out on some ""fun"" activities. Don't smoke, drink or engage in sexual activity. Even if you feel pressured, do 'not take drugs. If you feel like something is not the right thing to do, it definitely isn't. If you listen to your values and gut feeling and evaluate the consequences of your actions, all will be fine.

, If you're at a party, don't accept a drink from someone else. Don't leave your drink unattended. Someone could slip something into it and you would never know (the 'date rape' drug is completely tasteless). If you're going to drink, please don't do it at parties. If you get drunk enough, you're leaving yourself very vulnerable to all kinds of things. If you don't think you can gracefully say no to a drink if offered, just carry a cup with water in it. Being cool does not mean being reckless. Recklessness is a sign of weakness and immaturity--don't get stuck in that awful behavioural pattern! Drinking water, watching out and not taking dangerous risks is cooler and more virtuous than getting drunk and smoking.

, This goes for girls and guys. Just don't do it. Even if you know them from school or somewhere else, it's just not safe. If you leave with somebody, your chances of survival are greatly diminished. Say no kindly and firmly, resist if necessary and get away if you are pursued.

, Just because they call you ugly or stupid or anything else does not make it true. Chances are, they're probably just one those people who get pleasure out of being mean and meaningless.

, If you have had sex and regret it, don't feel guilty. Don't be afraid to talk to a parent or another adult you love and can be open with! This is always a good idea.

Keep out of harm's way.,
Understand the difference between cover and concealment.,
Take cover immediately.,
Keep panic at bay and keep thinking clearly.,
Decide to move or not to move based on what you feel the danger is to you.,
If you move, you have three methods that you can vary between as you judge necessary:


A) If you think the shooter is really far away and not targeting you, just run as far away from the gunfire as you can.,
Keep reassessing.",How to Evade Gunfire," The most obvious method of evading gunfire is to avoid places such as war zones and bad neighborhoods where guns are used. But as the world is a place of wonders and terrors, we'll assume you might not, and that the reader is a civilian who just wants to escape.;
, Cover is an obstruction or area that blocks bullets, e.g. cars, large buildings, and ditches. Concealment is something that blocks the shooter's view but not bullets, e.g. bushes, large signs, and smoke.

, Upon indication of gunfire -- either hearing it, seeing the shooter, or noticing bullets coming your way -- drop anything you're carrying and sprint for the nearest cover or concealment. Don't bother trying to figure out where the gunfire is coming from unless it's the only cover and concealment and the shooter may be occupying it. The nearest cover may be something lame like a wet gutter or a fire hydrant, but don't pause for your dignity -- it's your life. If there's absolutely no cover at all within a 2 to 3 seconds sprint from where you are, drop to the ground and crawl to it.

, Once behind cover or concealment, breathe deeply, think ""I will live,"" and assess the situation. Keep your head down. But if you have to expose your head to look, try to look around the side of your cover or concealment instead of over it if it allows, e.g. if you're hiding behind a car, peek around the bumper and not over the hood or roof. If peeking around a building, do so at ankle- to knee-height. Where is the gunfire coming from? Are they single shots or machine gun fire? Are there bullets coming so near you it look likes you are being targeted? Are you injured? Where is the next available cover or concealment the farthest from the shooter? Your next action will be based on what you assess.

, Generally if you're hurt, you feel the gunfire is far away and not specifically targeting you, and the cover is ideal, you should stay. But even if you do stay, the situation may change, so stay aware and prepare to move. Ditch any heavy items you're carrying and ladies should abandon their high heels. Removing any bright clothing may help if time permits.

, Use this also if you're stuck in a place where there is no other cover for hundreds of meters. Dodge and weave to upset the shooter's aim.
B) If you think the gunfire is intense but not necessarily close or targeting you specifically, crawl on your belly to the nearest cover or concealment. If there are slight rises in the ground or street curbs, use them along your route. Provided you're sure the shooter won't run up on you, it may be worthwhile to use them even if they don't go directly to safety.
C) The 2 to 3 second rush. This is for if you're really close to the shooter and feel he's either shooting at you or will as you make your move. Determine a route to safety that includes as much cover and concealment on the way. Use it by sprinting in brief rushes that last 2 to 3 seconds at a time from one hiding place to the next. The average marksman can only sight on a target within 3 to 4 seconds. So, ideally, using this technique, you'll be behind the next cover or concealment before he pulls the trigger. Try to stay low and dodge and weave if you miscalculate the distance. It isn't perfect, but it is a proven infantry technique.

, Each time you find new cover and concealment, ensure you reassess the situation. Your enemy is a human being and really may be out to get just you.

Get behind your opponent and bring him to the ground.,
Wrap your legs around him, to where your insteps are roughly on the inside of his thighs or knees (this is commonly known as ""getting your hooks in"", the legs/feet being the hooks).,
Releasing the seat belt, loop one arm around your opponent's neck: this will typically be the top-most arm in the seat-belt position, just for convenience, but it doesn't really matter.,
Using your main-hand, grab the bicep of the other arm.,
Making sure to keep the figure-four grip intact, place your unoccupied off-hand against the back of your opponent's neck, to where it's roughly aligned with the arm that's looped around his neck.,
Squeeze.",How to Do a Sleeper Choke Hold," The rear naked choke, as the name implies, requires that you are behind your opponent. While the hold can be performed from the standing position, it is advisable to bring your opponent to the ground for maximum control.;
, Simultaneously, reach one arm over his neck and toward the center of his chest, while reaching your other arm in from under his arm. Clasp your hands together in a tight grip over his chest. This is commonly known as the seat belt, and will ensure that you stay on your opponent's back even if he starts trying to buck you off.

, Try to get your elbow aligned with his chin, so that his throat is basically caught in the crook of your elbow. For clarity, the arm looped around your opponent's neck will henceforth be referred to as your ""main-hand"", whereas your unoccupied arm is your ""off-hand"".

, Usually, this will result in your hand gripping the crook of your elbow, which is perfectly fine, as long as you maintain the grip. The grip is often called a ""figure-four"", due to the way your arms form the number four when performing it, and this can serve as a guide-line if you're unsure how you should be gripping.

, For reasons that will be discussed below, it is advisable that you make a fist with this hand, as it will not be grabbing anything for the remainder of the hold.

, More specifically, flex the choking arm as much as you can muster, while pushing your off-hand into his neck from behind. If done right, this will cut off the blood flow to his brain, resulting in unconsciousness in approximately five seconds. To reiterate, this move is NOT supposed to put pressure on your opponent's throat or trachea.

, Explain what you will be doing, and tell them to notify you of any discomfort or pain. Stand behind, placing your hands lightly on their shoulders as you both take several deep breaths.

, Begin easing away fatigue and tensions with an upper back, shoulders, arms, and neck massage. Squeeze the trapezius muscle (at the base of the neck) gently, starting close to the neck. Work your way outward to the shoulder. Repeat this three times, allowing the pressure to increase with each pass.








, Bring your hands back up next to the neck with the thumbs extended, and make small circles with the thumbs on either side of the backbone just below the collar line.








, Place your forearms at the sides of the neck and roll them outwards toward the shoulder by rotating at the wrists. After rotating, lift your forearms and move them a couple of inches away from the neck and repeat. When you reach the shoulder, come back to center and repeat this process two more times.

, Bring one hand to the volunteer's forehead for stability as you place the heel of the other hand in contact with back of the head. Begin rubbing the scalp by moving your rear hand vigorously back and forth. Continue rubbing as much of the scalp as you can reach, and then switch hands and repeat on the other side.








, Continue this for about a minute.








, Let the final strokes draw their head back slightly and then lay the fingers over the forehead and draw the fingers down and along the brow line to each temple, making small circles over the temples. Repeat this process three times.








, With smooth strokes beginning at the forehead, slowly work your way to the back of the head. Do this for about a minute, allowing the pressure to become lighter towards the end, until finally your hands float off the head.

Create distance between yourself and the attacker, if possible.If it turns out that you must face a knife-wielding attacker one-on-one, start by backing away.,
Use an object as a shield.If you want to disarm an opponent or attacker, you will have to do so at the right moment.,
Keep your body perpendicular to the attacker.Try not to stand directly in front of the attacker; this makes you more vulnerable to attacks.,
Block and redirect attacks.If the attacker lunges at you before you are able to get the knife, step to the side out of his/her way.,
Deflect the attacker’s arm if he or she strikes.If the attacker lunges at you and you are not able to get out of the way, grab the attacker’s arm as he/she moves toward you.,
Stop an underhand knife attack.If the attacker lunges at you using an upward motion, use the blade of your hand to chop into the attacker's hand.,
Throw the attacker from the ground.If the attacker lunges toward you with the knife, back away and pretend to fall down so that you are still facing the attacker.,
Focus on controlling the weapon.Do not try to attack the attacker.,
Get ahold of the attacker’s limb with both hands.When you are ready to remove the knife from the attacker’s hand, grab his/her arm as quickly as you can.,
Injure the attacker’s hand.Slam the attacker’s hand against a hard surface as quickly as you can.,
Keep the knife away.,
Use a weapon if necessary and possible.If the attacker still attempts to harm you after you disarm him/her, and you cannot get away, try to use a non-deadly weapon (not the knife) to defend yourself.,
Incapacitate the attacker.If you do not have any object at hand to help you, try and injure or immobilize the attacker using your own body.,
Run, hide, fight.When faced with an attacker, remember RHF: run, hide, fight.,
Stay as calm as possible.,
Move away.,
Call 911 as soon as possible.As soon as it is safe to do so (the attacker leaves, or you are able to get away), call 911 or another emergency number for assistance.",How to Disarm Someone With a Knife," Try to put as much distance as possible between yourself and the attacker. Experts recommend seven yards as a distance that will keep you safe from a knife attack., While you are waiting, you can protect yourself by using an object as a shield. Try to find a hard, rigid object such as a board or trash can lid, but any object (even a coat, blanket, etc.) can help. Hold the object in front of you to protect yourself against sudden attacks.


A shield will help keep your vulnerable areas protected. Remember that your most vulnerable areas are at your core (chest, abdomen), so keep those protected above all., Instead, remain to the side of the attacker if at all possible. That way, you will have a chance to see if the attacker turns to lunge toward you, and have slightly more time to react.

, The attacker may then turn around to face you again. Be prepared and move to the side of the attacker, so that you can avoid direct stabs in your direction.

, Use both of your hands to grab on, if possible. Yank the attacker’s arm and use the attacker’s momentum to throw him/her to the ground, making sure to keep the knife pointed away from you.

, Do this forcefully, and it will push the attacker’s arm backward. Use your hands to push and hold the attacker's arm back so that the knife stays away from you. Slam the attacker’s arm into a hard surface or apply pressure until the knife falls from his/her hand.

, Prop yourself up on your forearms, keep your left foot raised, and wait for the attacker to approach. When the attacker is within reach of your feet, put your left foot against his/her heel. Slam your right leg against the back of the attacker's knee as hard as you can, pushing the attacker away. If you do this correctly, your attacker will fall face first, with the knife aimed away from you.

, Remember that your primary goal is to keep yourself safe. If you are not able to get away from the attacker, then this means eliminating the source of danger: the knife.

, Use both of your hands if possible. Try to stabilize the attacker’s arm (hold it in place). This will be difficult since the attacker will probably try to get out of your grip, so you must hold on as firmly as you can.

, You can even try to break the attacker’s wrist or hand if necessary.If you cannot slam the attacker’s hand against anything, focus on applying as much pressure as you can to his/her arm until it is injured. If this goes well, the attacker's on the knife will loosen, and the weapon will fall away.

, Once the attacker is disarmed, make sure that the knife is far out of his/her reach. Kick, push, or fling the knife as far as you can so that the attacker cannot reach it.


Once the attacker is disarmed, try to flee to safety.

, You could:


Throw sand, rocks, or other small objects at the attacker. Hot coffee or ice water can even do the trick.
Hit the attacker with whatever object is at hand: a stick, chair, book, etc. You can even use a coat like a whip to strike the attacker.

, For instance:


Headbutt the attacker in his/her abdomen.
Strike the attacker in the face, especially the eye, nose, or temple.
Kick the attacker in the knees or groin.

, Your first tactic should be to run away, if you can get away without harming yourself. If you cannot escape the area, try to hide in a secure location, such as a room that can be locked, or behind a cover of some kind. You should fight back against the attacker only as a last resort.

, If you are faced with an attacker wielding a knife, you must work very hard to stay calm. This will be very difficult, because it is an extremely stressful situation. Not panicking, however, can save your life. It will help if you have the steps of a basic plan in mind:Stay calm
Quietly signal for help, if possible
Maintain eye contact
Stall for time
Keep talking to the attacker
Follow any instructions the attacker gives
Do not risk harm to yourself or others if at all possible
Do not try to grab the knife itself

, If becomes necessary to fight back and try to disarm the attacker (such as in the event that the attacker is attempting to stab you), then do so. However, if it is at all possible at any point during the confrontation, move away from the attacker.You can begin by trying to back away from the attacker. When you are several yards away, you can attempt to flee.
If the attacker becomes distracted or moves away from you, use the opportunity to run away as fast as you can until you are in a safe location.
Do not run in a straight line; instead, move in a zig-zag or more erratic motion. This will confuse the attacker, helping you to escape., Provide as detailed a description of the attacker as you can, and explain what is happening/what happened.

Be aware that your goal in a situation like this is to save your life.,
Grab their arm at the wrist.,
Grab the gun directly from the hand.,
Disarm a gun pointed at your back.,
Control the weapon.",How to Disarm a Criminal with a Handgun1," Fighting back greatly increases your odds of losing your life.


If you have not been trained by the military, the police or endured extensive martial arts training specifically in the area of disarming an opponent, the safest option when faced with a handgun is to do whatever the person says, with the exception of entering a vehicle with the attacker. You are gambling with your life in this situation, it is not the movies, and in almost all cases, your attacker will have more experience in this kind of situation than you do.
Be aware that the most common mistake made by potential victims in cases like these is over confidence. Over confidence leads to the vast majority of deaths. The second most common mistake is fighting back. However, there are times when you may calculate that you need to do so. For example, let's say you're caught up in a school shooting where it's obvious the attacker's goal is simply to kill as many people as possible.;
, If you've decided that you need to disarm the criminal because it's likely you will be shot otherwise, spin the gun away from you. This technique is very dangerous. Do not attempt it if you are not properly trained, unless absolutely necessary.


The goal is to make sure the gun is pointed away from your body as you grab it, and spin it away.Continue the energy you’ve created by twisting the arm with the gun around you to the right as you face away from where the criminal was originally positioned. Now, flip the gunman on the ground as you spin to the right while holding the gunman’s arm.
Keep your hand on the attacking arm, and take the gun. You can also step over the gunman and hold his arm with your leg.

, Twist the gun down, breaking the criminal’s finger as you do it. Remember, the criminal’s finger will be in the trigger.


Twist the gun to the right. All of these maneuvers are dangerous if the criminal is stronger than you and also risk the gun firing and striking other people in the area.
Take the gun from the criminal's wounded hand. Use the right hand to stop the wrist as you use the left hand to bend their wrist, grab the gun, and push the gun down. This is very important. If you don’t grab their wrist before twisting the gun down, you will risk them maintaining control of the gun.

, Turn around, and step in and under their arm, and rip the gun out of the criminal’s hand.


You could do either of the first two steps next; either, you will want to twist the gun in the criminal’s hand, breaking his finger. Or just rip the gun out of their hand. Move the left hand on the side of the attacker’s gun and at the same time move your body to the attacker’s right side.Before you do this, wave your hands as if surrendering and saying don’t shoot. After moving your left hand to the side of the attacker’s gun, take a right counter-clockwise circular step in between the attacker’s feet while turning the gun toward the attacker.
Your wrist should lock the attacker’s right hand, and turn the gun at the attacker’s throat, bringing the attacker to the ground. In each of these moves, the goal is to reposition the gun before twisting it from the gunman's hand.

, You must take control of the weapon so the gunman cannot redirect it at you. This will unfold fast, and the gunman will try to regain control. Burst in forward. Put your weight inward and downward on the gun. You are trying to get the weapon down and inward to limit the ability of the attacker to move it. Move your feet to keep putting weight on the weapon no matter how the criminal reacts. You will want to use your hip muscles and body weight to torque an opponent’s wrist to take them down. In one move, put enormous pressure on the attacker’s wrist, forcing them down to the ground while placing strong control of the weapon. You can kick the criminal to the head, midsection or groin to remove the weapon.Or reach over the attacker’s shoulder and clench the rifle’s butt stock. Insert your right hand with the thumb pointed toward the ground to grasp the weapon’s stock. Yank the weapon toward you to weaken the attacker’s leverage and yank it shortly up. Wrench the weapon away.

Give the attacker what they want.,
Redirect the line of fire.,
Run away.,
Telegraph your intentions.,
Distract the criminal.",How to Disarm a Criminal with a Handgun2," It’s arguably the least dangerous if you just comply with the gunman’s demands if his or her demands, such as robbery, don’t threaten your life.


For example, if a mugger wants your car, your wallet, or your purse, let them have it. It’s not worth risking your life over.Try throwing the object (purse, car keys) behind them; they will go for the object and you can escape.
There have been situations where the person gives the attacker what they want, and the person is shot anyway. There is no surefire technique for a fast-flowing, dangerous situation like this.

, The best approach to defending yourself is to first eliminate the most immediate threat to you. If a gun is pointed at you, that’s clearly an immediate danger to you.You need to remove yourself from the line of fire. You can do this by redirecting the line of fire or moving yourself. Make your first movement small and undetectable. If you make a major move to twist or step out of the line of fire, you could actually trigger the attacker to fire the weapon.
Redirect with the hand. Use your hand to redirect the line of fire so that it travels across fewer vital areas. Move the weapon laterally across the shortest line possible. If the gun is pointed at your chest, move it to the left or right. You could also push the gun upward.

, This is one possibility, although it can be a very dangerous one because the gunman might shoot you.


If you try this technique, throw something – your wallet for example – in one direction while you run in another direction in order to distract the attacker. Run in a zigzag or other unpredictable pattern.Again, this is a very dangerous move. Then again, everything about the situation is dangerous. Simply complying with the demands might be the best bet. If the person hasn't seen you yet, such as in an active shooter situation, first run, then hide (by barricading yourself behind a door), then fight if you are found.

, Until or unless you are ready to make your move, make it clear to the gunman what you are about to do before you do it.


For example, say something like, “I’m going to reach into my pocket so I can get my wallet out to give it to you now” before you do it.
Study the gunman as you do this. Find something about him or her that is unique and will help police identify the gunman later.

, Let’s say you’re facing a determined attacker you know is there to kill you. This means the attacker’s motive isn’t robbery – it’s to kill, such as what was seen at past school shootings.


If possible, run away. Get out of the building or area.
If running becomes impossible, hide. Barricade yourself behind a door with your phone on silent. Make sure the door is well barricaded before you call emergency services.
If the attacker finds you, fight. Improvise weapons: chairs, laptops, textbooks, et cetera to throw at them or hit them with. This is best done in a group, but also works alone.The goal is to take down the shooter no matter what.
Band together with others before you do this. Grab the gunman’s weapon and twist it quickly away from your body. Keep gripping the gun as the gunman pulls it back away from you, and push your weight forward, then punch him in the face or throat very hard. Use your hand to grab the non-shooting end of the gun. Knee the killer in the groin. Or twist your hands like you are revving up a motorcycle engine, breaking the gunman’s finger inside the trigger guard.

"
"
Raise your hands, and act scared and passive.,
Get arm’s length from the gun.,
Take steps back once you have the gun.,
Remain calm.,
Avoid getting in dangerous situations.",How to Disarm a Criminal with a Handgun3," Maybe the attacker won’t harm you if you don’t challenge them. If you plan to disarm the attacker, you will also want to act passive and deferential at first to throw them off too.


Ideally, all you need to do is comply, and you will not have to attempt anything risky.
Act cooperative and as passive as possible. Say something like, “Hey, don’t worry, I don’t want any trouble. What do you want?” Give the attacker the impression you are not a threat
Raise your arms higher than the handgun, and don’t keep them still. Wave them side-to- side in a repetitive way to lull the attacker’s peripheral vision and hide the defensive movement you are about to make by moving your hands forward.

, In one swift movement, move your head first and grab a hold of the gun. Turn the gun away from your body. Turn the gunman’s wrist in. Distract the gunman with a punch, kick, or both.
Reach under the weapon, placing your free hand on the hammer and being aware of where the barrel is pointed at all times. Keep both hands on the gun as you kick, stomp or knee the gunman. With both hands firmly on the gun, and the gunman’s wrist twisted, rip the gun away. Now you have the gun.

, The best case scenario once you have the gun is for you to get away without having to fire it.


Flee with the gun. If the gunman keeps coming at you, you may have no choice, but inspect the gun with your hands by tapping the bottom of the magazine to be sure it’s in.
Scream, make noise, and try to draw attention. Hopefully, the gunman will run away. Again, the goal is to not have to fire the gun. Learn the self-defense laws. You are entitled to defend yourself in many cases if you are in immediate danger of death or great bodily harm., You do not want to show panic because this might make the person with the gun panic, and that is very dangerous.


You want to retain psychological advantage. Make eye contact with the gunman. This will force him or her to see you as a human being and might make it harder to shoot you. Do not make this an intimidating or challenging gaze, however.
Calculate the context. Why is the person pulling a gun on you? If the motive is robbery, then the motive of the gunman may not be to kill you. If you’re being targeted in a mass shooting where the motive of the gunman is to kill as many people as possible, this is a very different scenario. If you’re not sure if the motive is to kill you, you can hope that the gunman spares your life without your needing to get the gun.

, There are ways you can reduce the chances you will need to use self-defense in the first place.


Avoid walking on foot alone, especially if it’s night, if you’re female, and if you’re impaired. Criminals look for moments of vulnerability. If you’re drunk and walking down the street, they might see you as a target. Don’t flash money or expensive jewelry around.
Be aware of your surroundings. Don’t walk with your head down or distracting yourself by talking on a cell phone. Be aware of what’s going on around you at all times. Wear shoes that would allow you to run.
You could consider getting a concealed-carry permit if this is lawful in your state and you are properly trained. Ask for a security escort at your college or apartment building or work, if one is available. Carry mace or pepper spray if this is legal where you live.

Take honest stock of your strengths.,
Note your weaknesses and find ways to cover them.,
Spar regularly.,
Watch other fighters for inspiration, but not to copycat.,
Tape yourself fighting.,
Study other disciplines to become a well-rounded fighter.,
Let your style evolve organically instead of forcing yourself to fight a certain way.",How to Discover Your Fighting Style1," Whether you're a boxer or a mixed martial artist (MMA), the first step to developing a style is figuring out what you're working with. Your physical traits might help you naturally fall into a fighting style, or make training for a certain discipline more natural. The best fighters develop their own style, one that accounts for their own bodies instead of copying someone else.


Long, wiry bodies have great reach, allowing them to pepper opponents from a distance.
Short, muscular bodies have to get in close, and focus on landing hard, powerful hits.
Is your natural inclination to use your feet and knees? Keep your blocks high and practice getting as much range out of kicks as possible.
Can you run for days without getting tired? Then keep your feet moving and tire your opponent out, moving in for the KO when she/he starts to become tired.;
, No fighter is perfect. But the best fighters take the time to find their weaknesses and prevent their opponent from using them against them. Bruce Lee, for example, is quick, powerful, and intelligent. But he was never tall. He knew fully well that a long-limbed opponent would try and keep him at a distance so that Bruce could never land a hit. His answer -- develop the sort of blazing speed and counter-attacks that let him close in on his opponents quickly.Do you struggle to dictate a fight and be aggressive? Then work on your counterattacks and blocks, forcing aggressive fighters to over-extend and make a mistake.
Are you big and bulky, but slow? Get in close with grapples and grabs, negating your opponent's speed, or sit back and block small jabs while you aim for 1-2 big hits.

, The best way to determine your fighting style is to fight. There is really no other way to determine what will work for you and what strategies fall flat. That said, there are a right and a wrong way to spar if you want to get better:


Warm up at half-speed. No one will get hurt, and you can start to feel what moves are fluid and easy to pull off.
Fight a variety of people. Note how you need to change up your style or strategy slightly against other people's styles. What can you learn from them?
Have a trainer or third person watching to give advice and feedback -- you can't see everything., Remember -- the best fighting style is completely unique to you, and trying to copy another's style will just lead to defeat. That said you can, and should, borrow techniques you like from other fighters, incorporating the work of the masters into your own personal style. When possible, watch fighters in other disciplines as well -- what can you learn about boxing footwork, for example, by watching talented MMA fighters?


Watch fighters with similar builds and body types as you -- you'll be more likely to replicate their moves and strategy., Watching yourself fight is the best way to note your own mistakes and pick up new techniques. When you rewatch the fight, break down the footage into smaller parts. Watch once to pay attention to footwork, once to punches and offense, and once to watch your opponent's strategy. When you see a mistake or a missed opportunity, hit pause and think about what you can do better next time.

, Style, in many ways, is about adapting. How do you counter or react to a situation in a fight? What is your natural inclination when attacked? What are your opponents? The more you know the more you'll discover about your style. Thought of another way -- if you are a natural bruiser (lots of big, hard hits), but always train to be a counter-attacker, you'll never be able to unlock your natural fighting style. Expose yourself to a wide range of fights, fighters, and styles and pick what works for you.A boxer can learn a lot from Muay Tai, and an MMA fighter can learn a lot from Judo. All of these disciplines are related and give you the competitive edge over your opponents.
If you're lost, peruse the list of popular fighting disciplines below to find potential new styles.

, A fighter's style is actually pretty easy to define. It is simply how a fighter maximizes their own strengths and weaknesses. There is no one style that is better than another, just like no one fighter is like any other fighter. As such, the best way to get better is to keep studying, keep practicing, and keep fighting. You'll quickly learn what works for you when you win. And you'll definitely learn what doesn't work when you lose. There is no right style, there is only your style.


Don't worry about ""one style."" You'll be easy to predict and beat. But if you can switch it up on your opponent with something unique you'll be much more powerful.

Take a free class to see what you enjoy.,
Hire a trainer to point out weaknesses and improve strengths.,
Focus on technique above all else, no matter what your style.,
Focus on full-body workouts to be a better all-around fighter.,
Work on what feels natural, not what looks cool, to discover style.",How to Discover Your Fighting Style2," Many martial arts studios and other athletic facilities will offer one free class, which is an excellent way to determine if a style feels right to you. The best styles, especially for beginners, are simply those that feel the most natural to perform., Sometimes all you need to discover your style is another set of eyes. A trainer, who has seen and worked with many styles, is invaluable if you plan on pushing your fighting further than a casual hobby.


A good trainer is one you feel comfortable with, but who still pushes you to improve and work harder.
If you're intimidated about working one-on-one, join a gym in your chosen discipline (boxing, MMA, karate, etc.). The group setting is a great place to start working with less pressure.

, The technique is the art of getting the most speed and power out of your body with the least effort. It requires hours of slower, concentrated practice punching, kicking, and dodging so that the motion is completely natural when you need it in a fight. Though sparring is crucial to develop a style, technical exercises are needed to make your style sing. Try out:


Speed-bag drills
Punching bag workouts
Shadow-boxing (acting out a fight, in full speed, by yourself).
Target practice (when a coach or friend holds up pads to hit).

, The type of workout will obviously change depending on the fighting discipline. However, fighting is always a full body sport. A strong physical base is needed to build your style upon; you'll never discover your style if you're too tired or weak to fight effectively. No matter how you're fighting, the following exercises are a great place to start:


3-4 days a week of cardio (running, biking, swimming, etc.)
Daily push-ups, pull-ups, and crunches.

Daily stretching for flexibility (Yoga and aerobics are good options)
Plyometrics and jump rope for agility
Interval training for strength and explosiveness.

, Your style should feel fluid and easy. This isn't to say that you shouldn't practice difficult moves. It means that your body knows itself best. If you struggle every day to get a long, high kick to land, then you're not necessarily a long-range kicker. But if you can hit a speed bag all day and dance in the ring for hours, then you've found a road worth traveling down.If you keep practicing, you'll find ways to make things natural. Remember that, in a fight, you only have a split-second to react. You will, of course, react with what your body finds easiest. Train that instinct to be the best it can be.

, Many fighters consider mixed martial arts a fluid, ideal discipline to start with. As its name suggests, MMA is a combination of different styles and disciplines. Variations of judo, jiu-jitsu, and Muay Thai are fighting styles often employed in MMA, but you don’t have to stick to just one of these styles. A combination can be effective, and your opponent’s mode of attack might dictate your own method of defense.


MMA is one of America's fastest growing sports, and can be found at local gyms and clubs in most cities and towns., If you're heavy and stocky, study judo, a widespread style, and Olympic sport. Judo is known for its throws and takedowns of opponents. Judo technique can be very effective at neutralizing an opponent and gaining the upper hand.

, This is a great option for stockier or smaller fighters, but all can benefit. Jiu-jitsu is very popular in MMA today and is often employed in a ground or defensive fighting. Some form of grappling or wrestling should be incorporated into any self-defense regimen, and jiu-jitsu can provide the fundamental framework.

, Muay Thai looks similar to kickboxing and, at times, jiu-jitsu, but it is different from both. Muay Thai primarily focuses on strikes from fists, elbows, knees, and feet, and it involves a type of grappling known as the clinch that is meant to set up these strikes., Krav Maga, Hebrew for “contact combat,” is currently very popular, particularly in military and self-defense training. The primary purpose of Krav Maga is to defend oneself and end a confrontation quickly and definitively. Its focus is on swift counterattacks, and it accounts heavily for defense against weapons., Ninjutsu is the feudal Japanese guerrilla fighting style of the ninja or shinobi.In Ninjutsu, you’ll study pressure points and surprising moves, while training for fitness and agility. Historically, Ninjutsu training is secretive, and teachings vary by instructor.


Ninjutsu is a very complex, nuanced fighting form that takes decades to learn. That said, the basics of it will benefit any fighter., The basics of boxing can come in handy in almost any fighting situation. Boxing teaches speed, striking with accuracy, dodging punches, footwork, and how to read your opponent’s punches. These are all valuable skills. Plus, boxing is good for a cardiovascular workout and to build core strength, upper body strength, and stamina.

, If you’re quick and fast, consider Kung Fu. Kung Fu is also a good way to stay fit in general or for training in any other type of fighting style. Kung Fu training involves both “Iron Body” and “Light Body” conditioning. The former is meant to strengthen the body into a weapon. The latter, much like Parkour, teaches speed and agility through exercises like running up walls., Taekwondo is known for its discipline, self-control, and conditioning. It uses isometric and dynamic tension exercises to tone and to put strength in muscles.Training in taekwondo helps hone reflexes and coordination as well as self-esteem.

Escape the fight.",How to Defend Yourself in a Fight," If the other party is riled up and looking for violence, words might not do any good, but it's usually a good idea to try. Physical fights can very likely end people in the ER, so avoiding them at all costs is advisable. Try to determine why the other person is angry, and see if you can talk them down.Some people may be motivated not by anger but by something else, like a mugger whose motivation is money. Trying to talk them out of the attack would be a bad idea that could cause even more trouble. In such a situation, giving up your money without defending yourself is the wisest choice to avoid harm.
Physical fights very often start as a verbal fight, an argument. If you sense that a confrontation you're in might escalate to physical violence, try to quell the argument. First, lower your voice and end the shouting match. Say things like ""I don't want to fight,"" and ""I understand why you're upset"" to make it very clear that you're not interested in escalating the conflict. Once the other person has calmed down some, start talking it over by conceding the points of the argument that they are right about, and what, if anything, you did wrong.;
, It might wound your pride to run away from a fight, but a wounded pride is better than a wounded body, especially when a wounded body can have serious long-term repercussions. If you tried talking it out, and that didn't work, try getting away. Don't turn your back and run, as this leaves you vulnerable. Just slowly back away, while watching for any sudden moves.If your assailant is a mugger, give him your money. Chances are he has a knife or some other kind of weapon, and the money in your wallet is not more valuable than your life.

, Most fights with no good reason behind them start because of a combination of intoxication and miscommunication. Don't let your ego get in way of apologizing, even for something you didn't do. And keep your voice low and calm when you try to reason with the other party. This will avoid an escalation of shouting that leads to fists being thrown., If you cannot avoid a fight, then get prepared. Be aware of your surroundings. If there's something near you that you can use as a weapon, make note of it. Look out for friends your assailant has that look like they're ready to join the fight., Just before you are about to fight, point one knee left or right and the other straight. Bend your knees until you are level with the fighter's eyes. Make fists and raise them so that they protect your face. Keep your elbows near your body., As soon as the other person enters your personal space or touches you, shove him/her back with a firm push and shout ""back off!"" This lets the assailant know you're not an easy target, and that you are prepared to defend yourself. It also signals to anyone around that you need help., A punch is easier to dodge or block if you see the arm moving back first, so keep your attention on the assailant's fists. If they have a knife, that should be the focus of your attention., You should always try to keep your back away from an assailant. But if someone is behind you and tries to grab you, sit down. Try to get your whole body to the floor with as much force as you can. This will make it difficult for your attacker to hold you or lift you. If the attacker tries to choke you from behind, shove your elbow behind you into his/her collarbone as hard as you can., While ideally you should avoid getting hit as much as possible, it's likely that your attacker will land a few punches. Knowing how to absorb a punch effectively can save you from a lot of pain and injury.If the attacker punches your head, move your head towards the punch. This sounds counter-intuitive, but this may cause the punch to miss its target, which was probably your nose or eye. You want to clench your jaw and tighten your neck, and try to absorb the punch with your forehead. The forehead is strong, so a punch there will cause you the least damage and hurt the other's hand the most.
If the attacker punches your body, tighten your stomach. Don't suck in your stomach though. Try to twist your torso so that the punch lands on your obliques, rather than the middle of your stomach.

, There are effective movements you can do to escape some of the common holds that could arise during a fight. Four holds and grips you want to know how to escape are: the wrist hold, the choke hold, the bear hug, and the mount position.Wrist hold: If someone's got you by the wrist, squat down and then push your elbow towards the attacker until they can no longer hold on to your wrist.
Choke hold: If someone's got an arm around your neck from behind, step to the side towards their choking arm and move your torso and head down until their arm can no longer maintain the hold.
Bear hug: If someone is holding you from behind around your waist, drop your self down toward the ground and try to hit them in the stomach with your elbows or pry at their finger with your hands.
Mount position: If someone has knocked you to the floor and is sitting on top of you, grab his/her left arm with both of your hands, your left hand around his/her elbow, your right hand around his/her wrist. Then use your leg to wrap your left foot around his/her left foot, and push your pelvis up and back to do a roll, out of the hold.

, Real fights don't last long. It may take nothing more than a few quick hits for the fight to end, and it can happen in seconds. For this reason, it's important to be as efficient as possible with your movements. Don't waste energy or time jumping around or trying to fake your opponent out. Just defend against their attacks, and make your own when there's an opening., The goal is to end the conflict as soon as possible, and that can be done by attacking the sensitive parts of the body to disable them.These areas include:


Face: The eyes, nose, and ears are all sensitive and can easily be hurt enough to disable an attacker. Clapping your hands around someone's ears will stun them. A hard punch to the nose or finger in the eye can bring someone to their knees.
Throat: A strike to the throat can stop someone in their tracks.
Groin: A hit to the groin can cause a lot of pain and incapacitate someone long enough for you to escape.
Knees: A hard kick to the knee can stop someone who's chasing you or bring someone down.
Stomach: You can knock the wind out of someone with a hit the stomach.

, Being loud while in a confrontation will do two things: One, it will create intimidation. The more intimated your opponent is, the more likely he is to back off. Two, it will draw the attention of others, who can potentially help you get out of the situation.

, The fastest way to end a fight is to quickly incapacitate your assailant with a swift hit to a vulnerable body part, then get away. You don't need to knock the other person out, and the longer you stick around, the higher chance you have of being seriously injured, so it's best to just escape the situation as soon as possible."

Silence is golden.,
Don't look smug.,
Look for logic.,
Defend by offending.,
Know when to walk away.,
Master gesticulation.,
Probe for weakness.,
Manipulate perception.",How to Defend Yourself With Words," When in an argument or debate, whoever is the most belligerent will look quite foolish. Don't let this be you;if someone is getting very loud, talking over you, screaming, seething or what have you, simply stay quiet and wait your turn. Most people will, during the course of speaking, come to natural stopping points. These stopping points are usually rhetorical questions,clincher statements, heavy pauses or segues.;
, In fact, try not to express any emotions, as this will let them know too much about your internal state, leaving you vulnerable. Smugness, however, is your worst enemy. Seeming smug is very infuriating to others and will make you look like an asshole, weakening your defense in most any situation. A smug demeanor is the number one trait of someone that people would call, "" a tool"", or, ""a douche"".

, Analyze the other persons' argument/tirade/remark. Did they just say something that you can flip around to embarrass them? Did they say something you can easily disprove with close at hand facts? Undermining their logic or turning it on them will make them look profoundly foolish, giving you the win. A classic example of this is found in the film ""Happy Gilmore"" : ""Shooter McGavin: You're in big trouble though, pal. I eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast!Happy Gilmore: You eat pieces of shit for breakfast?Shooter McGavin: No!"" and an example of disproving: ""Happy Gilmore: That's right, I'm gonna beat your ass on the course!Shooter McGavin: Yeah, right. And Grizzly Adams had a beard.Lee Trevino: Grizzly Adams *did* have a beard. ""

, Insulting a person is perhaps the greatest power you can have over them, they'll have a lingering hurt. Think about how you feel when people insult you, yes you can make them feel that! Watch plenty of stand-up comedians, particularly videos where they're being heckled. Usually, the comic will have a little insult prepackaged, ready to hand out to a heckler, making the comedian seem like a wise guy, and a winner. Also, a nice, smart Alec insult can shut down an exchange very quickly, which brings us to the next step...

, Even if you've thoroughly trounced the other person with a cutting remark, you'll lose the exchange if you stick around for them to fire back. Fire torpedoes, then walk away. You'll look like a boss in front of anyone present and deny your opponent the satisfaction of revenge. Plus, walking away can help keep things verbal and avoid a fistfight.

, The right gestures are unspeakably crucial in any verbal exchange. If you walk up on an exchange between two people, even before you can hear them, you can immediately tell who has the upper hand by their gestures and postures. To project strength, superiority, invulnerability and poise, stand up straight, lean up against something, cross your arms, and raise an eyebrow.Then, only uncross the arms to gesture with your hands to emphasize jokes, wise cracks or points of logic. To project honesty and concern, lean forward slightly, bring your open hands out, and elbows in, this is often referred to as throwing your hands up. NEVER PACE! Standing still makes you look calm, cool and collected. Pacing makes you look desperate and Inelegant.

, The more you know the person, the better. Search for those little insecurities your opponent has, and exploit them. Call big people ""stretch"", call bald people ""Mr. Clean"" or ""cue ball"". Punctuating your sentences with these will be off putting to the other person, and their anger will make them look foolish. If you have a hard time coming up with something, use the dependable all purpose belittling titles: Chief, Pal, or Tough Guy.

, Make sure that no matter how the conversation goes, you always come out as the correct one. Twist their words, your previous words, and the stream of logic to always prove yourself right.

Do a physical search of the premises.,
Listen as you walk the entire room quietly.",How to Detect Hidden Cameras and Microphones1," This involves a slow, meticulous sweep of the room or building you suspect is wired.


Look around for anything that seems different or out of place, such as flower arrangements, pictures on the wall out of level or in unusual areas, or lampshades that don't look normal. Check for smoke detectors you didn't add, look for a speaker that might have a camera in it.
Look inside flower pots, light fixtures, and other places where a microphone transmitter can easily be hidden.
Look under couch cushions, table tops, and shelves. Underneath shelves and table tops are excellent places for miniature cameras.
Look for wires that do not seem to go anywhere, such as an appliance or other familiar device. ""Hardwired"" (that is, not wireless) spy equipment is less common with modern technology, but is still used for permanent surveillance in commercial businesses for loss prevention.;

Begin from a closed guard.,
Initiate a sweep.,
Take hold of your opponent’s arm.,
Free your hips.,
Twist the opponent’s wrist toward their head.",How to Do a Kimura Submission in Jiu Jitsu1," Your opponent will be in your guard, meaning you’ll be on your back with you legs wrapped around their waist. Push your hips forward while keeping your torso straight to restrict their movement. From the guard, you’ll have access to both arms, which will leave them vulnerable to an unexpected submission.The kimura is an excellent defensive submission that can be secured just as easily from the bottom as from the top.Make sure you’re on the lookout for submission attempts yourself while searching for an opening.;
, Sit up quickly and scoot your hips back. This will fool your opponent into thinking you’re going to try to throw them off balance. They’ll instinctively plant their arms to brace themselves, allowing you to capitalize.If your sweep attempt works, you’ll have successfully escaped from the guard and can begin scrambling for a stronger position.

, As you sit up, begin reaching your dominant hand up and over your opponent’s opposite shoulder. Meanwhile, clutch their wrist with your hand on the same side. Wind your top hand around the back of their arm, then grab the wrist of your bottom hand.When targeting your opponent’s right arm, you’ll grab their right wrist with your left hand. To apply the submission to their left arm, grab their left wrist with your right hand.Try not to give away your intentions by reaching for an arm too early. Once your opponent knows what to look for, you’ll have a much harder time setting up the submission.

, Now that you’ve got control of your opponent’s arm, uncross your legs and slide your hips to the side. You’ll need to create some space to get into a better position to torque the arm. Keeping the arm tight to your chest, scissor your legs around your opponent’s waist once again to hold them in place.Make sure you turn to the same side that the opponent’s arm is on.
Proper hip distance and placement is key to pulling off a kimura from the guard., Push your bottom hand (the one holding their wrist) forward to rotate the opponent’s arm. Doing this will put pressure on the shoulder joint. If you’re in a solid enough position, the opponent will have no choice but to tap out.Don’t wrench or tug at the arm. The rotation of the shoulder should be done in one smooth motion.

Turn off the lights and look around for tiny red or green LED lights.,
While the lights are off, grab a flashlight and carefully examine all mirrors.,
Search for pinhole cameras in the dark.",How to Detect Hidden Cameras and Microphones2," Some microphones have ""power on"" indicator lights, and if the person who sets it up is careless they may fail to cover or deactivate this feature.

, These can be made transparent from one side so that a camera can see through, but they rely on the observer's side being darker than the area observed in order to keep the other side of the mirror reflective.

, A pinhole camera might have a charge-coupled device (CCD) sitting behind a tiny opening in a wall or object. Get an empty toilet paper tube and a flashlight. Put the tube over one eye like a telescope and close your other eye. As you sweep the flashlight over the room, pay attention to any small glimmers that reflect back at you.

Buy an RF signal detector or other bug detector.,
Use your cell phone to pick up an electromagnetic field.",How to Detect Hidden Cameras and Microphones3," If you seriously believe you are being spied on, buy an RF (radio frequency) detector and do a sweep of your room, building, or home. These portable devices are small, simple to use, and fairly inexpensive. However, there are bugs that use multiple frequencies in rapid sequence called ""spread spectrum"" that an RF detector will not pick up. These bugs are used by professionals and require a spectrum analyzer and an experienced technician to find.

, Place a call on your cell phone, then wave the device around where you think there might be a camera or microphone. If you can hear a clicking noise on the call, it means your phone might be interfering with an electromagnetic field.

Start in side control.,
Grab your opponent’s arm.,
Lock on the kimura.,
Pull the opponent’s elbow up toward the ceiling.",How to Do a Kimura Submission in Jiu Jitsu2," In side control, you’ll be lying across your opponent, keeping your body weight pressing down on them. Clamp your knees against your opponent’s side to restrict their movement. From there, reach around their opposite shoulder and clasp your hands together. This will prevent them from squirming out.Since you’ll already be controlling your opponent’s arm to maintain side control, you’ll be in a perfect position to secure a kimura.
Be prepared to adjust your technique depending on which side you’re controlling—grip your opponent’s right wrist with your left hand and vice versa.

, In dominant side control with your opponent on their back, securing an arm will be as simple as reaching down and grabbing it with your bottom hand. If they’re attempting to escape, you’ll have to first flatten them out. You can do this by angling your legs toward their head and driving your weight forward until both of their shoulders are on the mat.If your opponent is braced and pushing against your chest, quickly take hold of their wrist before you flatten them out. This will make it easier to complete the submission once they’re on their back.Be careful not to let your opponent slip out or turn over onto their knees while you’re setting up the leg drive.

, Now that you’re controlling your opponent’s wrist, snake your top hand around the back of their upper arm and grip your own wrist. To put yourself in a stronger controlling position, step over the opponent’s head with your nearest leg, drop your weight and turn so that you’re facing their feet.Twisting the wrist so that the palm is facing upward will take away your opponent’s leverage.
Keep your knees pulled in tight. Otherwise, your opponent may turn inward, neutralizing the submission., Hugging the arm tight to your chest, use the forearm of your top hand to lift straight up on the elbow. You should pull with the full strength of both arms, not just your top hand. Imagine that you’re trying to pinch your shoulder blades together.The submission will work best if there’s a little bend in the arm. If it’s completely straight, you’ll have apply much more rotational force in order to tap the opponent out.

Assume the full mount.,
Slide forward to extend your opponent’s arms.,
Trap your opponent’s arm.,
Twist to apply pressure to the shoulder.",How to Do a Kimura Submission in Jiu Jitsu3," Work your way into a mount position, straddling your opponent with both legs. You weight should be centered over your hips to keep them from being able to sweep you or otherwise free themselves. Sliding your knees up into their armpits will also help make your mount more stable.The mount is a less common position to apply the kimura from than the guard or side control, but it can be a useful variation to learn nonetheless.
In addition to the kimura, a full mount will set you up to perform a variety of submissions, including the americana, guillotine choke or arm triangle., The higher up on your opponent’s body you are, the more they’ll be forced to reach to defend. If you can catch hold of one of their arms while they’re struggling for an escape or reversal, you’ll be able to score a kimura without altering your position.Lean your upper body forward and pull your knees up toward your shoulders, keeping your center of gravity low.If the opponent has their arms around your midsection to defend against strikes or submissions. you can break their grip by taking a step forward on one knee and pushing down on their head with your free hand.

, While maintaining your base squarely over your opponent’s chest, use your elbow to pin their arm to your side. Then, turn your upper body slightly to take hold of their wrist with your same side hand. Loop your opposite hand around the back of their arm and clutch your own wrist in the familiar kimura technique.Be careful not to lose top control while turning to grab their wrist.

, Keeping the arm tight to your chest, crank the opponent’s wrist in the direction of their head. Because of your superior positioning, it won’t take much force to make them submit.Unlike other positions, finishing the kimura from the mount is more about rotating your shoulders than pulling with your arms.
Step over and hook your opponent’s head with your opposite leg to gain even more leverage."

Stay alert and prepare yourself.,
When the aggressor attacks, deliver a proportional response.,
Try to disarm your attacker so that you have the opportunity to escape.,
Always remain in the defensive position.,
If you can't escape, protect yourself as best as you can.,
If it escalates, create a weapon.,
As soon as you can, escape and seek help.,
Seek medical attention if needed.",How to Defend Yourself if Attacked," Try to estimate their aggression levels and the possible ability of fighting. It is easier than people think to understand an opponent just by observing their aggression responses.;
, Try to talk down the fight. If you see that they are slowly calming down, say what you need to to get them to walk away. Even if you believe you have done nothing wrong, it's still better to avoid a physical altercation.


If you ever have a chance to flee and escape the attack, do it. You can do this by throwing a wallet, watch or whatever the attacker wants in the opposite direction so you can escape.

, If aggression levels remain high, you should begin preparing yourself for a strike. Keep yourself centered. Bring your body closer together and tight so that you are smaller. This will make it harder to fight you and will give you more control when you need to defend yourself. Remember that keeping your body compact will prevent you from flailing and will make it easier to keep your balance during strikes.



Know the defensive position. Put your non-dominate leg in front and pointing outward. Bring down your body so that your center of gravity is low. With your front fist closed and blocking your face, keep your balance until you are ready to pivot your body.

Know how to kick. In your starting defensive position, bring your back leg and shoulder forward, turning your body 180 degrees. With the momentum your body created, lift your back leg up and then straighten your knee to deliver the blow.

Know how to punch. In your starting defensive position, bring your back fist and shoulder forward, turning your body 180 degrees. Your back shoulder should pass your front one, and your whole body will follow. Using this momentum your body created, deliver a closed fist punch to your attacker.

, If you are hit, make sure that you are hitting back enough to defend yourself and to deliver a blow without being overly aggressive. If for some reason, the police become involved, you can be arrested for assault even if you didn't instigate, if you were striking not in self-defense.

, Usually, it's best to go for the most vulnerable body parts on your attacker. This will depend on your height (if you are short, attacking his/her eyes might be difficult) or size (if you are small, you maybe not have enough force to attack his/her stomach) and your attacker's height and size.



Eyes: Blind your attacker by gauging out his/her eyes by thrusting your fingers into his/her eyes.

Throat: Knock the wind out of your opponent by hitting him/her in the throat with your fist (See: know how to punch, above).

Ears: Quickly clasp your hands over both of your attacker's ears at the same time, this will cause a ringing in his/her ears.

Groin: If your attacker is a male, kick or punch his groin. He will likely fall to the ground, giving you a chance to escape.

Solar plexus: This will cause your attacker to fall over if done with enough force. Either kick or punch (See: know how to punch and know how to kick, above) your attacker in the solar plexus (stomach/abs).

Nose: Punch your opponent in the face with your fist (See: know how to punch, above) to cause they to focus their attention on their face.

, Don't give your attacker the chance to grab your arm or catch you off balance. As soon as you hit him/her return to the ""defensive position."" To get into that position, put one hand in front of your cheek and one in front of your temple (left or right depending on your stance). You must do this because if you are hit hard in your cheek or temple, you will pass out.

, This means to cover your vulnerable body parts. Always cover your face. If you are on the ground, roll into a ball and cover your head.

, If, and only if, the situation becomes too difficult to handle, look for a weapon on your person. Keys, purse, belts, etc. are not ideal, but they could be the difference between a couple of stitches and a serious stay in the hospital.

, Never try to ""finish"" a fight. If you see an out, take it and seek help. This is going to help if charges get pressed. Immediately explain what is going on to someone who can help: 911 dispatch, the nearest police officer or a good Samaritan. Have them call the police and immediately write up a report or have them take a statement of what happened.

, Depending on how severe your condition, do this first. Hospitals often have the staff to deal with threats and attackers if they try to continue the fight.

Walk backwards.",How to Defend Yourself if Caught from Behind," Or a complete stranger grabbing the wrong person.;
,, If someone grabs you from behind, then just drop all your weight. It will force them to drop you and be that much harder to carry your full weight.

, Usually when someone grabs you from behind they're going to have at least one of their hands in front of you. With one hand grab their index and their middle finger and with your other grab the ring and the pinkie finger. Pull very hard in opposite directions. This is very painful to your attacker and should give you a chance to get away.

, This defense you can use if you're grabbed from behind or if for some reason your attacker decides to grabs you where you're facing them. If from behind - put your hands on their head and drag your fingernails down until you find their ears. Grab on to the ears and pull down in a fast motion. Doing it too slow can give them a chance to realize what is happening. But if done fast enough and with enough strength, you should be able to damage their ear. And if you are very strong (As to where you're actually superman) you could even rip it off.

, This one only works if your attacker is coming at you or grabs you to where you're facing them. Your hand shouldn't be in a fist, but uncurled and straight. Make sure every bone in your hand is straight. It won't work right if any of your bones are bent. With your hand 'jab' them straight in the middle of their throat. This should close their wind pipe for a few seconds; leaving them gasping for air and giving you a chance to get away.

, As a last effort, try walking backwards. Both your attacker and you will fall backwards; giving you a chance to escape.

Remember that you are strong and capable., If you can find a pattern, try to fight back, but use the pattern to help you advance. Paying close attention to the way they move can help you to predict their next move, and can give you an advantage in the fight. Stay alert!, Dodge their punches to make yourself look like an expert fighter. If they do make contact, a kick to their shins, groin, or stomach could prevent another strike from occurring. Hitting them with a powerful elbow to the ribs can also end the fight.Guard your face, as your head is the most sensitive part of you. Bend your arms and hold them in front of your face. Keep your hands clenched into fists so that you can be ready to punch if necessary.

, Punch with your fist held straight, and keep your wrist sturdy or else your wrist could break. Don't put your thumb inside your fist, or it'll break, too. If you're anticipating a possible fight, practice fighting beforehand. Watch videos on YouTube or pick up boxing to polish your skills., However, if the fight is happening on school grounds, you should let go almost instantly. In any case, let them go quickly so that they don't pass out and pin the blame on you. After letting go of them, try to make sure they fall to the ground and pin them down when they do."

Avoid insulting them.,
Run away if you are outnumbered.,
Avoid specific people who wish to cause you harm.,
Refrain from causing permanent damage.",How to Defend Yourself During a Fight at School2," Do not say anything to egg them on (including threats, racist words, or sarcastic comments). This could escalate the fight, and your goal is to end the fight altogether. If their friends are there, they could end up using your words against you. Or, if the fight persists, the opponent could end up winning and then those words would come back to haunt you., If their friends or allies join the fight and you are outnumbered, try to run and defend yourself while sprinting off. Keep careful watch on the body language of everyone there, so that you can be ready to react with fast reflexes. Dodge any objects that they may try to throw at you. Call for help if needed., Certain people are just plain cruel, and avoiding them altogether could be the best plan. Steer clear of areas where a bully usually hangs out, and instead find a new route to get where you need to go. You are not cowardly for wanting to avoid confrontation and maintain peace in your life., Do not get carried away in the fight, and never try to cause permanent physical harm to another person. Do not aim for their face, for instance. Do not use objects to fight; simply use your hands to defend yourself. Once you have protected yourself from harm, retreat from the fight.You can certainly use objects as a shield, such as holding up a book to block blows. However, you will lose the respect of your peers if you use such objects against your opponent and the odds become uneven and unfair.

Talk to a counselor.,
Ask a friend for assistance.,
Travel in groups or with a friend.,
Talk to parents, a coach, or a mentor.",How to Defend Yourself During a Fight at School3," If you are in an altercation, reaching out to an authority figure can keep you out of trouble.

You can reveal as much or as little as you choose. Overall, your counselor will just want to make sure that you are safe., There is no shame in asking your peers for help if you are in trouble. Call a friend that you trust. A friend can also have your back if you need them during the fight. Come up with a signal word between the two of you so that your friend will know right away if you're in trouble., If you are anticipating a fight and hope to avoid it, walk around with a large group of people or with a trustworthy friend. If you outnumber the bully or if there is a large audience, he or she will feel less emboldened to threaten or intimidate you., Trusted adults can give you helpful advice on how to handle a bully or how to evade a fight.

Consider your design.,
For a large design, such as a portrait or a character, choose areas of skin that are easy for your artist to access without making you contort yourself.,
For very small, simple designs, you may prefer a more whimsical placement.,
Some designs wrap around a limb, such as the tribal band, or the string of rosary beads.",How to Choose Tattoo Placement1," What kind of artwork will you be putting on your skin? Size and detail are usually the first considerations of your placement. Is this a small, or a large tattoo? Does it have a lot of fine details such as swirls or shading that won't be visible if the art has to be scaled down?;
, The back is a favored canvas because of its broad, gentle curves. To a lesser extent, the thigh, the stomach, upper arms, or the back of the calf are also good choices for very large designs.

, A small tattoo may lose impact if you choose a broad, empty area of skin, but an unexpected word or doodle offers an almost ""treasure hunt"" appeal to your body. You may try behind the ear, around a finger, or behind the joint of your ankle. Some artists have even started offering tattoos on the forward helix (this is the curved outside rim of your ear, from the very top down and forward to your tragus, which is the little tab of cartilage over the ear canal), the inside of the lip, and even on the tongue!

, For the obvious reasons, it behooves you to choose an area that will allow the artist to complete the design evenly, such as the upper forearm, around the bicep, or just above the ankle (rather than directly on the boney, tender ankle itself).

"
"
Think about how public you'd like the tattoo to be.,
Some tattoos can be sort of ""semi-private"", by choosing an area that may or may not be naturally covered by clothing during daily activities.,
The ""peek a boo"" placement is a fun way to flirt with a public tattoo.,
You may want a strictly private tattoo for various reasons.",How to Choose Tattoo Placement2," Some placements that are obviously hard to cover, such as a neck tattoo, may affect your future career prospects (sad, but true), especially if the design is particularly provocative or sensitive. The placement of your tattoo may convey certain stereotypes; an example being the ""tramp stamp"" of the lower back, which some may interpret as being an indication of low morals and immaturity. Many people favor these very public tattoos as a clear statement of themselves and their beliefs, but others may view them as tasteless and limiting. Choose wisely for yourself!

, For instance, a simple tattoo on the back, over the trapezius muscles (the muscles on either side of your spine connecting your neck to your shoulders) can be easily covered with a collared shirt, or scarf when desiring a more conservative look. However, it is just as easy to reveal this tattoo by wearing a shirt with a wider neckline, or sleeveless articles of clothing. Some other options are the upper arms, the legs, the back, the lower midriff, or the feet.

, These tattoos are placed in areas that are commonly not very visible to the casual observer, but may reveal themselves as you move. These areas include behind the ear, the inside of the lip, the tongue, the webs and inside faces of the four fingers, behind the ankle joint, over the hip bone, the collarbone, pectorals/breasts (usually the upper areas), the nape of the neck at the hairline, the inside of the upper arm, or very low on the lower back.

, The rib area can be very private, depending on how much skin you routinely show, as well as the lower abdomen, the buttocks, the thighs (especially on the inside faces), the back, or the undersides of the breasts, upper arms, or feet. The broad sides of the hips, where the thigh meets the pelvis are also favored by people desiring a sensuous tattoo that can only truly be appreciated when the person is unclothed. These types of private tattoos can be very intimate pieces of artwork that add a sense of mystique to the subject on which it is placed.

Tattoos hurt.,
If you have a low tolerance for pain, or this is your first tattoo, choose a simple design, and place it in an area that has few nerve endings and will take ink well.,
However, if you are feeling daring, or would like a tattoo to evoke more of a ""rite of passage"" feeling, more sensitive (and often more sensual) areas are easily available.",How to Choose Tattoo Placement3," There's no way around it. The very premise of tattooing revolves around a mechanized needle (or set of needles....up to 16) being used to puncture the skin and thus open a channel in which an ink or dye is simultaneously deposited. There will be pain, swelling, heat, and blood, just like with any injury. But the level of pain can greatly vary from artist to artist, tattoo to tattoo, and person to person.

, Backs, shoulders, and upper arms are favored for this. They are not often touched on a daily basis, which will make your 5-10 day healing period easier, and they are easy to wash and apply ointment without too much torquing of the skin.

, The ribs are well known for being some of the most painful tattoos to endure, as the jarring of the tattoo needle invariably causes one to tense up (well developed or locked muscles are very painful to tattoo over). Also. because the skin over the ribs is very thin and the bones so close to the surface, people have reported a deep ache akin to cracked or bruised ribs being felt during the course of the tattoo. Any area with the bones close to the surface will have a similar type of pain: ankles, feet, knees, elbows, collarbones, hipbones, eyebrows, the spine. Other areas are sensitive due to collections of nerve endings: the hands, the insides of the arms, the breasts and nipples, anywhere near the face, the scalp, behind the knees, the arch of the foot, the palms and fingers, and the whole pelvic region, including the genital and anal areas. Think long and hard about whether you can sit through a session before choosing any of these areas! They can be very rewarding to have tattooed, but it's important you are able to be still and calm throughout the process of inking!

Wash your hands.,
Rinse your mouth.,
Position yourself in front of a large mirror to help guide you.,
Stick out your tongue.,
Hold one ball of the barbell.,
Unscrew the other ball of the barbell.,
Remove the barbell.,
Reverse the process to put in a new piercing.",How to Change a Tongue Piercing1," Your hands should be clean to handle a piercing, even after it heals. Wash your hands with clean water and antibacterial soap. Dry your hands well afterwards – dry hands allow you to gain a better grip so that the piercing doesn't slip out of your fingers.;
, Rinse your mouth with a saline solution – use a mixture of warm water and salt (warm water will dissolve salt better than cold water). You can also use an anti-bacterial mouthwash, if your piercing is healed.

, Once you get used to changing your piercing you can do it without looking. For now, however, it will help to be able to see what you’re doing.

, Stick your tongue out as far as you can – this will minimize your risk of swallowing part of the piercing if you drop it.


If you’re changing your piercing over the sink, close the drain first so you don’t lose any parts you drop.

, Grasp the ball on the bottom of your tongue with your non-dominant hand. Hold it steady. If you can’t get a good grip, try holding it with a piece of paper towel or clean cloth.Some barbells have balls that only unscrew on one end, and others have two balls that can unscrew. Know which one yours is before trying to change your piercing, so you know which ball to unscrew.

, Twist the top ball to the left with your dominant hand. Unscrew it completely and remove it from the barbell. Be careful not to swallow any piece of your jewelry., Gently slide the barbell out of your tongue, removing the entire piece of jewelry.If you’re doing this in the bathroom, be sure you don’t accidentally drop it down the sink drain.

, Insert your new piece of jewelry through the piercing. Do this right away so your piercing doesn’t start to close up. Make sure both balls are screwed on tightly.If the piercing hole feels tight, swish some warm to hot water in your mouth; this may loosen your piercing up and make inserting the new jewelry easier.

Bite down on the back of the stud firmly but slowly.,
Place the base of the piercing on your thumb.,
Unscrew the ball clockwise.,
Remove the bar from your tongue.,
Insert your new piece of jewelry through the piercing.",How to Change a Tongue Piercing2," Follow the above procedure to clean your mouth and wash your hands before handling your piercing. It’s important to keep your hands and jewelry clean even after your piercing heals.

, Be careful not to harm your teeth! Clamp down on the back of the labret slowly. Keep this position to hold the stud in place.

, Stabilize the flat, bottom part of the labret with your thumb, beneath your tongue. Carefully hold your tongue piercing atop your tongue with your index and middle finger on either side of the bar. This will hold it steady and also ensure the bar does not slip out of the tongue in the process.

, Use your other hand to unscrew the ball to the left, or clockwise.

, Do so without letting it drop into your mouth or out of your hands.


If you are struggling, it is best to get professional help. Do not tug at your piercing; this risks damaging your tongue.

, Do this right away so your piercing doesn’t start to close up. Make sure the ball is screwed on tightly.Consult a professional piercing artist as soon as possible if you lose part of your piercing; they can re-pierce any closed holes.

Wait 4 weeks before removing your initial piercing.,
Replace your piercing in one sitting.,
Choose a piercing that fits your tongue.,
Use titanium or surgical steel jewelry.,
Switch to a labret or retainer only once your piercing is fully healed.,
See your piercer for help changing your jewelry.,
See your doctor if you have swelling, redness, or discharge.",How to Change a Tongue Piercing3," Tongue piercings generally heal in about 4 weeks, though this varies from person to person.Do not try to change your jewelry before your piercing is fully healed. This can cause pain, damage, and your piercing may close up.

, Do not take out your piercing without replacing it. Tongue piercings can close up very quickly, even after they heal. If you take out your jewelry, put a new one in its place right away., Your tongue swells when you get it pierced, so the bar you were pierced with is extra long. When the swelling goes down, you can use shorter bars.Once your initial swelling goes down and your piercing is healed enough, change your barbell to a shorter one that sits more snugly on your tongue. This will probably be more comfortable and less obtrusive.It’s best to have a professional piercer help you choose the right length barbell for your tongue.

, When you change your piercing, continue to use high-quality jewelry made out of titanium or surgical steel. These are sturdy and safer than cheap jewelry, which can cause an allergic reaction.Use titanium if you have had allergic reactions to jewelry – it’s the least likely to cause a reaction.
14- to 18-carat gold and other hypoallergenic products can also be a good choice for sensitive skin., It can be helpful to wear a retainer to keep your piercing open if you work in a professional environment that discourages piercings. Only use one of these once your piercing has fully healed. The same goes for switching from a barbell to a labret stud.It’s usually safe to start experimenting with jewelry after about a month. This varies from person to person, however.

, If possible, return to the person who originally did your piercing; otherwise, see another trained professional. They can tell you whether or not it is a suitable time to change your piercing, and can help you choose the right length of jewelry to use. They may use pliers adapted to remove the ball from the ring; it's not recommended that you try to do this yourself.

, Changing your jewelry can introduce bacteria to your piercing if your hands or jewelry aren’t clean. See your doctor right away if you notice signs of infection, including:Swelling in your tongue (after the initial few days of swelling)
Redness
Discharge
Discoloration or red streaks

Decide on the Tattoo.,
Make a list of Artists.,
Narrow down the List.,
Contact the Artist(s).,
Wait.,
Smooth out the Details.",How to Choose a Body Piercing or Tattoo Studio2," You probably won’t have a specific design in mind, but you should have a theme or idea of what you want, which should include the style. Different artists work well with different styles and it is important that you find someone who matches up well with what you want from your tattoo.


If you’re after a colourful, incredibly detailed hyper-realism piece you’re probably not going to do to the world’s best traditional style artist, because for all you know he can’t do realism to save his life. Black and grey, or colour?






You should decide on whether you want a colourful tattoo or something that is black and grey, because the concepts are slightly different and a lot of artists do have a preference – some artists will work exclusively in black and grey, some will only include small amounts of colour and so on and so forth; not everyone can do everything, and sometimes they simply don’t want to.







, You need to get together a list of artists that you like.


This is possibly one of the more time consuming parts of the process, but also one of the most fun, as you get to look at a lot of tattoos which might inspire your design a little more. So – how do you find these artists?






Start by looking for local tattoo studios and make note of artists you like working at those studios. Look at lists for top artists, top tattoos and make note of the artists whose work stands out to you.






Find pages on social networks like Facebook for tattoo studios, conventions and supplies companies – artists that are associated with these pages will often have joined these groups or liked the pages, so you can find them through these.






You can also check the upcoming conventions where you are and look at which artists are set to attend (sometimes artists will discount your tattoo if you get it done at a convention, so it can be worth looking at who’s going where and when – link to European convention list can be found in the sources).






If you’re struggling to find artists that really capture your attention, try joining some tattoo enthusiast forums and asking the users there for suggestions. Be sure to tell them your location and how far you’re willing to travel, as well as what you’re looking for from the artist. Most tattoo forums are full of people with experience of a wide range of tattoo artists, so they may have some fantastic suggestions for you.







, Once you have a nice long list of artists you like you can start to narrow it down. Artists you’re not willing to travel too far for can be taken off the list if you’re quite a distance from them. Then you can start looking at the quality of the tattoos, how frequently they post tattoos and so on and so forth.


You should ideally be looking for an artist that posts new stuff on a fairly regular basis, as this means they are actively tattooing and getting work, but not so busy that you’re going to be on a waiting list for five years if you pick them (unless you’re willing to wait five years of course).






They should post fresh and healed work, as it gives you a better idea of the quality of their work, particularly with black and grey artists, some of which will look completely different when healed despite looking fantastic fresh.






Take your time to decide on the artists that suit your needs best – then contact them. You should contact two or three artists unless you’ve decided on the perfect artist for you.







, If you’ve decided on an artist you love at this point, then fantastic. If not you probably have two or three artists you can’t choose between, and that’s fine. Contact them and base your decision on their communication – after all the artist might not even be willing to work with your idea, you need to confirm that they’re interested in the job.


When you contact the artist, they generally don’t really care why you want the tattoo, and can’t be bothered to read several paragraphs about how deep and meaningful the design is to you. What they want is information.






Explain to the artist the theme or idea you want for your tattoo, and include some reference pictures that might give the artist a better idea of what you want it to look like or even just tattoos that you quite like so that they get an idea of what you like to see in tattoos and what you don’t, this will make it easier for them to come up with ideas that you are likely to enjoy.






If you are a considerable distance from the artist you may want to explain this, particularly if you will be unable to attend a consultation with them as a result. If you are able to attend a consultation offer your availability to the artist in your email, you will have a higher chance of success if you are willing to make yourself flexible to their schedule.







, Artists tend to be pretty busy people, and you can probably guess by how often they update their social media how busy they are and how often they manage to sit down at a computer. So you could be waiting a little while for a reply to your email, but be patient. For some artists the average response time is a week or even two, so if you want a good, popular artist who gets numerous emails every day then you need to be willing to wait. If you still haven’t decided on an artist you’re going to go with you may choose to use the response time or even the enthusiasm of the response as your deciding factor. As stated previously – some artists are going to be more interested in your idea than others.

, Now that you’ve found your ideal artist you don’t want to lose them, and you want to be sure that you stay on their good side if you’re thinking about getting more work from them in the future.


Once you have both agreed on the idea and you’ve answered any questions the artist might have, you can start to ask about the costs, dates and times. First establish what the tattoo is likely to cost you, this is rarely set in stone but the artist should be able to tell you what their hourly rate is and how many hours they estimate the design would take to tattoo (you may not have a design in mind yet, so this might not be an accurate estimation) and they will be able to tell you how much they charge for a deposit.






You can use this information to decide on when to set your appointment. Of course in order to set the appointment you will need to put down the deposit, to be sure you have that money available when making the arrangements and set the date of your appointments for times when you are sure you’re going to have the money available. Suggest a few suitable dates and compare those with your artists schedule in order to settle on a date that suits both parties.
