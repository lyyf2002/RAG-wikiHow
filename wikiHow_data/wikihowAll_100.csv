Add the code of the function making sure you 1) use the values provided by the parameters; 2) assign the result to the name of the function; and 3) close the function with ""end function"".,
Go back to your workbook and use the function by starting the content of a cell with an equal sign followed by the name of your function.,
Verify the result is Ok after using the function several times to ensure it handles different parameter values correctly:

",How to Create a User Defined Function in Microsoft Excel,";
,, You can create the user defined function in the Worksheet itself without adding a new module, but that will make you unable to use the function in other worksheets of the same workbook.

, It has to have the following structure:public function ""The Name Of Your Function"" (param1 As type1, param2 As type2 ) As return Type
It can have as many parameters as you want, and their type can be any of Excel's basic data types or object types as Range. You may think of parameters as the ""operands"" your function will act upon. For example, when you say SIN(45) to calculate the Sine of 45 degree, 45 will be taken as a parameter. Then the code of your function will use that value to calculate something else and present the result.

,
Learning to program in VBA or in any other language can take some time and a detailed tutorial. However, functions usually have small code blocks and use very few features of a language. The more useful elements of the VBA language are:


The If block, which allows you to execute a part of the code only if a condition is met. For example:
Public Function Course Result(grade As Integer) As String
  If grade >= 5 Then
    CourseResult = ""Approved""
  Else
    CourseResult = ""Rejected""
  End If
End Function
Notice the elements in an If code block: IF condition THEN code ELSE code END IF. The Else keyword along with the second part of the code are optional.
The Do block, which executes a part of the code While or Until a condition is met. For example:Public Function IsPrime(value As Integer) As Boolean
  Dim i As Integer
  i = 2
  IsPrime = True
  Do
    If value / i = Int(value / i) Then
      IsPrime = False
    End If
    i = i + 1
  Loop While i < value And IsPrime = True
End Function
Notice the elements again: DO code LOOP WHILE/UNTIL condition. Notice also the second line in which a variable is ""declared"". You can add variables to your code so you can use them later. Variables act as temporary values inside the code. Finally, notice the declaration of the function as BOOLEAN, which is a datatype that allows only the TRUE and FALSE values. This method of determining if a number is prime is by far not the optimal, but I've left it that way to make the code easier to read.

The For block, which executes a part of the code a specified number of times. For example:Public Function Factorial(value As Integer) As Long
  Dim result As Long
  Dim i As Integer
  If value = 0 Then
    result = 1
  ElseIf value = 1 Then
    result = 1
  Else
    result = 1
    For i = 1 To value
      result = result * i
    Next
  End If
  Factorial = result
End Function
Notice the elements again:FOR variable = lower limit TO upper limit code NEXT. Also notice the added ElseIf element in the If statement, which allows you to add more options to the code that is to be executed. Finally, notice the declaration of the function and the variable ""result"" as Long. The Long datatype allows values much larger than Integer.
Shown below is the code for a function that converts small numbers into words.

, Append to the name of the function an opening parenthesis, the parameters separated by commas and a final closing parenthesis. For example:=NumberToLetters(A4)
You can also use your user defined formula by looking for it in the User Defined category in the Insert Formula wizard. Just click in the Fx button located to the left of the formula bar.
The parameters can be of three types:


Constant values typed directly in the cell formula. Strings have to be quoted in this case.
Cell references like B6 or range references like A1:C3 (the parameter has to be of the Range datatype)
Other functions nested inside your function (your function can also be nested inside other functions). I.e.: =Factorial(MAX(D6:D8))

, This will open a new Excel spreadsheet.

, This will go in the ""A"" column. To do so, you should first click and drag the divider between columns ""A"" and ""B"" to the right at least three spaces so you don't run out of writing room. You will need eight cells total for the following categories:


Loan Amount $
Annual Interest Rate
Life Loan (in years)
Number of Payments per Year
Total Number of Payments
Payment per Period
Sum of Payments
Interest Cost

, These will go in your ""B"" column, directly to the right of the ""Categories"" column. You'll need to enter the appropriate values for your mortgage.


Your Loan Amount value is the total amount you owe.
Your Annual Interest Rate value is the percentage of interest that accrues each year.
Your Life Loan value is the amount of time you have in years to pay off the loan.
Your Number of Payments per Year value is how many times you make a payment in one year.
Your Total Number of Payments value is the Life Loan value multiplied by the Payments Per Year value.
Your Payment per Period value is the amount you pay per payment.
Your Sum of Payments value covers the total cost of the loan.
Your Interest Cost value determines the total cost of the interest over the course of the Life Loan value.

, Since this is your Life Loan value multiplied by your Payments Per Year value, you don't need a formula to calculate this value.


For example, if you make a payment a month on a 30-year life loan, you would type in ""360"" here.

, To figure out how much you must pay on the mortgage each month, use the following formula: ""= -PMT(Interest Rate/Payments per Year,Total Number of Payments,Loan Amount,0)"".


For the provided screenshot, the formula is ""-PMT(B6/B8,B9,B5,0)"". If your values are slightly different, input them with the appropriate cell numbers.
The reason you can put a minus sign in front of PMT is because PMT returns the amount to be deducted from the amount owed.

, To do this, simply multiply your ""payment per period"" value by your ""total number of payments"" value.


For example, if you make 360 payments of $600.00, your total cost of the loan would be $216.000.

, All you need to do here is subtract your initial loan amount from the total cost of your loan that you calculated above. Once you've done that, your mortgage calculator is complete.

You'll need a separate column for each of the following categories:



Date - The date the payment in question is made.

Payment (number) - The payment number out of your total number of payments (e.g., ""1"", ""6"", etc.).

Payment ($) - The total amount paid.

Interest - The amount of the total paid that is interest.

Principal - The amount of the total paid that is not interest (e.g., loan payment).

Extra Payment - The dollar amount of any extra payments you make.

Loan - The amount of your loan that remains after a payment.

, This will go in the first empty cell at the top of the ""Loan"" column.

, In the date column, you'll input the date on which you take out the loan, as well as first two dates upon which you plan to make the monthly payment (e.g., 2/1/2005, 3/1/2005 and 4/1/2005). For the Payment column, enter the first three payment numbers (e.g., 0, 1, 2).

, To do so, you'll need to perform the following steps:


Select the first entry in your Payment (Number) column.
Drag your cursor down until you've highlighted to the number that applies to the number of payments you'll make (for example, 360). Since you're starting at ""0"", you'd drag down to the ""362"" row.
Click Fill in the top right corner of the Excel page.
Select Series.
Make sure ""Linear"" is checked under the ""Type"" section (when you do your Date column, ""Date"" should be checked).

,, The formula for calculating your Payment per Period value relies on the following information in the following format: ""Payment per Period<Total Loan+(Total Loan*(Annual Interest Rate/Number of Payments per Year)),Payment per Period,Total Loan+(Total Loan*(Annual Interest Rate/Number of Payments per Year)))"".


You must preface this formula with the ""=IF"" tag to complete the calculations.
Your ""Annual Interest Rate"", ""Number of Payments per Year"", and ""Payment per Period"" values will need to be written like so: $letter$number. For example: $B$6
Given the screenshots here, the formula would look like this: ""=IF($B$10<K8+(K8*($B$6/$B$8)),$B$10,K8+(K8*($B$6/$B$8)))"" (sans the quotation marks).

, This will apply the Payment per Period formula to your selected cell.


In order to apply this formula to all subsequent cells in this column, you'll need to use the ""Fill"" feature you used earlier.

,, The formula for calculating your Interest value relies on the following information in the following format: ""Total Loan*Annual Interest Rate/Number of Payments per Year"".


This formula must be prefaced with a ""="" sign in order to work.
In the screenshots provided, the formula would look like this: ""=K8*$B$6/$B$8"" (without quotation marks).

, This will apply the Interest formula to your selected cell.


In order to apply this formula to all subsequent cells in this column, you'll need to use the ""Fill"" feature you used earlier.

,, For this formula, all you need to do is subtract the ""Interest"" value from the ""Payment ($)"" value.


For example, if your ""Interest"" cell is H8 and your ""Payment ($)"" cell is G8, you'd enter ""=G8 - H8"" without the quotations.

, This will apply the Principal formula to your selected cell.


In order to apply this formula to all subsequent cells in this column, you'll need to use the ""Fill"" feature you used earlier.

, This should be directly below the initial loan amount you took out (e.g., the second cell in this column).

, Calculating the Loan value entails the following: ""Loan""-""Principal""-""Extra"".


For the screenshots provided, you'd type ""=K8-I8-J8"" without the quotations.

, This will apply the Loan formula to your selected cell.


In order to apply this formula to all subsequent cells in this column, you'll need to use the ""Fill"" feature you used earlier.

, Your payment should be the same all the way down. The interest and loan amount should decrease, while the values for the principal increase.

, At the bottom of the table, sum the payments, interest, and principal. Cross-reference these values with your mortgage calculator. If they match, you've done the formulas correctly.


Your principal should match up exactly with the original loan amount.
Your payments should match the total cost of the loan from the mortgage calculator.
Your interest should match the interest cost from the mortgage calculator.

In Excel, ""columns"" refer to vertical depth. If you look at the above pictures, the columns are labeled with letters, and go from top to bottom: ""A,"" ""B,"" ""C,"" etc.
""Rows,"" on the other hand, refer to horizontal distance. They are labeled with numbers, and go from left to right: ""1,"" ""2,"" ""3,"" etc.

, If you want the column labels and the row labels to show up in the graph, ensure that those are selected also.

, In some versions of Excel, you can also try navigating to the Charts tab in the Ribbon tab and selecting the specific kind of graph you'd like to use. This will create your a graph on a “chart sheet.” A chart sheet is basically a spreadsheet page within a workbook that is totally dedicated to displaying your graph.


For Windows users, you can create a graph with a shortcut by hitting the F11 button on your keyboard.

, Select the perfect kind of graph depending on what information you have and how you want to present it — don't just settle for any old one. Different versions of Excel allow you to change the chart type in various different ways:


Change your chart on the Chart toolbar, which appears after your chart is created. Click on the arrow next to the Chart Type button and click on the whatever type of chart you'd like.
Manipulate the chart types in the Chart Layout tab in the Ribbon tab. Some versions of Excel won't have a ""Chart Toolbar,"" but instead will keep the same basic information in a whole tab devoted to charts.

Learn how to change your graph by switching the plotting.",How to Create a Graph in Excel3," Excel has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to charts and graphs. This is usually a great thing, but it can also paralyze the user with choice. Which graph should I choose? the user asks herself. Here's a breakdown of the basic kinds of graphs or charts you can use in Excel:Column charts. These charts compare values across categories. Great for comparing sales and expenditures, for example, during a period of time.
Bar chart. These charts compare multiple values. They're similar to column charts, except their ""columns"" are twisted 90° and stick out to the side instead of up and down.
Line chart. These charts display trends over time. Use a line chart to track global production of steel from 1930 to present, for example.
Pie chart. These charts depict the contribution of each value to a whole. Use these charts to display the percentage breakdown of ethnicity in a given population, for example.
Area chart. These charts display differences in data sets over time. Use these charts to show how revenue and profit are linked for a year, for example.
Scatter plot. These charts compare pairs of values. Use these charts to plot the relationship between a person's weight and their height.

, Click on the ""Chart Title"" button in the Ribbon tab and select whether you want your title to overlap the graph or to sit solidly above it. Give your graph a useful name while still keeping it pithy. ""GDP in Cuba, 1901-1945"" is useful, while ""The economic state (GDP) of Cuba, from 1901 to 1945"" is probably a little too wordy.

, What does your x-axis represent, and how about your y-axis? If you don't pay attention to labeling your chart's axes, it's like you're creating a novel without chapters or an instruction manual without pictures. Either way, it will be very hard to interpret your graph.

, The legend is the sort of glue that holds a chart together. Without a legend, you're unlikely to know what the graph means because you won't know what information is plotted on the graph.


When you create a chart, Excel creates a legend by default, unless you specify not to. Your legend will be the column and row headers that you highlighted in the beginning while creating your graph.
Changing any column and row headers in their cells automatically changes their representation in the legend.

, Maybe you've accidentally input your information into the cells wrong, and your rows are mixed up with your columns. Instead of inputting the information all over again, simply find the ""Data"" subsection in the Charts tab (in the Ribbon tab) and press either ""plot series by row"" or ""plot series by column.""

, A normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution in which 68% of the values are within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% are within two standard deviations, and 99.7% are within three standard deviations.

, In Excel, the NORM.INV function returns a normally distributed value given a probability, a mean, and a standard deviation. NORM refers to a normal distribution with a given mean and a given standard deviation. and INV refers to inverse, that is, finding a value given a probability, rather than finding a probability given a value.

, The RAND() function returns a random number between zero and one.

, Combining the two above-referenced functions returns a normally distributed random value with a given mean and a given standard deviation.

, To create a random sample of a normal distribution with a mean of 70 and a standard distribution of 3, enter the above-referenced combined function in cell A1.

, To create a sample of size 10, copy cell A1 to cells A2 to A10.

, Excel displays the random sample of a normal distribution with a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 3.

Hit ↵ Enter to execute the function.",How to Convert Measurements Easily in Microsoft Excel1," For the purposes of this example, let's assume that the measurement you want to convert is in column A and you'd like to see the conversion results in column B (but really this method will work for any two columns). To label column A , click on cell A1 and type in the original unit (the one you'd like converted, e.g. inches, meters, or yards). This is also called the “from_unit.”


For example: click on cell A1 and type “Inches”. In this example, we will convert 12 (number) inches (from_unit) to feet (to_unit).
Excel’s convert function converts a “from unit,” into a “to-unit” (the unit you are converting the measurement to).
Labeling your columns will help you organize your data.;
, This will be your “to_unit” column. Type in the unit you are converting the measurement to. This is also called the “to_unit”.


For example: click on cell B1 and type “Feet”., Type in the original measurement in numbers only. Do not enter in the units.


For example: in cell A2, enter “12” (as in 12 inches).,


Functions in Excel are not case-sensitive. Typing ""=CONVERT("" has the same result as typing ""=convert("".

, Excel's convert function calls this value the ""number"".


For example: ""=Convert(A2""
When you are converting a single measurement, as in the example above, It is also possible to type an actual number (not a cell reference) in this spot. Instead of “=Convert(A2”, you would enter “=Covert(12”.

,


For example, your cell may now look like this: ""=Convert(A2,"" or “=Convert(12,”.

, The “from_unit” is enclosed by a set of quotation marks and is followed by a comma.


For example: “=Convert(A2, “in”,” or “=Convert(12, “in”,”.
Some approved unit abbreviations are ""in"" ""cm"" ""ft"" and ""m"".
Excel provides a comprehensive list of unit abbreviations here.

,


For example, your cell should look something like: “=Convert(A2, “in”, “ft”)” or “=Convert(12, “in”, “ft”)”.
This example function will convert the contents of cell A2 from inches to feet.

, The converted measurement will appear in your cell (in this case, cell B2).


For example: B2 will contain “1” (as in 1 foot).If the function returns the “#N/A” error, check the unit abbreviations again. Make sure the abbreviation is correct and that the two units belong to the same group (for example it is not possible to convert mass into length). Please note, unit names and prefixes ARE case-sensitive.
If the function returns the “#VALUE!” error, this means you have entered the “number” incorrectly. Make sure you have only entered one value or cell reference."

As before, copy these macros from here into MS Word or a Text Editor application that has a Replace All function and do REPLACE ALL of ""#** "" with nothing (disregarding the quote marks).,
The way the macros work is as follows:

Sub Macro01_TransferTodayToYesterday_j is DAILY run by pressing command+option(alt)+j first BEFORE getting the wikiHow data.,
Here are the macros, including strikethrough Macro e that still needs work.",How to Create an Overall Status Workbook in XL and VBA for Your wikiHow Articles,", The .xlsm means it contains macros.,,, For example, this author has two ID's because one ID only allows up to 100 articles and views to be shown using the standard in-built layout. Since more were desirable using this layout, a second ID was started. Join wikiHow if you haven't already, possibly as an Anonymous ID, just so long as you can access other's User Pages. Access in your browser https://www.wikihow.com/User:Chris-Garthwaite and go to Articles Started - View More and click on it.

With your mouse, carefully select the following group of articles and views without activating them by clicking just to the left of THIS ARTICLE, then dragging down fairly slowly under control until you can complete the selection with the bottom rightmost number of views for the last article. Do command v Copy.

, It may take a few seconds to update., It may take a few seconds to update.

You can see from the data it's approaching 150 articles and 500,000 article views, skewed by a single article. In analyzing the data, attention should be paid to eliminate such skewing, while still being very conscious of it. But for the purposes of this article, it will be kept simple.

, You will notice that those are conveniently and ever-so-nicely all live links now. Clicking on one takes you right to the article.

You may want to take a second to test that feature. You'll notice a used one turns a different color, perhaps brown or wine-red. That's going to prove useful. What is not as useful is that it does not open a new tab in your browser but uses the last one used, so you may want to hit your Back button to get back to where you were, page-wise, or use History.

, This author uses ""☞"", which appears as a hand with a pointing finger on my computer. You choose. Select cell A1 and Insert Name Define it as _TopLeft You can copy the finger and hand from this page for use on your own page if you like. It's just a memo to save the workbook by running one of the 2 macros. There are two in case something happens to the other.

People who have suffered losing a lot of work become a bit of a fanatic when it comes to using AutoSave and frequently save their work.

, Do the same for cell B2. For cell B1, use a lavender or hot pink. In cell B1, input Macro 09 u, and input to cell B2 Macro 10 g. Those macros will save the workbook to various folders, on this author's iMac, so you must change the pathnames and so forth to suit yourself. The macros will be done all together at the end., Format Cells Fill cells C1:C3 yellow. You can get those links from your own User Page by copying them from the browser window directly while in FireFox or Explorer or whatever and pasting them into the OVERALL STATUS workbook in Excel., Input by hand the total number of article views per each ID to the right (these hand-input totals will not agree to the worksheet totals by the amount of article views attributable to any new articles written since THIS ARTICLE, however, the total lines and lower references in this article should still be correct because new articles will not have been inserted effectively above THIS ARTICLE.

You can copy all the articles for Chris Garthwaite to a separate new workbook and figure out a reconciliation if you so desire. Or, you can input the views of any articles since THIS ARTICLE as one sum to be subtracted at the left in cell A3 from Chris Garthwaite - Input and xhohx - INPUT, to arrive at a total in A6 equal to The_Total below, once the other INPUT subtotals are also brought over to A4 and A5. Enter label New Articles to cell B3 in that case and Format Alignment left.

Input to cell C6, TOTAL_per_wikiHow and in cell B6 enter the formula, =B5+B4 and format both B6 and C6 Font Red., Format it font bold red size 14 and do Insert Names Create in Right Column, OK. Even though this total does not agree with the worksheet's total by the amount of new article views after THIS ARTICLE for the Chris Garthwaite ID, you'll use the correct total wikiHow figure to do the monthly projections at right. The rest of the worksheet grand totals of Views should agree internally.,, This author realizes there are no numbers in column A yet and so you will have zeroes returned temporarily.,, then edit it so that all the B's are F's, and the sum approaches 500,000 or more.,,, Select cell C20 and Insert Name Define it as FILE_SAVE____S (that's 4 underlines at the end; 5 total).,,,,,, Format Cells for A12 Font Red, Fill Yellow, Border Red boldest outline.,, From there it will be possible to rebuild _Clear_Total_Views_to_Date if need be. These daily Article View Totals can be copied and transposed, then sorted from greatest to least value, and that should correspond to their values in _Clear_Total_Views_to_Date.,, It is quite noticeable how very often article views trend similarly on the same days of the week, also months of the year, etc. because of school and exam scheduling and other factors., Surround the cell with a red boldest border, fill it yellow and make the font bright red.,, You will start each day by transferring the data that was in Today to Yesterday via Macro 01, using command+option+j.,,,, Currently, that's A18:A158 when this article is completed, but if this is not the topmost article, then A158 will not be the bottommost cell, since a new row will have been inserted for each new article at the top, via macro.,, In the cell under the last article, enter Other. Under usual circumstances, the wikiHow numbers will not sum to the hand-input total by the amount of views of any new article views written after THIS ARTICLE. Other bugs can occur, rarely. Try refreshing the page(s) first however, several times, and give it some time -- the numbers come out around 5:15AM Pacific Time, and the squirrels at the wikiHaus are still rubbing the sleep out of their eyes I imagine!?! It does not happen very often. More typically, the page does not update from the previous day at all because of some server maintenance being done -- a day might get skipped -- please update your sheets anyway, even with zeroes for the day, because the macro has to be on the right day.,, Select the cell range H17:158 and do Edit Fill Series -1 for the step value, OK. You'll re-number for your own quantity of articles when you get all done with this and modify it for your own usage., It would take too long to have you enter each star correctly, so just enter a 1 in column I to the right of the article Prepare a Broad Working Capital or Cash Flows Budget, and Edit Fill Down 59 cells, which is currently accurate as to count if not as to article. It gives you an idea anyway and you're just going to edit in your very own, hooray!,, Notice that cells J1:J14 are blank and useful for collecting these Ready-To-Be-Relateds when you are trying to figure out which ones to gather in support of a new (or old) article.,,,, It applies as a memo to cell F5 -- about the macro's goal seeking usage within the spreadsheet's formulation.

One author wrote over 200 articles per year., For example, this author starts each week on the slow day of Saturday, in cell M10 because on Saturday what's actually being reported are pretty likely to be Friday night's returns when a lot of people are out on dates. If, on the other hand, your subject matter is all about dating (whereas mine is about math), Saturday might just be your heaviest traffic day! This author just likes to know what the probable low point for the week is likely to be, because that can indicate an overall strong or weak week right away. So, for example the closest Saturday to 3/31 was 3/28, so I entered 3/27/15 to cell M11.

Warning: The macro is not date-dependent but instead, next-blank-cell dependent. This author is fastidious about running the macros every day, so it's not a problem, but it's possible it could be. The problem is, that =NOW() does not correspond to any of the dates at left, because =NOW() includes the time down to the fraction of a second. There's a way around that, if the author can make time for it.

, Now, here, we're getting into the next worksheet, 'Daily Sort', you'll notice. $NQ$150 holds the summary information for April, 2015. In $NZ$150 on 'Daily Sort' are Total Article Views to date, over all periods. Therefore, if for ANY reason Total Article Views as held by O4 today, less (Total Article Views to date less April's) should be less than 0, return the value directly below in cell S5, Otherwise return the Total to date in O4, less the Total to date in $NZ$150, less less (=plus) the April Views to date, $NQ$150. The wikiHow system gives us Total Views to date all the time -- it's up to us to gather each week's views and each month's views. Until O4 gets Total Views of the current day input into it by Macro b, it is empty! So when it subtracts (Total Views to date, less April's, even if April's are 0), it gets a big negative, so it takes the number in S5 below it until the cell in column O to the left is updated. That's fine if it happens to be April, but what if it's March?, On the 'Daily Sort' worksheet in the next cell to the left, $NP$150, are March's Total Views. On 'Article Views Views and Other' n M7 is 03/31/15 and in M6 is 04/01/15. So you see why this has been saved this for last: you have to manually update this formula at month's end with the correct next cell to the right from the next sheet, 'Daily Sort'.,, (That's 2 underlines and a 1 so it sorts to the top of the variable names list.),,,,, If not already done, do so now., down to ""#** End Sub"" in Advanced Editing in wikiHow and pasted into a Text Editor or Word Processor like Word that has a REPLACE ALL function. You want to replace all ""#** "" (without the quotes) with nothing. You then want to RECORD a dummy macro in Excel in the OVERALL STATUS.xlsm workbook and paste the Replace(d) All text over the dummy macro. There are other ways to go about it, but that's quick and dirty and gets the job done. Save the workbook. Run the macro either from the macros tool icon or by pressing command+option(alt)+p.

, Also, on the transposed section in Relateds, the formatting will not get copied over and that will need to get fixed at some point by copying over the formatting and then manually resetting it. No time for that now. It should read with your head turned 90 degrees left, justified vertically down, with word wrap., If there is ever a lingering New Article name in A4, just delete it or fix the macro code to do so.,,,,,,,,, ='Article Views and Other'!$A$12:$A$163, and transfer it exactly to Nexter and beneath it. It will then name the next top cell to the right Nexter so that it can proceed to do the same thing the next day and each day. That is, the DAY'S views, not the Total Views as of that Date will be transferred. However, you have just transferred with Macro03 to Defined Cell Range Name __02 the Total Views as of today's date. If you had YESTERDAY'S Total Views, plus Today's DAY'S views, you would then have Today's Total Views separated. So what you need is a starting point of Total Views. You will then add each day's views across to become the Month to Date's views. They will become that Month's Views. Then you will add your Starting Point to all the Months and agree it to wikiHow's Total Views as of Today. Thus, you will have gained insight into how you are doing per article per day and by month, whereas on Article Views and Other you were watching it for the current week, average and Projected Month., So in J1, enter 01/01/15 (if 2015 is the current year), and Format Cells Number Date mm/dd. Select the cell range for all 365 days of the year (or 366 days in 2016), i.e. over right from J1:NJ1 and do Edit Fill Series Step Value 1, OK., For cell CV1, do Insert Name Define Nexter, OK. Just whichever row 1 date you start the process on, make sure to Insert Name Define as Nexter.

When Nexter has updated column CV, remember to do the following: enter to CV3 the label, Don't dbl-count, and enter to CV4 the label, this column. Format Cells Font red bold.

, The next thing to do is to put in the bottom formulas. Enter to cell CV154 the formula, =DAY(CV151), and enter to CV155 the formula, =SUM($CV$150:CV150), and enter to cell CV156 the formula, =CV155*30/CV154. Put a boldest red border at the top of cell CV154, a left boldest border down cells CV154::CV156, and a bottom red boldest border for cell CV156., Then put a boldest red border around each month because you will need to change the middle formula for each month. You can split and freeze the screen at J5 so you can see the upper dates to make this job easier, or copy them temporarily nearby below., We want that to continue on through all of April and then stop and start afresh for May.

Enter to DZ155 the formula, =SUM($DZ$150:DZ150) and Edit Paste Special Formulas that across for all of May. Surround April and May and each new month with Format Cells Border red boldest outline
Enter to FE155 the formula, =SUM($FE$150:FE150) and Edit Paste Special Formulas that across for all of June. Do the red boldest border for June.
Enter to GI155 the formula, =SUM($GI$150:GI150) and Edit Paste Special Formulas that across for all of July. Do the red boldest border for July.
Enter to HN155 the formula, =SUM($HN$150:HN150) and Edit Paste Special Formulas that across for all of August. Do the red boldest border for August.
Enter to IS155 the formula, =SUM($IS$150:IS150) and Edit Paste Special Formulas that across for all of September. Do the red boldest border for September.
Enter to JW155 the formula, =SUM($JW$150:JW150) and Edit Paste Special Formulas that across for all of October. Do the red boldest border for October.
Enter to LB155 the formula, =SUM($LB$150:LB150) and Edit Paste Special Formulas that across for all of November. Do the red boldest border for November.
Enter to MF155 the formula, =SUM($MF$150:MF150) and Edit Paste Special Formulas that across for all of December. Do the red boldest border for December.
Go back and do January, February and March as well please, even though you'll get errors -- this sheet will prove useful in future years. Remember to do the red boldest border for each month. You can hide columns you're finished studying or which contain no data. It might be best to leave 01/01 showing so you remember it's all there but hidden. Bear in mind that Macro t does NOT look for a date but instead for whichever cell is named Nexter -- that is what will next be updated.


, The Article Views as of 01/17/15, the Starting Point, are included below in cells NL37:NL147., This column adds across all the activity from 1/18/15 to 1/31/15. Starting in cell NM33 is the formula, =SUM(AA33:AN33) and it has been copied and pasted down to NM147., In cell NN6 is the formula, =NL6+NM6, and that has been copied and pasted down to cell NN147., In cell NO6 is the formula, =SUM(AO6:BR6), and that has been copied and pasted down to NO147.,, Edit copy NL150 and Edit Paste it to cell range NM150:NZ150,,,, That should equal 0 and proves that the spread equals the number from wikiHow!, Counting all the 1's of that meant counting all the article-days per article on which there were 0 article views. These were summed and the total column was sorted from greatest to least to find out which articles were having the most Zero Views days. The formulas were Edit Paste Special Values back atop themselves to conserve memory and the sort was undone by sorting on Article number from Highest to Least. Many various sorts are possible in this worksheet, some dependent upon the categories yet to be input. It's a pretty big job and it's left up to you as to whether you really want to do it or not., Almost every article has two categories it uses, which is the current maximum available. As an example of how it works in the spreadsheet, Rank would list something like 1.02, which would mean SEEN = Mathematics and TWO = Calculating Volume and Area. Since many articles are categorized in the same Rank(s), sorting them by Rank order is meaningful.
,,,, The formula is, =H6&""-""&I6, copied and pasted down, then copied again entirely and Paste Special Values atop itself, to preserve memory., If you usually only use one category, you might still want to leave columnar space for two, as you might someday change your mind. If wikiHow changes and permits 3 categories, then a system of Rank looking like 01.12.02 will still sort just fine as a string, so long as there is actually a leading zero. You may have to use a formula to add one on, like this: =""0""&_Rank for just the single digit leads, where the Rank column has been defined as Defined Variable Name, _Rank. Or, =""0""&text(Rank,""0.00""), else 10's might appear right after 1's., There is just really no simple way for this author to convey the spreadout of Relateds/Article across the entire worksheet to you. 142*142=20164. Each cell in cell range J10:EV152 either has is blank or has a 1 in it, the 1 indicating that the intersection of the horizontal row article holds the vertical article as a Related wikiHow. Vertically, that means that the vertical article is held by n many horizontal articles currently. If you think about it from a user's perspective, it might be nice to have a way back to the article you just came from ... but that's not essential when allocation space is short at ten articles only, max. It's far more important that the article be actually related, firstly, and secondly, it's preferable for recent articles to support current articles, generally speaking, on the assumption that one's readership is already acquainted with older articles. It has been observed that readership of popular articles remains consistently high but that all readership of older articles declines with age; it is important not only to be writing high quality new articles that earn Rising Star or Featured Article status, it is also important from time to time to ""freshen up"" the older articles where possible. One way of doing this is to change their Relateds. Although the most recent 42 articles account for just 3% of total views to date, they often account for around 25% of today's views!! That is a very important fact to know and use. It means that a good portion of one's following is keeping very current with one's authorship. This article already has 24 views and it is tagged with an InUse template as well as being Not Yet Reviewed for Quality, so the readership is pretty hungry for the latest thing, it is thought. The article has modifications being made in the middle of it! -- so it has to be re-read to make complete sense! -- and still they persist!! This author admires their tenacity and feels extremely devoted to them per their own devotion. This author does his level best best to get it right on the first draft. This author does not track other author's Related wikiHows. The reason is because it's difficult to keep track of what the rest of the world is doing, let alone just oneself. However, the possibility of tracking other author's Relateds posted to one's articles is feasible within this system and not all that unwieldy.,, Another objective might be to delete Relateds subtracted as a group that were in excess of the 10 Relateds per article limit -- in that case you would be deleting 1's instead of adding them., The final list in B166 on should have formulas which deliver out the article name without brackets; 9) Use Macro 07.08. ... n and then command v to FIND the article in row 1 Searcher and when the Input Box comes up do command v paste; click OK for the Input Box afterwards; 10) Use the down arrow and row-heights = 0 to post a 1 quickly to the article the Relateds, one macro run by the next (or manually is faster if they are all in a row)l; 11) Click on the next article name row in this worksheet and color it by group of about 6-15 articles and repeat until done., Update changes., Calibri (Body) font is used mostly, size 12 or 14. Your favorite font is a matter of personal preference, as is its size, which is why it has been left until now mostly to state a preference. Input cells, or cells which are important or may be modified, other than those pasted in from wikiHow, may be color-filled canary yellow, even if the macros do the changing. You may want to work out your own style system as is preferable to you. The more important a cell is, the more likely it is to receive a boldest border, often in red. It's been left up to you to adjust your row heights and column widths to automatically fit the data all along. However, for column A, where the ready-tobe-Relateds formulas and pasted values run quite long, this author has a column width of only 5.36"" -- more than enough, and a frozen window at cell J7. Cell H7 contains xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx and column I is hidden, as is column F. Columns C:D are minimal, in order to see if any Rising Star objects somehow made it through the deletion subprocedure of Macro p., There is room for improvement. One needs to give it serious consideration. Currently, because no Relateds have been done for this article yet, there are 1416 Relateds assigned out of 1420 (142 articles * 10 Relateds/article) Allowed = 4 (Under). However, there are 271 under 10 (19.41%), 520 at 10 (36.72%), for a subtotal of 55.86% at 10 or under, and 625 over 10 (44.14% -- the balance)(sometimes there are 11 or 12 Related wikiHows, sometimes up to 15). All in all, it is below the total allowed overall. That may be a bit of fudgery and other's Relateds are not counted in the system, but it's felt to be fair, all things considered, with heavier-usage articles receiving more attention and lesser-used articles receiving less attention, so it's proportional to what the users want, actually. It's meant to please the users, after all. Sometimes, it has been as much as 6% over Allowed but has always been trimmed back to be within the limit. The system also does not count links within an article that are not down in the Relateds section, e.g. in the article How to Teach or Learn Math, Trig and XL with Enthusiasm -- but that is a rare treatment, not the standard. Someone counting actual links will thus arrive at a somewhat greater number. This article, also, falls into that category, but only temporarily as a model for the user to build their own article list as retrieved from their own User Page.

,,,,,,,,, Articles with high view counts are more likely to have high Relateds counts, and low view counts have low Relateds counts, typically, though some low view articles are promoted via higher Relateds spreads. All in all though, a balance is achieved. Promoting the visibility of an article for awhile may be just the boost it needs, and a unique coloring fill can alert the eye to which articles have been so adjusted, and their history can be checked on the Daily Sort worksheet to see if progress has been made or not. There is a macro, n, for inputting Relateds to an article ON THIS WORKSHEET -- the actual updating of the article with Relateds in wikiHow has to be done in the usual way, though the pre-formatting and pre-grouping that can be achieved either in column A on Relateds or (usually) column J of Article Views and Other helps quite a bit.,,,,,,, Do the same for cells EY153:EZ153 except Fill white and do not make the font red, but do make it black bold.,, Edit the formula in cell FE153 to be, =FD153+FC153+FB153. The total Relateds in cell FE153 should now agree to V_Sum and H_Sum.

,,,, Easiest just to copy it from here.

,,,,,
You will also use them to update other actual wikiHow articles in their Related wikiHow sections, by editing those sections, typically because you want to ""freshen up"" their image for the user in one way, i.e. you have written new articles since you wrote the old ones, and the new articles are Related! In such a case, where the old article is down the list a ways, you will probably want to hide the rows in between the old article and row 9, so that you can reach it faster once the macro and you find the right vertical article in Row 1 to update.

, The Macro n does not do this for you but because it's all in a convenient column, and the links are live, it's a simple matter to click on a link, edit in the ready-to-be a-Related new article's column A format copied from cell A10, and then put a 1 in column J to the right of the old article whose row you're updating below and whose link is now conveniently a new distinct color., Also, be warned that about the first thing that Macro n does is to delete the first entry, so be sure to place your entries in to A167 and not A166. If the macro does not work right on the first try, look at the cell range A166:E166 and see what's in it -- if it's an article, it's about to get deleted! If it's empty, it needs the x's and formulas -- then try the macro again and it should work fine. Sometimes, perhaps you forgot you have to press command+v to paste into the macro's InputBox the article name the macro just copied at cell B166. You might think you're supposed to type in the name of the article, but that would have been way too time consuming!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, That way, you needn't insert a new category type within the bounds of the variable definition to have it be included.,,, But, at the same time, it's nice to have the section copyable between the CAT ANALYSIS ws and the Daily Sort ws.,,,,,,,, You can sort the columns (left to right) if and when you put in the type 2 category decimal numbers in Row 2 above the concatenations. How you choose to sort your data is entirely up to you.,, There is nothing in column B. ""Seen"" is in cell D292. The second part starts on row 307. Thus, 0.01 is in cell C307 and Mathematics is in cell E307. Some of type TWO categories are copyable from the SEEN categories.

,,,,,,,, So, for example, enter =Totals into cell O302 for Microsoft Excel and into cell O307 for Mathematics, and enter =Totals into cell P294 for MSXL Imagery and into P307 for Mathematics. Continue this way across to the right until complete!, Edit the formula in K309 to be, =SUM(K307:K328) and surround it in Format Cells Border black outline boldest., Create a dummy macro, assuming you have enabled Developer in Excel Preferences on the Ribbon or otherwise, by recording a tiny macro and then copying this macro code over it. You may find it useful to split it up into 3 modules, or perhaps not; that is what is indicated in the top section of 'Article Views and Other' by Mod n, etc. You create a new module using the Visual Basic Editor. Each Sub to End Sub procedure must be separated by a blank line and not have any crapola between subprocedures. Comments, effected with preceding apostrophes, may go in at the beginning, middle or end of cod, or after lines, after a space. To continue a line of code, use space underline, then probably indent the next line -- watch for where this has already been done for you, however, please., It transfers F16:F161 to B16:B161 because the new data from wikiHow will presumably have larger Views to report per article and we want to subtract Yesterday's from Today's that we're about to bring in, so first we have to transfer what was Today to Yesterday. The result of the subtraction in column A, since the totals are Views to date, will be just Today's results.
Next, use the links in C3 and C2 to DAILY access the wikiHow data. You transfer in the wikiHow data as explained above, by selecting in the Chris Garthwaite data from THIS ARTICLE downwards the article title and views, and copy it and paste it into C17, then do the same for Xhohx's 100 articles, but below the data you just pasted in for Chris (the later ID).
Next, DAILY post from the wikiHow pages the summary of the total Article Views to cells A4 and A5, and possibly subsequently written line item article views as a negative sum to A3. Reconcile the totals.
Next, DAILY run Macro02_TransferTodayToDailySort_t by pressing command+option(alt)+t only AFTER the wikiHow data has been transferred in. Running the macro repeatedly will cause duplication in the columns of 'Daily Sort', which can be cleared and the dates pasted back in and edited to be correct, and the Nexter defined variable name reset to be the correct following day in row 1 to the right of today's correct update should such an error occur.
Next, DAILY run Macro03_TotalViewsAndGoalSeekingPastoid_b. It's probably better to run b before p, because p saves all the work done so far. Otherwise, run g or u after b. Macro03_TotalViewsAndGoalSeekingPastoid_b updates the Monthly Projections section and has to do with the goal seeking done in that region of 'Article Views and Other' as well. It is run using command+option(alt)+b.
DAILY run Macro04_Tfr_Views_Thruout_p transfers the new wikiHow article names and views and article numbers to all 4 worksheets, then saves all the work done so far. It is run by pressing command+option(alt)+p.
Sub Macro05_InsertNewArticle_y is used to populate a new article WHENEVER WRITTEN throughout the entire workbook. The new article name is copied in link form from the top of the wikiHow article just written and published and pasted to cell C16. Then the macro is run by pressing command+option(alt)+y.
Macro06_WeeklyUpdate_s is run WEEKLY when cell range O4:O10 on 'Article Views and Other' becomes full. The macro moves _AvgWklyReturns, _AvgWklyCashFlow and _AvgReturnRate up a cell and also handles_MNO_Update and _QRS_Update, all to the region Q46:U73, except that it also pushes it all down a row first.
Macro07_UpdateRelated_n updates 'Relateds' worksheet with your latest Related wikiHows info. See above VERTICAL UPDATING in The Macro n Section of Relateds for vertical updating however, which is done manually. Macro n is run by pressing command+option(alt)+n. Postings can be manually undone, or, if you still have the group of ready-to-be-Relateds over on 'Article Views and Other', you can use those to clear instead of add, if you like.
Macro08_FindRelated acts as part of Macro07 and is called by it.
Sub Macro09_PinkSave_u colors a cell pink and updates THIS AUTHOR'S pathnames/folders and files and saves OVERALL STATUS.xlsm four times before landing on a File Save cell. You will need to RECORD a new macro to save your own workbook adequately; the color-changing subprocedure tells you that things are happening. Run via command+option(alt)+u
Macro10_YellowSave_g colors the pink cell yellow again and updates THIS AUTHOR'S pathnames/folders and files and saves OVERALL STATUS.xlsm four times before landing on a File Save cell. You will need to RECORD a new macro to save your own workbook adequately; the color-changing subprocedure tells you that things are happening. Run via command+option(alt)+g
MacroAB_Get_wH_data_e needs work -- see the Macro comments.
MacroV_FindArticle_v finds an article by name or partial name in 'Article Views and Other' and is run by command+option(alt)_v. It's useful sometimes when an article seems to have somehow just disappeared from this author's memory as to location.
CommandButton1_Click is a problem in search of a solution -- see the macro comments regarding this experiment.

, This author has written thousands of lines of code but does not really hold himself out to be a programmer per se. Feel free to fix or just complain of whatever bugs you find and report them back in, if you would be so kind, please.

Set the Settings and Music to fit taste and idea.,
Set the Theme.,
Export via the bottom center button.,
Go to Finder on the Desktop and open Applications; open iMovie.,
import the stills per the Camera Icon at middle far right, from iPhoto's Imported Slideshows folder.,
Double-click on the microphone icon in the center Editing bar and set the microphone settings.,
Play the video several times with the microphone off and do a mock voiceover until comfortable what will be said and when it will be said are known.,
Finalize the project by selecting that option from the File menu.

,
Open YouTube in the browser and click on Upload File when the home page is reached, else set up a home page first in YouTube.,
Make use of helper articles when proceeding through this tutorial:

See the article How to Create a Spirallic Spin Particle Path or Necklace Form or Spherical Border for a list of articles related to Excel, Geometric and/or Trigonometric Art, Charting/Diagramming and Algebraic Formulation.",How to Create a Slideshow of Excel Images,", See Tips below for the storyboard progression for this video.

, Then export as JPGs to a unique file folder.

, Do Import to Library, and collect all the JPGs from Preview into iPhoto. Open the Last Import folder if not already open and your pictures are showing. Select each photo in its proper storyboard order and set its keyword to a consecutive numeric order, e.g. 001, 002, 003, etc, Select all and sort by keyword. Do Create Slideshow with the button at the bottom right. Copy and paste any JPGs that appear twice in the storyboard order in the upper storyboard frame, and any JPGs that need to appear for double the standard duration per the narration.

, If adding music, be aware that YouTube may consider the music that Apple provides with iPhoto to be copyright-protected, and fail the import on that account. So be sure to have the rights or permission to the music, if any, being added. Dissolving from one frame to the next may be preferable. If narrative is added in iMovie, set Music to None. It would certainly be wise to choose to create a new album and store a copy of all the photos altogether in it.

, Ken Burns may be preferred; others work as well. Experiment until satisfied.

, Choose Medium typically and to Automatically send it to iTunes, which then quit when it opens.

, Do New Project. Select the project type in the upper left, No Theme, with the house as it gives the most creative freedom.

, Select a picture then do Select All and drag them over to the Projects frames. The way to set up is with Projects on the bottom and Events on the top, preferably, and there's a two-arrow flip button to exchange the two in the far left middle of the iMovie app screen.

, If you will use the built-in microphone for input, block out about 65% of the background noise, especially if living by a freeway and the trucks sometimes honk at each other, plus, there are a lot of convalescent hospital nearby so there's also a lot of ambulance sirens, not to mention the noisy terrier across the street! In other words, carefully gauge the background noise likely to affect the recording and adjust for it.

, Then, when ready, tap the mic icon and begin speaking after just a half-second or so.

,, Drag and drop the iMovie file from its file folder into the YouTube import box and wait while it uploads the file. If it's going to be over an hour, the file may exceed YouTube's 15 minute size requirement / allowance, so then pare it down with selective editing (this may be an outdated limit). Name the file and watch it to make sure it uploaded correctly with the sound intact, etc. But wait and see if it uploads anyway even if it's long: importing about 63 photos has been successful. You're done!

Use Concatenate to join two cells.,
Insert spaces between your joined text.,
Insert punctuation and other text between concatenated strings.,
Concatenate a range of dates.,
Use the “&” symbol as a replacement for Concatenate.",How to Concatenate Text in Microsoft Excel," The basic function of concatenate is to join two or more text strings together. You can join up to 255 different strings together using one concatenate command. Take the following example:

Entering the Formula


A
B
C


1
good
bye
=Concatenate(A1,B1)



The Result


A
B
C


1
good
bye
goodbye
;
, If you want to join text but leave a space in between, you can add a space to the formula with quotation marks around a single space. This is especially useful for data such as first and last names. For example:

Entering the Formula


A
B
C


1
John
Smith
=Concatenate(A1,"" "",B1)



The Result


A
B
C


1
John
Smith
John Smith


, As seen above, you can add spaces by placing quotation marks around a blank space in the formula. You can expand this and use quotation marks to insert any text into your concatenation. Take note of the spacing left in the quotation marks to result in a readable sentence.Entering the Formula


A
B
C


1
Monday
Friday
=Concatenate(A1,"" - "",B1, "", closed weekends."")



The Result


A
B
C


1
Monday
Friday
Monday – Friday, closed weekends.


, If you have a date range that you want to join, you will need to use the TEXT function to prevent Excel from treating the dates as mathematical formulas:Entering the Formula


A
B
C


1
01/14/2013
06/17/2013
=Concatenate(Text(A1,""MM/DD/YYYY""),"" - "",Text(B1,""MM/DD/YYYY""))



The Result


A
B
C


1
01/14/2013
06/17/2013
01/14/2013 - 06/17/2013


, The “&” performs the same function as concatenate. It can be useful for shorter formulas, but can quickly become cluttered for longer ones. Note the space in quotation marks. You must have an “&” between each value that you want to concatenate.

Entering the Formula


A
B
C


1
John
Smith
=A1&"" ""&B1



The Result


A
B
C


1
John
Smith

Get your data in order.,
Create tables.,
Give the first table a meaningful name.,
Create the second table by following the same steps as above.,
Give the second table a meaningful name.,
Compare tables.,
View the results.,
Be aware of Join tables settings.",How to Compare Two Lists in Excel," Before doing any analysis make sure the data is well organized, have headers and there are no blank cells.;
, Select the cells from the first list and make sure to include the header cells. In this case click on A1 then Ctrl+⇧ Shift+↓. Then go to INSERT tab and in Tables group click Table button. In the Create Table dialog box check My table has headers then click OK.

, To do this, click any cell in the created table and then go to DESIGN tab and in the Properties group under Table Name write the desired table name. In this case rename the table to ORDERS.

, Select the cells from the second list and make sure to include the header cells. In this case select E1:F1 then Ctrl+⇧ Shift+↓. Then go to INSERT tab and in Tables group click Table button. In the Create Table dialog box check My table has headers then click Ok.

, Click any cell in the created table and then go to DESIGN tab and in the Properties group under Table Name write the desired table name. In this case rename the table to ORDERSTATUS.

, Now that we have created the tables we need to compare the values between them. Our look up key is the ORDER_ID column. The data in the ORDER_ID column is used to link both tables. The look up column does not have to be on the left side of the tables. To join and compare the data between two tables go to GEGPRIFTI tab and then in the Database group click Join tables button. In the Join tables dialog box:


Go to Left table drop box and select ORDERS.
Go to Right table drop box and select ORDERSTATUS.
The columns of each table are displayed in Left table output columns and in the Right table output columns lists. By default the first column of each table is set to be as join key. If it happens that the join key is a different column then right click and set it as key column.
In the Join type click the last button FULL OUTER JOIN. Click Run and see the result created in a new worksheet.

, From the results you see that:


There are orders from the ORDERS table that are not in the ORDERSTATUS table.
There are orders from the ORDERSTATUS table that are not in the ORDERS table.
There are orders that are in both tables.

, Be aware that the way that the two key columns join together effects the output results. By default the matching values of key columns are not case insensitive. So o4521 is equal to O4521. If you want o4521 not to be equal to O4521 when matching then go to Database group settings and check Case sensitive from the Key column matching radio boxes.

Select the column you wish to alphabetize.,
Open the Data tab.,
Look for the Sort and Filter section.,
Click the A → Z button.",How to Sort Microsoft Excel Columns Alphabetically1," The header row is the top row of your spreadsheet, with the names of your columns. Excel will sometimes sort this row thinking it is part of your data, especially if your spreadsheet is entirely text. Here are a few ways to prevent this:


Format your header row differently. For example, bold the text or make it a different color.Make sure there are no blank cells in your header row.If Excel still screws up the sort, select the header row and use the top ribbon menu to click Home → Editing → Sort & Filter → Custom Sort → My data has headers.;
, You can click the header cell for that column, or the letter above it (A, B, C, D, etc.).

, Click Data in the top menu to view Data options in the ribbon menu above your spreadsheet.

, The ribbon menu is divided into related areas, with the name under each one. Look for the area labeled Sort & Filter.


If you don't see it on the Data menu, try returning to the Home tab and looking for a Sort & Filter button in the Editing section.

, To sort the spreadsheet in alphabetical order, just click the A → Z symbol in the Sort and Filter section. This will rearrange the spreadsheet in alphabetical order of the selected column. On most versions of Excel, this button is in the top left corner of the Sort and Filter section.


To sort it in reverse alphabetical order instead, click the Z → A symbol instead.

Begin every formula with an equal sign (=).,
Use coordinate references for cells that contain the values used in your formula.,
Use arithmetic operators for basic calculations.,
Use comparison operators to compare the values in cells.,
Use an ampersand (&) to join text strings together.,
Use reference operators when working with ranges of cells.,
Use parentheses to identify the arguments of functions and to override the order of operations.",How to Type Formulas in Microsoft Excel1," The equal sign tells Excel that the string of characters you're entering into a cell is a mathematical formula. If you forget the equal sign, Excel will treat the entry as a character string.;
, While you can include numeric constants in your formulas, in most cases you'll use values entered in other cells (or the results of other formulas displayed in those cells) in your formulas. You refer to those cells with a coordinate reference of the row and column the cell is in. There are several formats:


The most common coordinate reference is to use the letter or letters representing the column followed by the number of the row the cell is in: A1 refers to the cell in Column A, Row 1. If you add rows above the referenced cell or columns above the referenced cell, the cell's reference will change to reflect its new position; adding a row above Cell A1 and a column to its left will change its reference to B2 in any formula the cell is referenced in.
A variation of this reference is to make row or column references absolute by preceding them with a dollar sign ($). While the reference name for Cell A1 will change if a row is added above or a column is added in front of it, Cell $A$1 will always refer to the cell in the upper left corner of the spreadsheet; thus, in a formula, Cell $A$1, could have a different, or even invalid, value in the formula if rows or columns are inserted in the spreadsheet. (You can make only the row or column cell reference absolute, if you wish.)
Another way to reference cells is numerically, in the format RxCy, where ""R"" indicates ""row,"" ""C"" indicates ""column,"" and ""x"" and ""y"" are the row and column numbers. Cell R5C4 in this format would be the same as Cell $D$5 in absolute column, row reference format. Putting either number after the ""R"" or the ""C"" makes that reference relative to the upper left corner of the spreadsheet page.
If you use only an equal sign and a single cell reference in your formula, you copy the value from the other cell into your new cell. Entering the formula ""=A2"" in Cell B3 will copy the value entered into Cell A2 into Cell B3. To copy the value from a cell in one spreadsheet page to a cell on a different page, include the page name, followed by an exclamation point (!). Entering ""=Sheet1!B6"" in Cell F7 on Sheet2 of the spreadsheet displays the value of Cell B6 on Sheet1 in Cell F7 on Sheet2.

, Microsoft Excel can perform all of the basic arithmetic operations �- addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division -� as well as exponentiation. Some operations use different symbols than are used when writing equations by hand. A list of operators is given below, in the order in which Excel processes arithmetic operations:


Negation: A minus sign (-). This operation returns the additive inverse of the number represented by the numeric constant or cell reference following the minus sign. (The additive inverse is the value added to a number to produce a value of zero; it's the same as multiplying the number by -1.)
Percentage: The percent sign (%). This operation returns the decimal equivalent of the percentage of the numeric constant in front of the number.
Exponentiation: A caret (^). This operation raises the number represented by the cell reference or constant in front of the caret to the power of the number after the caret.
Multiplication: An asterisk (*). An asterisk is used for multiplication to avoid confusion with the letter ""x.""
Division: A forward slash (/). Multiplication and division have equal precedence and are performed from left to right.
Addition: A plus sign (+).
Subtraction: A minus sign (-). Addition and subtraction have equal precedence and are performed from left to right.

, You'll use comparison operators most often in formulas with the IF function. You place a cell reference, numeric constant, or function that returns a numeric value on either side of the comparison operator. The comparison operators are listed below:


Equals: An equal sign (=).
Is not equal to (<>).
Less than (<).
Less than or equal to (<=).
Greater than (>).
Greater than or equal to (>=).

, The joining of text strings into a single string is called concatenation, and the ampersand is known as a text operator when used to join strings together in Excel formulas. You can use it with text strings or cell references or both; entering ""=A1&B2"" in Cell C3 will yield ""BATMAN"" when ""BAT"" is entered in Cell A1 and ""MAN"" is entered in Cell B2.

, You'll use ranges of cells most often with Excel functions such as SUM, which finds the sum of a range of cells. Excel uses 3 reference operators:


Range operator: a colon (:). The range operator refers to all cells in a range beginning with the referenced cell in front of the colon and ending with the referenced cell after the colon. All the cells are usually in the same row or column; ""=SUM(B6:B12)"" displays the result of adding the column of cells from B6 through B12, while ""=AVERAGE(B6:F6)"" displays the average of the numbers in the row of cells from B6 through F6.
Union operator: a comma (,). The union operator includes both the cells or ranges of cells named before the comma and those after it; ""=SUM(B6:B12, C6:C12)"" adds together the cells from B6 through B12 and C6 through C12.
Intersection operator: a space ( ). The intersection operator identifies cells common to 2 or more ranges; listing the cell ranges ""=B5:D5 C4:C6"" yields the value in the cell C5, which is common to both ranges.

, Parentheses serve 2 functions in Excel, to identify the arguments of functions and to specify a different order of operations than the normal order.


Functions are pre-defined formulas. Some, such as SIN, COS, or TAN, take a single argument, while other functions, such as IF, SUM, or AVERAGE, may take multiple arguments. Multiple arguments within a function are separated by commas, as in ""=IF (A4 >=0, ""POSITIVE,"" ""NEGATIVE"")"" for the IF function. Functions may be nested within other functions, up to 64 levels deep.
In mathematical operation formulas, operations within parentheses are performed before those outside it; in ""=A4+B4*C4,"" B4 is multiplied by C4 before A4 is added to the result, but in ""=(A4+B4)*C4,"" A4 and B4 are added together first, then the result is multiplied by C4. Parentheses in operations may be nested inside each other; the operation in the innermost set of parentheses will be performed first.
Whether nesting parentheses in mathematical operations or in nested functions, always be sure to have as many close parentheses in your formula as you do open parentheses, or you'll receive an error message.

",How to Sort a List in Microsoft Excel," You can either click and drag to select the column that you want to sort, or you can click one of the cells in the column to make it active and let Excel select the data automatically.


All of your data in the column will need to be formatted in the same way in order to sort (i.e. text, numbers, dates).;
, These can be found in the Data tab in the ""Sort & Filter"" section. To do quick sorts, you will be using the ""AZ↓"" and ""AZ↑"" buttons.

, If you are sorting numbers, you can sort from lowest to highest (""AZ↓"") or highest to lowest (""AZ↑""). If you are sorting text, you can sort in ascending alphanumeric order (""AZ↓"") or descending alphanumeric order (""AZ↑""). If you are sorting dates or times, you can sort from earlier to later (""AZ↓"") or later to earlier (""AZ↑"").


If there is another column of data next to the one you are sorting, you will be asked if you want to include that data in the sort. The sort will still be the column you originally selected, but associated columns of data will be sorted along with it.

, If you are running into errors when you try to sort, the most likely culprit is formatting problems with the data.


If you are sorting numbers, make sure that all of the cells are formatted as numbers and not text. Numbers can be accidentally imported as text from certain accounting programs.
If you are sorting text, errors can arise from leading spaces or bad formatting.
If you are sorting dates or times, troubles usually stem from the formatting of your data. In order for Excel to sort successfully by date, you need to ensure that all of the data is stored as a date.

, Let's say you have a spreadsheet with a list of customer names as well as the city that they are located in. To make your life easier, you want to sort first alphabetically by city, and then sort each customer alphabetically within each city. Creating a custom sort can do just that.

, This can be found in the ""Sort & Filter"" section of the Data tab. The Sort window will open, allowing you to create a custom sort with multiple criteria.


If your columns have headers in the first cell, such as ""City"" and ""Name"", make sure to check the ""My data has headers"" box in the upper-left corner of the sort window.

, Click the ""Sort by"" menu to choose the column that you want. In this example, you would first be sorting by city, so select the appropriate column from the menu.


Keep ""Sort on"" set to ""Values"".
Set the order to either ""A to Z"" or ""Z to A"" depending on how you want to sort.

, Click the ""Add Level"" button. This will add a rule underneath the first one. Select the second column (The Name column in our example) and then select the sort order (for ease of reading, choose the same order as your first rule).

, Your list will be sorted according to your rules. You should see the cities listed alphabetically, and then the customer names sorted alphabetically within each city.


This example is a simple one and only includes two columns. You can, however, make your sort as complex as you would like, and include many columns., You can either click and drag to select the column that you want to sort, or you can click one of the cells in the column to make it active and let Excel select the data automatically.

, The Sort button can be found in the Data tab in the ""Sort & Filter"" section. This will open the Sort window. If you have another column of data next to the one you are sorting, you will be asked if you want to include that data in the sort.

, This will allow you to choose the first color you want to sort by.

, In the ""Order"" column, you can use the drop down menu to choose which color you want to put first or last in the sort. You can only choose colors that are present in the column.


There is no default order for color sorting. You will need to define the order yourself.

, You will need to add another rule for each color in the column you are sorting. Click the ""Add Level"" to add another rule to the sort. Choose the next color that you want to sort by, and then the order that you want to sort.


Make sure that each order is the same for each rule. For example, if you are sorting from top to bottom, make sure the ""Order"" section for each rule says ""On Top"".

,, Because this is the first balance entry, the balance will be determined by taking the difference between the expense and the revenue. How you set this up depends on the whether you want to look at expenses or cash on hand.


If you're setting the spreadsheet up to look primarily at your expenses, the balance formula would be =E3-F3, where E3 is the cell representing the expense and F3 is the cell representing the revenue. Setting up the formula this way will make the total of your expenses a positive number, which will be easier to understand.
If you're setting the spreadsheet up to keep a running tab on your cash on hand, the balance formula would be =F3-E3. Setting the spreadsheet up this way will show the balance as positive when your cash flow exceeds your expenses and negative when you have more expenses than revenue.

,, Because the second and subsequent entries will keep a running balance, you need to add the result of the difference between the expense and revenue to the value of the balance for the previous entry.


If you're setting the spreadsheet up to look primarily at your expenses, the balance formula would be =G3+(E4-F4), where G3 is the cell representing the previous balance, E4 is the cell representing the expense and F4 is the cell representing the revenue.
If you're setting the spreadsheet up to keep a running tab on your cash on hand, the balance formula would be =G3+(F4-E4).
The parentheses around the cells representing the difference between expenses and revenue aren't necessary; they're included just to make the formula concept a bit clearer.
If you want to keep the cell with the balance empty until a complete entry has been made, you can use an IF statement in the formula so that if a date hasn't been entered, the balance cell won't display a value. The formula for this, for the second entry, reads =IF(A4="""","""",G3+(E4-F4)) if you're setting the spreadsheet up to track expenses, and it reads =IF(A4="""","""", G3+(F4-E4)) if you're setting the spreadsheet up to show cash on hand. (You may omit the parentheses around the cells representing the expenses and revenue, but not the outer set of parentheses.)

, Right-click Cell G3 and select ""Copy"" from the popup menu; then drag to select the cells below it in the column. Right-click the selected cells, and select ""Paste"" from the popup menu to paste the formula into the selected cells. (In Excel 2010, choose either the ""Paste"" or ""Paste Formulas"" option on the popup menu.) The formula will automatically update the cell references to indicate the expense, revenue, and date (if used) references from the current row and the balance reference from the row above the current row.

, Give the spreadsheet a meaningful name, such as ""Expense Tracking.xls"" or ""Personal Budget.xls."" As with a template-based budget spreadsheet, you may want to include your name and the year in the file name. (Again, note that the quote marks are used only to show the example names and shouldn't be typed in. You also don't type in the file suffix; Excel provides it for you.)


Excel 2003 and older save spreadsheet files in the older "".xls"" format, while Excel 2007 and 2010 save spreadsheets in the newer XML-based "".xlsx"" format but can read and save spreadsheets in the older "".xls"" format as well. If you have several computers and plan to keep this spreadsheet on all of them, use the older format if any of your computers have Excel 2003 or older on them and the newer format if all your computers have at least Excel 2007.

You have your spreadsheet, with both first and last names combined as in this illustration.,
In this example, you would hold your cursor over the ""B"" column heading until it makes a down arrow, and then left click the mouse to select the entire column as shown here.

,
Next, you select the DATA tab, and then select the TEXT TO COLUMNS button.,
In the first window of the Text to Columns Wizard, you will choose DELIMITED.,
In the second window of the Text to Columns Wizard, you choose the delimiter, or what separates the things you'd like in separate columns.,
In the third window of the Text to Columns Wizard, choose ""general"" formatting and leave everything else as it is.,
Review your work.,
You can now change the headers to First Name and Last Name if you like, and sort by last name if you are so inclined.",How to Separate First Names and Last Names Into Separate Fields in a Microsoft Excel List,";
,, Note that you must have several empty columns after the column you are converting. If you need to, highlight the column and insert 2-3 new columns. Otherwise, the conversion will overwrite the data in successive columns.

,


You only choose fixed width if the segments you want to separate are all exactly the same width (like separating area codes from phone numbers).

, In our case, it is simply a space, so we select space. You can also checkmark ""Treat consecutive delimiters as one"".


If you had names separated by commas (like Brown, James), you would use the comma as the delimiter, etc.

Launch the Microsoft Excel 2010 program.,
Locate the equation you plan on solving and re-arrange the equation to equal zero.,
Figure out your expected number of roots (solutions).,
Select cells to work with.,
Label a cell “X-value” and an adjacent cell in the same row “Equ=0”.,
In the row below “X-Value” in the same column, put in a guess value for x.,
In the row below “Equ=0” in the same column, put in your re-arranged equation using the X-value guess in step 3 as your variable.,
Find and click the “Data” tab on the top of the Excel spreadsheet.

,
Click “What-if Analysis” and select “Goal Seek” from the drop down tab.

,
Click the cell used to input your equation in Part 2, Step 4 under the ""Set Value"" field.

,
Type in zero under the ""To value"" field (see figure above).,
Click the cell used to input your guess x-value under the “By changing cell” field(see figure above).,
Press “Ok” to solve.,
Find the lower root by entering another guess for the X-Value.,
Repeat all steps in part 3 for the different guess.,
Prove your answers though graphical methods or algebraic (factoring methods).

",How to Solve a Quadratic Equation Using the Goal Seek Feature on Microsoft Excel,"


This procedure can be applied to Microsoft Excel 2013 or earlier versions of Microsoft Excel as long as it has the Goal Seek feature.;
,


For this example, we will use a quadratic equation of the form ax^2+bx+c=0. To do this, we will need to rearrange the equation so that the right hand side is equal to zero.

,


For a quadratic with an order of 2, the expected possibilities are two roots or no roots.

,


You can do this by simply picking the cells you want to use. For this example, we will use four cells in total. We have arbitrarily chosen the block between A1 and B2.

,


“X-Value” will be a guess for the root, or solution, to the equation. “Equ=0” will be your equation set equal to zero.

,


Put in a guess for the solution to the quadratic equation. Remember, we do not know the solution so we must guess! Since we are looking for the higher (or more positive root), it is best to guess a double digit positive number.We will choose positive 10 as a guess.Press Enter.

,


Enter by putting “=” and put equation in by selecting X-value (A2 Cell) guess as variable. Press Enter.

,,,,


This was the purpose of re-arranging our equation to equal to zero.

,


Excel will compute the solution by changing this guess until the input equation is equal to zero.

,


The “Goal Seek Status” window will appear. As you can see, Equ=0 converges to a small value that is close to zero, while the solution can be found under the “X-Value” header as 3.

,


This time, we will choose negative 10 to capture the lower root in Excel's solution process.

,


Equ =0 should converge to a small value that is close to zero, while the solution can be found under the “X-Value” header as -1.

Create the following tabs on your spreadsheet:


CampaignsWoW - this will be an internal company dashboard to view your client (or entire company's) paid social media analytics.,
Decide whether you want to measure and report on a week-over-week or a month-over-month interval, for your clients.,
Add a number of graphs to indicate growth trends based on your strategies.,
Add an Analysis & Recommendations section.,
Consider the campaign objective in this tab.,
Add more, as needed.,
Add your graphs to add trends analysis.,
Add an analysis or comments section to make sure you tell the data story on the campaign.

,
Use a week-over-week campaign tab.,
Create rows.,
Focus on the ration.,
Include columns.,
Make comparisons.,
Collect your information and put it into your spreadsheet reports.,
Analyze your data.,
Stay consistent with the approach outlined in this article.",How to Set Up Your Facebook Ads Analytics KPIs in Excel Spreadsheets,"
ClientDashboard - shared with the client and aggregates campaign KPIs.
IndividualCampaign - an individual campaign tab that looks at KPIs and helps you focus on the campaign's impact and ROI. We will use this when we AB test as well.;
, Obviously, the more often you can build these reports, the better you will understand your data, and the higher your ROI will be in the end. Start by creating the following rows:


Impressions
Leads (site clicks)
Conv (CTA clicks)
CTR
Cost
Cost/Conv.
Conv. Rate
Avg. CPC (if CPC campaigns...if CPM or CPP, replace CPC)
Avg. CPA
Avg. Relevance Score
Avg. Frequency
Revenue
ROI

, These can measure :


1) Leads/Conv./Impressions on a bi-weekly basis for the year
2) Revenue and ROI for the MoM or WoW period; and/or
3) Facebook Ad KPIs (leads, conv., CTR, cost).

, This is an important part of the report and should not be taken for granted. This is where you can tell your data story (or analysis) so you need to give it some thought.

, You need to run ads differently, depending on your goals. As a result, your KPIs will also be different. The Campaign objectives could include:


Objective - Build brand awareness and community growth. KPIs include: The number of website visits from ad, the number of followers or page likes from ad, engagement rate from post (if promoting content), conversation rate (if promoting content), amplification rate (if promoting content), the number of website visits from ad, and the number of followers or page likes from the ad.
Objective - Increase purchases (drive revenue). KPIs can include: The number of website clicks or leads from ad, the number of CTA clicks or conversations from ads, the number of purchases from ad, the number of return visitors from ad, the number of purchases per person from ad, ad CTR, ad Fatigue Rate, and ROI.
Objective - increase visits to a piece of content. KPIs can include: The number of visits to the content from ad, the number of content downloads/signups, etc., from ad and the number of shares of pieces of content from the ad.
Objective - increase Facebook page likes. KPIs can include: The number of new followers or likes from ad, engagement rate, applause rate, amplification rate on posts, and the number of shares from ad (referrals).
Objective - drive attendance to an event or webinar. KPIs can include the number of visits from ad, the number of signups from ad, and the number of shares from an ad.
Objective - download the mobile app. KPIs can include: The number of app downloads from ad and the number of app engagements from ad.

, The KPIs listed above are, by no means, an exhaustive list. Thus, if you're building an individual campaign report with a revenue objective, your KPIs could include the following:


Leads (website clicks) from ad
Conversions (CTA clicks) from ad
Google Analytics conv. data to match with the CTA clicks
Purchase data (if available)
Budget
Amount Spent
Avg Frequency
Avg CTR
Avg Relevance Score
Cost metricsCPCCost per total actionCPP CPM
CPC
Cost per total action
CPP
CPM
Engagement metrics, newsfeed impressions, impressions total, actions, click search
newsfeed impressions
impressions
total actions
clicks
reach
Revenue
ROI.

, A good foundation for which graphs to add include: Cost metrics, investment metrics, campaign results, campaign effectiveness, and engagement metrics. Some data-centric marketing organizations do not like to add internal ad ratios to these reports, since they could confuse clients.

,, The Campaign WoW (week-over-week) tab is an internal organization tab that helps you track all of your Facebook ad activities across clients. The tab includes five different areas: Active Campaigns WoW Summary, Ad Efficiency, Facebook Ads Aggregate Campaign data (by campaign), Facebook Ads last 7 days data and Ad Activity last seven days.

, For the Active campaigns WoW summary, add the following rows or KPIs (and make sure you specify a time period for the report):


Ad Spend
Avg CPC
Avg CTR
Website Clicks
CTA Conversions
Cost/Conversions
Avg Frequency
Avg Relevance Scores.

, For the Ad Efficiency section, you focus on the effectiveness of the ads, while paying particularly close attention to the ad fatigue rate ratio. To get the ad fatigue ratio, calculate the frequency rate change and the ctr change. Thus, your KPIs will include:


All Ads Fatigue Rate
Avg. CTR
Avg. Frequency Rate Delta
Avg. CTR delta.

, For Aggregate Campaign Data, you'll want to look at all KPIs per campaign name. In it, we put campaign names in the Y axis and KPIs on the X axis. As a result, your KPIs could include the following columns:


Budget
Amt Spent
Balance
Avg. Relevance Score
Impressions
Clicks
Avg CTR
Avg CPC
Avg Frequency Rate
CTA clicks.

, For Facebook Ads Last 7 Days simply compare your top KPIs per strategy. KPIs can include monitoring only Website Clicks and CTA conversions on a daily basis. This can vary greatly, depending on your objectives.


For Ad Activity Last 7 Days you can compare your spending per channels. Some spend KPIs for ad Activities could include spending for Facebook Ads, Google Adwords, and even Instagram Ads.

, This is time-consuming but worth the effort. There are ways to speed this up. You could write an ODBC connector (expensive) or pay for a query or other service to do this. It requires a certain skill to write the queries, so most people resort to the manual import of data from different sources. Note that about 88 percent of spreadsheets have errors associated with these processes,so be careful that you do this correctly. There are a few tools that can make it easier to set up and can automatically download data into your spreadsheet. Check them out on the tips section.


In the spreadsheet described in this tutorial, you will need to import information from Facebook Ads, Google Adwords, and Google Analytics. Be sure to devote at least two hours every time you want to import from these sources into Excel, since you will need to format the imports and verify that there are no human errors.

, Whether you do it by campaign, or on an aggregate basis, be sure to pay close attention that the KPIs are growing towards your campaign goal on a daily basis. Not doing so can severely affect your campaign's performance.

, You don't need to be a data scientist to build your first paid social media analytics portal with Facebook Ads. With a little effort and a basic understanding of spreadsheets, you can work out for yourself which ads perform best.


Be sure to use your spreadsheet, not to report vanity metrics, but to understand your data story. More importantly, be sure to keep your data updated continuously.

You will not be able to classify the data sheet into the following three variable forms:

a cell, which contains a single data figure
a column, which is a vertical group of cells
a row, which is a horizontal group of cells


Find the meaning of each cell in relation to its column and row. A spreadsheet is the combination of presentation and information, where each cell will convey a value, in relation to an object and attribute.

a cell is the value of the relationship between an object and attribute
a column refers to an object
a row refers to an attribute


Finally, observe the significance of each variable by compare and contrast.

, In other words, understand how the spreadsheet is relevant for you. Investigate the production process, in terms of the people (participants), the reason for the involvement (motivation), and also the situational relevance (date and location). You can use the following as a reference:


participants: individual, group, teacher, company
motivation: work, school, hobby, research
date: creation, update, version
location: availability

, To fully utilize a spreadsheet, you will use the information and presentation to form an argument or a judgment based on what you have studied.

, Click the Home tab on the ribbon and look in the Number group. On Excel for Windows, click the dialog launcher next to the word Number (a small arrow in a square).On Excel for Mac, click the dropdown menu (it says General by default) and select Custom....


On old versions of Excel without a ribbon menu, instead click Format → Cells → Number tab., In Excel 2013 and Excel 2016, just select any format on the list. When you edit that default format, Excel will automatically create a new custom format without altering the default option.On all other versions of Excel, select Custom from the list of options instead. Look for a text box labeled Type where you can enter your custom format.


If your data represents calendar dates, phone numbers, or other common data types, browse the list of default options. You may be able to use one of them rather than creating your own format.

, Custom formats use several ""placeholder characters"" to specify how digits should display. The character 0 (zero) tells Excel to display a zero in that position if there is no other digit there.For example, the format 000 will add leading zeroes to the hundreds and tens place if necessary. 97 will display as 097, and 3 will display as 003.


Numbers to the left of the decimal point are always displayed. Even though there are only three digits in the format code 000, the number 3750 will still display as 3750.

, Custom number formats will delete all digits after the decimal point unless you specify otherwise. To change this, just add a decimal point to the end of your custom code, followed by 0 (or one of the placeholder characters described below).For example, 000.000 will round to the nearest thousandth, and add up to three trailing zeros after the decimal point. Here's how various numbers look in the 000.000 format:


13.1 becomes 013.100
95001 becomes 95001.000
5.0057 becomes 5.006

, The symbol # is another placeholder character in custom formats. This will prevent all leading zeroes if used at the front of the number, and prevent all trailing zeroes if used after the decimal point.For example, the custom format 00.## allows for a leading zero in the tens place, but no trailing zeroes:


5.8 becomes 05.8
2.71 becomes 02.71
15.0 becomes 15
38.315 becomes 38.32

, Excel treats anything inside quotation marks as text in your custom format, and will display it exactly as you typed it.This may be useful if each cell in your original database had exactly two leading zeros, for example. To restore these, set your spreadsheet to the custom format ""00""#.


If your data includes digits after a decimal point, prevent rounding by using the custom format ""00""#.## instead, using as many # or 0 characters after the decimal point as necessary.

, If your goal is to align the decimal points in a column, there's no need to add leading or trailing zeroes. Use the ? character in your custom format, and Excel will add empty spaces instead to align the digits in the column. For example:


?.??? rounds to the nearest thousandth with no trailing zeroes, and aligns the decimal points.
000.? adds leading zeros up to the thousands place, rounds to the nearest tenth with no trailing zeros, and aligns the decimal points.
?.00 rounds to the nearest hundredth with trailing zeros and aligns the decimal points.

In cell E8, create a formula to calculate the loan interest amount on the beginning balance for that period. The formula will look like ""=ROUND($B8*($B$2/12), 2)"". The single dollar sign creates a relative reference. The formula will look for the appropriate cell in the B column.
In cell D8, subtract the loan interest amount in cell E8 from the total payment in C8. Use relative references so this cell will copy correctly. The formula will look like "" =$C8-$E8.""
In cell H8, create a formula to subtract the principal portion of the payment from the beginning balance for that period. The formula will look like "" =$B8-$D8.""

,


Cell B9 should include a relative reference to the ending balance of the prior period. Type ""=$H8"" in the cell and press the Enter key. Copy cells C8, D8 and E8 and paste them into C9, D9 and E9. Copy cell H8 and paste it into H9. This is where the relative reference becomes helpful.
In cell F9, create a formula to tabulate cumulative principal paid. The formula will look like this: "" =$D9+$F8."" Do the same for the cumulative interest cell in G9 which will look like this: "" =$E9+$G8.""

,

Use Vlookup to find a discount.",How to Use Vlookup With an Excel Spreadsheet1," Vlookup is a function in Excel that allows you to type the value of one cell to look up the value of a corresponding cell in the same row.


Use it to look up information from a large spreadsheet or if you have to find repetitive information.
Imagine being a teacher with a student list in Excel. You could use Vlookup to type the name of the student and immediately be given their grade from a corresponding cell.
Vlookup is helpful if you work in retail. You can search an item name and be given the item number or price in return.;
, The “v” in Vlookup stands for “vertical.” This means that your spreadsheet must be organized in vertical lists, as the function will only search columns, not rows.

, If you are using Vlookup for a business, you can format it for a table to calculate a price or discount on an item."

Understand the “lookup value.” This is the cell from which you start; the place that you enter the Vlookup code.,
Understand the “table array.” These are the cell numbers of the complete range of data.,
Find the “column index number.” This is the number of the row that you are searching for data in.,
Understand the “range lookup.” This is part of the Vlookup code that wants to know if you want an exact number or an estimated one.",How to Use Vlookup With an Excel Spreadsheet2,"


This will be a cell number, such as F3. It refers to the location of your search.
You will enter your Vlookup code here. Whatever search you do here must be from the first column of your spreadsheet.
It is helpful to place this a few spaces away from the rest of your completed spreadsheet, so that you don’t mix it up with your other data.

,


The first number will be the one on the top left corner of your spreadsheet, and the second number will be on the bottom right corner of your data.
Using the example of a teacher with a class list, imagine you have two columns. The first has the names of all the students, and the second has their GPA. If you have 30 students starting in A2, then the first column lists from A2-A31. The second column with grades goes from B2-B31. Therefore, the table array is A2:B31.
Be careful not to include your table headers. This means that you don’t include the name of each column, such as “student names,” and “GPA” in your table array. These would probably be A1 and B1 on your spreadsheet.

,


For Vlookup to work, you must use the number of the column, not the name. So even though you are searching for your students’ GPA, you would put “2” as the column index number because the GPA is listed in the second column.
Don’t use the letter for this, only the number representing the column. Vlookup will not recognize “B” as the correct column, only “2.”
You may have to literally count the number of columns to the right to find the column index number if you are working with a very large spreadsheet.

,


If you want an exact number, not one that is rounded or from a neighboring box, then you must put “FALSE” in your Vlookup function.
If you want an estimated number that is rounded or borrowed from a neighboring cell, then you can put “TRUE.”
If you aren’t sure which you need, it is typically safe to put “FALSE” so that you get an exact answer from your search in your spreadsheet."
"
Create your spreadsheet.,
In a blank cell type the Vlookup formula.,
Expand the Vlookup function to include other cells.,
Test Vlookup.",How to Use Vlookup With an Excel Spreadsheet3," You must have at least two columns of information for Vlookup to work, but you can have as many as you need

, In the cell, enter this formula: =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, range_lookup).


You can use any cell to write this is, but remember that whatever cell you choose is entered as the “lookup value” in your function code.
Refer to the guide above for the information about what each of those values should be. Following our same example of a student list using the aforementioned values, our Vlookup formula would look like this: =VLOOKUP(F3,A2:B32,2,FALSE), Select the cell with your Vlookup code. In the bottom right corner, select the cell handle and drag it to include one or more other cells.


This allows you to search using Vlookup, because you must have at least two cells in order to have an input/output of information.
You can enter the purpose of each cell in an adjacent (but not joined) cell. For example, to the left of the box where you search for a student, you can put “Student Names.”

, To do this, enter the lookup value, as per our example it would be the name of a student, in one of the cells that you included in your Vlookup code. Then, Vlookup should automatically supply you with the grade of said student in the adjoined cell."

,, Excel will AutoFill the rest of the formulas for you!

"
"
Use the SUM function to add two or more cells.,
Use the SUM function to add a range of cells.,
Use the AutoSum Wizard.,
Copy/paste data into other cells.,
Reference sums in other functions.",How to Use Summation Formulas in Microsoft Excel1," Type an equals (=) sign, the SUM function, and the numbers you are adding surrounded by parenthesis(). For example: =SUM(your numbers here) , or =SUM(C4,C5,C6,C7). This formula will add together all numbers and cells within the parentheses.;
, If you provide a start and an end cell, separated by a colon (:), you can include large sections of the spreadsheet in your calculation. For example: '=SUM(C4:C7) tells Excel to add the value from C4, the value from C7, and everything in between.


You don't have to type out ""C4:C7"" - you can click and hold on cell C4, and drag your mouse down to highlight all the cells from C4 to C7 to automatically enter the formula values. Add the parenthesis at the end, and you're done. For large columns of numbers, this is a much faster method than clicking on each and every cell individually.

, Alternately, if you are using Excel 2007 or later, you can have excel perform this functions automatically by selecting a cell next to the desired range and pressing “AutoSum > Sum”.


AutoSum is limited to contiguous cell ranges - meaning if you want to skip cells in your calculation it may not work correctly.

, Since the cell with the function holds both the sum and the function, you have to consider which information you want copied.


Copy a cell (“Edit > Copy”), then select another cell and go to “Edit > Paste > Paste Special”. Here you can select whether to paste the cell value (sum result) or formula into the destination cell.

, The value of your summation cell can be called in other functions in your spreadsheet. Rather than re-adding information or typing out the number value of your previous function, you can reference the cell in other calculations to automatically use the result.


For example, if you add all of column C and want to add the result to sum of column D, rather than typing it all out you can refer to the cell containing the summation of column C in your summation formula for column D.

To understand the Solver, it’s important to understand the basic concept of what it does and how it works.",How to Use Solver in Microsoft Excel1," There are 3 primary components you should be familiar with.



Target Cell. This is the cell that represents the goal or objective of the problem. In our example, we will be attempting to have a schedule that has no shortfall in staffing. The cell that reports any shortfall will be our Target Cell.

Variable Cells are the cells that can be modified to arrive at the desired outcome. In our example, that will be work hours from Monday through Friday for all employees.

Constraints. This are restrictions or limitations to what Solver can do to solve the problem. For example, if Employee X cannot work Tuesdays, Solver is restricted from assigning an employee work on Tuesdays.;

Enter the formula into a spreadsheet cell.,
Hit the Enter key.",How to Use Summation Formulas in Microsoft Excel2," Select a cell and type an equals (=) sign, then alternate between clicking on the first number you need to add, then typing the plus (+) sign, then clicking on the second number you want to add, and so on. Each time you click on another number, Excel will insert the cell reference for you (C4, for example), which tells Excel which spreadsheet cell contains the number (for C4, it's the cell in column C, in row 4). Your finished formula should look something like this: =C4+C5+C6+C7.


If you know which cells you want to calculate, you can type them out at once instead of selecting them individually.
Excel functions will recognize mixed numbers and cell entries. That is, you could add 5000+C5+25.2+B7.

, Excel will automatically add the numbers together for you.

"
"
Set up your data for a SUMIF function.,
Enter the function into a cell.",How to Use Summation Formulas in Microsoft Excel3," Since SUMIF can interpret non-numeric data, your data tables will need to be set up a little differently from a basic + or SUM function. Create one column with number values and a second column with a conditional value, like “yes” and “no”. For example, a column with 4 rows with values 1-4 and a second column with alternating values of “yes” or “no”.

, Select a cell and enter “=SUMIF” then enclose the conditions in parentheses. First you must enter a range, then criteria, then a second range to summate. In this case, the criteria the yes/no condition, the range will be the cells containing those criteria, and the summation range is the target values. For example: =SUMIF(C1:C4, yes, B1:B4). This means the column C, which contains the yes/no condition, will add any values from column B where column C reads “yes”.


The cell range will vary depending upon your data table.

"
"
Setup your data table.,
Enter your SUMIFS function.",How to Use Summation Formulas in Microsoft Excel4," The setup for this data table is much like for SUMIF, but it can support multiple criteria differing ranges. Make a column with numeric values, a second column with a conditional value (e.g. yes/no), and a third column with another conditional value (e.g. date).

, Select a cell and enter “=SUMIFS()”. Within the parentheses enter the summation range, criteria ranges, and target criteria. Important to note, with SUMIFS the sum rage is the first value. For example, =SUMIFS(B1:B4, C1:C4, yes, D1:D4, “>1/1/2011”). This will calculate the sum of column B, as long as column C has the condition “yes” and column D reads a date later than 1/1/2011 (“>” and “<” are symbols used to denote greater than and less than).


Note that the ranges can be variable, which can be useful for large data tables.

When it’s finished processing, Solver will either return a solution, or alert you that it was not able to do so.
If Solver is not able to find a solution, you must think through, diagnose, and debug, your problem. First, revert to your original values.

The two quickest fixes are to try different initial values and to add or remove constraints to the problem.

The heading is where the filter will be placed and will not be included in the data that is sorted. Each column can have a unique dataset (e.g. date, quantity, name, etc.) and contain as many entries as you wish to sort through.


You can freeze your headings in place by selecting the containing row and going to “View > Freeze Panes”. This will help keep track of filtered categories on large data sets.;
, Click and drag to select all of the cells you wish to be included in the filter. Since AutoFilter is, as the name implies, an automatic process, you cannot use it to filter non-contiguous columns. All columns in between will be set to filter with them.

, Go to the “Data” tab, then press “Filter”. Once activated, the column headers will have drop-down buttons. Using these buttons, you can set your filter options.

, Filters options can vary based upon the type of data within the cells. Text cells will filter by the textual content, while number cells will have mathematic filters. There are a few filters that are shared by both. When a filter is active a small filter icon will appear in the column header.


Sort Ascending: sorts data in ascending order based on the data in that column; numbers are sorted 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. and words are sorted alphabetically starting with a, b, c, d, e, etc.
Sort Descending: sorts data in descending order based on the data in that column; numbers are sorted in reverse order 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, etc. and words are sorted in reverse alphabetical order, e, d, c, b, a, etc.
Top 10: The first 10 rows of data in your spreadsheet or the first 10 rows of data from the filtered selection
Specific conditions: Some filter parameters can be set using value logic, like filtering values greater than, less than, equal to, before, after, between, containing, etc. After selecting one of these you will prompted to enter the parameter limits (e.g. After 1/1/2011 or greater than 1000).
Note: the filtered data is hidden from view, NOT deleted. You will not lose any data by filtering.

, A custom filter allows for multiple filters to be applied using “and/or” logic. The “Custom Filter…” option is listed at the bottom of the filter dropdown menu and brings up a separate window. Here you can select up to two filter options, then select the “And” or “Or” button to make those filter exclusive or inclusive.


For example: a column containing names could be filtered by those containing “A” or “B”, meaning Andrew and Bob would both appear. But neither would appear in a filter set for those containing both “A” and “B”.

, To clear a single filter, select the dropdown for the filtered column and select “Clear Filter From ”. To clear all filters, select any cell in the table and go to the “Data” tab and press “Clear” (next to the Filter toggle).

, If you want to disable the filters completely, simply deselect the AutoFilter option while the table is selected.

Decide on your level of detail; for example, considering everything worth more than 1% of your yearly income is a starting point.,
Build an inventory in the first column.,
Estimate the current value for each item, and put it in the second column.,
Add to the list all your debts, loans, mortgages, credit cards, and other open payments of relevant size.,
Build the total of all estimates.,
If you would like it more detailed, go back and add more lines for smaller things, of both groups (owned and owed).

",How to Use Excel for Your Finances1,";
, An inventory is a list of all the assets you own that are worth anything. To keep it simple, you should only consider assets that are of relevance; so list cars, houses, motorbikes, bank accounts, CDs, 401-ks, etc.; but skip the skirts in your closet, the books in your shelves, or the old TV.

, Be sure to be realistic; even though you paid 1299 $ for that plasma TV, what could you seriously get if you sold it now? Most household articles loose 50% right when you take them out of the shop. On the other hand, cars lose about 50% every three years, and houses only a small percentage if at all. Of course, bank accounts and cash is worth its current total.

, Spend some time to make the list complete; don't leave out things because they are 'kind of special' or 'everyone has them', or 'they will be soon gone'. For everything you owe, put the amount in the value column as a negative number.

, This is your net worth.

,"
"
Repeat the net worth calculation after a month, or a year.,
Compare the new total with the previous one.,
Divide the difference by your income for that period, and consider the resulting percentage - this is called the savings quota.,
Don't interpret too much into the first number.",How to Use Excel for Your Finances2," Copy the sheet you used, and start adapting it. Consider the list of items, and correct the worth where necessary, for example, deduct 1% for a car per month, and especially update the fast-changing things, like bank account and cash. Remember also your loans might have decreased, if you paid something off.

, Did it increase, or did it decrease? If it decreases, you might be living beyond your means. If it increases, you are accumulating wealth, which is generally a good thing.

, Typical US customers have a low savings quota, around 0% or even negative. In many European countries, a savings quota of 15-20% is considered normal.

, All your little estimation errors accumulate, and the result may just not be exact enough. Keep repeating it after another month or year. If you see a consistent direction, and you are sure you are not forgetting something relevant, take it more serious.


It is your decision what savings quota you want to target at, but with 0% you will have nothing when you retire, which does not sound to attractive. On the other hand, many people would consider saving 20% of their income as too much. You should try to stay safely away from 0%, and of course on the positive side.

"
"
In the inventory from above, put a number or code onto each line.,
Add further lines (accounts) to the inventory, which describe the different types of things you spend money on.,
Assign codes to these lines too.,
Start a new sheet, which will contain the log.,
Now the real work starts - add a line for each transaction.",How to Use Excel for Your Finances3," This will be your chart of accounts. You can use any coding you like, for example numbering them 001, 002, etc.; or using letters, like c01, c02 for credit card, b01, b02 for bank accounts, or whatever.

, Be as detailed or rough as you want to know it later; start rather small, and if you value the results, get more detailed. Typical lines would be 'food & drinks', 'gas & other car related', 'house related'. Simply come back here and add more lines when you find you missed something.

, Don't duplicate codes already used.

, Each transaction in your finances will be recorded in this sheet as one line. Create columns for 'date', 'description', 'amount', 'from account', and 'to account'.

, This is an ongoing process, not a one-day activity. Every evening, or latest every weekend, add the lines for all transactions. For example, if you get cash from your checking account, you would add a line like: '3/8/09 | took out cash | 200.00 $ | 100 | 120', where 100 and 120 would be the account numbers you assigned to 'bank' and 'cash'. If you shop in the supermarket, the line might be '3/9/09 | supermarket | 69.50 $ | 120 | 410', where 120 is again the account number for 'cash', and 410 is the code for 'food'.


Start calculating. Once you have some lines collected, you can make Excel do the math: for each account number, add with a formula all changes that affect it together. Whenever the account number is in the 'from' column, subtract the amount; if it is in the 'to' column, add it. For example, with the two example lines from above, the cash account would have a total of +200.00 -69.50 = +130.50, plus whatever the cash was before. You will need some more complex excel techniques for this, it is not trivial. There are many ways to do it in Excel, one option is a matrix formula, which might look something like ""=SUM(IF('Log'!$E=$C2;1;IF('Log'!$D=$C2;-1;0))*'Log'$C)"" - this means compare the values in column E and D of the log to the current lines code, and if they match, add the amount from column C, multiplied by 1 or -1.
The result will show the new totals for all your accounts in the inventory, and in the second part of that sheet, the cost for each line; for example the line 'food' would show the total of 69.50 $, which is what you spent for it.
If you use this process, you do not need to make a new inventory every period - it gets calculated automatically. You should check it for correctness, though; any differences mean that you forgot lines in the log.
You will be able to see your net worth changes all the time but be careful to analyze them only after some longer period. Obviously, the day you get your paycheck, your net worth jumps up, but the next days you are only spending, so it goes down again. Compare it only for corresponding days, like each time before your paycheck comes.

This only works for locked sheets and books. You'll still have to be able to open the file. You cannot unlock a password-protected file using this method.


This method is for when the structure of the workbook or worksheet has been locked, but you want to make edits to it.

, You should see an "".xlsx"" extension for the file. If you don't see any extensions, enable them in the View tab of the Explorer window by checking the ""File name extensions"" box.

, You will be warned by Windows that the file may become unusable. Confirm that you want to proceed.

, This will create a new folder in your current location with the same name as the Excel file.

, This will display all of the sheets in the document. Each sheet will be its own file, such as ""sheet1.xml"".

, This will open the XML information for the locked worksheet in Notepad.


If you're trying to unlock the entire workbook for editing, return to the ""xl"" folder and edit the ""workbook.xml"" file instead. The rest of the process is the same.

, You'll find it with information about the algorithm used to protect the sheet or workbook.


If you're trying to unlock a workbook, search ""workbookProtection"" instead.

, Select everything in the brackets containing the word ""sheetProtection"" and delete it. Save the file and close Notepad.

, Highlight the file you just edited and press Ctrl+C to copy it.

, Double-click it to open it instead of extracting it.

In Excel 2003, click the Data menu and select List.
In Excel 2007, 2010, and 2013 select either ""Table"" on the Insert menu ribbon or ""Format as Table"" in the Styles group on the Home menu ribbon. (The former option applies Excel's default table style, while the other lets you choose a style when you create the table. You can later apply or change the table style by selecting one of the options from the Table Styles group in the Table Tools Design menu ribbon.), If you did not previously select a group of cells, you will need to select the cells now. After you pick your range, a dialog box will appear, either the Create Table dialog (Create List dialog in Excel 2003) or the Format As Table dialog.


The ""Where is the data for your table?"" field displays the absolute reference(s) for the current cell(s) selected. If you want to change this information, you can type in a different cell or range reference.

, If your table has headers, check the ""My table has headers"" box. If you don't check this box, the table will display default header names (""Column 1,"" ""Column 2,"" etc.).


You can change a column name by selecting the header and typing in your own name in the formula bar.

, Move your mouse cursor over the sizing handle at the lower right corner of the table. Your cursor will change to a 2-sided diagonal arrow. Click and hold to “grab” the corner.

, Drag your cursor inward to reduce the table size, outward to enlarge it. Dragging your cursor adds or reduces the number of rows and columns.


Dragging your cursor up toward the column header reduces the number of rows in the table, while dragging your cursor down increases the number of rows.
Dragging your cursor to the left reduces the number of columns in the table, while dragging it to the right increases the number of columns. A new column header is created when a new column is added.

, A popup menu appears.

, Choose one of the Insert submenu options.


Select ""Insert Columns to the Left"" or ""Insert Columns to the Right"" to insert a new column in the table.
Select ""Insert Rows Above"" or ""Insert Rows Below"" to insert a new row in the table.

, Choose one of the Delete submenu options.

Select ""Table Rows"" to delete the entire row(s) containing the selected cell(s)., A dropdown menu will appear.

, The sort options appear at the top of the dropdown menu.


Choose ""Sort A to Z"" (or ""Sort Smallest to Largest"" if the data is numeric) to sort items in ascending order.
Choose ""Sort Z to A"" (or ""Sort Largest to Smallest"" if the data is numeric) to sort items in descending order.
Choose ""Sort By Color"" and then select ""Custom Sort"" from the submenu to set up a custom sort. If your data is displayed in multiple colors, you can select one of the colors from this submenu to sort your data by.

, You can access additional sort options by right-clicking on any cell in a column and selecting ""Sort"" from the popup menu. In addition to the options above, you can also sort by cell or font color or by cell icon.

, A dropdown menu will appear.

, Three sets of filtering options are available: ""Filter by Color,"" ""Text Filters,"" and ""Number Filters."" (The ""Text Filters"" option is displayed only when the column entries contain text, while the ""Number Filters"" option is displayed only when the column entries contain numbers.) Below that is a set of check boxes.


The ""Filter by Color"" option is enabled when the text or numbers are show in multiple colors. Select the color you wish to filter the data by.
The ""Text Filters"" option includes the options ""Equals,"" ""Does Not Equal,"" ""Greater Than,"" ""Begins With,"" ""Ends With,"" ""Contains,"" ""Does Not Contain,"" and a ""Custom Filter"" option.
The ""Number Filters"" option includes the options ""Equals"","" Does Not Equal,"" ""Greater Than,"" ""Greater Than or Equal To,"" ""Less Than,"" ""Less Than or Equal To,"" ""Between,"" ""Top 10,"" ""Above Average,"" ""Below Average,"" and a ""Custom Filter"" option.
The check boxes below these options include a ""Select All"" and ""Blanks"" option to display all data meeting the filtering criteria or all rows with blank cells in that column, as well as a listing of each unique data element (such as the same name) in that column. Check or uncheck the combination of boxes that will let your display only those rows with a cell that meets your criteria, such as checking the elements ""Smith"" and ""Jones"" to display sales figures for only those 2 individuals.
Excel 2010 and 2013 offer an additional filtering option: enter text or a number in the Search field and the display will be restricted to only those rows with an item in the column that matches the contents of that field.

, To restore the original display, select ""Clear Filter From "" from the dropdown menu. (The actual name of the column is displayed in this option.)

, This displays a popup menu. Select ""Table"" from the popup menu.

, A totals row will appear below the last row of the table, displaying a total of all the numeric data in each column.

, Click the menu on the Totals line for the value you want to adjust. You can choose what function you would like displayed. You can show the Sum, the Average, the Count, and more.

, If necessary, you'll have to add a blank column first. See ""Enlarging and Reducing Table Size"" and ""Inserting Table Rows and Columns"" for the methods to do this.

, Your formula is automatically copied into all the column's cells, whether above or below the cell you entered the formula in. You can also copy the formula into the column cells manually.


You can enter the formula in any row of the spreadsheet beneath the table, but you can't refer to any cells in those rows in the table reference.
You can type or move the formula into a column that already has data, but to make it a calculated column, you'll need to click the ""AutoCorrect Options"" button to overwrite the existing data. If you copy the formula, however, you'll have to manually overwrite the data by copying the formula into those cells.

, After creating the calculated column, you can later go back and create exceptions by typing data other than a formula in any of the cells, deleting the formula from 1 or more cells, or copying a different formula into some of the cells. Any exceptions to the calculated column formula, other than a formula deletion, will be clearly marked., You can pick from a variety of preset color combinations for your table. Click anywhere in the table to select it, and then click the Design tab if it is not already open.


Choose from one of the presets available in the Table Styles section. Click the More button on the right side to expand the list and see all the options.

, Click the More button on the right side of the list of preset styles. Click “New Table Style” at the bottom of the menu. This will open the “New Table Quick Style” window.


Give your style a name. If you want to easily access this style again, give it a name that you can remember or that describes the style.
Choose the element you want to adjust. You will see a list of table elements. Choose the one you want to edit and click the “Format” button.
Choose your formatting options. You can choose the font style, fill color, and border style from the Format menu. This formatting will be applied to the element you selected.

, If you are finished working with the data in a separate table, you can revert the table back into the spreadsheet, maintaining the data. Click anywhere in the table to select it.


Click the Design tab.
Click Convert to Range and then click Yes.
The table formatting will be removed, but the style will remain. You will no longer be able to sort and filter data.

Copy the data lists onto a single worksheet.,
Give each list item a unique identifier.,
Standardize data where possible.,
Create columns for the comparison formula.,
Enter the comparison formula in each cell.,
Sort the lists to see non-matching values more easily, if necessary.,
Compare the non-matching items visually to see why they don't match.",How to Match Data in Excel1," Excel can work with multiple worksheets within a single workbook, or with multiple workbooks, but you'll find comparing the lists easier if you copy their information onto a single worksheet.;
, If your two lists don't share a common way to identify them, you may need to add an additional column to each data list that identifies that item to Excel so that it can see if an item in a given list is related to an item in the other list. The nature of this identifier will depend on the kind of data you are trying to match. You will need an identifier for each column list.


For financial data associated with a given period, such as with tax records, this could be the description of an asset, the date the asset was acquired, or both. In some cases, an entry may be identified with a code number; however, if the same system is not used for both lists, this identifier may create matches where there are none or ignore matches that should be made.
In some cases, you can take items from one list and combine them with items from another list to create an identifier, such as a physical asset description and the year it was purchased. To create such an identifier, you concatenate (add, combine) data from two or more cells using the ampersand (&). To combine an item description in cell F3 with a date in cell G3, separated by a space, you'd enter the formula '=F3&"" ""&G3' in another cell in that row, such as E3. If you wanted to include only the year in the identifier (because one list uses full dates and the other uses only years), you'd include the YEAR function by entering '=F3&"" ""&YEAR(G3)' in cell E3 instead. (Do not include the single quotes; they are there only to indicate the example.)
Once you've created the formula, you can copy it into all other cells of the identifier column by selecting the cell with the formula and dragging the fill handle over the other cells of the column where you want to copy the formula. When you release your mouse button, each cell you dragged over will be populated with the formula, with the cell references adjusted to the appropriate cells in the same row.

, While the mind recognizes that ""Inc."" and ""Incorporated"" mean the same thing, Excel doesn't unless you have it re-format one word or the other. Likewise, you may consider values such as $11,950 and $11,999.95 as close enough to match, but Excel won't unless you tell it to.


You can deal with some abbreviations, such as ""Co"" for ""Company"" and ""Inc"" for ""Incorporated by using LEFT string function to truncate the additional characters. Other abbreviations, such as ""Assn"" for ""Association,"" may best be dealt with by establishing a data entry style guide and then writing a program to look up and correct improper formats.
For strings of numbers, such as ZIP codes where some entries include the ZIP+4 suffix and others don't, you can again use the LEFT string function to recognize and match only the primary ZIP codes. To have Excel recognize numeric values that are close but not the same, you can use the ROUND function to round close values to the same number and match them.
Extra spaces, such as typing two spaces between words instead of one, can be removed by using the TRIM function.

, Just as you had to create columns for the list identifiers, you'll need to create columns for the formula that does the comparing for you. You'll need one column for each list.


You'll want to label these columns with something like ""Missing?""

, For the comparison formula, you'll use the MATCH function nested inside another Excel function, ISNA.


The formula takes the form of ""=ISNA(MATCH(G3,$L$3:$L$14,FALSE))"", where a cell of the identifier column of the first list is compared against each of the identifiers in the second list to see if it matches one of them. If it doesn't match, a record is missing, and the word ""TRUE"" will be displayed in that cell. If it does match, the record is present, and the word ""FALSE"" will be displayed. (When entering the formula, do not include the enclosing quotes.)
You can copy the formula into the remaining cells of the column the same way you copied the cell identifier formula. In this case, only the cell reference for the identifier cell changes, as putting the dollar signs in front of the row and column references for the first and last cells in the list of the second cell identifiers makes them absolute references.
You can copy the comparison formula for the first list into the first cell of the column for the second list. You'll then have to edit the cell references so that ""G3"" is replaced with the reference for the first identifier cell of the second list and ""$L$3:$L$14"" is replaced with the first and last identifier cell of the second list. (Leave the dollar signs and colon alone.) You can then copy this edited formula into the remaining cells in the comparison row of the second list.

, If your lists are large, you may need to sort them to put all the non-matching values together. The instructions in the substeps below will convert the formulas to values to avoid recalculation errors, and if your lists are large, will avoid a long recalculation time.


Drag your mouse over all the cells in a list to select it.
Select Copy from the Edit menu in Excel 2003 or from the Clipboard group of the Home ribbon in Excel 2007 or 2010.
Select Paste Special from the Edit menu in Excel 2003 or from the Paste dropdown button in the Clipboard group of Excel 2007 or 2010s Home ribbon.
Select ""Values"" from the Paste As list in the Paste Special dialog box. Click OK to close the dialog.
Select Sort from the Data menu in Excel 2003 or the Sort and Filter group of the Data ribbon in Excel 2007 or 2010.
Select ""Header row"" from the ""My data range has"" list in the Sort By dialog, select ""Missing?"" (or the name you actually gave the comparison column header) and click OK.
Repeat these steps for the other list.

, As noted previously, Excel is designed to look for exact data matches unless you set it up to look for approximate ones. Your non-match could be as simple as an accidental transposing of letters or digits. It could also be something that requires independent verification, such as checking to see if listed assets needed to be reported in the first place.

If you want to highlight records in both lists, you'll want to highlight records that do match each other. For the purposes of this example, we'll assume the first list takes up cells G3 through G14 and the second list takes up cells L3 through L14.

If you want to highlight the records in each list that are found in the other list, you'll need two formulas, one for the first list and one for the second. The formula for the first list is ""=COUNTIF($L$3:$L$14,G3>0)"", while the formula for the second list is COUNTIF($G$3:$G$14,L3>0)"".

If you want to create a graph from pre-existing data, instead double-click the Excel document that contains the data to open it and proceed to the next section.;
, It's in the top-left side of the template window.

, To do so, click the A1 cell (X-axis) and type in a label, then do the same for the B1 cell (Y-axis).


For example, a graph measuring the temperature over a week's worth of days might have ""Days"" in A1 and ""Temperature"" in B1.

, To do this, you'll type a number or word into the A or B column to apply it to the X- or Y- axis, respectively.


For example, typing ""Monday"" into the A2 cell and ""70"" into the B2 field might show that it was 70 degrees on Monday.

, Once your data entry is complete, you're ready to use the data to create a bar graph.

, To do so, click the A1 cell, hold down ⇧ Shift, and then click the bottom value in the B column. This will select all of your data.


If your graph uses different column letters, numbers, and so on, simply remember to click the top-left cell in your data group and then click the bottom-right while holding ⇧ Shift.

, It's at the top of the Excel window, just right of the Home tab.

, This icon is in the ""Charts"" group below and to the right of the Insert tab; it resembles a series of three vertical bars.

, The templates available to you will vary depending on your operating system and whether or not you've purchased Excel, but some popular options include the following:



2-D Column - Represents your data with simple, vertical bars.

3-D Column - Presents three-dimensional, vertical bars.

2-D Bar - Presents a simple graph with horizontal bars instead of vertical ones.

3-D Bar - Presents three-dimensional, horizontal bars.

, Once you decide on a graph format, you can use the ""Design"" section near the top of the Excel window to select a different template, change the colors used, or change the graph type entirely.


The ""Design"" window only appears when your graph is selected. To select your graph, click it.
You can also click the graph's title to select it and then type in a new title. The title is typically at the top of the graph's window.

Insert a bar graph, if you are comparing several correlated items with a few variables.,
Choose a line graph.,
Select a scatter graph.,
Opt for a chart.",How to Make a Graph in Excel 2010,",, Typing in a data series requires you to organize your data. For most people, you will enter items in the first column, Column A, and enter the variables for each individual item in the following columns.


For example, if you are comparing the sales results of certain people, the people will be listed in Column A, while their weekly, quarterly and yearly sales results might be listed in the following columns.
Keep in mind that on most charts or graphs, the information in Column A will be listed on the x axis, or horizontal axis. However, in the case of bar graphs, the individual data automatically corresponds to the y axis, or vertical axis.

, Consider totaling your data in the last column and/or last rows. This is essential if you are using a pie chart that requires percentages.


To enter a formula in Excel, you highlight data in a row or column. Then, you click on the Function, fx, button and choose a type of formula, such as a sum.

, Use headings in the second row and column to explain your data. Titles will be transferred to the graph when you create it.
You can enter your data and headings into any section of the spreadsheet. If you are making a graph for the first time, you should aim to keep the data within a small area so it is easy to work with.

,, Drag your cursor from the top left heading to the bottom right corner of the data.


If you want a simple graph explaining only 1 data series, you should only highlight the information in the first column and the second column.
If you want to make a graph with several variables to show trends, highlight several variables.
Make sure you highlight the headers in the Excel 2010 spreadsheet.

, In Excel 2010, the Insert tab is located between the Home and Page Layout tabs. ,, Each type has a small icon next to it explaining what it will look like.


You can return to this chart menu to choose a different graph option as long as the graph is highlighted.

, Right click with your mouse and choose “Format Plot Area.”


Scroll through the choices in the left hand column, such as border, fill, 3-D, glow and shadow.
Reformat the look of the graph by selecting colors and shadows according to your preferences. , The bar for each item can be either clustered or stacked depending upon how you want to compare the variables.


Each item on the spreadsheet is listed separately in a single bar. There are no lines connecting them.
If you are using our previous example with weekly, quarterly and yearly sales, you can create a different bar in a different color for each individual. You can choose whether to have the bars side by side or condensed into a single bar.

, If you want to plot data over time, this is the best way to show how a data series has changed over time, such as in days, weeks or years.


Each piece of data in your series will be a dot on your line graph. The lines will connect these dots to show changes.

, This type of graph is similar to a line graph because it plots data on an x/y axis. You can choose to leave the data points unconnected in a marked scatter graph or connect them with smooth or straight lines.


The scatter graph is perfect for plotting many different variables on the same chart, allowing the smooth or straight lines to intersect. You can easily show trends in data.

, Surface charts are great for comparing 2 sets of data, area charts show changes in magnitude and pie charts show percentages of data. "

When grouping, Excel looks for data sandwiched between logical bookends (i.e. headings at the beginnings and formula totals at the ends), singles it out, and gives you the option of minimizing it. If Excel informed you that it could not create an automatic outline, it’s because your spreadsheet contains no formulas. You will have to group your data manually (skip to Manually Group Data below).;
, Depending on the complexity and arrangement of your spreadsheet, you will notice that section(s) of your data have become grouped and are now marked by bars along the top and/or left side of the cells. The example spreadsheet is very simple and has only been grouped in one place.

In the example outline, that data between the first row (the header) and the final two rows (both of which contain formulas) has been automatically grouped. Cell B7, for example, contains a SUM formula.


Click on the button to minimize a group of data.


Look at the data that remains. This is usually key information, giving the viewer the option of whether or not to investigate the specifics and making your spreadsheet easier to digest.


, If Excel has misinterpreted your data and you aren’t pleased with the results, you can clear your outline by going to Data > Ungroup (or Group and Outline) and selecting Clear Outline; from here, you manually group and ungroup data (see method below).

Count days in Excel.",How to Generate a Number Series in MS Excel," Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet developed by Microsoft for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and iOS. It features calculation, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming language called Visual Basic for Applications. It is part of the Microsoft Office package.


Once you have downloaded Excel, go to the Start Button. And then go to Microsoft office. Select Microsoft Excel.Click on Excel. Double-click on “blank workbook” to open it. Or, if you already have an Excel spreadsheet filled with data, open the spreadsheet.;
, A cell is one of the individual blocks that make up an Excel spreadsheet.


Type the number that you want to start the series with in that cell and hit enter. By way of example, type “1.” This is called a “value” in Excel terminology.Now, write the first few numbers of your series in adjacent cells. You could write them in the vertical columns or horizontally in a row., For example, if you want cells to increase by the same increment (say by “1”), then type two numbers with that increment. Thus, you would type “1” in the first cell and “2” in the cell beneath it.


If you want the number series to increase by increments of 2, you would type 2 and then 4.
If you want the series to use more complicated increments (say, “2, 4, 8, 16”) type the first three numbers so it doesn’t assume you are asking it for increments of 2.

, To do so, hold your cursor in the top left of the first cell, and drag it down to the last cell with a number in it (in the first example, the cell with the “2” in it.)Do this without letting your finger off the cursor. This will highlight the 2 (or 3) numbers that you have already typed into the cells.
Remember that, in Excel, cells form vertical columns but horizontal rows. You can create the number series vertically down a column, or horizontally across a row.

, The square will appear in the bottom right of the last cell you typed a number in (in the first example, the cell with the “2."")


The little black square will turn into a small black plus sign in the bottom right corner of that cell. This is called the fill handle. The key to creating a number series in MS Excel is the fill handle.
When you look at the individual cell, notice the green or black border around the cell. That means you are working in the active cell., Drag the cursor down the vertical column. Excel will automatically create a number series for as long as you drag your cursor.


Use the same process with a number series in a horizontal row. But drag your cursor horizontally. Remember, by default, Excel uses a linear growth pattern to determine these values.
If you already have a sequence of numbers and you just want to add to it, select the last two in the sequence and drag the fill handle to the new selection, and it will continue the list.

, Put your cursor in the cell at A1. This means the block that is located where Column A meets Row 1.


In A1, type =ROW(). This formula should generate the first number in your series. Select the fill handle on the bottom right of the A1 cell, and drag down or across to create the number series.
If you want to find the number of any cell, you can put your cursor in it, and type =ROW(C10), replacing C10 with the coordinates of that cell. Hit enter.

, This will open a shortcut menu that allows you to perform other functions with the number series.


To fill the series in increasing order, drag down or to the right. To fill in decreasing order, drag up or to the left.
In the shortcut menu, you can choose such options as fill series to populate the numbers or copy series.

, This same trick also allows you to count up by days. To make this work, type a date in any recognizable format in any one cell.


Drag the fill handle to the adjacent cells, and it will add the days as you go.
You can skip days, for example, showing every other day or every third day, as long as the sequence is repetitive.

"
"
Use a linear trendline for simple data.,
Use a logarithmic trendline for data that begins with a sharp change and levels out.,
Use a moving average trendline for rapidly fluctuating data.,
Use a polynomial trendline for gradually fluctuating data.,
Use a power trendline when working with measurements that increase at specific rates.,
Use an exponential trendline for data that rises or falls at rates that increase constantly.",How to Do Trend Analysis in Excel3," If your data fits best around a straight line, you'll want to use a linear trendline. This trendline represents a steady rate of increase or decrease.

, Data such as that for a startup business that experiences a flurry of initial sales that levels off over time can best be represented with this curved line.

, Data that cycles up and down, such as stock prices, can best be represented with a moving average trendline that smooths out the fluctuations to show the overall trend.


Moving average trendlines require setting a number of data points to be averaged; setting the period to two averages of each two successive points (first and second, second and third, third and fourth, etc.) to produce the points in the trendline.

, While a moving average trendline suppresses individual fluctuations, a polynomial trendline brings them out. This can be important for such things as analyzing fuel consumption at a given speed, where a peak (or bottom) value needs to be found.


Polynomial trendlines are classed according to the maximum number of peaks or valleys they contain. An Order 2 polynomial trendline has a single peak or bottom value, while an Order 3 trendline can have two such values, an Order 4 trendline can have up to three such values, and so on.

, This works with data sets such as those representing vehicle acceleration.


Power trendlines are valid only for data sets where all values are greater than zero.

, This trendline can be used with such things as radioactive decay, which progressively slows down over time.


Exponential trendlines are valid only for data sets where all values are greater than zero.

, This will create a new blank worksheet.

, This sheet will house the table that tracks all of your product's variable costs, such as shipping, commission, and other costs.

, To create a basic variable costs table, enter ""Description"" into A1 and ""Amount"" into B1.

, Below the ""Description"" header, enter the types of variable costs you'll be dealing with for your product.

, You'll be filling out the actual costs later in the process.

, Turning the data into a table will make it easy to plug into formulas later:


Select all of the data, including the header row and the blank amounts, by clicking and dragging your mouse over all of the cells.
Click the ""Format as Table"" button. You'll find this in the Home tab. If you're using Excel for Mac, click the Tables tab, click the ""New"" button, and then select ""Insert Table with Headers.""
Check the ""My table has headers"" box. This will preserve the labels in the first row as header labels.
Click the ""Table Name"" field in the upper-right corner and name it ""VariableCosts.""

, This will create another blank worksheet.

, This sheet will house all of the fixed costs for your product, such as rent, insurance, and other costs that don't change.

, Like with the Variable Costs sheet, create a ""Description"" label in cell A1 and a ""Amount"" label in cell B1.

, Fill out the first column with descriptions of your fixed costs, like ""Rent.""

, You'll be filling out these costs after creating the rest of the spreadsheet.

, Select everything you created on this sheet, including the headers:


Click the ""Format as Table"" button in the Home tab.
Check ""My table has headers"" to turn row 1 into headers for the table.
Click the ""Table Name"" field and name the table ""FixedCosts.""

, This sheet will house your main BEP (Break Even Point) chart. You don't have to rename it to ""BEP,"" but it will be easier to navigate your workbook if you do.

, For the purposes of this example, create your sheet using the following layout:


A1: Sales - This is the label for the Sales section of the spreadsheet.
B2: Price Per Unit - This will be the price you charge for each item you sell.
B3: Units Sold - This will be the number of units you have sold at the specified price in a set timeframe.
A4: Costs - This is the label for the Costs section of the spreadsheet.
B5: Variable Costs - These are the costs of your product that you have control over (shipping, commission rates, etc.)
B6: Fixed Costs - These are the costs of your product that you don't have control over (facility rent, insurance, etc.)
A7: Revenue - This is the amount of money selling your products generates before costs are considered.
B8: Unit Margin - This is the amount of money you make per unit after costs are considered.
B9: Gross Margin - This is the total amount of money you make for all the units sold after costs.
A10: BEP - This is the label for the Break Even Point section of the spreadsheet.
B11: Units - This is the number of units you need to sell to match your cost outlay.

, You'll need to change the numeric formats for certain cells in order for your data to appear correctly:


Highlight C2, C5, C6, C8, and C9. Click the drop-down menu in the ""Number"" section of the Home tab and choose ""Currency.""
Highlight C3 and C11. Click the drop-down menu and select ""More number formats."" Select ""Number"" and then set ""Decimal places"" to ""0.""

, Select and create the following ranges to make your formulas work. This will create variables that can be plugged into your formulas, allowing you to easily reference and update these values.


Select B2:C3 and then click the ""Formulas"" tab. Click ""Create from selection"" and then click ""OK.""
Select B5:C6 and then click the ""Formulas"" tab. Click ""Create from selection"" and then click ""OK.""
Select B8:C9 and then click the ""Formulas"" tab. Click ""Create from selection"" and then click ""OK.""
Select B11:C11 and then click the ""Formulas"" tab. Click ""Create from selection"" and then click ""OK.""

, This will calculate the total variable costs for the number of items you sell. Click C5 and enter the following formula:


=SUM(VariableCosts)*Units_Sold

, This will calculate the total fixed costs for your product. Click C6 and enter the following formula:


=SUM(FixedCosts)

, This will calculate the margin you make after variable costs have been considered. Click C8 and enter the following formula:


=Price_Per_Unit-SUM(VariableCosts)

, This determines the total amount you make for all of the units you sell after variable costs. Click C9 and enter the following formula:


=Unit_Margin*Units_Sold

, This takes your fixed costs and compares them to your margins, informing you how many units you need to sell to break even. Click C11 and enter the following formula:


=IFERROR(Fixed_Costs/Unit_Margin,0)

, Return to the VariableCosts table and fill out all of the costs related to your product. The more accurate you are here, the more accurate your BEP calculation will be.


Each cost in the VariableCosts table should be per unit sold.

, Enter these costs into your Fixed Costs table. These are the costs of running your business, and should all be set to the same interval (for example, monthly costs).

, In the BEP sheet, enter an initial estimated price per unit. You'll be able to adjust this as you perform the calculations

, This is the number of units you intend to sell in the same timeframe as your Fixed Costs. For example, if your fixed costs includes monthly rent and insurance, the Units Sold will be the number of units sold in that same timeframe.

, The Units output cell (C11) will display the number of units that you'll need to sell in your timeframe to break even. This number will change depending on the Price Per Unit as well as your Variable Costs and Fixed Costs tables.

, Changing the Price Per Unit will change the number of units you need to break even. Try changing the price and see what happens with your BEP value."

A pivot table will allow you to create visual reports of the data from a spreadsheet. You can perform calculations without having to input any formulas or copy any cells. In order to create a pivot table, you will need a spreadsheet with a lot of data.;
,






Your spreadsheet should include at least one column with duplicate values. This basically just means that at least one column should have repeating data. Also, It should include numerical information. This is what will be compared and totaled in the table.

,


By default, Excel will select all of the data on the spreadsheet. You can highlight (click and drag) to choose the specific data in which you wish to include.

,






Click the Insert tab at the top of the Excel window. Click the pivot table button on the far left.

,


By default, Excel will place the table on a new worksheet. You can switch back and forth from the spreadsheet and the pivot tables by using the tabs at the bottom of the page.

,


Click into the pivot table anywhere, and on the right had side; a list of the columns will be displayed. Check each box you wish to include in the pivot.

,






After all the needed information is put into the pivot, the order can be changed by clicking the column heading and dragging it to the desired spot.

,

Every column will have subtotals in each row of data. Unless this is correct, right click the column in which there are unwanted subtotals. After you right click in the column, unselect subtotals.

,


Repeat the previous process in a separate Excel document using the alternate data. Make sure to order the data the exact same way as the first document.

,


Copy and paste both pivot tables onto the document. Make sure they are in the same order so they line up properly.

,

Look for mistakes in alignment, and make sure everything is matched up to what it is supposed to be.

,

Now is time to see how the data compares. The differences are easily seen in the totals of each table.

Time: hh:mm:ss will give you the full time. You can also enter any part of that for more abbreviated time displays.

Day of week: as described above, ddd gives you the abbreviated day name, and dddd gives you the full day name.

Date: dd will give you the date with a leading zero for the 1st through the 9th. A single d will drop the leading zero.

Month: mmm will give you the abbreviated month, and mmmm will give you the month spelled out.

Year: For just the decade, use yy. For the complete year, use yyyy.


For example, to have field A1 (as above) read as ""Wed, 7 Nov., 2012"" you would enter ""=TEXT((A1), ""ddd, d mmm., yyyy""). Make sure you include the quotes, and that your parentheses are balanced (as many open ones as closed ones).

Excel has different formulas for figuring out the standard deviation of an entire population and the standard deviation of the sample of a population. Keep this in mind when you choose your formula later on.

,


The locations and functions of the Excel program can differ greatly depending upon the version you use. If you cannot find a button on the formatting bar, look in the top horizontal toolbar.

Enter headings at the top of the columns.
Enter the name or date that identifies each occurrence on the left of each row. Enter the corresponding data on the right.

,,


You can also place the standard deviation number in any other empty cell in the Excel spreadsheet. Excel may automatically figure out your data range if you put it underneath a list of numbers.

, Remember that the formula should be entered without spaces.

, This is the Excel syntax for standard deviation. When you use this abbreviation for a data range, Excel will figure out mean and standard deviation automatically.


Excel formulas differ depending upon the version of Excel you are using. Although STDEV is fairly standard, you may need to use STDEVA or STDEVAP in its place.
Choose either STDEV.P or STDEV.S to signify whether you are using an entire population or a sample population.

, A data range is a series of numbers in a certain column or row.


In Excel, data ranges are listed in the following manner: (C2:C15). Your entire formula would be ""=STDEV(C2:C15).""

, Your standard deviation for your sample should appear in the box.

, Switch to the formula bar. Here, write =DATEDIF(A1,B1,""d"") (A1 being the cell with start date and A2 with end date.) It will output the number of days between the two dates.


The syntax is: =DATEDIF(start_date,end_date,mode)

The various modes that can be used are ""m"", ""y"", ""d"", ""ym"", ""yd"", ""md""

""m"" refers to only months.
""y"" refers to only years.
""d"" refers to only dates.
""ym"" filters off the unique years and returns the month difference between the months considering both years to be same.
""yd"" filters off the unique years and returns the month difference between the days considering both years to be same.
""md"" filters off the unique months and returns the difference between the days considering both months to be same.

Enter the numbers you want to find the average of.,
Find the average of the numbers you entered.,
Observe the result in the cell you entered the formula in.",How to Calculate Averages in Excel1," To illustrate how each of the central tendency functions works, we’ll use a series of ten small numbers. (You won’t likely use actual numbers this small when you use the functions outside these examples.)


Most of the time, you’ll enter numbers in columns, so for these examples, enter the numbers in cells A1 through A10 of the worksheet.
The numbers to enter are 2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 9, 16, and 19.
Although it isn’t necessary to do this, you can find the sum of the numbers by entering the formula “=SUM(A1:A10)” in cell A11. (Don’t include the quotation marks; they’re there to set off the formula from the rest of the text.);
, You do this by using the AVERAGE function. You can place the function in one of three ways:


Click on an empty cell, such as A12, then type “=AVERAGE(A1:10)” (again, without the quotation marks) directly in the cell.
Click on an empty cell, then click on the “fx” symbol in the function bar above the worksheet. Select “AVERAGE” from the “Select a function:” list in the Insert Function dialog and click OK. Enter the range “A1:A10” in the Number 1 field of the Function Arguments dialog and click OK.
Enter an equals sign (=) in the function bar to the right of the function symbol. Select the AVERAGE function from the Name box dropdown list to the left of the function symbol. Enter the range “A1:A10” in the Number 1 field of the Function Arguments dialog and click OK.

, The average, or arithmetic mean, is determined by finding the sum of the numbers in the cell range (80) and then dividing the sum by how many numbers make up the range (10), or 80 / 10 = 8.


If you calculated the sum as suggested, you can verify this by entering “=A11/10” in any empty cell.
The mean value is considered a good indicator of central tendency when the individual values in the sample range are fairly close together. It is not considered as good of an indicator in samples where there are a few values that differ widely from most of the other values.

"
"
Enter the numbers you want to find the median for.,
Find the median value of the numbers you entered.,
Observe the result in the cell you entered the function in.",How to Calculate Averages in Excel2," We’ll use the same range of ten numbers (2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 9, 16, and 19) as we used in the method for finding the mean value. Enter them in the cells from A1 to A10, if you haven’t already done so.

, You do this by using the MEDIAN function. As with the AVERAGE function, you can enter it one of three ways:


Click on an empty cell, such as A13, then type “=MEDIAN(A1:10)” (again, without the quotation marks) directly in the cell.
Click on an empty cell, then click on the “fx” symbol in the function bar above the worksheet. Select “MEDIAN” from the “Select a function:” list in the Insert Function dialog and click OK. Enter the range “A1:A10” in the Number 1 field of the Function Arguments dialog and click OK.
Enter an equals sign (=) in the function bar to the right of the function symbol. Select the MEDIAN function from the Name box dropdown list to the left of the function symbol. Enter the range “A1:A10” in the Number 1 field of the Function Arguments dialog and click OK.

, The median is the point where half the numbers in the sample have values higher than the median value and the other half have values lower than the median value. (In the case of our sample range, the median value is 7.) The median may be the same as one of the values in the sample range, or it may not.

"
"
Enter the numbers you want to find the mode for.,
Find the mode value for the numbers you entered.,
Enter the mode function you’ve chosen.,
Observe the result in the cell you entered the function in.",How to Calculate Averages in Excel3," We’ll use the same range of numbers (2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 9, 16, and 19) again, entered in cells from A1 through A10.

, Excel has different mode functions available, depending on which version of Excel you have.


For Excel 2007 and earlier, there is a single MODE function. This function will find a single mode in a sample range of numbers.
For Excel 2010 and later, you can use either the MODE function, which works the same as in earlier versions of Excel, or the MODE.SNGL function, which uses a supposedly more accurate algorithm to find the mode.(Another mode function, MODE.MULT returns multiple values if it finds multiple modes in a sample, but it is intended for use with arrays of numbers instead of a single list of values.)

, As with the AVERAGE and MEDIAN functions, there are three ways to do this:


Click on an empty cell, such as A14 then type “=MODE(A1:10)” (again, without the quotation marks) directly in the cell. (If you wish to use the MODE.SNGL function, type “MODE.SNGL” in place of “MODE” in the equation.)
Click on an empty cell, then click on the “fx” symbol in the function bar above the worksheet. Select “MODE” or “MODE.SNGL,” from the “Select a function:” list in the Insert Function dialog and click OK. Enter the range “A1:A10” in the Number 1 field of the Function Arguments dialog and click OK.
Enter an equals sign (=) in the function bar to the right of the function symbol. Select the MODE or MODE.SNGL function from the Name box dropdown list to the left of the function symbol. Enter the range “A1:A10” in the Number 1 field of the Function Arguments dialog and click OK.

, The mode is the value that occurs most often in the sample range. In the case of our sample range, the mode is 7, as 7 occurs three times in the list.


If two numbers appear in the list the same number of times, the MODE or MODE.SNGL function will report the value that it encounters first. If you change the “3” in the sample list to a “5,” the mode will change from 7 to 5, because the 5 is encountered first. If, however, you change the list to have three 7s before three 5s, the mode will again be 7.

Demand for tonic increased, so the second shipment was for 40 cases. However, due to demand, the price of tonic went up to $30 per case. Enter “$30” in cell A3 and “40” in cell B3.
Because the price went up, demand for tonic went down, so the third shipment was for only 20 cases. With the lower demand, the price per case went down to $25. Enter “$25” in cell A4 and “20” in cell B4.

, Unlike figuring a single average, Excel doesn’t have a single function to figure a weighted average. Instead you’ll use two functions:


SUMPRODUCT. The SUMPRODUCT function multiplies the numbers in each row together and adds them to the product of the numbers in each of the other rows. You specify the range of each column; since the values are in cells A2 to A4 and B2 to B4, you’d write this as “=SUMPRODUCT(A2:A4,B2:B4)”. The result is the total dollar value of all three shipments.
SUM. The SUM function adds the numbers in a single row or column. Because we want to find an average for the price of a case of tonic, we’ll sum up the number of cases that were sold in all three shipments. If you wrote this part of the formula separately, it would read “=SUM(B2:B4)”.


Since an average is determined by dividing a sum of all numbers by the number of numbers, we can combine the two functions into a single formula, written as “=SUMPRODUCT(A2:A4,B2:B4)/ SUM(B2:B4)”.







, The average per-case price is the total value of the shipment divided by the total number of cases that were sold.

The total value of the shipments is 20 x 10 + 30 x 40 + 25 x 20, or 200 + 1200 + 500, or $1900.
The total number of cases sold is 10 + 40 + 20, or 70.
The average per case price is 1900 / 70 = $27.14.

You don't need to use this for birthdays specifically. You can use any starting point, such as ""Shipping Date,"" ""Purchased Date,"" etc.

, Make sure each birthday is entered using the same format. If you're in the US, use MM/DD/YYYY. If you're elsewhere, use DD/MM/YYYY. Excel should automatically detect that you are entering dates, and will format the data accordingly.

=DATEDIF() is a function that calculates the difference between two dates. (B2,TODAY(),""Y"") tells DATEDIF to calculate the difference between the date in cell B2 (the first birthday listed) and the current date (TODAY()). It outputs the calculation in years (""Y"").

How would you make sense of all this data? You can enter all the corresponding letter grades manually. For example 95 percent means ""A"" and 90 percent means ""A-,"" or you can use the ""IF"" or ""LOOKUP"" function in Excel and have the grades entered automatically as you type the percentage.;
,, Type: =IF(B3>89,""A"",IF(B3>79,""B"", IF(B3>69,""C"",IF(B3>59,""D"",""F"")))). Notice that the letter in the roster will change live as you enter the grades. This IF function states that if B3 is > than 89 is true than assign a letter ""A"" grade. In the second example below, we will use the LOOKUP function. Type in =LOOKUP(B4,{40,45,60,65,80,85,90,95},{""D-"",""D"",""C-"",""C"",""B-"",""B"",""A-"",""A""})in B4 that corresponds to Dave. This will tell Excel to look-up the data in cell B4.

, Click the Design tab, and select one of the layouts from the Chart Layouts group.


If you have reduced the size of the Excel window, you can see the chart layouts in the Quick Layouts gallery. If you don’t see a layout style you like, click the More button to see additional layouts.

, Click the Design tab, and select one of the styles from the Chart Styles group.


If you have reduced the size of the Excel window, you can see the chart styles in the Quick Chart Styles gallery. If you don’t see a style you like, click the More button to see additional styles.

, If the chart’s size isn’t to your liking, you can adjust its size with the commands in the Size group on the Format tab.


Enter a number in the Height spin box or use the up or down arrows at the right of the field to increase or decrease the chart’s height.
Enter a number in the Width spin box or use the up or down arrows at the right of the field to increase or decrease the chart’s width.

, Adding a title to the chart makes it look more professional. You add, format, and position the chart title with the option buttons in the Labels group of the Layout tab.


Click Chart Title to display the chart positioning and naming options. Select the position option you want to place a dummy title on the chart.
Select the dummy title and type the title text you want to display.
Resize the title, if desired, by right-clicking it and entering the point size for the title text in the Size box on the popup menu that appears.
If you want to remove the chart title altogether, click Chart Title and select None.

, The Labels group of the Layout tab also has options to control the display and labeling of chart axes and data.


To label an axis, click the Axis Titles option button and select one of the options: Primary Horizontal Axis Title, Secondary Horizontal Axis Title (if the chart has secondary axes), Primary Vertical Axis Title, Secondary Vertical Axis Title (if the chart has secondary axes), or Depth Axis Title (if the chart is a 3-D chart). Enter the label in the Axis Title box.
To remove an axis title, click Axis Title, select the type of axis title you want to remove, and select None. You can also click on the axis title and press the Delete key on your keyboard.
To label the data, click anywhere in a data series to label the entire series, a specific point within a data series to label only that data point, or anywhere in the chart to label all data points. Click the Data Labels option button and select the desired display option. (The available options depend on the type of chart you’re making.)
To remove all data labels, click Data Labels and select None. To remove a specific data label, click it and press the Delete key on your keyboard.
To move the chart legend (created when you create the chart) to another location, click the Legend option button and select its new location from one of the display options. To hide the legend altogether, select None.

, Excel normally puts the chart on the same worksheet the data it displays is on, which is useful if you want to view or print the chart and data together. If you want to place the chart on its own chart sheet, do the following:


Select the chart by clicking on it. You will see the additional Design, Layout, and Format tabs on the ribbon.
Click the Design tab and select Move Chart from the Location group. This will display the options under “Choose where you want the chart to be placed.”
If you want to display the chart in its own sheet, select “New sheet.”
If you want to embed the chart in a different worksheet, select “Object in” and choose the worksheet from the list.
If you simply wish to move the chart to another location on the worksheet it was created on, click on it and drag it to its new location.

, Excel automatically gives your chart a name consisting of the word “Chart” plus a number. You will probably want to give the chart a more descriptive name, probably the same name as the title you gave the chart. To give the chart a name, select the chart and do the following:


Click the Layout tab and click the Chart Name text box within the Properties group.
Enter the new name in the text box.
Press the Enter key on your keyboard.

, A line chart consists of a series of data points connected by a line. Line charts can be used for short or long increments of time, provided the increments are of equal length.Line graphs show smaller changes better than do bar graphs.
You can also use a line graph to show changes over time for more than one group.Usually, a different color is used for each group.
Excel lets you display the lines in a line chart as either 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional. The 2-dimensional chart options allow you to display markers (plotted data points) or stack lines for multiple trends. Markers are best used when you have only a few data points to display, while stacked lines may not display as distinctly as 2-dimensional lines as they would as 3-dimensional lines or areas.

, Area charts differ in appearance from line charts in that the area below, and sometimes above, the trendline is colored. Different colors are used for different groups, such as blue for publicly traded companies and red for privately owned companies.


While line charts can show changes, such as increases or decreases in population, area charts can better show the totals resulting from those changes.
Area charts work best when you have a few groups to display, as the shading for the area on top may obscure parts of the charts beneath it. The shading can be made transparent, but doing so for a large number of charts can produce a muddy, indistinguishable color. In such cases, area charts need to be stacked correctly so that the chart with the smallest values overall is on top.Excel lets you display areas in an area chart as either 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional. Either type of chart may be stacked (showing peaks and valleys for each dataset) or 100% stacked (showing a graph fully colored in with trendlines dividing the colors).

, Bar graphs use horizontal or vertical bars to show comparison. In Excel, the term “bar chart” is used for charts that use horizontal bars, while charts that use vertical bars are called “column charts.”


Bar graphs that show comparison usually assign a bar to each distinct item in a group, such as types of movies or manufacturers of cars.Bar graphs that compare aspects of continuous data, such as height or weight, usually assign bars to smaller ranges within the overall ranges; these types of bar graphs are called histograms.When using bar graphs to track changes over time, they work better when the changes are significant (large).Excel lets you render bar and column charts with either 2-D or 3-D rectangular bars or columns. For variety, you can also choose to render the bars or columns as cylinders, cones, or pyramids.
Excel also lets you cluster bars and columns, stack them, or, with 3-D columns, place contrasting color columns in front of each other.

, Also called an X-Y chart, a scatter chart compares pairs of values against each other to see which value changes, and in which direction.If both values in increase at the same time, they are positively correlated.
If one value increases while the other decreases, they are negatively correlated.
If there is no discernible relationship between the values, they are not correlated.
Excel lets you create scatter charts with no lines, smooth lines, or jagged lines. Use the smooth style version when the values are not ordered by the x-axis or when the x and y values represent separate measurements. Use the jagged line version when the values are ordered by the x-axis Use the smooth line version when the relationship between the x and y values can be described by a mathematical function (such as y = x2).
Excel also lets you create your scatter chart with or without markers. (The lineless scatter chart is only available with markers.) Use markers when you have only a small number of data points; don’t use markers when you have many data points.

, The bubble chart is similar to the scatter chart, except that you use it to compare sets of three values, with the third value represented by the size of the bubble.


Bubble charts in Excel are most similar to the lineless scatter chart with markers. You may select one of the Bubble Chart options under Other Charts in the Charts group of the Insert tab, choosing bubbles with or without a 3-D effect.

, Pie charts are circular charts composed of wedges of various sizes; the larger a given wedge is, the greater the part of the whole it represents.


Pie charts should be used only when the items represented with each wedge form a meaningful larger group, such as a company composed of several divisions as opposed to unrelated occupations. (In the latter case, a bar or column chart is the better chart to choose.)Each slice in the pie chart should be of a distinguishable width from each of the other slices. In practical terms, this means the pie chart should not have a large number of thin slices.(If this is the case, the groups can be better compared with a bar or column chart. )
Each slice in a pie chart should represent a unique part of the whole, with no item in the group represented by that slice anything that can be represented by any of the other slices.(You can, however, show a breakdown of any given slice within your Excel pie chart by choosing to represent it as a smaller pie or bar chart.)
Excel lets you display pie charts as 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional. (The “Pie of Pie” and “Bar of Pie” options are available only for the 2-dimensional pie chart.) You may also display an “exploded” pie chart, where each slice is separate instead of contiguous.
If you are comparing parts to the whole when you have multiple data series, you may wish to use Excel’s doughnut chart options instead of a pie chart. (The doughnut chart has a hole in the middle; each part is represented by a segment of the doughnut.) The Doughnut Chart options are listed under Other Charts; you may select a doughnut with contiguous segments or one with separated (“exploded”) segments.

, A surface chart is a kind of topographic map of data, in that it uses colors to represent ranges of data values instead of separate datasets. It is commonly used in scientific and engineering applications, such as evaluating the tensile strength of metals.Excel makes its four surface chart options available under Other Charts.


Excel offers two views, a surface (or side) view and a contour (or top) view. The surface view displays a continuing curve with bands of color to represent the data ranges within the curve, giving the overall appearance of a multi-colored tent. The contour view bears a stronger resemblance to a topographic map, showing colored bands bounded by lines that each represent a distinct value.
For each view, you can choose to show the data ranges as colored bands or only the range boundary lines (wireframe). The wireframe views are harder to read, but may be the better option when you are dealing with very large datasets to save on plotting time., Also called a star chart or spider chart, a radar chart projects values outward from the chart center; the larger the value, the further the projection from the center.Radar charts can be used when line or area charts would be harder to read because of overlapping data ranges.


Excel places its radar chart options under Other Charts. You can display a basic radar chart with outlined shapes, a radar chart with outlined shapes and markers, or a chart with the shapes filled in.

, A stock chart is a specialized form of column chart designed to track the performance of a stock over a period of time. To use a stock chart, your data must include at least the stock’s high and low price and its closing price for each day to be displayed in the chart.


Excel displays its stock chart options under Other Charts. The simplest chart option, High-Low-Close, will display a vertical line connecting the high and low price and a square marker somewhere along the line.
If you have and wish to chart the open price as well as the other three prices, select the Open-High-Low-Close option. The high and low prices will be connected by a vertical line, while the open and close prices will be connected with a thin rectangular strip.
If you have and wish to chart the trading volume as well as the high, low, and close prices, select the Volume-High-Low-Close option. The high, low, and close prices for a day will be displayed above thicker vertical bars representing the number of shares traded for that day.
If you have and wish to chart the trading volume and open price as well as the other three prices, select the Volume-Open-High-Low-Close option. This stock chart will display vertical lines to connect high and low prices, rectangular strips to connect open and closing prices, and vertical bars to show trading volume.
A stock chart can also be used to track some scientific data, such as daily temperature fluctuations.

, This will display the Design tab, as well as the Format and Layout tabs.

,, Creating a template from a chart stores the formatting and colors used by that chart, and automatically applies them to any new chart created from that template. This can be useful if you plan to create several of the same type of chart to compare side-by-side.


Unless you specify a different folder to place it in, your chart template will be saved in the Charts folder. It will be available in both the Insert Chart and Change Chart Type dialog boxes under “Templates.”
If you prefer not to apply the template colors to a chart created from it, right-click the chart area and select “Reset to Match Style” on the popup menu."

Into cell E1, type Number. 

, Into cell A2, input 2880 (as the number of adjusted rows in the data-set). In cell B2, input the formula ""=-(1-sqrt(5))/2"" (without quote marks). This is the Golden Mean or Ratio or Proportion, known since Euclid's time, such that a:b as b:(a+b), and is quadratic and has many special properties -- it's used because it maintains in proportion the square of a number to the number such that for the Pythagorean Theorem, a given Pythagorean triplet will grow in constant proportion to itself, and since the sine and cosine functions are Pythagorean functions, it applies to them as well. In cell C2, input .125 or ""=1/8"". Into cell D2, input w/o quotes ""=IF(Spheroids<=24, Spheroids*VLOOKUP(Spheroids,LOOKER2,2)*2,Spheroids)"". Into E2 type 1.,

Into cell H3, type Variable.

,,

Into cell A4, input ""=Base*12/(VARIABLE*1)*PI()"" -- the empty parentheses for pi are correct.
Into B4, input 1712, which is 2^4 * 107 (where 2^4 means 2 raised to the power of 4).
MODIFIED: Into cell C4, type 64 for now -- the lookup table that is going to be prepared is set to take any number of spheroids up to 150.
MODIFIED: Into cell D4, type 1 for now. Setting up another plot column set of data with ShrinkExpand set to a different value will insert or surround one circle of spheroids with another one.
Into cell E4, input 180. Differentiating this variable creates special effects.
MODIFIED; Into cell F4, type 1.
Into cell G4, type 2.
Into cell H4, type 1.

, Do the same for cell range A4:G4 please., Generally, viewing 4 decimal places will inform one of the differences in the sine and cosine function results.,

MODIFIED Into cell B6, input the formula, ""=(Base*24/Spheroids)"". Into cell B7, type ""=B6"". Do Edit Go To cell range B7:B2886 and do Edit Fill Down.
Into cell A6, input ""=If(odd(Spheroids)=Spheroids,0,Tip)"". This formula states that if the number of spheroids input is odd, result=0, else result=Tip (where Tip was defined above as 12*PI()*B4 or 1712, for a total of 64,540.8795). In the case of the result becoming 0, the column will decrement to twice Tip, negatively from 0. The number of spheroids charted will be odd, eg. 31.

, The value in cell A2886 should be decremented to -64,540.8795 if spheroids is even (eg. at 32), else it will equal 2*-64,540.8795.,

Do Edit Go To cell range C6:C2886 and input into cell C6 the formula, ""=Thickness*Spheroids/KEY*(COS((ROW()-6)*Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))"" (without the quotation marks, as always). Do Edit Fill Down. By taking the cosine of the cell 6 rows up from cell C6, we are taking the cosine of 0 to begin with, then in subsequent rows, take the cosine up to 360 and in cycles then to 2880+6. 2880/360=8. So there are 8 cycles. Number is a variable for getting partial circle effects like animation motion likenesses when a fraction because the next piece, *PI()/PiDivisor. converts from pi radians to degrees and vice versa. Recall that PiDivisor is set to 180 degrees. Multiplying by Factor1 is taking back the 8 by 1/8th.
Do Edit Go To cell range D6:D2886 and input into cell D6 the following formula: ""=Thickness*Spheroids/KEY*(SIN((ROW()-6) *Number*PI()/PiDivisor*Factor1))"". Do Edit Fill Down.

, Do that now for cell C2 until you see the red corner flag and remember to do it for all the other formulas later please. The Abs() Absolute function allows one to input a negative number of spheroids; the effect will be to flip the graph 180 degrees horizontally (from left to right or right to left), as one can tell with an odd number of spheroids.,

Do Edit Go To cell range E6:F2886. Press the Charts button, All, or Chart Wizard. Select chart type Scatter Smoothed Line Scatter. Command c copy it and access the new worksheet and command v paste it into the new worksheet. Your chart should look like the example above except for detailing and the second helix is to be deleted as messy. Adjust the chart size by dragging the bottom right corner until you get a rectangular plot area about 5"" tall by 3"" wide. Get rid of the Vertical and Horizontal Axes, Legend and Grid lines via the Chart Layout tab. Clicking on the plot area will give access to the gradient style; the setting for that are Plot Area Fill Gradient Radial Centered Far Left White, 30% Ultramarine Blue, 55% Deep Navy Blue, no Line, Shadow, Glow or 3-D Format. Double-clicking on the chart plot line itself will give access to changing that under Format Selection of Chart Layout: set Series 1 Line to Ultramarine Blue, smoothed line, weight 1 pt. Glow is medium dark muddy red wine 1 pt 0 transparency 0 pt soft edges. Shadow for the line is checked, Perspective, 248 degrees, dark navy blue 33% size, 0 pt blur, 72 pt distance and 11% transparent. Chart Area Fill Gradient is Radial Centered left 41% White and fully right 100% Hot Pink Fuschia.

,, Under all that data, paste a picture of the chart by going to the Chart worksheet, clicking in the Plot Area, holding down the shift key and doing Copy Picture, then lift off the shift key, go to the Saves worksheet, depress the Shift Key again and do Paste Picture. Make a note that cell O2889 equaled 6, Looker was defined to 150 and Looker2 to 24. You can make the formulas come out with no errors in the Saves worksheet by filling in the reference with 6 that is under the c in the CONICAL HELIX DATA Section and them cutting it and pasting it back above closer to the data set copies., This is the variation called the ""Unwinding Vajra""

This is very useful if you want the column headers or row labels to be visible anywhere on the spreadsheet. You can only freeze whole rows or columns., Find the ""Window"" group. This contains the ""Freeze Panes"" button.

, If your top row contains column headers and you want them to always be visible, you can freeze the top row. Click the ""Freeze Panes"" button and select ""Freeze Top Row"". A line will appear underneath the top row, and it will stay on the screen if you scroll down.

, If you have a lot of columns that you need to fill out and want to be able to see the identifier for each row, you can freeze the leftmost column. Click the ""Freeze Panes"" button and select ""Freeze First Column"". A line will appear to the right of the first column, and it will stay on screen if you scroll to the right.

, You can freeze both columns and rows if you want them to stay on the screen. The frozen columns and rows must connect to the edge of the spreadsheet, but you can freeze multiple columns and rows at once.


For example, you can freeze columns A and B, but you can't freeze just column B.
To choose what you want frozen, select the column that you want to be the new upper corner, click the ""Freeze Panes"" button, and then select ""Freeze Panes"". Everything above and to the left of the cell will be frozen. For example, if you select cell C5, rows 1-4 will be frozen along with columns a and B.

, If you want to return the spreadsheet to normal, click the ""Freeze Panes"" button and select ""Unfreeze Panes"". The frozen cells will be unlocked.

, Splitting your panes allows you to scroll your separate sections individually. This is very useful for large spreadsheets that you need to manipulate several areas of at once.


When splitting, you split from the right and from the top.

, The split bars are small bars located at the top of the vertical scrollbar and the right of the horizontal scrollbar. Click and drag these bars to set your new split border. You can scroll the spreadsheet in each individual frame you create.


Dragging split bars is no longer available in Office 2013. Instead, you can click the ""Split"" button in the ""View"" tab to create a default split that you can then click and drag to adjust.

Create a Pivot Chart.",How to Create Pivot Tables in Excel," A Pivot Table allows you to create visual reports of the data from a spreadsheet. You can perform calculations without having to input any formulas or copy any cells. You will need a spreadsheet with several entries in order to create a Pivot Table.


You can also create a Pivot Table in Excel using an outside data source, such as Access. You can insert the Pivot Table in a new Excel spreadsheet.;
, A pivot table is not always the answer you are looking for. In order to take advantage of the pivot table features, your spreadsheet should meet some basic criteria:Your spreadsheet should include at least one column with duplicate values. This basically just means that at least one column should have repeating data. In the example discussed in the next section, the ""Product Type"" column has two entries: ""Table"" or ""Chair"".
It should include numerical information. This is what will be compared and totaled in the table. In the example in the next section, the ""Sales"" column has numerical data.

, Click the ""Insert"" tab at the top of the Excel window. Click the ""PivotTable"" button on the left side of the Insert ribbon.


If you are using Excel 2003 or earlier, click the Data menu and select PivotTable and PivotChart Report...


, By default, Excel will select all of the data on your active spreadsheet. You can click and drag to choose a specific part of the spreadsheet, or you can type the cell range in manually.


If you are using an external source for your data, click the ""Use an external data source"" option and click Choose Connection.... Browse for the database connection saved on your computer.

, After selecting your range, choose your location option from the same window. By default, Excel will place the table on a new worksheet, allowing you to switch back and forth by clicking the tabs at the bottom of the window. You can also choose to place the Pivot Table on the same sheet as the data, which allows you to pick the cell you want it to be placed.When you are satisfied with your choices, click OK. Your Pivot Table will be placed and the interface will change.

, When creating a Pivot Table, you are essentially sorting your data by rows and columns. What you add where determines the structure of the table. Drag a field from the Field List on the right onto the Row Fields section of the Pivot Table to insert the information.


For example, your company sells two products: tables and chairs. You have a spreadsheet with the number (Sales) of each product (Product Type) sold in your five stores (Store). You want to see how much of each product is sold in each store.
Drag the Store field from the field list into the Row Fields section of the Pivot Table. Your list of stores will appear, each as its own row.

, Like the rows, the columns allow you to sort and display your data. In the above example, the Store field was added to the Row Fields section. To see how much of each type of product was sold, drag the Product Type field to the Column Fields section.

, Now that you have the organization laid out, you can add the data to be displayed in the table. Click and drag the Sales field into Value Fields section of the Pivot Table. You will see your table display the sales information for both of your products in each of your stores, with a Total column on the right.For all of the above steps, you can drag the fields into the corresponding boxes below the Fields list on the right side of the window instead of dragging them onto the table.

, Pivot tables allow you to add multiple fields to each section, allowing for more minute control over how the data is displayed. Using the above example, say you make several types of tables and several types of chairs. Your spreadsheet is records whether the item is a table or chair (Product Type), but also the exact model of the table or chair sold (Model).


Drag the Model field onto the Column Fields section. The columns will now display the breakdown of sales per model and overall type. You can change the order that these labels are displayed by clicking the arrow button next to the field in the boxes in the lower-right corner of the window. Select ""Move Up"" or ""Move Down"" to change the order.

, You can change the way values are displayed by clicking the arrow icon next to a value in the Values box. Select ""Value Field Settings"" to change the way the values are calculated. For example, you could display the value in terms of a percentage instead of a total, or average the values instead of summing them.


You can add the same field to the Value box multiple times to take advantage of this. In the above example, the sales total for each store is displayed. By adding the Sales field again, you can change the value settings to show the second Sales as percentage of total sales.

, When changing the ways values are calculated, you have several options to choose from depending on your needs.


Sum - This is the default for value fields. Excel will total all of the values in the selected field.
Count - This will count the number of cells that contain data in the selected field.
Average - This will take the average of all of the values in the selected field.

, The ""Report filter"" area contains the fields that enable you to page through the data summaries shown in the pivot table by filtering out sets of data. They act as the filters for the report. For example, setting your Store field as the filter instead of a Row Label will allow you to select each store to see individual sales totals, or see multiple stores at the same time.

, One of the key features of the Pivot Table is the ability to sort results and see dynamic reports. Each label can be sorted and filtered by clicking the down arrow button next to the label header. You can then sort the list or filter it to only show specific entries., Your pivot table will automatically update as you modify the base spreadsheet. This can be great for monitoring your spreadsheets and tracking changes. .

, Pivot tables make it extremely easy to change the location and order of fields. Try dragging different fields to different locations to come up with a pivot table that meets your exact needs.


This is where the pivot table gets its name. Moving the data to different locations is known as ""pivoting"" as you are changing the direction that the data is displayed.

, You can use a Pivot Chart to show dynamic visual reports. Your Pivot Chart can be created directly from your completed Pivot Table, making the chart creation process a snap.

D - Effort A 1-5, from the Effort table.
E - Urgency A formula based on Due date.
F - Due Date when the task should be finished. Due dates are not hard and fast. Ramp Up tells you how early you could start the task and Extension tells you how many days it could slide. Getting a haircut might have a Ramp Up of 5 and an Extension of 4 - it doesn’t make sense to get a haircut 2 weeks early and people might notice if it was more than 5 days late.
G - Ramp Up Days prior to Due date you could start task.
H - Extension Automatic extension of Due date

, Select from cells A1 to K, for as many rows as you have data. Then click on Data Sort.

,, As you complete tasks, mark the date in the Finished column. Remember CTRL-; (control key and semi-colon) immediately enters the current date.

, Here are the priorities over several days. On July 13 all tasks are before the Ramp Up period, so have large numbers. On July 20th, higher priorities (smaller numbers) appear for four tasks, including Mow Lawn which has hit its Due date. On the 21st, the priority is higher because we're in the Extension period and on July 23rd it's even higher because it's beyond the Extension period. Pay bills also goes through an escalation on the 23rd and 25th.

Input all of your data.,
Click the cell you want to format.,

Click ""Add >>"" to use two conditions.,
Click “Add >>"" one more time to set another condition, or click “Delete..."" and choose which condition to remove.

Determine if your first condition is based on the value in the current cell, or if it is based on another cell or group of cells in another part of the worksheet.

,
Leave the condition as is (in other words, leave the first drop-down as “Cell Value Is""), if the condition is based on the current cell.,
For “Formula Is"" you can actually apply conditional formatting based on the value of another cell or cells.,
Click the cell that contains the value.,
Apply the type of formatting.,
Select what type of font changes you would like to make.,
A preview of the format will appear under the argument and values.,
Move on to the second (and third, if you’ve got it) condition and follow the above steps (starting with Step 6) again.,
Click ""OK."" Now that you have finished all your conditions.",How to Apply Conditional Formatting in Excel," This is useful because conditional formatting is best understood by testing it on data you already have. While you can apply conditional formatting to empty cells, it is easiest to see if the formatting works by using pre-existing data.;
, Conditional formatting allows you to change font style, underline, and color. Using conditional formatting, you can also apply strike-through as well as borders and shading to the cells. However, you cannot change the font or the font size of the contents in the cell.

, In Excel 2007 this can be found under ""Home"" > ""Styles"" > ""Conditional Formatting"".

, For this example, two conditions are used to see how each one plays off the other. Excel allows up to three conditions per cell. If you need only one condition, skip the next step.

,,, If it is based on other cells, change the first drop-down to “Formula Is."" For “Formula Is"" directions, go to the next step. For “Cell Value Is"" directions, do the following:


Select what kind of argument works best using the second drop-down box. For conditions between a low setting and a high setting, select “between"" or “not between."" For conditions using a single value, use the other arguments. This example will use a single value using the “greater than"" argument.
Determine what value(s) should be applied to the argument. For this example, we are using the “greater than"" argument and cell B5 as the value. To select a cell, click the button in the text field. This will minimize the conditional formatting box.

, After selecting “Formula Is,"" all the drop-downs disappear and you are left with a text field. This means you can type in any formula you want using Excel’s formulas. For the most part, you want to stick to simple formulas and avoid text or text strings. Keep in mind that the formula is based on the current cell. For an example, think like this: C5 (current cell) = B5>=B6. This means that C5 will change formatting when B5 is greater than or equal to B6. This example can actually be used in “Cell Value Is,"" but you get the idea. To select a cell in the worksheet, click the button in the text field. This will minimize the conditional formatting box.


For example: Imagine you have a spreadsheet with all the days of the current month listed down in Column A; you need to enter data in this worksheet everyday; and you would like the entire row associated with today's date to light up in some way. Try this: (1) Highlight your entire table of data, (2) Select conditional formatting as explained above, (3) Select ""Formula Is"" and (4) Enter something like =$A3=TODAY() where Column A contains your dates and Row 3 is your first row of data (after your headings). Note that you want the dollar sign in front of the A but not in front of the 3. (5) Select your formats. , You will notice that it automatically places dollar signs ($) before the row and column designations. This makes that cell reference non-transferable. This means if you were to apply the same conditional formatting to other cells through copy/paste, they will all reference the original cell. To turn this off, simply click in the text field and delete the dollar signs. If you do not want to set a condition using a cell in your sheet, simply type the value into the text field. You can even enter text, depending on the arguments. For example, don’t use “greater than"" as the argument and “John Smith"" in the text field. You can’t be greater than John Smith...well, you could, but - oh, never mind. In this example, the whole condition, if you were going to say it out loud, would read something like this: “When this cell’s value is greater than the value in cell B5, then...""

, Keep in mind that you want to offset the cell from the rest of the sheet, especially if you have lots of data. But you also want to make it look professional. For this example, we want the font to become bold and white and the shading to become red. To begin, click “Format...""

, Then click “Border"" and make any changes there. This example does not make border changes. Then click “Patterns"" and make changes there. At whatever point you are finished making the formatting changes, click ""OK.""

, Make changes as needed until the formatting appears the way you would like.

, You will notice in the example that the second condition also includes a small formula (=B5*.90). This takes the value of B5, multiplies it by 0.9 (aka 90 percent) and applies formatting if the value is less than that.

, One of two things will happen:


No changes will appear. This means that the conditions are not met, so no formatting was applied.
One of the formats you selected appears because one of the conditions has been met.

Use this method to quickly copy a formula without changing the cell references.,
Open the Find window.,
Find and replace ""="" with another character.,
Copy and paste the cells.,
Use Find & Replace again to reverse the change.,
Try alternate methods.",How to Copy Formulas in Excel3," Sometimes, you have a large spreadsheet full of formulas, and you want to copy them exactly. Changing everything to absolute cell references (as described in the section on cell references) would be tedious, especially if you just want to change them back again afterward. Use this method to quickly move formulas with relative cell references elsewhere without changing the references.Here's our example spreadsheet, which needs to have column C duplicated to column D:



Example Spreadsheet


Column A
Column B
Column C
Column D


row 1
944
Frogs
=A1/2



row 2
636
Toads
=A2/2



row 3
712
Newts
=A3/2



row 4
690
Snakes
=A4/2




If you're just trying to copy the formula in a single cell, skip to the last step (""Try alternate methods"") in this section.

, On most versions of Excel, you can find this by clicking the Home tab at the top of the Excel window, then clicking Find & Select in the ""Editing"" portion of the tab.You can also use the keyboard shortcut, CTRL F.

, Enter ""="", click ""Find All,"" then enter another character into the ""Replace with"" box. This will automatically turn all formulas (which always begin with =) into text strings beginning with some other character. Always use a character that you have not used in your spreadsheet. For example, replace it with # or &, or a longer string of characters, such as ##&.



Example Spreadsheet


Column A
Column B
Column C
Column D


row 1
944
Frogs
##&A1/2



row 2
636
Toads
##&A2/2



row 3
712
Newts
##&A3/2



row 4
690
Snakes
##&A4/2




Do not use the characters * or ?, since these will make later steps more difficult.

, You may now select any cells you wish to copy, then paste them into another location. Since they are no longer interpreted as formulas, they will be copied exactly.



Example Spreadsheet


Column A
Column B
Column C
Column D


row 1
944
Frogs
##&A1/2

Snakes
##&A4/2
##&A4/2


, Now that you have the formulas where you want them, use the ""Find all"" and ""Replace with"" options to reverse your change. In our example, we'll look for the character string ""##&"" and replace it with ""="" again, so those cells become formulas once again. You can now continue editing your spreadsheet as usual:



Example Spreadsheet


Column A

row 4
690
Snakes
=A4/2
=A4/2


, If the method described above does not work for any reason, or if you are worried about accidentally changing other cell contents with the ""Replace all"" option, there are a couple other methods you can try:


To copy a single cell's formula without changing references, select the cell, then copy the formula shown in the formula bar near the top of the window (not in the cell itself). Press esc to close the formula bar, then paste the formula wherever you need it.Press Ctrl` (usually on the same key as ~) to put the spreadsheet in formula view mode. Copy the formulas and paste them into a text editor such as Notepad or TextEdit. Copy them again, then paste them back into the spreadsheet at the desired location.Press Ctrl` again to switch back to regular viewing mode.

Use a relative cell reference in a formula.,
Understand why they're called relative references.,
Use an absolute reference instead.,
Use the F4 key to switch between absolute and relative.",How to Copy Formulas in Excel4," In an Excel formula, a ""cell reference"" is the address a cell. You can type these in manually, or click on the cell you wish to use while you are entering a formula. For example, the following spreadsheet has a formula that references cell A2:



Relative References


Column A
Column B
Column C


row 2
50
7
=A2*2


row 3
100




row 4
200




row 5
400




, In an Excel formula, a relative reference uses the relative position of a cell address. For example: cell C2 has the formula “=A2”, which is a relative reference to the value two cells to the left. If you copy the formula into cell C4, then it will still refer to two cells to the left, now showing “=A4”.



Relative References


Column A
Column B
Column C


row 2
50
7
=A2*2


row 3
100




row 4
200

=A4*2


row 5
400





This works for cells outside of the same row and column as well. If you copied the same formula from cell C1 into cell D6 (not shown), Excel would change the reference ""A2"" to a cell one row to the right (C→D) and 5 rows below (2→7), or ""B7"".

, Let's say you don't want Excel to automatically change your formula. Instead of using a relative cell reference, you can make it absolute by adding a $ symbol in front of the column or row that you want to keep the same, no matter where you copy the formula too.Here are a few example spreadsheets, showing the original formula in larger, bold text, and the result when you copy-paste it to other cells:



Relative Column, Absolute Row (B$1):
The formula has an absolute reference to row 1, so it always refers to row 1.


Column A
Column B
Column C


row 1
50
7
=B$3



row 2
100
=A$3

=B$3



row 3
200
=A$3

=B$3



row 4
400
=A$3

=B$3





Absolute Column, Relative Row ($B1):
The formula has an absolute reference to column B, so it always refers to column B.


Column A

row 3

=$B3



row 4
400

Absolute Column & Row ($B$1):
The formula has an absolute reference to column B of row 1, so it always refers to column B of row 1.

Format your document.",How to Make a Process Document," Almost anything can be broken up into a process and turned into a process document. Some examples include:


Making pasta
Learning to drive
Writing a letter
Performing a drum roll;
, Think about all of the resources that your readers will need in order to complete the process you want to describe.Understanding the resources involved will come in handy when deciding how to describe each of the steps. Some examples of necessary resources include:


Making pasta: water, pasta, salt, cooking pot, colander, heat, time
Learning to drive: vehicle, teacher, time (both learning and practicing), knowledge of traffic laws
Writing a letter: writing and spelling skills, paper, pen or pencil
Performing a drum roll: drum set, drum sticks, some experience playing the drums, time

, Before you move any further, you should take some time to think about who your audience is and what they already know about your subject. This knowledge can help you to determine what information you need to include and what information you might be able to leave out.For example, if you are writing a process document about how to cook pasta for a general audience who may or may not know how to cook, then you will probably want to define terms like “al dente” and describe what is meant by a “rolling boil.”

, Every process document needs a clear title explaining what process you are detailing. To determine what you should call your process document, think about what you want your readers to learn how to do. For example, you might call your process document “Make Pasta,” “Learn to Drive,” or “Write a Letter.”


Use the imperative form for your title and steps.Your process document should start with a present tense verb, such as “make,” “cook,” “learn,” or “write.” You should continue to use this tense to describe the steps in your process.

, The introduction of your process document will give you a chance to explain what the document will offer and attract your reader’s attention as well. In your introduction, it is a good idea to create a sense of urgency so that your reader will want to read on. Try to create a problem for your readers and then offer to solve it.For example, when introducing a process document that explains how to make pasta, you might say something like, “Cooking pasta may seem easy, but it is easy to overcook or undercook pasta. This is a problem because pasta that is too chewy or too soft can be unappetizing, no matter what kind of sauce you put on it. But if you make pasta the right way, then your pasta will be as impressive as your sauce.”

, Think about the things that need to happen as part of the process you are trying to describe. Write down as many parts of the process as you can to get started. This is a pre-writing strategy called ""listing.""As you do so, try to break down the process into small, easy to understand steps. For example, if you want to explain how to make pasta, then you might write down:


Get out a pot and fill it with water.
Put pot on stove and turn the heat on high.
Get out pasta.
Add pasta to water.
Turn the heat down slightly.
Cook for the time indicated on the package.
Drain pasta into a colander in the sink.

, Once you have a basic list of steps that your readers will need to complete, look over them and make sure that they are in order. Consider whether it would make more sense to give one of your steps earlier or later in the sequence.


For example, if you are describing the process of making pasta, then you might think about whether it makes more sense to tell readers to get out the pasta before or after the water is heating up.
If the process that you are describing is something that is quite complicated or that you can do without thinking about, then you may need to spend more time considering the logic of your steps. For example, if you are an experienced drummer trying to describe how to do a drum roll, then you might have to sit down at your drum set and do a few drum rolls.
As you perform the steps in your process, think about what happens first, second, third, etc. Compare this sequence with your list of steps.

, Think about the process again and try to determine if there is any information missing from the process. Try to determine if there is anything that readers will need to do before they can complete one of your steps.


For example, you might advise your readers to set a timer when adding the pasta to the water. Or, you might advise readers to check a piece of pasta before draining the whole pot.
Try reading off your steps to a friend to see if there is anything you missed. Do not elaborate on anything you have written, just read off your steps to a friend and ask for suggestions.

, After you have devised a solid sequence for your steps, you will need to expand on each of your steps. Each step in your process document should include useful information to help your readers understand how to complete each of the steps. Try to be as detailed as possible.


For example, when you advise readers to get out a pot and fill it with water, you will need to say what type of pot readers should use and how much water readers should add to the pot. You might tell readers to use a large stockpot to cook the pasta and to fill it with 12 cups of water.

, Examples can help your readers get a clearer idea of how to do something that might be difficult to understand. Try to use examples that will be easy for your readers to relate to and explain how the example relates to the process you are describing.For example, if you are trying to explain to readers how tightly to hold a drumstick to do a drumroll, then you might use the example of holding a pencil to describe how much pressure is required. Readers will be able to relate to holding a pen or pencil and use that knowledge to help them hold a drumstick the right way.

, Think about the common mistakes that people make when trying to complete this process and make sure that you address these common mistakes in your document.You might find a way to work this information into one of your steps or you might provide this information at the end of your document.


For example, perhaps the reason why many people end up overcooking their pasta is because they forget to set a timer. Or perhaps many people struggle with drum rolls because they are holding their drumsticks too tight.

, Transitions are words that help to improve the flow of your writing. Transitions can help you clarify when readers are supposed to do things in your process. For example, you might advise your readers to set the timer right BEFORE you add the pasta to the boiling water. Or, you might advise your readers to put on oven mitts AND THEN pour the pasta into the colander in the sink. Some other good transition words to use in a process document include:next
after
first
last
also

, When describing a process for a large audience, it is important to make sure that the words you use are simple enough for most people to understand. Using lots of jargon (technical language) can make it hard for readers to understand the instructions. Take a minute to read through your instructions and look for ways to simplify the language.


If you need to use a special word to describe your process, make sure that you define it for your readers.For example, if describing how to make pasta, you would need to explain what “al dente” means.

, It is important to make sure that the process you have described can be carried out successfully by following your instructions. Try to complete the process you have described by following each step in the order you have placed them and by using only the information you have included.


As you test your process, try to identify any information that is missing or anything that might be unclear to your readers.
Ask someone else to test your process as well. Having someone else test your process can ensure even more accuracy in your process document. Ask a friend or family member to use your steps to complete the process you have described.

, Depending on how you plan to use your process document, you may need to format it. For example, if your process document is meant to be formatted as an MLA style essay for a class assignment, then you will need to review your instructor’s guidelines and make sure that your document meets them. If you are using your document for a website, then you will need to format your document to meet your needs.


Process documents may describe a different step in each paragraph or each step might begin with a number or bullet point.

, As you drag the slider left and right, you'll see more or less detail. Play with the slider until you find a level that gives you strong lines without sacrificing too much detail.

, There's a good chance that your photo will have some background detail that muddies up the image. Use a large white Paintbrush to quickly erase any details that you don't want to see. Use a black Paintbrush to fill in areas of white to make solid black spaces.


You can use the Crop tool to quickly cut out large chunks of the image that you don't want to use.

, When you cut and print the stencil, you will be cutting away the black spaces to paint through. This means that if there are isolated details in white, they will need to be connected to the rest of the white space so that you can cut it properly. Use the white Paintbrush to quickly connect your islands to the rest of the white space.Keep the strength of your finished stencil in mind and create any additional links to maintain its structure when using it.

, Once you've created all of your links, click ""Filter"" → ""Artistic"" → ""Cutout"". This will convert the image to straighter lines to make it easier to cut out.


If you are using newer versions of Photoshop (CS6+), you'll need to select ""Preferences"" → ""Plug-ins"" → ""Show All Filter Gallery Groups and Names"" before you can see the Artistic filters., The different sliders will allow you to adjust the amount of flattening that the filter applies to the image. The ""Edge Simplicity"" slider will make your edges straighter, which will make the image more stencil-like. You'll notice a large reduction in detail, which will make cutting your stencil easier.

, Look over the whole stencil and check for any unconnected islands or extraneous details. Don't worry too much about stray lines, as you can just ignore them as you cut the stencil out.

, Once you're satisfied with your stencil, you can print it out. Make sure you print it on thick paper so that the stencil is sturdy. You can set the printing color to gray if you want to save some ink.

, After printing your stencil, all that's left is to cut it out and use it. Take a pair of scissors and cut away all of the black sections of the image. Make sure to pay attention to your links between island so that you don't lose any detail. When you're finished, all that should be left are the white parts of the image, with empty space where the black parts were.

, This is typically located on the right side of the screen. Most images that haven’t been edited before will only have one layer, called “Background”. Right-click on this layer and select “Layer From Background…”.


This will open the New Layer window. Leave the options at their presets and press OK. “Background” will change to “Layer 0”. Doing this will unlock the image, allowing you to edit it.

, This is located in the Eraser tool menu. To access it, click and hold the Eraser tool icon. Select the Magic Eraser Tool from the menu that appears.

, Once you select the Magic Eraser, you will see some settings in the top menu bar. Adjust them so that they look similar to this:


Set Tolerance to 20-30. A low tolerance will keep parts of your original image from being erased when you use the tool. Adjust the tolerance to find a level that works for your project.
Check the Anti-alias box.
Check the Contiguous box.
Set Opacity to 100%

, The Magic Eraser will remove all of the color that you clicked on, turning it into transparent background. The Tolerance level will affect how many related colors are removed as well (For gradient backgrounds).

, If you were deleting a solid-color background, it should be almost completely erased in one click. You may need to zoom in and make minor adjustments with the Eraser tool.

, Once you are satisfied with the removal of the background, you can use the Lasso tool to draw a rough outline around the object. Press Ctrl+Shift+J to create a “New Layer Via Cut”, which will place your object on a separate layer from the old background. You can now delete the background layer (Layer 0).

, In the toolbar at the top of the window, click the arrow icon next to the brush shape. Set the Hardness to 100% so that the edges of the brush remove as much as the center. Set the diameter to a size that works well with the image you have. You will be making large, broad strokes with the brush.

, This will delete the color that you select in the circle, but only if the colors are touching. This will help keep from deleting colors inside the subject of the photo, while only erasing the background.


If you have spots of the image where there is background inside the subject (wisps of hair that can be seen through, for example), use the Dis contiguous option to remove the background from inside the isolated spots.

, A low tolerance limits erasure to areas that are very similar to the sampled color. A high tolerance erases a broader range of colors. Set your tolerance between 20-30.

, You will see a circle with small cross hairs in the center. The crosshairs show the “hotspot” and deletes that color wherever it appears inside the brush. It also performs color extraction at the edges of any foreground objects, so that color halos are not visible if the foreground object is later pasted into another image.

, You can allow the circle to cross over into the subject while erasing and you shouldn’t lose anything, but do not allow the cross hair in the circle to touch the subject, otherwise you will start deleting those colors..

, As you click and drag you’ll see the checkerboard pattern appear in the areas you have erased. The checkerboard represents transparency.

, In some places you will need to reduce the size of the brush to ensure that you don’t accidentally erase part of the subject. For example, in this image you would want to change the size when erasing between the petals.

, Once you have the subject properly outlined, you can make broad strokes with a standard eraser to remove the remaining background.

, If you want to soften the edges of your subject so that it will blend in better with the whatever background you put it on, use the Smudge tool. Set it to a low strength (20% or so) and drag it around the edge of the subject. This will soften any hard lines."

, Go to select, choose ‘invert’ so the area outside the art is active.

,, Check ‘strength’ just above work area. Make sure all areas are fully erased. For ease, set the eraser size to 1000 or 2000. It is important to erase everything so problems don’t happen during the ‘distort’ phase later.


If the background layer is visible during erasing, it will appear as if nothing was erased. Make background layer invisible by clicking eyeball next to layer.

,,,,, We are doing this because we want a straight line at the top so the art can be squared up accurately. Putting the rectangle on a separate layer will let you move the rectangle without moving the art too.

, Select a color that is different than the art so it is easy to distinguish the art from the rectangle.

,, It doesn’t have to line up perfectly with the edge of your art because the rectangle can be moved later.

,, Fill the rectangle with color.

, Fill the rectangle with color.

, Is your art bowed? Are the sides curved?

, We don’t need to correct the layers with rectangles since they are already straight.

, Wait for tool to load.

, Perfection is probably not going to happen. Try all the features. Remember, the objective is to get the sides of the art straight, the objective is not to make the art square.

,,, Use the move tool to move the rectangle up or down until it meets a top corner of your art. Since your art is not square, the rectangle won’t meet both corners so just make it touch one corner.

, Use the move tool to move rectangle over until it touches one corner of art.

,,, Activate the background copy layer so work takes place on your art.

, Click image, transform, distort.

, Using the mouse on each corner, drag the corner and stretch the art until each corner touches a rectangle.

, Is it square? Does it need adjustment? If problems still exist, repeat some of the steps.

, Use the crop tool and draw a rectangle around your art.

, Using the rectangles as a guide will ensure you get the right crop.

Simply use the Magic Wand to select the background, the delete it away to leave just the silhouetted object.


Change the tolerance at the top bar to make the Wand more or less precise. A higher number (75-100) selected a wider range of colors while a low tolerance (like 1-10) will only select very similarly colored pixels., The most intuitive tools for creating selections, these generally require a steady hand and some patience, though they are easy to use. For all of them, simply click and drag around the object with your tool to create a selection. You can add more to a selection by holding Ctrl/Cmd when you click, or subtract from a selection by holding Alt/Opt.



Quick Selection: Looks like a paintbrush with a circular dotted line around the brush. This object selects everything roughly the same color or clarity, following the edges of shapes.

Lasso Tools: You have a lot of options here, each of which requires you click the mouse, then manually trace out the object. Clicking again creates an anchor point while completing the circle or shape ends the section.

Fade the shadow away for a more realistic effect.",How to Add a Drop Shadow in Photoshop Elements," You can add a drop shadow to any layer in Photoshop Elements, from singular objects in a picture to text and graphics. Open up a copy of the image you need to add the shadow to.


If you want to make a drop shadow on text, you'll need to write it out and turn it into a layer by right-clicking on it in the layers menu (on the right) and clicking ""Rasterize Type.""If you just want to learn how to make drop shadows, use the text as described above on a white background -- it makes it much easier to learn.;
, Selections are when you outline an object with the moving dotted line. You can use the quick selection tool, the lasso, or the square selection tool to trace out your exact selection. For simple objects or text, you can Ctrl-Click or Cmd-Click on the layer's picture in the palette to automatically create a selection.


Don't worry about getting the selection exactly right-- you just need a rough enough outline for a shadow.
If your selection is on a one-color background, you can use the magic wand to select the background. Then press Ctrl/Cmmd+Shift+i to get the inverse of your background -- the image.
You can Alt-click with your selection tool (magic wand, quick selection, etc.) to subtract a spot from your current selection. You can press Shift-click or Cmd-click to add a spot to a selection.

, Otherwise, you can skip to the next section by pressing Ctrl + J or Command + J on a Mac. This will copy the selected area to a new layer without refining.


Alternatively, if you want a quick fix to your selection and don't mind a little trial and error, you can play around with Select (from the top menu bar) -> Modify -> border, expand, smooth, feather, etc. which offers some of the same features with refine edge. But Select modify method doesn't preview the changes before they are made so you will have to try and retry.

, To bring up the Refine Edge menu, make sure you're on the layer with your selection. Then, you can:


Press Alt-Ctrl-R (PC) or Alt-Cmd-R (Mac).
Click ""Select"" from the top menu, then find ""Refine Edge.""
Right-click on the selection with a selection tool on (like magic wand) and choose ""Refine Edge."", This is not the actual shadow -- you're making a copy of the layer that you will then place and adjust. Still, there are some features to note that may help you create a great shadow:



Radius: Shrinks the selection slightly. Remember that the size of the final image is important. For example, if you have a 300x200 image 4px will sure have effect, but it won't in a 3000x2000 image.

Smooth: Takes out hard edges, making the shadow more blob-like. In general, nearer shadows are clear and sharp and far away shadows should be smoother.

Feather: Blurs the edges of the selection. This, however, will be accomplished later, so only set it to 1-2 pixels now.

Contrast: Makes the selection sharper -- the inverse of ""smoothing.""

Shift Edge: Grows or shrinks the selection by percentage. You can play with this depending on your desired effect., At the bottom of the Refine Edge menu, there is a box labeled ""Output."" Under the section ""output to:"" make sure you select ""New Layer"" from the drop-down menu., To do so, make sure your layer is selected. From there, there are three ways to open up the correct ""Layer Styles"" menu:


In the layers palette on the right, select the Effects button. It is small ""fx"" on the bottom of the palette.
Click on ""Layers"" then ""Layer Styles"" from the top bar.
Right-click on the layer in the layers menu and select ""Blending Modes."", It is usually on the bottom of the menu on the left side of Blending Modes or Layer Styles. Once you click it, you should see a checkmark in the box next to the words Drop Shadow.


There are only a few settings, namely ""spread"" and ""size,"" that really matter here. However, you should feel free to adjust the rest of the settings at will to get your perfect shadow., With the Layer Styles menu open still, click on the image and drag. This will show you the shadow. You will be able to move it later as well, so just put it somewhere you can see it well for now.

, Spread will take each bit of the shadow and grow it, meaning some parts of the shadow may blend into others. While the amount you want is different for each project, 5-10% will create a nice fuzz.

, Play with this until you find your desired amount of blur. For reference, remember that hard, bright light sources make very sharp shadows. Weak or far-off light creates blurrier shadows., Once your layer is fully styled, hit okay. You'll see a set of ""eyes"" appear under your layer in the layers palette, one labeled ""Effects"" and one labeled ""Drop Shadow."" Right-click on the ""Drop Shadow"" one and click ""Create Layer.""


A box appears claiming ""Some aspects of the Effects cannot be reproduced with layers!"" Ignore this -- a drop shadow can be reproduced.

, With the new layer selected, click on ""Edit"" → ""Free Transform"" from the top bar. You can also click Ctrl-T (PC) or Cmd-T (Mac) to start Free Transform. You will see a box with eight small squares appear around your shadow.

, This special click lets you adjust just one point of the shadow, allowing you to angle the shadow diagonally away from your image. You can Ctrl/Cmd-Click on any square, allowing you plenty of control to shape your shadow how you'd like it.Remember that shadows always point away from a light source. Look at other shadows in the image and try to follow their arc and length.

, Keep moving, twisting, and transforming your shadow using the Free transform tool. Remember to Ctrl/Cmd-click to change the angle of the shadow, and use regular clicks to adjust the size and placement. You want the shadow to start on the bottom of the image. So, for a person, the shadow's feet need to be lined up with the feet of the person in the image., Check out your shadow. Unless the light source is very close, very bright, or both, most shadows fade the further away they get from you, or if there are other lights from other directions weakening the shadow. Making your shadow fade, however, is easy. To do so:Click on the shadow layer.
In the layer's palette, click ""Create Vector Mask."" It should be right next to the Fx from earlier, and is a square with a circle in the middle.
Click on the white square that appears in the layer's palette.
Select the gradient tool (press G), and use a normal linear gradient.
Create a gradient across the face of your image. To lessen the effect, lower the opacity in the top bar."

IF (<condition>, <result-if-true>, <result-if-false>)



Supported Conditional Operators

< Less than

= Equal
/ Divide
AND Both statements are true
OR One of the statements is true
NOT Statement is false


Conditional statements can contain numeric values, numeric parameter names, and Yes/No parameters. Currently, <= and >= are not implemented. To express such a comparison, you can use a logical NOT. For example, a<=b can be entered as NOT(a>b)

Simple IF Statement

IF (Length < 900, <true>, <false>)



Formula That Returns Strings

IF (Length < 900, “Opening too narrow”, “Opening OK”)



Using logical AND

IF ( AND (x = 1 , y = 2), <true>, <false>)
Returns <true> if both x=1 and y=2, else <false>



Using logical OR

IF ( OR ( x = 1 , y = 2 ) , <true>, <false>)
Returns <true> if either x=1 or y=2, else <false>



Nested IF statements

IF ( Length < 500 , 100 , IF ( Length < 750 , 200 , IF ( Length < 1000 , 300 , 400 ) ) )
Returns 100 if Length<500, 200 if Length<750, 300 if Length<1000 and 400 if Length>1000


IF with Yes/No condition
Length > 40
Returns checked box (<true>) if Length > 40

NOT with Yes/No condition

not(Viz)
Returns checked box (<true>) if Yes/No parameter ""Viz"" is unchecked, and returns unchecked box (<false>) if Yes/No parameter ""Viz"" is checked.



IF AND OR Returning the greatest of three values

Say you have these 3 length parameters, and want a fourth parameter to return the greatest value/length of the 3:
Length A
Length B
Length C
Return Length (Returns the greatest of the three length parameters)
Return Length = if(and(or(Length A > Length B, Length A = Length B), or(Length A > Length C, Length A = Length C)), Length A, if(and(or(Length B > Length A, Length B = Length A), or(Length B > Length C, Length B = Length C)), Length B, if(and(or(Length C > Length A, Length C = Length A), or(Length C > Length B, Length C = Length B)), Length C, 0 mm)))
Another option is to use an extra ""Calc"" parameter, which is a bit more clumsy but also way easier and more manageable for us mortals.
Calc = if(Length A > Length B, Length A, Length B)
Return Length = if(Calc > Length C, Calc, Length C)

Incorporate a call to action in the landing pages of the website.,

Understand your visitors’ psychology.,
Develop a consistent design strategy.,
Keep to the same font type throughout the webpage.,
Do not subconsciously make it difficult for the user to access information.,
Don’t forget to include these three factors on your pages: a motivation to keep the reader on the page, ability to do something that you have intended the user to do and an appropriate trigger at the right place.,
Go mobile-friendly.,
Include a brief guide – really brief.,
Test your design on many different screen sizes and types.",How to Get Started in UX Design," Make sure that the page has a lead that users will want to use. Keep the design simple and lead easy to find. You can keep details in another page of the website.;
, Remember that users will be looking for something that will enhance their knowledge and help them to follow it. If you can perceive what users want, then, incorporate it in a conspicuous position.

, Visitors don’t read a webpage like they do a book. What they actually do is simply scan from left to right and top to bottom and spend no more than a few seconds to do it. They will not even take the trouble to scroll down. So present everything in a nutshell.

, If you design your links to open in another tab or on the same page, keep it that way throughout the website’s design. It may be repetitive, but the advantage to the user is they will not be lost in the wilderness.

, The size of the fonts is just as much important. Using a small font to cramp more content can produce negative results. They make it difficult for an average user to read and they will want to leave the page fast. If you are in doubt about what is best, choose something big rather than small.

, A designer may be tempted to ask for user information – email ID and name for example, but it is a turn off for most visitors. If it is not an absolute necessity, don’t ever ask for it – keep it an option instead.

, A trigger placed in the wrong place is seldom found and used. Remember, we said, visitors scan the pages, not read.

, If you are designing an e-commerce website, don’t forget that most users are switching to mobile devices. Therefore make the design responsive. Though mobile devices have keyboards, not everyone will want to spend time in using it. If you want a quick response, do away with the registration process. It takes time and visitors don’t have enough of it for you.

, It will save a lot of time for users. A link to the guide on every page of your website will be really wonderful so that it can be accessed anytime by the user. You should avoid asking for too many information because privacy is important to users. Most users will not want to part with it.

, Do not be led into believing that every visitor has a screen as wide or tall as yours. Choose an optimized size that will fit every other size your potential visitors will be using.

Turn on OSNAP.",How to Set up an AutoCAD Drawing1," The program is either shown as an icon on your desktop, or you may find it in the START menu on the bottom left corner of your computer screen.

, There are two views in AutoCAD: modelspace and paperspace. Your drawing should always be made in modelspace, and dimensions that are added later should be represented in paperspace. To switch between modelspace and paperspace, view the tabs located at the bottom of the screen. One tab is labeled ‘modelspace’ and the other tabs are labeled either as ‘sheet’ or ‘layout’. The ‘sheet’ or ‘layout’ tabs indicate paperspace.If you are in modelspace, the background of the screen should appear black. If you are in paperspace, the background should appear white.

, Engineers represent units in various ways: feet, meters, etc. To ensure accuracy and eliminate confusion, it is important that the drawing is set in the proper units. To set up your units, type ‘UN’ into your keyboard and then select the ‘ENTER’ key. A dialog box should pop-up on the screen allowing you to specify the unit type and precision for your units. The options for the unit types are: DECIMAL, SCIENTIFIC, ENGINEERING, ARCHITECTURAL, FRACTIONAL. The ‘precision’ section allows you to pick the number of decimal places for your dimensions. If you are doing a project for your teacher, she should have information regarding unit specifications.

, To do this, hover your mouse over an empty space at the top of your screen near the toolbars. Then right-click and select AutoCAD. A long list should show up, displaying various toolbars containing different commands. The most popular toolbars that are used for AutoCAD 2D drawings are the DRAW, MODIFY, and OBJECT PROPERTIES toolbars. Select these toolbars and they should pop-up on your screen. Move them to the side to create space for your drawing. DRAW TOOLBAR: contains common drawing tools. MODIFY TOOLBAR: contains editing options. OBJECT PROPERTIES TOOLBAR: contains style and color options

, OSNAP, which refers to object snap, is an extremely useful property when creating a drawing. It allows you to see where the midpoint and endpoint of a line is located, where a tangent is on a circle, and other useful information. To turn on OSNAP, press the F3 button on your keyboard. To ensure your OSNAP settings are on, right-click on the icon reading ‘OSNAP’ located at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. A dialog box should pop-up on the screen. Click the ‘SELECT ALL’ button, ensuring that all OSNAP properties are turned on.

Most web hosting services will have PHP and MySQL already installed. You will just have to check they have the most recent versions of PHP and MySQL for this guide to work. If they don't have at least PHP5.3 and MySQL5 you might like to ask a few questions about their commitment to security. Keeping your software up-to-date is a part of the security process.
If you have your own server or computer, you should install the required software in the normal way for your system. Generally speaking, if you are not going to use the setup for production purposes and you are developing under Windows or OS/X, installing an XAMPP stack is the way to go. Get the appropriate version for your operating system at:https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
But please note that you should under no circumstances use XAMPP to create a production server environment for you.
Under Linux, use your package manager to download and install the necessary packages. Some distributions, like Ubuntu, package all the necessary applications into one bundle. Just do the following from a terminal window in Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install lamp-server^ phpmyadmin


However you install the necessary elements, please ensure you configure MySQL with a secure root password.
,
Log into your database as an administrative user (usually root)
In this guide we will create a database called ""secure_login"".
See how to Create-a-Database-in-Phpmyadmin.
You can either use the code below or do the same thing in phpMyAdmin/your favourite GUI MySQL client, if you prefer:



CREATE DATABASE `secure_login`;




Note: Some hosting services don't allow you to create a database through phpMyAdmin, Learn how to do it in cPanel.,
Creating a user with restricted privileges means that if there was ever a breach of security in our script the hacker couldn't delete or drop anything from our database. Using these privileges, you can get by doing pretty much anything you would want to in your application. If you are really paranoid, create a user for each function.
Of course you will need to be logged into MySQL as a user with sufficient privileges in order to create a user. This user will usually be root.
These are the details of the user we created:


User: ""sec_user""

Password: ""eKcGZr59zAa2BEWU""

Note: it is a good idea to change the password from the one given above when running on your own server. Make sure, if you do this, that you also change the code below, and your PHP database connection code in the application we are creating.
Remember it doesn't need to be a password that you can remember so make it as complicated as possible. Here's a random password generator
Given below is the SQL code for creating the database user and granting it the necessary permissions. Or you can do this in a GUI database client like phpmyadmin if you prefer:




CREATE USER 'sec_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'eKcGZr59zAa2BEWU';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON `secure_login`.* TO 'sec_user'@'localhost';





If you see yourself deleting records from either of the tables in this module, you may want to add DELETE to the list of privileges, or you may prefer to create a different user with just the DELETE privilege, and only on the table from which you want to delete records if you don't want to delete from both. You do not need to grant DELETE privileges at all for anything in this example script., We use the BINARY datatype to store the password because it will be encrypted using BCrypt, which has an output length of 60 characters. To store it more efficiently, we store it in the BINARY format:IMPORTANT: If you have attempted to use this script with SHA512 hashing and had problems with logging in, you need to change the PASSWORD field to CHAR(128) as the original BINARY(60) cropped out 68 crucial characters at the end of the hashed password, this causes the password to mismatch when attempting to login.




CREATE TABLE `secure_login`.`members` (
    `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    `username` VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    `email` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    `password` CHAR(128) NOT NULL
) ENGINE = InnoDB;





As we've said before, you can do this in whatever type of client you prefer.,
We will use this table to store login attempts for a user. This is one way in which we will make brute force attacks more difficult:



CREATE TABLE `secure_login`.`login_attempts` (
    `user_id` INT(11) NOT NULL,
    `time` VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB





,
It will be important to be able to test your login script, so below is the script to create a user with known details:


Username: test_user

Email: test@example.com

Password: 6ZaxN2Vzm9NUJT2y


The code you need in order to be able to log in as this user is:



INSERT INTO `secure_login`.`members` VALUES(1, 'test_user', 'test@example.com',
'$2y$10$IrzYJi10j3Jy/K6jzSLQtOLif1wEZqTRQoK3DcS3jdnFEhL4fWM4G');




, Call it psl-config.php. In a production environment you'll probably want to locate this file and all your other include files, outside of the web server's document root. If you do that, and we strongly suggest that you do, you will need to alter your include or require statements as necessary, so that the application can find the include files.
Locating your include files outside of the web server's document root means that your file cannot be located using a URL. So, if someone mistakenly dropped the 'php' extension, say, or messed up the file permissions the file still could not be displayed as text in a browser window.
The file contains global configuration variables. Things like whether anyone can register, whether or not it's a secure (HTTPS) connection, and other stuff as well as the database details could also go here...



<?php
/**
 * These are the database login details
 */  
define(""HOST"", ""localhost"");     // The host you want to connect to.
define(""USER"", ""sec_user"");    // The database username. 
define(""PASSWORD"", ""eKcGZr59zAa2BEWU"");    // The database password. 
define(""DATABASE"", ""secure_login"");    // The database name.
 
define(""CAN_REGISTER"", ""any"");
define(""DEFAULT_ROLE"", ""member"");
 
define(""SECURE"", FALSE);    // FOR DEVELOPMENT ONLY!!!!
?>




, Create a new PHP file called db_connect.php in the application's includes directory and add the code below. You can then include the file onto any page you wish to connect to the database.



<?php
include_once 'psl-config.php';   // As functions.php is not included
$mysqli = new mysqli(HOST, USER, PASSWORD, DATABASE);




,
PHP sessions are known not to be secure, therefore it is important not just to put ""session_start();"" at the top of every page on which you want to use PHP sessions. We are going to create a function called ""sec_session_start()"", this will start a PHP session in a secure way. You should call this function at the top of any page in which you wish to access a PHP session variable. If you are really concerned about security and the privacy of your cookies, have a look at this article: Create-a-Secure-Session-Managment-System-in-Php-and-Mysql.
This function makes your login script a whole lot more secure. It stops crackers accessing the session id cookie through JavaScript (for example in an XSS attack). Also the ""session_regenerate_id()"" function, which regenerates the session id on every page reload, helps prevent session hijacking. Note: If you are using HTTPS in your login application set the ""$secure"" variable to true. In a production environment it is essential that you use HTTPS.
Create a new file called functions.php in your application's includes directory and add the following code to it:




<?php
include_once 'psl-config.php';
 
function sec_session_start() {
    $session_name = 'sec_session_id';   // Set a custom session name 
    $secure = SECURE;
    // This stops JavaScript being able to access the session id.
    $httponly = true;
    // Forces sessions to only use cookies.
    if (ini_set('session.use_only_cookies', 1) === FALSE) {
        header(""Location: ../error.php?err=Could not initiate a safe session (ini_set)"");
        exit();
    }
    // Gets current cookies params.
    $cookieParams = session_get_cookie_params();
    session_set_cookie_params($cookieParams, $cookieParams, $cookieParams, $secure, $httponly);
    // Sets the session name to the one set above.
    session_name($session_name);
    session_start();            // Start the PHP session 
    session_regenerate_id();    // regenerated the session, delete the old one. 
}




,
This function will check the email and password against the database. Using the password_verify function rather than comparing the strings helps to prevent timing attacks. It will return true if there is a match. Add this function to your functions.php file:



function login($email, $password, $mysqli) {
    // Using prepared statements means that SQL injection is not possible. 
    if ($stmt = $mysqli->prepare(""SELECT id, username, password 
        FROM members
       WHERE email = ?
        LIMIT 1"")) {
        $stmt->bind_param('s', $email);  // Bind ""$email"" to parameter.
        $stmt->execute();    // Execute the prepared query.
        $stmt->store_result();
 
        // get variables from result.
        $stmt->bind_result($user_id, $username, $db_password);
        $stmt->fetch();
 
        if ($stmt->num_rows == 1) {
            // If the user exists we check if the account is locked
            // from too many login attempts 
 
            if (checkbrute($user_id, $mysqli) == true) {
                // Account is locked 
                // Send an email to user saying their account is locked
                return false;
            } else {
                // Check if the password in the database matches
                // the password the user submitted. We are using
                // the password_verify function to avoid timing attacks.
                if (password_verify($password, $db_password)) {
                    // Password is correct!
                    // Get the user-agent string of the user.
                    $user_browser = $_SERVER;
                    // XSS protection as we might print this value
                    $user_id = preg_replace(""/+/"", """", $user_id);
                    $_SESSION= $user_id;
                    // XSS protection as we might print this value
                    $username = preg_replace(""/+/"", 
                                                                """", 
                                                                $username);
                    $_SESSION= $username;
                    $_SESSION= hash('sha512', 
                              $db_password . $user_browser);
                    // Login successful.
                    return true;
                } else {
                    // Password is not correct
                    // We record this attempt in the database
                    $now = time();
                    $mysqli->query(""INSERT INTO login_attempts(user_id, time)
                                    VALUES ('$user_id', '$now')"");
                    return false;

Brute force attacks are when a hacker tries thousands of different passwords on an account, either randomly generated passwords or from a dictionary. In our script if a user account has more than five failed logins their account is locked.
Brute force attacks are hard to prevent. A few ways we can prevent them are using a CAPTCHA test, locking user accounts and adding a delay on failed logins, so the user cannot login for another thirty seconds.
We strongly recommend using a CAPTCHA. As yet we have not implemented this functionality in the example code, but hope to do so in the near future, using SecureImage, since it does not require registration. You may prefer something better known such as reCAPTCHA from Google.
Whichever system you decide on, we suggest you only display the CAPTCHA image after two failed login attempts so as to avoid inconveniencing the user unnecessarily.
When faced with the problem of brute force attacks, most developers simply block the IP address after a certain amount of failed logins. But there are many tools to automate the process of making attacks like these; and these tools can go through a series of proxies and even change the IP on each request. Blocking all these IP addresses could mean you're blocking legitimate users as well. In our code we'll log failed attempts and lock the user's account after five failed login attempts. This should trigger the sending of an email to the user with a reset link, but we have not implemented this in our code. Here is the code for the checkbrute() function at the time of writing. Add it to your functions.php code:



function checkbrute($user_id, $mysqli) {
    // Get timestamp of current time 
    $now = time();
 
    // All login attempts are counted from the past 2 hours. 
    $valid_attempts = $now - (2 * 60 * 60);
 
    if ($stmt = $mysqli->prepare(""SELECT time 
                             FROM login_attempts 
                             WHERE user_id = ? 
                            AND time > '$valid_attempts'"")) {
        $stmt->bind_param('i', $user_id);
 
        // Execute the prepared query. 
        $stmt->execute();
        $stmt->store_result();
 
        // If there have been more than 5 failed logins 
        if ($stmt->num_rows > 5) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}




,
We do this by checking the ""user_id"" and the ""login_string"" SESSION variables. The ""login_string"" SESSION variable has the user's browser information hashed together with the password. To check if they are equal, we use the hash_equals function to prevent timing attacks. We use the browser information because it is very unlikely that the user will change their browser mid-session. Doing this helps prevent session hijacking. Add this function to your functions.php file in the includes folder of your application:



function login_check($mysqli) {
    // Check if all session variables are set 
    if (isset($_SESSION, 
                        $_SESSION, 
                        $_SESSION)) {
 
        $user_id = $_SESSION;
        $login_string = $_SESSION;
        $username = $_SESSION;
 
        // Get the user-agent string of the user.
        $user_browser = $_SERVER;
 
        if ($stmt = $mysqli->prepare(""SELECT password 
                                      FROM members 
                                      WHERE id = ? LIMIT 1"")) {
            // Bind ""$user_id"" to parameter. 
            $stmt->bind_param('i', $user_id);
            $stmt->execute();   // Execute the prepared query.
            $stmt->store_result();
 
            if ($stmt->num_rows == 1) {
                // If the user exists get variables from result.
                $stmt->bind_result($password);
                $stmt->fetch();
                $login_check = hash('sha512', $password . $user_browser);
 
                if (hash_equals($login_check, $login_string) ){
                    // Logged In!!!! 
                    return true;
                } else {
                    // Not logged in 
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                // Not logged in 
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            // Not logged in 
            return false;
        }
    } else {
        // Not logged in 
        return false;
    }
}




, It is a modificaton of a function of the same name used by the WordPress Content Management System:



function esc_url($url) {
 
    if ('' == $url) {
        return $url;
    }
 
    $url = preg_replace('||i', '', $url);
 
    $strip = array('%0d', '%0a', '%0D', '%0A');
    $url = (string) $url;
 
    $count = 1;
    while ($count) {
        $url = str_replace($strip, '', $url, $count);
    }
 
    $url = str_replace(';//', '://', $url);
 
    $url = htmlentities($url);
 
    $url = str_replace('&amp;', '&#038;', $url);
    $url = str_replace(""'"", '&#039;', $url);
 
    if ($url!== '/') {
        // We're only interested in relative links from $_SERVERreturn '';
    } else {
        return $url;
    }
}





The trouble with using the server variable unfiltered is that it can be used in a cross site scripting attack. Most references will simply tell you to filter it using htmlentities(), however even this appears not to be sufficient hence the belt and braces approach in this function.
Others suggest leaving the action attribute of the form blank, or set to a null string. Doing this, though, leaves the form open to an iframe clickjacking attack., It goes in this directory because it contains no HTML markup.
We will use the mysqli_* set of PHP functions as this is one of the most up-to-date mySQL extensions.



<?php
include_once 'db_connect.php';
include_once 'functions.php';
 
sec_session_start(); // Our custom secure way of starting a PHP session.
 
if (isset($_POST, $_POST)) {
    $email = $_POST;
    $password = $_POST; // The hashed password.
 
    if (login($email, $password, $mysqli) == true) {
        // Login success 
        header('Location: ../protected_page.php');
    } else {
        // Login failed 
        header('Location: ../index.php?error=1');
    }
} else {
    // The correct POST variables were not sent to this page. 
    echo 'Invalid Request';
}




,
Your logout script must start the session, destroy it and then redirect to somewhere else. Note: it might be a good idea to add CSRF protection here in case someone sends a link hidden in this page somehow. For more information about CSRF you could visit Coding Horror.
The current code for logging out the user, which you should add to a file called logout.php in the application's includes directory, is:



<?php
include_once 'functions.php';
sec_session_start();
 
// Unset all session values 
$_SESSION = array();
 
// get session parameters 
$params = session_get_cookie_params();
 
// Delete the actual cookie. 
setcookie(session_name(),
        '', time() - 42000, 
        $params, 
        $params, 
        $params, 
        $params);
 
// Destroy session 
session_destroy();
header('Location: ../index.php');




,
The registration code is included in two new files, called register.php in the application's root directory and register.inc.php in the includes directory. It does the following things:
Obtains and validates the username the user wishes to adopt
Obtains and validates the user's email address
Obtains and validates the password the user wants to use
Hashes the password and passes it back to the register.php page (i.e. it posts to itself)


Most of the validation is done in JavaScript, client side. This is because the user has no motivation to circumvent these checks. Why would a user want to create an account that would be less secure than otherwise? We will discuss the JavaScript in the next section.TIP: $error_msg can be changed into an array instead of simply making it one long string of errors. This is as simple as setting $error_msg = array(); at the top of the file. Then replacing every $error_msg .= to $error_msg= serialize($error_msg);, the serialize turns the array into a single string so the post is able to use it. To use this post on the page after registering, simply do: $error_variable = unserialize($_POST);, of course you should always use an if(isset($_POST)) {$error_variable = unserialize($_POST);} as this checks if the variable is actually set.
For now, just create the register.php file and include the following code in it:

If there is no POST data passed into the form, the registration form is displayed. The form's submit button calls the JavaScript function regformhash(). This function does the necessary validation checks and submits the form when all is well. The JavaScript functions are discussed in the next section.
If the POST data exists, some server side checks are done to sanitise and validate it. NOTE that these checks are not complete at the time of writing. Some of the issues are mentioned in the comments in the file. At present, we just check that the email address is in the correct format, that the hashed password is the correct length and that the user is not trying to register an email that has already been registered.
If everything checks out, the new user is registered by writing a new record into the members table.
, We will use the hashing function so our passwords don't get sent in plain text.
The file can be downloaded from pajhome.org.uk
(It is also saved in the github repository)
Store your copy of this file in a directory called ""js"", off the root directory of the application.
, 
    var p = document.createElement(""input"");
 
    // Add the new element to our form. 
    form.appendChild(p);
    p.name = ""p"";
    p.type = ""hidden"";
    p.value = hex_sha512(password.value);
 
    // Make sure the plaintext password doesn't get sent. 
    password.value = """";
 
    // Finally submit the form. 
    form.submit();
}
 
function regformhash(form, uid, email, password, conf) {
     // Check each field has a value
    if (uid.value == ''         || 
          email.value == ''     || 
          password.value == ''  || 
          conf.value == '') {
 
        alert('You must provide all the requested details. Please try again');

        alert('Passwords must be at least 6 characters long.  Please try again');
        form.password.focus();
        return false;

    var re = /(?=.*\d)(?=.*)(?=.*).{6,}/; 
    if (!re.test(password.value)) {
        alert('Passwords must contain at least one number, one lowercase and one uppercase letter.  Please try again');
        return false;
    }
 
    // Check password and confirmation are the same
    if (password.value != conf.value) {
        alert('Your password and confirmation do not match. Please try again');
        form.password.focus();
        return false;
    }
 
    // Create a new element input, this will be our hashed password field. 
    var p = document.createElement(""input"");
 
    // Add the new element to our form. 
    form.appendChild(p);
    p.name = ""p"";
    p.type = ""hidden"";
    p.value = hex_sha512(password.value);
 
    // Make sure the plaintext password doesn't get sent. 
    password.value = """";
    conf.value = """";
 
    // Finally submit the form. 
    form.submit();
    return true;
}




In both cases, the JavaScript hashes the password and passes it in the POST data by creating and populating a hidden field.
,
This is an HTML form with two text fields, named ""email"" and ""password"". The form's submit button calls the JavaScript function formhash(), which will generate a hash of the password, and send ""email"" and ""p"" (the hashed password) to the server. You should create this file in the application's root directory.
When logging in, it is best to use something that is not public, for this guide we are using the email as the login id, the username can then be used to identify the user. If the email is not displayed on any pages within the wider application, it adds another unknown for anyone trying to crack the account.
Note: even though we have encrypted the password so it is not sent in plain text, it is essential that you use the HTTPS protocol (TLS/SSL) when sending passwords in a production system. It cannot be stressed enough that simply hashing the password is not enough. A man-in-the-middle attack could be mounted to read the hash being sent and use it to log in.

, This is the page to which the user is redirected after successfully registering. Of course you can make this page anything you like or redirect to another page entirely (or even not at all). It's up to you. The page should be located in the root directory of the application. The current register_success.php page that we have written looks like this:



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset=""UTF-8"">
        <title>Secure Login: Registration Success</title>
        <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""styles/main.css"" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Registration successful!</h1>
        <p>You can now go back to the <a href=""index.php"">login page</a> and log in</p>
    </body>
</html>





, Call it error.php This is the page to which users will be directed if an error occurs during the login or registration process, or when trying to establish a secure session. The code given below simply provides a bare bones error page. You will probably need something a bit more sophisticated. However, please note that the input into the page must be properly filtered to guard against XSS attacks. The example page code is:



<?php
$error = filter_input(INPUT_GET, 'err', $filter = FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
 
if (! $error) {
    $error = 'Oops! An unknown error happened.';
}
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset=""UTF-8"">
        <title>Secure Login: Error</title>
        <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""styles/main.css"" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>There was a problem</h1>
        <p class=""error""><?php echo $error; ?></p>  
    </body>
</html>





,
One of the most common problems with authentication systems is the developer forgetting to check if the user is logged in. It is very important you use the code below on every protected page to check that the user is logged in. Make sure you use this function to check if the user is logged in.



// Include database connection and functions here.  See 3.1. 
sec_session_start(); 
if(login_check($mysqli) == true) {
        // Add your protected page content here!
} else { 
        echo 'You are not authorized to access this page, please login.';
}




As an example of what you should do, we have included a sample protected page. Create a file called protected_page.php in the root directory of the application. The file should contain something like the following:




<?php
include_once 'includes/db_connect.php';
include_once 'includes/functions.php';
 
sec_session_start();
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset=""UTF-8"">
        <title>Secure Login: Protected Page</title>
        <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""styles/main.css"" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <?php if (login_check($mysqli) == true) : ?>

For this method you need two objects to work with. One could be a line/object/block/image/group and the other could be different (eg. one line and one image, or one block and one image). Or they could both be the same thing (eg. two lines or two images).

, Choose which object is the correct size for you, and leave it alone. Choose the thing you want to scale and click on it.

, Or choose the Scale button from the modify tab in the ribbon.

, So select your base point (could be the point where the two objects line up).

, You can click on ""reference"" / or just type ""r"" and ↵ Enter.

,, You can select a midpoint of the object, or select the end, depending on how much you want to scale it. According to what you want, click on a point anywhere the object you want to scale. (Don't click on the objects base point again.)

, Now you can click on how long you want the object to be. It could be to the midpoint of the first object, or it could be the full length of the first object. If you put the Object Snap (OSnap) off now, you can click anywhere in the workspace and your object will scale to that size."

Import or go to the Autocad drawing that is not to scale.,
Identify one line segment in the drawing that you know the length of.,
Measure the length of the line segment that you chose in Step 2.,
Divide the length the line should be by the length the line is in the drawing.,
Type ""scale"" into the command prompt followed by the space bar.,
Check the line that you measured in step 2 to make sure the scale is now accurate.",How to Set up an AutoCAD Drawing2," It is okay if the Autocad drawing is not to scale, as long as you know at least one length. Type in ""UN"" followed by the space bar to change the units. Make sure the units are architectural and the precision is 1/6"".;
, This can be a wall length or the length of a building. Larger lengths make more accurate scaling in Autocad. You do not want to scale the whole drawing by the width of a door or the length of a piece of furniture, for example.

, Click on the line, type ""properties"" followed by the space bar in the command prompt. Scroll down the pop up window until you see the length of the line. Write this number down. You can also draw a new line in the drawing to scale from, if the line doesn't exist in the drawing, like the length of a building, for example.

, (length full scale) / (length measured in drawing). You should get a decimal number. Write this number down.

, Then select the entire AutoCad drawing and press the space bar. Then click any part of the drawing. You will see as you move your mouse, AutoCad is attempting to manually scale the drawing. Do not click a second time. Instead type in the command prompt the decimal number you got from Step 5. Then press the space bar. The drawing should be scaled accurately.

, If it is close, but slightly off, you may have not included enough decimal places in your scale calculation. Simply repeat steps 3-6 for the new scaled drawing to get the scale even more precise. After a second run of the scale, the AutoCad drawing should be accurately scaled.

"
"
Check the settings.,
Use the following:


Command: Line --> Draw a line of a length that you want to use (for example, you have an object in your drawing, and you want it to be 100 units long, so draw a 100 units long line).,
Select the base point.,
Pick first point and endpoint of your referenced line that you drew.

,
Done.",How to Set up an AutoCAD Drawing3," Before scaling, you should make sure that all layers are set to ON and UNLOCKED.


Note: Pretty much the same procedure can be used when rotating an object by an undefined angle.

, This is going to be your reference length.
Command: Scale --> select entire drawing, except your reference line, press space.

,


Type ""re"" (as reference), press space.
Pick first point and endpoint of the object from your drawing, that you want it to be 100 units long.
Type ""po"" (as points), press space.

,, Instead of you having to calculate and writing down decimals, now AutoCAD will do it instead, and the result will be most accurately scaled drawing.

Do some further reading.",How to Create a Python App in Google Appengine," Download and install Python 2.7 for your platform, if you haven’t done so already (as of this writing, only 2.5 and 2.7 versions are supported) . Then, download and install the GAE API from here. MSI setups are available for windows platform. For Linux, you can just unzip into a local folder like ‘~/programs/’. The zip file will create a subdir called ‘google_appengine’. Practically, the only two Python scripts you are ever going to need to develop a GAE app are: dev_appserver.py and appcfg.py;
, Register your subdomain on GAE by visiting https://appengine.google.com. Once you register your app there, you will get a subdomain called http://your-app-id.appspot.com. There are also options for redirecting your custom domain such as www.mydomain.com to your app subdomain.

, This is as simple as creating a folder on your machine such as ~/source/foo in linux or C:\source\foo in windows. Then just create a text file named app.yaml with below contents inside this folder.
#application: your-app-id


#version:1


#runtime: python27


#api_version: 1


#threadsafe: true


#handlers:


#- url: /.*


#script: helloworld.application


Note that your-app-id is the name that you just registered for yourself, make sure that it is typed correctly. version parameter refers to the version of your app, while api_version is the version of GAE SDK used to run this app. The line “script: helloworld.application” indicates that this wsgi handler will be invoked for your app.

, This is as simple as creating a Python file named “helloworld.py” in the same folder as above, and add below contents to it.

#import webapp2


#class MainPage(webapp2.RequestHandler):


#def get(self):


#self.response.headers= 'text/plain'


#self.response.write('Hello, World!')


#application =webapp2.WSGIApplication([


#('/', MainPage),


], debug=True)


, To test your app, open up your terminal and change directory to your GAE installation folder (alternatively, add the GAE installation folder to your PATH/$PATH environment variable to avoid doing this each time), and then type the below command

python dev_appserver.py ~/source/foo

OR on Windows:

python dev_appserver.py C:\source\foo


, Want to host this app on GAE and check it out? Just fire up your terminal as described above and issue this command:

python appcfg.py update ~/source/foo

or on Windows:

python appcfg.py update C:\source\foo


Test your app: The above command should host your app on your appspot subdomain (it will ask for your Google username/password before doing so). Once the app is successfully hosted, you can check it out by visiting http://your-app-id.appspot.com.

, Now that you have a working app, you can actually visit the official reference to read more about:

Use single-line comments for short comments.,
Use multi-line comments for longer comments or code testing.,
Use comments to leave notes about how code works.,
Leave comments so that you remember what you were doing.,
Comment on code you intend to share.,
Use comments to keep specific blocks of code from being run.,
Be careful when commenting out large blocks of code.,
Use comments to create pseudo-documentation.",How to Comment in PHP," If you need to leave a short comment, you can use the single-line comment code. The comment will only last to the end of the line or the end of the code block. These comments only work within PHP tags, and will be read if placed in HTML.<?php
 
 // This is the standard (C++) way to create a single-line comment
 
 # You can also use this Unix style to create a single-line comment
 
 ?>


;
, Multi-line comments are useful for writing a long explanation, or for preventing a segment of code from being processed. See the ""Usage"" section below for some tips on using multi-line comments.<?php
 
/* This is how you format
a multi-line comment. Everything 
until the ending tag will be included
in the comment */
 
/* Some people like to include 
* extra markers at the beginning 
* of each line. This can help with readability
* for large comments, but isn't necessary.
*/
 
 ?>




, You shouldn't have to do this for every line of code, since good code should be fairly easy to parse by other programmers. It is useful if the code is performing irregular or not obvious functions.// Generate curl request
$session = curl_init($request);
// Tell curl to use HTTP POST
curl_setopt ($session, CURLOPT_POST, true);




, Whenever you're working on your own projects, comments can help you remember where you left off. Leave comments on code that isn't working properly, or that you haven't finished yet.





// Need to revisit the output for this before moving on
echo ""Hello World!"";




, If you plan on collaborating with others, or intend to make your code open-source, comments can help others figure out how your code functions and the best places to make improvements./* Is there a more effective way to accomplish this? */
Gender:
<input type=""radio"" name=""gender""

value=""female"">Female
<input type=""radio"" name=""gender""
<?php if (isset($gender) && $gender==""male"") echo ""checked"";?>
value=""male"">Male




, This is useful if you're testing something and need to prevent certain code from being run. Anything contained within the comment tags will be ignored when the page is loaded.





 <?php
 
echo ""/*Hello*/ World!"";
 
 /* The word ""Hello"" will not be displayed 
 when the above code is run */
 
 ?>




, The comment function will end whenever the first ending tag is hit, so if there's already a multi-line comment inside the code you comment out, the comment will only last until the end of the original nested comment.





 <?php
 
 /* 
echo ""Hello World!""; /* This comment will mess things up */
*/
 
 ?>









 <?php
 
 /* 
echo ""Hello World!""; // This comment will be fine
*/

, You can use some creative code formatting to create documentation for your code directly in the code. This can be useful for open-source projects.

Add the log-in block.",How to Create a Log in Script in Perl Without the Use of Databases,"


sub change {
my($a) = @_;
chdir ""$a"" or die ""ERROR: $!"";

}


sub is a subroutine/function declaration. This code can function by typing either change(""test"") or &change(""test"").

my is the word of a special variable designed for only the block of code (a block is {}). Similar in math class, a variable is a placeholder that holds bytes.

chdir is another word for ""change directory"". A substitute is system ""cd $a"", in this case.

or are logical operators with true and false as the ""answers"".

die is a command that prints the message to STDERR (another name for ""Standard Error""). $! and $@ represent why the command failed, and can be added to die, as well as others.

;
,,


print ""Do you want to register or log-in? ""; chomp($a=<STDIN>);

print is a word meaning to print data.

chomp is a function to chop of the newline that the nasty <STDIN> leaves after input. You could also use the chop command.

,


if($a =~ /register/i) {
# Stuff goes here...
}

if is a boolean condition block with true or false.


=~ means to compare to a regular expression operator. If you use UNIX/LINUX or something similar, the grep command should be similar.

/register/i is the text that the regular expression should compare to. The / means to start, the word register is the code the operator will compare to, and the second / means to end. The letter i means to use case-insensitivity, as case-sensitivity is commonly used.

# is to signify a comment. The rest of the line is commented, the text will be ignored by the compiler.

{ to } represents a block. These will be executed when called.

,


print ""What is your name: ""; chomp($name=<STDIN>);
print ""What is your password: ""; chomp($password=<STDIN>);

,, Remember to add this between the two curly braces!


#* change ""name"";
open NAME, "">$name.nme"";
print NAME ""$name"";
close NAME;
change "".."";
change ""password"";
open PASSWORD "">$name.pswrd"";
print PASSWORD ""$password"";
close PASSWORD;
change "".."";

print ""Complete.\n"";


change is the function we wrote when we first wrote the program. The function would change directory to the name we specified.

open NAME, "">$name.nme"" or open PASSWORD, "">$name.pswrd"" will ""open the file"" on the second parameter (>$name.nme or something close), and give a ""name"" to it, known as file handle. The name is the first parameter (like NAME or PASSWORD). The > sign in the files name represents ""types"". < and nothing are reading, > is writing (overwrites anything) and >> is appending (writes additional stuff).

print NAME or print PASSWORD is a command. In this case, we use the print function to print data to a filehandle, which then will be processed and (with the > and >>) added.

change "".."" is using the change we added to go back a directory. The command for going back is "".."".

\n represents a newline.



,


else {
print ""Name: ""; chomp($a=<STDIN>);
print ""Password: ""; chomp($b=<STDIN>);
change ""name"";
open NAME ""$a.nme"";
$c=<NAME>;
close NAME;
change "".."";
change ""password"";
open PASSWORD ""$a.pswrd"";
$d=<PASSWORD>;
close PASSWORD;
change "".."";
if($a =~ /$c/ and $b =~ /$d/) {
print ""Log-in successful!\n"";
sleep(2);
print ""Hello, $a!\n"";

}


else is if the if test failed. The compiler will run the block.

$c=<NAME> or $d=<PASSWORD> means that the variable's data will be assigned to the filehandle specified.

sleep(2) means that the compiler should wait for the number specified. 2 means to wait for two ""blinks"" on the prompt.

, To change the timezone in PHP, use this function: date_default_timezone_set ( 'America/Los_Angeles' ); where 'America/Los_Angeles' refers to the timezone you wish to switch to. Anytime you call a function (after calling date_default_timezone_set) that interacts with the date/time, you will be using the new selected timezone.

Company’s Clientele: First of all check if the company has some satisfied customers.,
Customer’s Feedback: The next thing to note is if any customer has provided their feedback on the quality of their work.,
Company’s services: Check their services.,
Software: Investigate the quality of work.,
Customization: Another tool to measure the company’s worth is to check if it provides custom CAD solutions.",How to Get Better Designs Using CAD," Check their customer’s list if available. The CAD design service providers may also display a portfolio of their works in order to make their point.;
, It can be a good mirror of the company’s standing as a CAD service provider.

, Checking their available solutions is also a good parameter to confirm if the company has viable design services. These services must include basic CAD services as well as advanced solutions.

, The use of software also affects the quality of the work. Good companies use only the latest and the best rated software.

, Check if the company provides custom 3D CAD services as it is the most complex service in the architectural CAD services.


Other relevant points: Apart from these points, service quality, customer support service, pricing and the time it takes the company to successfully finish a project may also affect its standing in providing better CAD services.

This way you can ensure that you have the most up-to-date hardware and all the capabilities it offers. Not only will this give you more options to experiment with, but the price difference shouldn't be very significant.;
, The Raspberry Pi is available in stores and online from several different companies in many different packages, so it can be a little overwhelming at first. Oftentimes they are bundled with a wide range of accessories in various Starter Kits. The standalone base model can also be purchased by itself without any accessories. But not all ‘Starter Kits’ are alike; some might not come with everything you actually need to get started, whereas others might have far more than needed.

If you have already purchased a Raspberry Pi, take notice of what was included in the box as you may need to acquire a few more items.
If you have not yet purchased a Raspberry Pi, take stock of what you already own as you might find you don’t need everything in a starter kit. Some people might find they already have plenty of HDMI cables or 5 volt MicroUSB Power Adapters leftover from old smartphones and TV's and may not need a Starter Kit.

, If you were to simply hook up all the components together and plug in the power . . . nothing will happen. That’s because there’s no operating system (OS) on the Raspberry Pi yet, meaning there's no software to tell the hardware what to do. Fear not, for there are many operating systems you can use and installing them is easy! This guide will cover Raspbian, the official operating system designed for the Raspberry Pi. There are 3 methods to do it!

, This is the easiest option if:

You don’t already have a micro SD card
You don't have an SD card reader
You don't have access to the internet

, NOOBS is an acronym for “New Out Of the Box Software” and is also internet slang for “newbie.” And that you are! It is a program that will make it easy to install the Rasbian operating system onto the Raspberry Pi from the microSD card. Online sellers like Amazon and Adafruit sell microSD cards with operating systems already loaded on them. Most of these microSD cards come with “NOOBS” preloaded on them, which is a program that allows you to pick from several selected operating systems and install the one of your choice.

It's important to note that there may be no way of knowing when the SD card was preloaded with NOOBS, so it could be an older version of the operating system that is not up to date. Generally, this won’t be a problem if you plan to connect your Raspberry Pi to the internet, since you can always upgrade it later, but those without internet access should be aware of this possibility.

, That's it! Once it arrives, you're ready to Boot Up the Raspberry Pi., This is the best option if:

You already have a suitable microSD card
You have an SD card reader
You can access the internet

, Find the section that says “NOOBS (Offline and network Install)” on the left side of the page., Then select what folder to save it to. This is a large file and will take a while to download., If the microSD card was previously used in a camera or smartphone or some other device, the card needs to be formatted to ensure there is nothing else on it. Just deleting the old files manually could cause errors., This is the official website of the SD Association and they have a free tool called SDFormatter for formatting SD cards.,, Select the option for the operating system you are currently using., This accepts the terms and conditions and the download should start right away. Then select which folder to save it to, and wait for the download to finish.,


Double click the zip file to open it. Then double click the file ""setup"" to start installation.







Double Click the installer package to begin installation.







, Check to see what drive letter your computer assigns your microSD card., Make sure the correct drive letter of your microSD card is selected. You may have to click ‘refresh’ to see the correct drive letter appear. Here you can also assign your microSD card a new name in the ""Volume Label"" box, if you choose. In the provided example, the new microSD card name will be ""BOOT"" after formatting., Wait for the SD card to finish formatting., Select all the files.,,


Right click on the microSD card drive and select ""Eject.""







Drag the microSD card drive to the trash bin.







, You did it! Don't you feel alive!? You can now proceed to Boot Up the Raspberry Pi., In this method, instead of installing the operating system from an installer package (such as NOOBS), you will copy over the entire operating system to the SD card, already installed and unpacked. This is the best option if:

You don’t want to have to wait for the OS to install
You want to boot directly into the desktop environment
You want to improve your “nerd cred”

, Find the section that says “RASPBIAN JESSIE WITH PIXEL” on the left side of the page.,

This is a large file and could take a long time to download. While that's downloading, let's grab Etcher, a free program that will write the image file to the microSD card.

,, Make sure you've selected the operating system that you are currently using. Select a folder to save it to.,


Click the install file and then click ""Install.""





Click on the install file and then drag the Etcher icon into the Applications folder.





, Take note of the drive letter your computer assigns to it., Drag and drop the image file somewhere easy to access, like the desktop., Click ""Select Image"". Select the image file you just extracted from the Raspbian zip file on the desktop., Select the drive letter of your microSD card.

If the wrong drive letter is selected, click ""change"" and pick the correct one.

, Wait for Etcher to finish writing the image file to your microSD card.,


Right click on the microSD card drive and select ""Eject.""







Drag the microSD card drive to the trash bin.







, If you are looking down onto the Raspberry Pi board from above, the gold contacts of the SD card should be facing up towards you, as pictured.

It will slide into place securely and can only be plugged in the correct way.







,

Keyboard (USB)
Mouse (USB)
Display/TV/Monitor (HDMI)

, It's alive! It's alive!

If you have NOOBS preloaded on your SD card, it will load up an installation menu asking which OS you’d like to install. To install Raspbian, simply check the box next to it and click “Install” and this will start the installation process.






When it has finished, it should reboot and startup Pixel, Raspbian’s new desktop environment. If, for some reason, you are still looking at a command prompt like the one pictured, simply type “startx” and then press ""Enter"" on the keyboard and it will load up the desktop environment.








If you have the Rasbian image flashed to your SD card instead of NOOBS, it should boot you straight into the desktop on startup. What a beautiful sight!







,, Once Wifi is enabled it will display a list of available networks., Enter the password, then click “OK."",,,,, For those familiar with PC’s this is similar to changing the BIOS settings. Once you have it the way you want it, you shouldn’t need to fuss with it much again.,, The file system will be enlarged upon the next reboot.” This is important because by default, the Raspberry Pi only uses as much of the SD card as the operating system requires. This setting will now let us use the rest of the SD card as free space. Press “Enter” to go back to the raspi-config menu.,,,,,,,,, It will ask “Would you like to reboot now?” Select “Yes” and press “Enter”,,,,"

Know that Lua has a strict syntax, or format, the way the program is set up.,
Know that the computer runs through the program line by line, starting from the top and working it's way all the way down to the bottom, unless told to go to another line.,
Know that Lua has variables, an element which is extremely important.,
Make a variable.",How to Get Started with Lua1," You must have a different command per line, and in those commands, if you get even a single dot wrong, the whole program will crash. We will learn more about commands later in the tutorial.

, It is helpful to know this when you are bugfixing, meaning going through and fixing mistakes in the code. They can simply be typos, or complicated things.

, A variable can be called anything, except for a number.

, Just type what you want the variable to be called, then an = sign, then what you want the variable to store.

"
"
Variables can be whatever you want, like these examples.,
There are things called strings in lua.,
See these examples:

,
This is the main command for talking to the user in the program.,
It will type the text or number you want onto the screen.

,
For strings, all you need to do is type 'print' then a space, then the string in quotes, as in this example.

,
For variables, you need to type 'print' and then the name of the variable in brackets, as shown.

,
This will print whatever is in the variable.,
Halfway through a string you want to print, if you type \n then it will print the rest of the text on a new line.,
You need a way of letting the user enter information for the program to use.,
It looks a bit complicated, but don't worry, it's not.,
Try to find out what this program will do, just as some practice.

,

What does this program do and how does it work?







,
Comments are lines of code put into the program to help you know what sections of the code do what.,
For example, if you wanted to mark a section of code which is used to add two numbers together you would add this comment.

",How to Get Started with Lua2,";
, These can be stored in variables like numbers, but they are text. All strings must have quotes “around them.

,, you can print variables or strings.

,,,, You don't have to have a set variable, either. You can print an equation, as shown.

, For example:

, When this is in the program and the computer gets up to it, the computer will stop and not go onto anything else in the code until the user has entered in some information. This is where the user input command comes in. Here is what it looks like:

, all you have to worry about is the 'A' at the start. This is the variable in which the information is stored. It can be anything, and once it's entered you can do whatever you want with it.

,,, As long as one of your lines of code starts with two dashes -- then the program will ignore whatever comes after it on that line. They are purely there to help you keep track of your program.

,"
"
The computer would ignore this line, as long as it starts with the two dashes.

,
These are sections of code which allows you to only run that section of code if certain variables are certain things.,
on the line of code that starts with 'if' you then have a space, then the name of a variable, then what operation (== means equal to, ~= means not equal to, => means bigger than etc) then the line must end with 'then'.

,
You can even have statements inside other statements, but just be sure you have the right amount of 'end's at the end.,
This can be useful for a variety of things, for example this.,
This is very similar to the 'if' statement, but instead it will keep looping through the code inside it until it is told to stop.,
This program will print the numbers from 1 to 20 and then it will stop, because it got above 20.,
You use this in your 'if' statement, at the end.",How to Get Started with Lua3,", Whenever you want in your code you can add one of these, and then enter some code into it. It will only do that code if the variables you say are equal to a certain thing. Once you have finished the code in the statement you must type a line of code which simply says 'end' without the quotes and it will tell the computer that that is the end if the code in the statement.

,, You can also have more than one variable, by saying either 'and' or 'or'.

, It will ask you what your favourite animal is, then says it likes that animal too. If you type in something completely different then it will say it doesn't understand you. Try to see how it works.

, This is how you use it.

, A lot of Lua programs are just massive 'while' loops with a whole lot of 'if' statements in them.

, If the variables don't match to anything on the 'if' line, then it goes onto the 'else' section.

Determine if your programming language has a random function as well as a function to seed the random number generator.,
You need to seed the random number generator first, so that you don't get the same list of numbers each time you run it.,
To make it an integer you multiply the result by the top value and round out the result.,
Understand that to get all the numbers to be different you will create a loop until you get as many numbers as you might need and then store the results to check they're not repeated:





function random_numbers(int howmany, int maxlimit) {
  int ret_array// This is the array where you'll store the generated numbers
  srand( (unsigned int) time(0) ) //seed the random number generator
while(ret_array.size() < howmany){
 int rnd = random() % maxlimit // Generate an int random number between 0 and""maxlimit""
 if(!includes(ret_array, rnd)){
   ret_array.push(rnd) // You're going to store only those numbers that don't belong to the array
}}
  return ret_array
}




,
Now, if you don't have that ""includes"" function, it's quite easy to program:





function includes(int array[], int number){
 for(int i = 0; i < array.size(); i  ){
 if(array== number){
  return true
 }}
  return false
}




Iterate as many times as needed in order to fill the array with different numbers.",How to Generate N Different Random Numbers," For example the function may be rand() or random() for generating random numbers and random() or srandom() for seeding the random number generator. Most modern languages do and the rand() or random() functions usually return a rational between 0 and 1.
, To seed the random number generator, you need to pass an integer to the srand function. Example: 'srand( (unsigned int) time(0))'. This would pass the number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970.

, For example, to get a random number between 0 and 50 type: random() % 50.

,, For each random number, we check if it's already in the array. If it isn't, then we push it in, otherwise, we just loop and try again with a different number.

Consider installing a user friendly intermediary program like TeXShop (for Macs) or TeXworks (for all users).;
, If you installed TeXShop or TeXworks, launch these directly from your applications. Otherwise launch LaTeXIT directly.

, For instance, a command is always proceeded by a backslash. Commands tell LaTeX how you want to format the document, from document style to text color, and also helps you add in special notations, pictures, etc. Commands are typically followed by a set of braces, in which you specify what you would like to happen.

, This is done using the command \documentclass{}. In the braces you should place what type of document you are creating, which is usually an article. So, if writing an article simply type \documentclass{article} on the first line, and then hit enter to move to the next line. Other document classes include book, slides, and report.

, This is done using the command \title{}. For instance, for this document one would type \title{How to Get Started Using LaTeX}. This typically is on the second line of the page.

, Use the command \author{}. For instance, \author{Your Name}.

, This is optional. LaTeX will automatically update the date to be current unless you set it using \date{}.

, This can include font size, font style, margins and other styling and formatting for the entire document. For an introduction you can skip this step, but the commands are easy to find online.

, LaTeX packages can be extremely helpful in improving the flexibility and usefulness of the program.To use a specific package use the command \usepackage{} or \RequirePackage{} with the package name in the braces.
More than one package may be used. For instance might write \usepackage{graphicx} to tell LaTeX to use the graphicx package, which is useful for inserting pictures and graphs. Another helpful package for use in math mode (see later steps) is amsmath and amssymb.

, Using the command \begin{document} tells the program that you are done with the document formatting and ready to start writing!

, If what you are writing does not require a title, you can skip this step. To make a title using the title, author, and date that you set, enter the command \maketitle on a new line.

, You can now type anything that you desire in plain text. Note that a line of blank space or the command \newline is required to start text in a new paragraph or new line.

, Explore some formatting options such as putting text inside \textbf{} command to make it bold or inside \textcolor{red}{} to make it red (or another color as specified).

, Math mode is really why you want to use LaTeX. There are many ways to access math mode.


If you wish to put an equation or math symbol in line with text, simply surround it with dollar signs. For instance, one may write $8 - 9 = -1$. If you want the equation on a new line, centered, surround it with backslash and bracket. For example, \. Using packages can further enhance the uses of math mode. For instance, with the package amsmath, you can align a set of equations using the \begin{align} and \end{align} commands. There are also many built in commands specifically for math mode. Most mathematical symbols are represented by some command, such as using \pi to write everyone's favorite irrational number.
Additionally, there are math formatting functions, such as using the \frac command to write the fraction for one third by typing \frac{1}{3}. If you use math commands outside of math mode, you will receive an error when you try to compile.

, You must end the document using the command \end{document}, placed on the last line.

, Hit the Typeset button or use a keyboard shortcut (e.g. ⌘ Cmd+⇧ Shift+T for Mac) to typeset your document. This will output a beautiful PDF with all your formatting. This PDF, along with 3 other helper files, will be saved in the same place as your LaTeX document.


If you get an error, read the error message in the console and see if you've made a typo or other small mistake. If it is not compiling, make sure you have ""LaTeX"" selected from the dropdown button next to the Typeset button.

Add internet permissions to the Android Manifest.,
Create a try block.,
Build HttpURLConnection and URL objects.,
Set the request method to Post.,
Output the stream to the server.,
Catch any exceptions.,
Disconnect from the URL.",How to Execute HTTP POST Requests in Android," The Android Manifest is an XML file that provides important information to the Android system that determines device compatibility and access to features. In the “AndroidManifest.xml” file, enter the following line to provide internet access.




<uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.INTERNET"" />


;
, In Java, a try statement is an exception handler that will prevent the program from crashing if it is not able to perform an action. Because this will require a connection to a network location, a try statement will catch an exception if it is not able to establish a connection. You can add this to a new Java method.try {
//enter statements that can cause exceptions
}





, Java is an Object-Oriented language. An object is comprised of states and behaviors which is an instance of a class. The HttpURLConnection object sends and receives data over the internet. In your code, begin your new method by creating a URL object and assign it a URL for the HttpURLConnection object to connect to. URL url = new URL(“http://exampleurl.com/”);        
HttpURLConnection client = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();





For best practice, establish the URL and HttpURLConnection objects outside of the try block to make it easier to catch exceptions.





URL url = new URL(“http://exampleurl.com/”);        
HttpURLConnection client = null;
try {
client = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
}




, In order to send information to the server, you must set the HttpURLConnection object’s type to post and set the output to true using setDoOutput(). Use the setRequestProperty() function to set a general request property which requires two elements, a key with a known request from the server and a value that’s contained within the corresponding key.

The setRequestProperty() function is used as the Accept-Encoding request header to disable automatic decompression.





client.setRequestMethod(“POST”);
client.setRequestProperty(“Key”,”Value”);
client.setDoOutput(true);




, You must request the output stream from the server in order to be able to write to the output stream, or post, then flush and close the stream when finished.




OutputStream outputPost = new BufferedOutputStream(client.getOutputStream());
writeStream(outputPost);
outputPost.flush();
outputPost.close();





For performance reasons, it’s a good idea to let the server know how large in bytes the content will be. The best method is setFixedLengthStreamingMode(int) when the body length is known,whereas setChunkedStreamingMode(int) is used if it’s length is not known.Not using either of the previous methods causes the HttpURLConnection object to buffer the complete body in memory before being transmitted.





client.setFixedLengthStreamingMode(outputPost.getBytes().length);
client.setChunkedStreamingMode(0);




, After the try statement, use the catch block to check for an exception for input and output with IOException, catch a URL error with the MalformedURL exception and check if the URL does not provide a response in time with the SocketTimeoutException.




catch(MalformedURLException error) {
        //Handles an incorrectly entered URL
}
catch(SocketTimeoutException error) {
//Handles URL access timeout.
}
catch (IOException error) {
//Handles input and output errors
}




, After you are finished with your URL connection, you will need to disconnect from the URL. Be sure to check that you are connected to a URL before attempting to disconnect.




finally {
if(client != null) // Make sure the connection is not null.
client.disconnect();
}

Program listing one below.,
To fix this error, call a floating-point (f-p) function or just add link of a file, which contains at least one floating-point (f-p) function.,
Program listing two below.,
A cleaner option is to enable floating point library linking in Turbo C/ C++ or Borland C/ C++ from linker options for library to include floating point.

","How to Fix ""Floating Point Formats Not Linked"" Error in Turbo C/ Borland C","


int main() {
struct STUDENT{
int rollno;
char stdname;
float percentage;
} *s1;
printf(""\Enter student details: "");
scanf(""%d %s %f"",
&s1->rollno,
s1->stdname,
&s1->percentage);
printf(""\nThe entered details are: "");
printf(""Roll: %d, Name: %s, Percentage: %f "",
s1->rollno,
s1->stdname,
s1->percentage);
getch();
return 0;
}
The above C program is written and compiled in Turbo C. When this program is executed, the compiler displays the following error,Scanf: floating point formats not linked and the program gets terminated abnormally.
This happens because of the variable *s1, which is a pointer to the structure ""STUDENT"", in which programmer had defined a ""float"" variable named ""percentage"". It means an error was found when the program tried to read a value for float data type using a pointer to structure. When the program is executed, the compiler, displayed a runtime error at the line scanf (""%f"", ... %s1->percentage).
It can happen when we use Borland C/ C++ or TurboC/C ++ as compiler. ""Floating point formats not linked"" is a Borland runtime error (Borland C or C++, Turbo C or C++). Borland's compilers do not link in the floating-point (f-p) library unless we need it. Therefore, by force we need to add any floating-point (f-p) function when we have ""%f"" or other floating point (f-p) formats in scanf() or printf() calls.;
, To do this, a hackish solution could be to define a dummy function somewhere in a source file but don't call it:


void dummy(float *a) {
float b=*a; //perform some floating access
dummy (&b); //calling a floating point function
}
It doesn't have to be in a module with the main program, as long as it's in a module that will be included in the link. Therefore, the above program should be written as follows:

,


void dummy(float *a) {
float b=*a; //perform some floating access
dummy (&b); //calling a floating point function
}
int main(){
struct STUDENT{
int rollno;
char stdname;
float percentage;
} *s1;
printf(""\Enter student details: "");
scanf(""%d %s %f"",
&s1->rollno,
s1->stdname,
s1->percentage);
printf(""\nThe entered details are: "");
printf(""Roll: %d, Name: %s, Percentage: %f "",
s1->rollno,
s1->stdname,
s1->percentage)
getch();
return 0;
}

In the above program, ""dummy"" is a user-defined function. You may give any name to this function instead of ""dummy"". Similarly, ""a"" and ""b"" are variable names, which you may change.
This is because Turbo and Borland C/ C++ compilers sometimes leave out floating point support and use non-floating-point version of printf and scanf to save space on smaller systems. The dummy call to a floating-point function will force the compiler to load the floating-point support and solve the original problem.

Use it as an outlet for creativity.,
Link coding to your other interests.,
Keep a goal in mind.",How to Develop an Interest in Coding1," You can create anything with the right lines of code – cartoons, websites, and software programs are just the most common. You might also be able to create something that no one has ever seen before. If you think about coding as an outlet for your creativity – the same way painting or writing are – you might become more interested in coding itself.For example, you could learn JavaScript to create cartoons or animations based on a story you're written.
You could also use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to create any kind of website - for a company, a product, or even your own blog.;
, If you love to read, you can use coding to build a website to write your own book reviews or blog about books you love. If you love cartoons, you can code your own animation. Think about your passions and then come up with ways that coding can help you pursue them.If you like music, for example, you can learn website coding that allows you to create a website where you can review your favorite music. With the right coding language, you can embed music samples or links to your favorite bands' websites,

, If you set out to learn coding just for the sake of learning how to code, you might not stay interested in it. Instead, have a specific goal for the coding you want to do. Tell yourself you’ll make one page of a website, or a few frames or a cartoon. Having a goal can help keep you focused and make learning to code feel less overwhelming."
"
Form a coding group with other people.,
Try out coding software, websites, or apps.,
Sample different types of coding.,
Be patient.",How to Develop an Interest in Coding2," It can be hard to maintain an interest in something that you’re doing all by yourself, so it’s probably easier to stay interested if you’re doing it along with other people. Ask your friends if they want to learn to code with you – it can make it seem more like a social activity and way more fun. It also gives you a few resources if you run into trouble., Sometimes the best way to get interested in something is to try it yourself, and there are so many free or pretty cheap ways to try out coding.

Free coding websites include Codeacademy, Free Code Camp, Codewars, and edX.
Free coding games include Scratch, through MIT’s website.
Robomind is an app available for Windows, Mac, and Linus operating systems. Cargobot is a coding game aimed toward a younger audience., If you’ve tried coding before, but just couldn’t get excited about it, it could be that the coding language you were using didn’t work for you. There are so many coding languages, and they all work a little differently. HTML and javascript are both used for websites. C or C++ can help you program your computer's operating system. Try something new and see if it gets you more interested.Python is a type of coding that you can use on a lot of different platforms. It's also pretty user-friendly, so it might be a good place to start.
Structured Query Language (SQL) is used on websites to create, store, edit, or delete any kind of website content you can think of. This is a good choice if you're thinking of creating a website that will need a lot of updating.

, A lot of people lose interest in something because they aren’t good at it right away. A lot of coders aren’t very good when they start, and that’s okay! You might not be the greatest coder right away, or you might mess up. Be patient with yourself and give yourself a chance to get good."
"
Learn the basics first.,
Start small.,
Keep a portfolio.",How to Develop an Interest in Coding3," If you try to jump in and begin coding projects right away, you might find yourself hitting a lot of dead ends because you just don't know what to do. Instead, learn the basics of the coding language you're interested in first. That way you know what each command does and where it might be useful.For example, if you want to use your coding skills to create animations, you should learn the basics of JavaScript first. Learn why you start a command with ""g."" and in what order your commands should be listed. Once you know these basics, using them to code more and more complicated projects can be a little easier.

, If your first coding project is a big project with lots of different steps, you might feel overwhelmed and lose interest in coding. If you start with a small, personal project, you can see the results of your work more quickly. Making it a personal project prevents you from feeling pressure from the person you're coding for.For example, you could start with a very short animation, where your cartoon character only does one thing - like waving.

, As you learn to code, keep a list of the projects you've completed. If you ever feel discouraged, or like you haven't accomplished much, you can look back at your portfolio. You'll be able to see how much you've done and how you've been able to complete harder and harder projects."

Learn PHP security.",How to Learn PHP and MySQL," PHP is a scripting language that you can use to build interactive scripts. These scripts are executed on the web server and then the results are returned to the viewer via HTML. PHP allows for very interactive and user-focused websites. MySQL is an open-source database language. It allows you to create, edit, and access multiple databases on your server. The combination of these two is essential for online stores, forums, games, and more.


PHP can collect form information from the user, create and edit files on the server, send and receive cookies, restrict access, encrypt data, and much more.;
, In order to use PHP and MySQL, you will need access to a web server. If you don’t have access to a web server, you will need to install one on your own computer.


This guide will show you how to find a cheap, reliable web host.
This article will show you how to create your own web server.

, There are a variety of ways that you can learn the ins and outs of PHP and MySQL coding. There are online resources, online courses, books, and classroom courses. All of these can help you learn PHP and MySQL.


The most popular online resource is w3schools.com. This is the premiere web development instruction website, and quickly covers the basics along with interactive tutorials.
There are a variety of books available as well. Some of the most popular books include “Learning PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, & CSS” by Robert Nixon and “PHP and MySQL Web Development” by Luke Welling.
Check the course listings for your local community college. There may also be programming schools in your area, or classes led in community centers. Hands-on classes led by professionals can be great for getting questions answered and seeing the code in action.

, To begin creating PHP scripts and MySQL databases, you will need to download a few basic tools. While PHP can be edited in any text editor, you will find that using a dedicated coding editor will make your life a lot easier.


Popular free editors include Notepad++, Komodo Edit, NetBeans, and Eclipse.
Popular paid programs include PhpStorm, Adobe Dreamweaver, and PHP Designer.
In order to use MySQL, you will need to have it installed on your web server.

, PHP is created in any text editor, though a dedicated coding editor will highlight your syntax and make it much easier to read.

, PHP exists within a standard HTML file. In order to see the results of your PHP script, you will need to have a basic website to display it:




<html>
<body>
<h1>PHP Test</h1>
</body>
</html>




, The “ECHO” function will print back the text to the website. This is a basic function of PHP, and will help you learn how to format PHP syntax. All PHP scripts start with <?php and end with ?>. Statements are ended with a semicolon (;).




<html>
<body>
<h1>PHP Test</h1>
<?php
echo ""This is my first PHP script!"";
?>
</body>
</html>




, This is a good practice to get into. Comments aren’t displayed to the user, but they allow other developers to see what you are doing. They can also help you remember what you were attempting if you revisit the code later.

<html>
<body>
<h1>PHP Test</h1>
<?php
// This is a comment that takes one line.
echo ""This is my first PHP script!"";
/*
This is a comment that
spans multiple lines
*/
?>
</body>
</html>




, Variables are objects that have values assigned to them in the script. You can then manipulate these variables to display results to the user. Variables are a powerful part of PHP scripting, and are denoted by a “$” before the variable.<html>
<body>
<h1>PHP Test</h1>
<?php
/*
This command will add the two variables 
and display the output (16).
*/
$x=4;
$y=12;
$z=$x+$y;
echo $z;
/*
Variables are case-sensitive. If you declare $x=4, 
but then type $X later, it will not be returned.
*/
?>
</body>
</html>




, A lot of the functionality of PHP comes from the If/Else statements. These allow you to create conditions for specific commands to occur. This is especially useful for creating customized messages, as well as checking connections.<html>
<body>
<h1>PHP Test</h1>
<?php
$t=date(""H"");
/*
This defines the “$t” variable as the time of day (date)
in a 24 hour format (H). It is based on the server’s clock.
*/
if ($t<""20"")
   {
   echo ""Have a great day!"";
   }
else
   {
   echo ""Get to sleep!"";
   }
/*
If the time is less than 20 (8 PM), then it will display 
“Have a great day!” If it is after 20, it will display 
“Get to sleep!”
*/
?>
</body>
</html>




, You will need to connect to the MySQL server before you can create your database. You can do this through the MySQL command line interface, or by using PHP, which is what will be covered here. Creating a connection uses the mysqli_connect(host, username, password) function.<?php
$connection=mysqli_connect(""example.com"",""admin"",""password1"");
/*
This creates a connection to the MySQL server on example.com
with the username “admin” and the password “password1”.
*/
if (mysqli_connect_errno())
  {
  echo ""Failed to connect to MySQL: "" . mysqli_connect_error();
  }
//This returns a message if the connection does not work.
?>





The connection to the database is assigned to the variable “$connection”. This will allow you to easily refer to the connection later in the script.
To see how to create a database using the MySQL command line, check out this article.

, Once you’ve opened the connection, you can add in code to create the database. The database will not contain any data yet; the first table in the database will be added in the next step. You will be using the CREATE DATABASE statement to create the database.




<?php
$connection=mysqli_connect(""example.com"",""admin"",""password1"");
if (mysqli_connect_errno())
  {
  echo ""Failed to connect to MySQL: "" . mysqli_connect_error();
  }
$sql=""CREATE DATABASE database1"";
if (mysqli_query($connection,$sql))
  {
  echo ""Database database1 created successfully"";
  }
else
  {
  echo ""Error creating database: "" . mysqli_error($connection);
  }
?>




, Once the database has been created, you can create a table to store data that you retrieve from forms. The table can be configured in any way you’d like to fit your data. The table created in this step will have three columns: FirstName, LastName, and Age. The table will be called “Users”




<?php
$connection=mysqli_connect(""example.com"",""admin"",""password1"", “database1”);
if (mysqli_connect_errno())
  {
  echo ""Failed to connect to MySQL: "" . mysqli_connect_error();
  }
$sql = ""CREATE TABLE Users 
(
PID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, 
PRIMARY KEY(PID),
FirstName CHAR(30),
LastName CHAR(30),
Age INT
)"";
/*
Each column needs to have the data type specified (CHAR, INT, etc.).
For the CHAR values, you need to set how long the string can be (30 in this case).
The AUTO_INCREMENT function increases the PID field by 1 for each entry.
This essentially creates an ID number for each entry added.
*/
if (mysqli_query($connection,$sql))
  {
  echo ""Table Users created successfully"";
  }
else
  {
  echo ""Error creating table: "" . mysqli_error($connection);
  }
?>




, This form will allow users to enter their information into a form on the website. This data will then be stored into a file and inserted into the database you created earlier. When the user clicks the Submit button after filling out the form, the data will be sent to the “insert.php” file.<html>
<body>
 
<form action=""insert.php"" method=""post"">
First Name: <input type=""text"" name=""firstname"">
Last Name: <input type=""text"" name=""lastname"">
Age: <input type=""text"" name=""age"">

, Once you have the form created, you will need to create the insert.php file to handle transferring the data to your database. You will be using the INSERT INTO statement to add the record to your Users table.




<?php
$connection=mysqli_connect(""example.com"",""admin"",""password1"", “database1”);
if (mysqli_connect_errno())
  {
  echo ""Failed to connect to MySQL: "" . mysqli_connect_error();
  }
$sql=""INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName, LastName, Age)
VALUES
('$_POST','$_POST','$_POST')"";
//The POST statement retrieves the data from the form.
if (!mysqli_query($connection,$sql))
  {
  die('Error: ' . mysqli_error($connection));
  }
echo ""1 record added"";
 
mysqli_close($connection);
//This command closes the connection to the database when finished.
?>




, Beyond database management, there is a lot that can be accomplished with PHP. You can open files, send emails, create cookies, start private sessions, and much more. The potential is nearly limitless, which is why so much web development is done with PHP.

, One of the quickest ways to learn PHP is to examine the code that other developers create and adapt it to your won. While there is no way to examine the PHP code of a website without direct access to the server that it is hosted on, there are a variety of communities that share code and can help explain what is going on in it.


GitHub is one of the more popular repositories for open source code and collaboration, Security on the web is a serious concern, and making sure that your code is secure is essential. This is especially important if you are dealing with passwords and payment information. Make sure that your forms and databases are secure from any intrusions.


See this article for a detailed look at creating a secure login with PHP and MySQL.

Take your stopwatch and start it at the same time you turn on your netbook.,

Stop the stopwatch when the internet window is showing your home page. Note the time it took. This is your load time. (The time can be a rough estimation if you want, i.e. : 1 min or 50 s.)

,, Start the test in the “Benchmark” tab. The running time may take up to 5 minutes depending on your hard drive speed. Once the program is done note the seek time and average transfer rate.

,, To do so, simply touch the screw on a wall outlet. This will remove all static electricity built up in your body that could damage the fragile computer parts.

, If there is more than one cover you can open, the one for the HDD is marked with 2 arrows pointing towards a circle in the middle. A little force may be required, sometimes a lot, be careful not to snap anything.

, (If you are not sure you can take it apart and put it back together I suggest you take a picture before every step you do so you will have a visual aid to re-do what you did backwards.) Sometimes a metal encasing can be holding the HDD, like in my case, make sure to remove it also.

, Re-assemble everything. Make sure not to forget any screws or not to tight them too much. (If the metal starts bending, it might be a sign that it is too tight.)

, Insert your Operating system DVD.

, By default the computer is looking at the HDD for instructions on what to do but since your HDD is empty, we need to tell it to look at the DVD instead. Once in the BIOS, look for an option called Booting, Boot sequence, Boot, Startup or something similar. Make sure the DVD reader is selected as your primary boot device. Exit and save BIOS.

, Exit and save BIOS. Unplug DVD reader, you are done with it.;

Allocate enough timings.,
Developing quality test scripts keeping in mind regression testing needs.,
Get the right automation tool.,
Keep a bird’s eye on development environment.,
Keep your tests small and lean.",How to Make Test Automation Effective in an Agile Environment," Since in agile development there is a continuous release of various iterations, the team usually misses out on the quality. Even worse, when there are several sprints which require fixing, it becomes really tough for the team to devote time in developing, fixing and testing each iteration.


It is necessary for the team to allocate enough time for testing. It is advisable to start test automation parallel to development so that there are no lags. This will help the team in becoming more productive and respond to the results quickly and avoid last minute rushes. Moreover, it will also help testers to devote time in exploratory test which requires manual efforts.;
, Teams should develop quality test scripts keeping in mind the regression testing concept. Developing quality test scripts here means, ensuring that the test scripts meet the below mentioned criteria: correctness, maintainability, versioning, integrity, portability, performance.


The objective behind this is to run testing especially regression testing smoothly and correctly without any intervention from the testers. If the test scripts are developed in the regression testing concept, the team would be able to complete the testing without much changes in the scripts and can also avail the benefits of performance, speed and accuracy.

, Testing team should also understand the fact that if it’s not the right automation tool, nothing’s going to be right. A lot of effort should be involved while evaluating and purchasing a test automation tool. One should always refer to the criteria or requirements before selecting a test automation. Below are some of the features/criteria that an ideal test automation tool should have/meet


The test automation tool you choose should be OS friendly. Larger the number of operating systems it supports, better it becomes for teams to perform testing
Test automation tool should also be in line with your budget and should incorporate features in terms of its pricing and licensing
The tool should have easy to understand architecture. Meaning, the UI, navigation and functionality should be user-friendly so that even a layman can operate it. There are certain testing tools with codeless architecture which means, testers need not write codes and can test the applications in minutes
The automation tool you choose should be able to give quick results and reporting abilities so that testers can quickly respond to the requirements of the agile testing environment

, The teams should understand and check their development environment which consists of simple virtual machines to cloud environments that deals with external services and database. Any bug or problem in the application may be the result of network problems, configurations, unavailability of services, backend data, etc. Without good understanding or monitoring of the actual environment, teams would be juggling with the root causes and would waste their time instead of achieving the results. Hence it is imperative to get complete knowledge about the development environment and their aspects before implementing test automation so that teams can divert their attention in improving the quality and not in finding the causes of defects.

, Keeping tests cases small and lean really helps avoid the unnecessary test data that do not require testing or add no value to the actual result. It also helps in dealing with complex scenarios since the test cases are small. Moreover, teams do not require analyzing large suite of test cases which contain different codes, scenarios, configurations etc. Smaller and incremental test cases also reduces the load on the agile development environment and helps in evaluating the cost vs. ROI figure for every lot.

At the Welcome screen, locate and click on the “New Composition” button in the right column. If you already have the program open, you may either click on the “Composition” tab and select “New Composition” or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+N. Every time you create a new composition, a “Composition Settings” window will appear on your screen.


Locate “Preset” and click on the drop-down menu. The menu is divided up into four sections, respectively: web settings, standard definition broadcast settings (NTSC and PAL), HD settings (the most commonly used), and film settings. Select the top HD preset: “HDV/HDTV 720 29.97.” This selection with automatically set the width, height, and frame rate.
In the second row, locate “Start Timecode” and “Duration.” Leave the “Start Timecode” at 0. “Duration” refers to the total length of the project, from start to end. Set the “Duration” to the required length for your composition.;
, Before you begin to work on the composition, you should always name and save the project. Click on the “File” tab at the top of the screen. When you select “Save,” a “Save As” window will appear. At the top of the window, type in the name of your composition. Select a location to save this file to and click the “Save” button at the bottom of the screen. The saved composition will appear in the “Project” tab to the left of the screen.


While you may save this file in any location, it is recommended that you save your composition near your “Footage” file. This file is located within the “Exercise Files” folder.

, In order to create a composition, you need material to manipulate and animate. Select File>Import>File or double click on the “Project” tab. Select all of the files you wish to import and hit “Open.” The imported files will appear in the “Project” tab. Alternative methods include:


Double click anywhere on the “Project” tab.
Strike “Command + I.”
Drag images directly into the “Project” tab., A composition is a composite graphic, or a composite of layers. Each individual layer of your composition is made up of a file. All of the layers combined form a composite graphic. There are several ways to add a file to your composition.


You may drag and drop files from the “Project” tab into the “Timeline” tab (located at the bottom right of the window), the “Composition” window (located to the right of the “Project” tab), or the “Layer” tab (located directly below the “Project” tab.)

, Once the files appear in the “Layer” tab, you may begin to manipulate the files. From this tab, you may alter the order of the files and edit the appearance of a file.


To adjust the hierarchy of the layers, drag a file up or down the list. The order of the files will alter the appearance of the composition (see the “Composition” window.) Files at the top of the layer list will appear over files at the bottom of the layer list.
To alter the appearance of a file, click on the sideways triangle next to the layer’s number. This will open up a “Transform” menu. From this menu, you may alter the following properties: anchor point, position, scale, rotation, and/or opacity., The “Timeline” function allows you to animate the graphic—it controls when each layer is or is not visible. The “Timeline” is located to the right of the “Layer” list. Each layer has it own life bar within the timeline, which you can trim, extend, or group with other layers as desired.

, Select a layer from the list. Move your cursor over the line dividing the list and the timeline so that a double arrow appears. Click and drag the double arrow across the timeline to produce a translucent grey box (this indicates that a clip is trimmed.) Stop once you reach the moment you would like the layer to appear.


The red line with the yellow tab indicates your current time. You can use this line to help you automatically trim layers. Select the layer you wish to trim. Drag the red line to your desired starting or ending point for the layer. Strike “Command + .”

, When you work within the “Composition” window, you may manually position, or transform, the layers. Select a layer from the list. Move your cursor over the “Composition” window and zoom, or scroll, out. A set of handles will appear around the composition. This indicates the the layer may be transformed, or positioned.


To shrink or expand the layer, click on the handle, press ⇧ Shift, and drag your cursor towards the inside or outside of the window.
To rotate an element, press Ctrl+W. This will activate the rotation tool.
To move a layer on a 2-D plane, click on the element you want to move and drag it to its new position.

, To create a 3D layer, return to the “Layer” tab. The column directly under this icon controls the 3D settings for each layer. To activate this feature, check the layer’s blank space in this column. Return to the “Composition” window—if you activated the 3D property, a Y, X, and Z handle will appear on the layer’s anchor.

, To move a 3D layer, press ⌘ Cmd+W to activate the rotation tool. Hover your cursor over the X or the Y axis. Click on the axis and drag your cursor to the left and right or up and down. The Z axis should always remain at “0.”, The parent function allows you to tie your layers together. One layer, the parent, will drive the actions of another layer, the child. The child layer, can still move independently of the parent.Select the child layer (the layer that you want to apply the keyframes to)—this layer will become the child.
Locate the “Parent” category in the layer tab.
In the “Parent” column for this layer, locate the curly-q shaped icon in the child’s row. Click on the icon and draw a black line from the icon to the “Layer Name” section of parent. Through this process, the child will become tied to the parent., Keyframes mark exact points in time when changes are to occur to a layer’s properties. This function, which is represented by a little stopwatch, allows you to animate your composite graphics.


Move your red “Current Time Indicator” line to the moment at which you would like to activate a keyframe.
Select a layer from the “List” tab.
Expand the layer’s “Transform” or “Contents” tab.
Click on the stopwatch icon next to the property you wish to alter. This will record a keyframe at the current time indicator. A yellow dot or a greater than/less than symbols will appear on the timeline to mark the keyframe.
To see your keyframes on the timeline, lasso the layers you wish to view and press “U.”
To move a keyframe, select a keyframe symbol on the timeline by lassoing it and then drag it to its new location. You may also copy and paste keyframes.

, Keyframes allow you to animate your project. You may alter any of the properties listed under the “Transform” or “Contents” tab. There are two basic forms of animation: with ease or linear. If a layer in animated with ease, the layer will ease into and out of the motion. If a layer is linearly animated, the layer will start and stop moving abruptly and it will also move at the same rate the entire time. Altering a layer’s position is an example of linear animation.


Click on the stopwatch next to “Position.”
Move the red line to the point at which you would like the layer to be off the screen.
Click on the layer’s anchor point.
Hold down “Shift” as you drag the layer completely off of the screen. The motion path will appear as a purple dotted line and each related keyframe will appear as a purple square. To preview your animation, scrub the red line over the timeline.

, Click on ""Window"" and ""Effects and Presets."" You will see a list of various animations and effects that are available for application to your project. Simply drag and drop the effect or animation selection onto the layer to which you'd like to apply it. You should see the change immediately.


Effects include 3D, color correction, and various camera views.
Transition options include wipe, fade and checkerboard.
You may remove selections by dragging them off your projects.

, Select ""Windows."" From here, click on ""Time Controls."" A preview pane will pop up where you can select ""Play"" to see a rough draft of your project. If you wish to see a more finished version, click on ""Ram Render Play."" If your project is especially long or requires a large amount of memory, adjust the resolution before you preview it. After clicking to play it, the video will run continually until you click on the screen to stop it.

, If you need to produce and deliver a high-quality composition, export your project to the Render Queue. The Render Queue is built into Adobe After Effects.


Click on “File” at the top of the window. Select “Export” followed by “Add to Render Queue.” Instead of “File,” you may click on “Composition” and select “Add to Render Queue.”
In your Render Queue, locate “Output Module” and click on the linked text to the left of this section. A dialogue box will appear on your screen. From this screen, you can change the video and audio output settings. Click “Ok” when finished.
In your Render Queue, locate “Output To” and click on the linked text next to the left of this section. Another dialogue box will appear on your screen. The screen you prompt you to select a location to save your rendered composition. Click “Ok” when done.
Click on “Render” to export the composition., The Adobe Media Encoder will produce a compressed version of your composition. The Media Encoder will also export files that are compatible with specific web platforms. While your project is rendering in the Media Encoder, you may continue to work in Adobe After Effects.


Click on “File” at the top of the window. Select “Export” followed by “Add to Adobe Media Encoder Queue.” You may also select “Composition” followed by “Add to Adobe Media Encoder Queue” or drag the file directly into the “Adobe Media Encoder Queue” tab.

If the saturation of the first image (Steve Jobs) is markedly different from the saturation of the second image (Bill Gates), the morphing will look like a cartoon and clearly edited, so it requires deft manual fixing to make it look like a real face.

, Only erase some parts, not the full face. For instance, it's recommended that you only adjust the eyes, nose, lips and hair features. This step is an important stage of morphing successfully.

Click ""Export"" to finish.",How to Save in Lightroom1," Since it's common to work with many photos at once in Lightroom, before you save your work, you need to specify what, exactly, you want to save. There are several ways to do this — see below:Click on a photo thumbnail in the grid view or film strip. You can use Ctrl + click (Command + click on Macs) to select multiple photos individually or Shift + click to select a continuous range of photos. See this site for more shortcuts (scroll down on the page after it loads.)
Select items in the Library module from the Catalog, Folders, or Collections panel. You can use the Library module's filter options to sort your choices.;
, This should open the Export dialog box, which gives you a wide variety of options for how (and where) to save your files. Since you want to save your files to your computer or a storage device, select ""Hard drive"" from the ""Export to"" menu at the top of the window.Realize that, while this ""Export"" option allows you to save your work, it doesn't affect your master files the way a traditional ""Save"" option would. In other words, rather than changing the ""starting"" files you used for your photos, Lightroom makes a new copy of the photos with the changes you made. This means you can't ruin your photos accidentally!

, Below the ""Export Location"" header, you should see a drop-down menu labeled ""Export to:"". Your options in this menu are: ""Specific folder,"" ""Choose folder later,"" and ""Same folder as original photo."" You can't export your work without picking one of these options.


The ""Specific folder"" option is generally what most people are looking for. This allows you to browse through your computer's directories and pick a specific place to save your files. If you have an external hard drive connected to your computer, you will be able to save in it with this option.
""Choose folder later"" will require you to make a decision about where to save the file when you finish. This is usually used when creating a preset (see section below.)
The ""Same folder as original photo"" does exactly what it sounds like — saves your work in the same file as the original photo is located.
If you check the ""Put in Subfolder"" box, your work will be saved to a new folder (with the name you provide) located in the directory you chose.

, Under this tab, you should see several options that can be used to give your work a name. Since Lightroom projects often are made up of many different photos, several of these naming conventions are designed to make sorting through long lists of photos easier. A few of these include:



Custom Name (x of y): You supply a single name for all of the files. Each individual file is labeled with its order in the list of photos you've selected (e.g., for a batch of photos labeled ""Family,"" the files would be named Family 1 of 10, Family 2 of 10, Family 3 of 10, etc.)

Custom Name - Sequence: You supply a single name for all of the files. Each individual file gets a numerical label. (e.g., Family 1, Family 2, Family 3, etc.)

Custom Name - Original File Number: Same as above, only based on each photo's order in its original directory.

Custom Name: You pick the name for each individual file (e.g., Birthday Party, Cake, Afterparty, etc.)
The rest of the options use similar naming conventions, only using the date the file was created or its original file name in place of the ""Custom Name"" value above.

, Not all image files were created equally. Use the options under this tab to determine the quality, color space, and, most importantly, the format of the files you want to save. Your options in the ""Image Format"" dropdown menu include:


JPEG: Good for most general usage.
PSD: Good for use in Adobe Photoshop.
TIFF: Preserves any layers that have been added to the file with Photoshop.
DNG: Universal file for Adobe products.

, While the tabs discussed above are generally the most useful ones for casual users, the Export dialog box has many other options for customizing the way you save your work. These include:



Video: Allows you to specify format and quality for any video files in your project.

Image Sizing: Gives resizing/resolution options.Output Sharpening: Gives options for improving image quality based on the medium the image will be viewed on (e.g., matte paper, glossy paper, screen, etc.)Metadata: Allows you to specify metadata ""tags"" for your project for organizational purposes (e.g., keywords, author's name, etc.)Watermarking: Gives options for watermarking your photos to prevent unauthorized usage.

Post-Processing: Allows you to apply touch-up and other effects to your files.

, When you have your export options exactly to your liking, click the ""Export"" button at the bottom of the dialog box. Your new files will be saved to the location you specified.

A good place to start is by designing a poster in Adobe Illustrator.,
After you’ve made a poster, you can try to make a brochure in Adobe Illustrator which requires a more skilled understanding of height, width, sizing, and layout.

,
If however your plan is to create graphics that could be transported to Photoshop, you can start by learning how to use first the most basic tool for drawing on the software and that is the Pen Tool.,
Once you’re skilled at the pen tool, you can try to draw something from start to finish.

,
The next step is to learn how to use the Shape and Pathfinder Tool.,
You can also test your ability to use the Pathfinder Tool through this tutorial about making shapes.,
After learning how to draw on Illustrator, learn how to use adobe illustrator swatches and colors.,
You can also apply a gradient by using the Mesh Tool.,
Test your ability to use the color tools by drawing a hamburger from start to finish in this tutorial: Draw a Hamburger in Adobe Illustrator

,
To wrap up everything you have learned you can go ahead and create your own personal logo and business card.,
If you want even more of a challenge, try to live-trace a picture.",How to Use Adobe Illustrator," Here you can learn how to create a starter document, do some basic text and color editing, and generate a product.;
,, Use the pen tool to start drawing a simple shape to creating a complex logo. So that you won’t be confused also on using the tool, make your fill white and your strokes black. Leave the effects, gradients and colors for a while and concentrate on drawing your graphic.

,, If you’re using the Pen Tool for drawing shapes and find that your shapes aren’t perfect enough, you can also use the Shape Tool. Use the Shape Tool to create ellipses, rectangles, rounded rectangles, triangles and stars.

, This tool helps when you’re creating complex shapes and objects.

, Begin by playing and changing the colors of the fills or strokes of your drawing by using your color swatches.

, The basic idea is to use your color swatches if you’re aiming for a flat or 2D artwork, gradients to make your graphics more three-dimensional and then the Mesh Tool if you want your graphics to be more realistic.

,, From following the tutorials on each of the step, you can essentially now start drawing a logo and prepare a simple layout. If however you’re still having trouble figuring out the software, you can follow the tutorial below on how to create a logo.

, This is a great introduction into some of the more advanced tools in Adobe Illustrator.

Apply a gradient to the sunflower’s water drops.,
For a water drop glisten effect, scale the drops to a size of 70 percent.,
For the final touches on the sunflower, change the stroke weight to something finer such as a weight of 1 to 0.5 pt.,
You now have an artwork where you were able to apply different techniques on how to use the gradient tool.

",How to Use Gradients in Adobe Illustrator," This drawing will be used to experiment with the gradient tool. In this tutorial, we're using a sunflower. But you can use anything you'd like.;
, Use the pen tool to trace the image.

, This will help make things more handy when you start selecting colors.


For the colors on the sunflower, we'll be using these combinations. Orange: C=1.03, M=50.89, Y=73.31, K=0; Yellow Orange: C=2.85, M= 31.93, Y=91.5, K=0.07; Yellow: C=3.78, M=9.6, Y=92.18, K=0; Brown: C=35.61, M=79.07, Y=95.78, K=51.25; Reddish Brown: C=24.12, M=72.27, Y=92.81, K=17.58; Green: C=48.54, M=17.21, Y=100, K=2.86; Yellow Green: C=30.45, M=3.7, Y=98.22, K=0.02 Blue: C=49.75, M=0.43, Y=6.81, K=0 Light Blue: C=24.75, M=0.75, Y=0.22, K=0
You can also choose other colors according to your taste or preference.

, Select the petals of the sunflower and then click on your gradient fill or color fill box. The petals will have a black and white gradient. To change them, drag your yellow, yellow-orange and orange color swatches onto your gradient’s color stop. Note: You can also switch back and forth from linear to radial for a more realistic look for your illustration.

, Select the center of the sunflower and click again on your gradient fill. Change the colors by dragging the reddish brown and brown swatches onto your gradient’s color stop. Keep the gradient type to radial.

, Select the first half of the leaf and then click on the gradient fill. Drag the colors green and yellow-green onto the gradient’s color stop. This time, however, change the type of gradient to linear.


To change direction of the gradient so that the lighter green will be shown, just drag your mouse downward.

, No need to change the direction of the gradient this time.

, Apply by selecting the water drops and clicking the gradient fill on your gradient box. Change the colors on the color stop to blue and light blue and then change the direction of the gradient by dragging your mouse upward.

, Scale the drops by selecting them, right clicking over it, transform and scale. After scaling them to a smaller size, click on the gradient fill and switch the type to radial. Then change the appearance of the drops to soft light and to opacity of 80 percent.

, Then change the color of the strokes of the petals, lead, water drops and the center of the sunflower. Lastly, apply a blur effect on the water drop’s glisten.

, Using the Zoom tool is the best way to get that level of precision.


If the image you’re working with is simpler, like a single shape or outline, use the Magic Wand tool instead.


,, Each click will drop one “anchor point.” As additional anchor points are dropped, a line will appear, connecting the new point to its predecessor.


You can also select this tool by clicking the fountain pen icon in the toolbar.

, The end goal is to surround the foreground object (from which you’ll be removing the background) with an outline built from these anchor points.

, Click along the entire outline of the foreground object until you’ve come back to where you started. Stay as close to the edge as possible—Illustrator will do its best to correct your clicks for accuracy.


You can press the Space key to move the image so that off-screen areas become visible. This will be helpful if you’re zoomed in far enough that you can’t see the entire image. The cursor will turn into a small hand—use it to drag the image in any direction, bringing other areas into view without breaking the continuity of the Pen tool outline.

, The object is now completely surrounded by a dotted outline.

, The part of the image you outlined is now considered an object of its own. Both the newly selected object and its background will now have selection outlines (usually a blue line) around them.

, This will select both objects at once.

, This will make the background turn white. Now, the foreground object you outlined with the pen tool really stands out.


Having a solid white background makes it easy to change the background color.

, If you want to save only the foreground image with no background at all, press Y to switch to the Magic Wand tool, then click on the white background. Now, press Del.

, Click “File,” then “Save as, ” and then choose “Illustrator EPS (*.EPS)” from the File Format drop-down. Type a name for your file, then click “Save.”

Determine whether the Magic Wand tool will work for your image.Because the Magic Wand tool uses color or stroke (line width) to “magically” outline a selection with a single click, this method works best for images where the background sharply contrasts an object.,
Double-click the Magic Wand tool in the left toolbar to launch the Magic Wand panel.The tool looks like a wand with sparks shooting from its top.,
Select “Fill Color” if the object you wish to isolate is a solid color.,
Select “Stroke Color” if the object you want to select is surrounded by a specific color line.,
Enter a number in pixels (0-255 for RGB color, 0-100 for CMYK) in the “tolerance” box if you choose either “Fill Color” or “Stroke Color” as your parameter.,
Select “Stroke Weight” to select lines of any color that are all the same weight.,
Enter a number between 0-1000 (pixels) in the “tolerance” box if you choose “Stroke Weight” as your parameter.,
Click the object on the image you want to keep.,
Press the ⇧ Shift key and click the background.,
Right-click (or Ctrl+click) the foreground image, then select “Make Clipping Mask”.This action will immediately delete the background, leaving only the foreground image and a white background.

,
Remove the background by making it transparent.,
Save your image as a .EPS for use in page layout or design software.The .EPS format supports transparent backgrounds and is widely used in almost all graphic applications and word processing programs.,
Save your image as a .GIF for the web.GIF files are known for their quick loading times and ability to support transparent backgrounds.",How to Remove Backgrounds in Adobe Illustrator2,"


For example, if the image is a solid black star on a checkerboard background, you can use the Magic Wand tool to get rid of the background.
If your image has many colors, such as a photograph, use the Pen tool instead.


, This panel is where you’ll define which areas of the image will be selected when you click the Magic Wand on your object.

, With this option selected, clicking an object with the Magic Wand tool will select everything in your image that matches the fill color of where you clicked.


For example, clicking the Magic Wand tool on a pink triangle on a purple background will select only the pink triangle. If there are multiple pink shapes on the purple background, all pink shapes will be selected.
Additionally, if there are more than one object in the image that matches this color, all of them will be selected when you click the color anywhere on the image.

, Stroke Color refers to the color of the line surrounding an object, whereas Fill Color is the area inside of the line. If you use Stroke Color as your parameter, you will click the line around the object to define the color, not the inside of the object.


For example, if you are stripping the background from a red circle that has a blue outline, use “Stroke Color” so the blue line will be included in your selection.
When you click the Magic Wand tool on a certain color line with this parameter chosen, all objects with that line color around them will be selected.

, The tolerance number affects how flexible (or tolerant) the tool should be when matching all of the colors to the area where you click the Magic Wand tool.


The default is 32px, which means clicking a single color will select everything that matches that color, plus extremely slight variations of that color (within 32 px).If the object has a gradient, you can increase the tolerance to additional colors to be selected.
For most objects, the default is fine.

, This will select all lines that are the same thickness as the one you select.

, A lower number indicates a more precise match. Meaning, if you click a 10px line with a tolerance of 0, the tool will only select lines that are exactly 10px.


The default is set to 5px, which is likely not specific enough for thinner lines. If you find that the default option is selecting more lines than you’d like it to, change the tolerance to 0.

, Click once on the object in the foreground to select it based on the criteria specified in the Magic Wand settings. Once you’ve clicked the object, a dotted outline will appear around the selection.


If the selected area isn’t what you were expecting, press ⌘ Cmd+⇧ Shift+A (Mac) or Ctrl+⇧ Shift+A (Windows) to deselect. Then, return to the Magic Wand panel to adjust the parameters and try again.

, This action will select both the foreground object and the background at the same time.

,, Press Y to select the Magic Wand tool (no need to launch the panel this time), click the white background once, then press Del.

, Click “File,” then “Save as,” then choose “Illustrator EPS (*.EPS)” from the File Format drop-down. Type a name for your file, then click “Save.”

, Unless you’re using a vivid photo, saving as a GIF is the best option.


Click “File,” then “Save for web”. Choose “GIF” as the preset, and place a check in the “transparency” box if your background is transparent. Click “Save,” enter a filename and location for your image, then click “Save” once more.
If your image contains more colors than the GIF’s maximum of 256 (for example, a photograph), choose “PNG-24” instead of GIF. This will save your file as a .PNG file, which is widely compatible with most internet applications. Place a check next to “Transparency” if you have a transparent background. Click “Save,” choose a save location, then click “Save” once more.

Save your document in Adobe Illustrator format, .ai, so that you can come back and change it.",How to Add an Image in Illustrator," Adobe Systems created their Photoshop program to edit photographs, so Illustrator is not directly built for photo editing. Crop, edit and change dimensions before adding your image to Illustrator.


Images should be high resolution, at least 300 Dots Per Inch (DPI). DPI is how printers measure image density.;
,,,


If you are adding an image to a document that is composed of many other elements, it would be easier to work on background, text and headline layers before inserting your image.
If you plan to use the image as a background, it may be easier to add the image as the first step.

, Decide what placement your image layer will have in your list of layers, click on the layer that will be directly below the image layer and click ""Add New Layer.""

, Select ""Place"" on the drop down menu.

, Choose the image in your project folder. Your image should appear on your document with a red outline and cross in the middle.

, The transform palette is often located in the upper right toolbar, but it may depend upon your version of Illustrator. You can find it by looking for the word ""Transform.""


The transform palette allows you to align, resize and rotate the image. If you already have objects in your document, you will most likely want to align them with the borders or edges of those objects. Note the alignment of these objects on the X and Y axis.
Illustrator does the resizing math for you on the Width (W) and Height (H) of your object. If you put a value in the H row, it will resize the W row in order to keep the right proportions. Press the ""Constrain Width and Height Proportions"" to activate this feature.

,, If you do not embed the image, it will link to the file on your computer. It is not necessary to embed the image if you are still working with it.


You can also make your image part of the illustrator document by rasterizing it. This simply means to convert it from vector graphic shapes to dots or pixels. Select ""Object"" from the horizontal toolbar, and then click ""Rasterize."" You can make changes in the dialogue box that pops up.

, You may need to experiment a little to identify the library that you like; however, there are some general guidelines that can help you choose more quickly.


Any library that says ""Vector Pack"" will likely have some graphics that include buttons and ribbons that follow the same theme. For example, the ""Grime Vector Pack"" has buttons that are styled like street art.
Any library that has a culture-specific theme like ""Fashion"" and ""Sushi"" will have a number of images that relate to that specific theme.

, The Illustrator symbol library palette will add the libraries as another tab as you open them, even if you close the library out.

, Add as many symbols as you believe will be useful to your document.

, Drag it to the place on your document where you would like to use it.


You can also click on the symbol and then click on the small button at the bottom of your Symbols Palette that says ""Place Symbol Instance."" Each time you use the symbol in your document it is called an ""Instance."" You can use the symbol as many times as you want, but if you edit the symbol, it will change it in all instances.
You can also click on the Symbol Palette Menu, which is a small arrow to the right of the symbols. It will bring up a pop-out menu. Select ""Place Symbol Instance.""

, It will stay there and you can use it an unlimited number of times.


This option is very helpful for illustrating a logo or layering an image very quickly. For instance, if you are drawing a sun, you can use a symbol to insert many identical rays.

You can alter the position of anchor points and corner handles. This allows you to change the shape of the stroke or the body using the Width tool. To do this, use Shift+W on both Windows and Mac. To change the profile of the stroke, open the “Stroke” panel again, and customize the profile using Cap (e.g., dash lines), Corner (round cap, 10X), Arrow Heads, and different profiles. The position of the gradient will vary according to the profile you set.

Set the resolution to 200 pixels/inch or more. The final size of your card will be 3.5 x 2 inches but it is customary to include a 1/8th inch 'bleed area' all around, hence the slightly larger image above. The bleed area makes sure that the colours ""bleed"" out over the edges when the cards are cut, instead of leaving white borders.;
, Turn on rulers (View > Rulers) and right click on the ruler to set the unit to inches. Click on the top ruler and drag down to create two horizontal guide lines, one at 0.125 in and one at 2.125 in. Create two more vertical lines at 0.125 in and 3.625 in. These lines mark the end of the actual business card. You can also create safety guidelines just inside the bleed area to make sure your text does not extend too close to the edges.

, Select the gradient tool and click on the preview on the top left to edit the colours. Use light or dark colours so that any text or images stand out clearly against the background. When using the gradient tool, draw a line across the entire image to create a gradual transition between colours. You could alternatively draw a shorter line within the image to create a more abrupt transition.

, You will need to add, at the very least, your name and designation, your company's name or logo, and your contact information. If you own or work for a small business, you might want to add a tagline below the company's name describing the type of business.

, Use a larger font size, between 18-20 points, for your name and the name of your company to make them stand out. Experiment with fancy fonts and different styles. The contact information is usually in a smaller font size of 10-12 points. This text must be in a plain, clear font without ambiguous characters (You don't want people wondering if that's a number 1 or lower-case letter l in your email address).

, If you have an image of your company's logo, open the image in Photoshop. Use the quick selection tool to select around the border of the logo (reduce the tool size if necessary), avoiding the background. Invert the selected area using Ctrl+Shift+I and use the eraser tool to delete the background around the logo. You can now use any selection tool to copy and paste just the logo onto your card template.

, Right click on the text layer and open the Blending Options window. Select the Bevel & Emboss option and set the size to 2-3 to give the text a bit of depth. For dark text against a light background, select the outer glow option. With the colour set to a light version of the background, set the spread and size to a small value to create a subtle glow instead of a broad halo. For light text against a dark background, use the Drop Shadow effect instead. Again, set the Spread and Size to a small value and adjust the distance so that the text is subtly outlined.

, You can use large abstract brushes with the colour set to match the centre of your background gradient to create a nice subtle contrast. Another way to make brushes blend in is to select Blending Options in the brushes layer, select gradient overlay and modify the gradient with colours similar to your background. You could also use more colourful brushes but lower the brush layer's opacity to make them less flashy. The brush effects must be catchy, but not make the text difficult to read.

, Open an image you own or have permission to use and select a portion using the quick selection tool. Copy and paste it into the card template. You can also create a composite using pieces of many images and brushes on a separate image. Arrange the pieces on separate layers and merge all the layers at the end before copying and pasting the composite onto your template. Paste your image on a new layer in your template and lower the opacity of the layer to 30-40%.

, Draw a rectangle along the safety guide lines (or slightly outside them) using the rectangle tool. Make sure the path style is selected in the top left corner. Select the brush tool and choose a simple brush style with a size between 5-10 pixels. Select the Paths panel in the layers palette and right click on the Work Path. Click on Stroke Path and select Brush. You can add Blending Options to the border as well.

, You will probably want to fine-tune your design to move text away from background graphics or remove effects that don't blend with the rest of the template. You may even need to change some font colours if your background has changed considerably.

, When you are completely satisfied with your template, save it once as a Photoshop .psd file (in case you still want to make changes to it) and again as a PDF (or any other format preferred by the printshop). Also make sure to tell the print shop the final size of your business card (3.5 x 2 inches in this case) and that your template includes a bleed area.

, For a quicker way, you can also open a new image by clicking Ctrl + N (Windows) or Cmd + N (Mac). A pop-up will appear with several options you can configure for your new Photoshop file.


Enter the name of your new Photoshop file into the Name field.
Set the image size to 300 pixels. This will improve the quality of the image when printed.
The default image is usually a white background, but if you want a transparent background, check the round circle beside the “Transparent” option. This will save the file as PNG automatically. A transparent background is great for many reasons: flexibility on the use of the 3D text and ability to overlap layers on top of one another, to name a few.
Once you’re done configuring the New Image settings, click “OK.”

, If you opted to use the default white background color, you can change it now. To do this, click the paint bucket (Paint) icon in the toolbar at the left. Change the color of the first box between two square boxes present at the bottom left side of the toolbar by clicking on it and selecting the preferred color. Now drag the paint bucket and click any area on the white image. The document will be filled with the color you have chosen.

, In case you want to place the 3D text on a specific image, you should load the image into Photoshop first. To do this, again go to “File” and click the “Open” option from drop-down menu. A file browser will open; navigate through your folders to the image file you want to use. When you find the image, click on it and click “OK” to open it in Photoshop.

, After creating a new image file or loading an image, go to toolbar at the left. Click the “T” icon, which is the Text tool. After clicking this tool, the toolbar at the top of the screen will change to display the different Text Options.

, Next thing you need to do is select the font to use for your 3D text. After selecting the Text tool, go to the top of the screen to the Text Options toolbar. Click the the arrow beside the rectangular box next to the “T” icon, and select a font from the list that drops down.


3D effects usually works best with big thick font.
You can also opt to have your texts in bold or italics by selecting the option next to the font styles box.

, Click the down arrow button beside the box with the numbers on it in the Text Options toolbar. You will have a set of options from “6” to “72” as font size in the drop-down menu. Click on a size you want to use.

, In the Text Options toolbar, you’ll find a box with the default color used for the text, usually black. Click this to open the color picker window. Click on the color you want to use for your text, and click “OK.” The color in the box at the top will change to your selected color.

, Click an area on the image where you want your text to appear. A blinking text icon will appear. Type in the text you want to create into 3D. The text will appear in 2D in the font style, size, and color you selected earlier.


If the text appears too large or too small, highlight it and go to the Text Options toolbar, then increase or decrease the font size accordingly.
After you’re satisfied with your 2D text, go to the Text Options bar and click on the check mark towards the right of the text color box. The text will be accepted, and you will come out of editing mode.

, Go to the bottom right side of the screen to find the layers palette. From the layers palette, click the “Layers” option. You can see the text layer placed above the “Background layer.” This text layer helps us to edit the text independently without effecting the background layer.


If the text layer is not above the Background layer, click, hold, and drag it above the Background layer.

, If you want to change the size, orientation, and distortion of the text, you should use the “Free Transform” command. To do this, click “Edit” at the top of the screen, and from the drop-down menu, select “Free Transform.” The keyboard shortcut to do this is Ctrl + T (Windows) and Cmd + T (Mac).


A transform box will appear around the text in the image. To distort the text image size, click the corner handles of the box and drag it diagonally to the size you want. Depending on how you dragged the box, this will elongate or flatten your text. If you don’t want the text to be distorted, hold down the Shift key before dragging.
To rotate the text, hold the left mouse button and click on the arrow type handle that appears at the top of the text.
After transforming, click “Enter” on the keyboard for Windows and “Return” for Mac to apply the transformation, and to come out of the Free Transform mode.

, One can’t simply create a 3D effect with a 2D text. Before proceeding, you need to change the perspective of text. Select the text layer from the layers palette then click “Edit” at the top. Select “Transform” from the options, and a drop-down menu will appear with various transformation options. You will see that “Distort” and “Perspective” is grayed out. This means that you can’t perform these actions on the text right now.


To enable this option, you should convert the text layer to a shape layer. Once it has been converted, you can change the perspective. Before you convert the layer, make sure that the text is edited to your preference since once you convert the layer, you will no longer be able to edit the text.
Go to the “Layer” menu at the top of the screen. Click “Type” from the drop-down menu. From the submenu options, select “Convert to Shape.” The text layer will now be displayed as a shape layer in the layers palette.

, Go to the “Edit” menu and select “Transform.” The “Transform” command now appears as “Transform Path.” This is because the text layer is now a shape layer. Click on it, and choose “Perspective” from the secondary menu.


A transformation box with corner handles will appear around the text. To give it a perspective look, drag the right bottom corner handle down and the right top corner handle up. The height of the text will change, giving it a perspective look. You can also do it vice versa, by dragging the left side corners or the top corners and the bottom corners.
When the perspective has been changed to your preference, click “Enter” or “Return” to set the changes.

, Select the shape layer in the layers palette, go to the toolbar at the left, and select the “Move” tool (arrow and junction icon). Hold the Alt key (Windows) or Option key (Mac), and press the right arrow key on keyboard. Press it as many times as you want. One press will give you a new copy of the shape layer in the palette, each layer moving one pixel to the bottom right. If you want it on the left side, press the left arrow instead. Keep pressing the arrow till you reach the required depth of the perspective.

, After creating multiple copies, go back to the layers palette. Select the original layer, which is present right above the Background layer; it doesn’t have the word “Copy” in its name. Click Ctrl + Shift + ] for Windows and Cmd + Shift + ] for Mac. This will take the original layer to the top of the layer stack.

, To merge all the copies into a single layer, keep the Shift (or Option) key pressed down and click on each layer. This will select all the layers; notice that they are all highlighted blue in the layers palette.


Go to “Layers” menu at the top, and click “Merge Layers.” You can also press Ctrl (or Cmd) + E. All the copies will be merged as a single layer, with Background layer at the bottom and original layer at the top.

, To give the text a real 3D effect, select the merged layer from the layers palette then go to “Layer Styles” at the bottom, shown as an “fx” icon. Choose “Gradient Overlay” from the options that are available. A layer style dialogue box will appear.


Click the color swatch beside “Gradient.” You will see a set of gradients to choose from. Select a gradient color, and make sure that the style below the gradient is “Linear” and the rotation angle is set to “90.”
Click “OK” to set the option on your 3D text. You can now save your 3D text image (Ctrl or Cmd + S) so you won’t lose your work.

Use the pen tool to do the image matting. Each balloon is selected, then cut; click on button on the lower right corner to create a new layer, and then paste those clipped layers to a new layer.
See the picture of original image after separating one layer. Separate other layers according to the process above. Eventually all the layers are separated to the corresponding layer.The clipped part is separated into a new layer, as shown in figure 1.6.

, Because in the 3d stereo image, each layer in stereoscopic display will be of left and right displacement. Therefore, in the background, the blank area will be displayed. It is not reasonable, so it needs to complement the blank area.　　　


The method to complement graph is to use the rubber stamp tool. Paste the other similar image to the blank area. In this way, the viewer would not see the unreasonable blank graph, even if the layer has displacement.

,,


The grating and a lens are not consistent with the actual data. Upon the determination, the actual raster resolution is 75.55lpi, so the grating will be changed into 75.55lpi, lens will be replaced in 8, focus and depth keep the same.;
, When the above settings are adjusted, a displacement will be automatically generated. You can adjust a little as per the effect.

, Preview the single layer after each end of hooking line for every layer.

You may skip this. more on custom shape tool settings below.

, To do this, click on your canvas in the spot that you intend for the top-left hand corner of this shape to be and drag to refine the size of this shape. As long as you keep that click held down, you can move the mouse about your canvas while seeing a live-preview of your shape in it's simplest definition: a single line that defines its would-be boundaries. Release the click and you've made an arrow. You can choose to hold down the shift key during this entire click-drag process to maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio (ratio of height to width) as you preview the shape's size. Most times you'll not want to distort (stretch) the shape which makes shift really helpful.

You can change your font face, size, and style with the tool bar that is along the top of the document. I used 72pt. “American Typewriter” in bold. You may want to use a thick font that is at least 60pt. in order to see the effect clearly.

, In the text layer, you can always find this under Select>Load Selection. In order to use the shortcut hold down the command key (mac) or ctrl key (pc) and click the layer thumbnail. The thumbnail is under the “Layers” toolbar (right side of screen), it is the small box located on the left side of the layer’s name (For text layers, it will be shown as a “T”). This should make a moving dotted outline around your text.

, To hide the layer click the little eye icon next to the layer thumbnail, this should make the black text disappear while leaving the moving dotted outline.

, You can do this by pressing the brackets (bigger) and click over the text outline to fill the text with the brush style. Its okay if your brush outline exceeds the text outline, it is just easier to be able to see the outline in order to know where the brush is going to place color. The first color I used was #f3698c and brush number 3.

Open Photoshop and create a new document 220px width and 100px height (note we are using 72px/inch).,
We are going to use the rounded rectangle tool.,
Next we want to apply the nice gradient overlay.,
Now we want to have a nice glow effect on the button as though it is lighted from the borders.,
Add a simple background so we can see our hard work.,
Add a nice border that actually flows with the button.,
Now time for the pattern effect on the button.,
To define your own custom shape, just go to Edit > Define Pattern and name it Stripes.

,
Time to apply our custom pattern to the button, go back to the tab with your button on it.,
Lets get the glow, to do this we use a simple radial gradient and then make it fit the shape of the button.,
After press enter to confirm the transformation.,
To give our text that nice stamped feel we will be using a clever trick with the shadow.,
To finish our masterpiece of button sexiness we just need a nice reflection.,
Click Ctrl and T to then transform and move the new button down so it looks upside down.,
Congratulations!",How to Make a Sexy Button in Photoshop,";
, It is a nice tool as it allows you to specify how rounded you want the edges. First select the tool from the tool bar and on the properties bar at the top change the radius to 6px. Next draw a rounded rectangle 205px by 60px towards the top of the document. Leave some space at the bottom for the reflection effect we will add later.

, You can choose your own colours but we used an inviting orange. To add a gradient overlay, first choose your foreground as #f4a007 and your background colour to #ffd11f. Right click on the new shape later and go to Blending Options then Gradient Overlay. Once there click on the gradient in the middle of the panel and select the top left one; this will be your current Foreground to Background colours. Click okay and you`ll see a nice feel your button appear already.

, Again back to Blending Options, by left clicking on the shape later and going to Inner Glow. Add the following effects:

, Add the colour #6daf03 as the background colour using the Paint Bucket Tool.

, Rather than just putting a solid colour around it, the stroke (border) will have its own gradient giving a much more realistic feel. First let's set our colours: foreground #bb7900 and background #d5ac0a then Right click > Blending Options > Stroke and then use the following settings:

, To do this we will make our own custom pattern and then apply that to the shape. First do File > New and use a size of 16p by 16px with a transparent background. Next choose from custom shapes the shape below: It is important to make the shape bigger than the actual canvas so you don`t see any joins later.

,, Now lets select the area we want to apply the new patter, we do this by first holding Ctrl (Cmd for Macs) and clicking on the shape layer ( you need to click directly on the little box showing the actual shape, not the colour and not the layer name). Create a new layer, select the Marquee tool and then right click and Fill. Turn the opacity down to about 30% and now you have a nice texture.

, Select white as your foreground, choose the gradient tool and then from the properties bar choose the white to transparent (look for the checkered boxes, that means transparent i.e no colour) and then choose radial gradient (that's the second from the left icon on the properties bar). Make a new layer and then draw your glow so that it is not too big as below. Click Ctrl and T to then re-size it and reduce the height a little.

, We’re ready to make it fit the shape and then change the blending mode it give a real shiny effect. Again, holding down Ctrl, click on the shape of the button, this will select it and you will see a dashed line appear. With the new gradient layer selected click on the Layer Mask at the bottom of the layers panel. Lastly, change the Blending mode to Overlay and you are done!

, Add your text (about 30px and you choose the font) and then add the following shadow settings under Blending Options: The 1px, normal white shadow with 1px distance gives the illusion of the text being stamped into the button, easy and quick to do.

, To do this, we simply copy our button and then transform and flip it. First we must make a copy of it. Select all the layers and then click Ctrl and E, this will merge them all into one later. Next press Ctrl and A to select all, Ctrl and C to copy and then, this is where it gets a little weird, do Edit > Undo until you have all your layers back. Now you can, with confidence click Ctrl and V to paste your button. You should have two lovely buttons one on top of the other.

, Next we need to give it a fade effect so we click on the new button layer and add another layer mask. Select your gradient tool and make sure that it is Black to White (this is important as you may have it still set from when we made our glow effect). Draw your your gradient so that it makes the upside down button fade out.

, You did it!

Create the shape of your gradient with the selection tools.,

Select the colors for your gradient using the two squares in the bottom right.,
Select the type of gradient you want.,
Click and hold to set the starting point of the gradient.,
Move your mouse in the direction you want the gradient, then release.,
Use gradients to create transitions anywhere.",How to Make a Gradient in Photoshop1," These are the tools with the dotted lines, like the square selection tool or the lasso, that let you set aside a small area of your image. If you don't select anything, your gradient will simply fill the entire layer you're working on.


You can make gradients any shape, as long as you can create the selection.
If you're just testing things out now, make a small square and work with that.
Gradients fill the area they are in. So, if you just create one without the selection tools first you'll fill the whole layer with gradient.;
, It looks like a small rectangle that fades from black to white. If you can't see it, click and hold on the paint bucket -- they are often stacked on top of one another. Once you click on it, you'll notice the ""gradient bar"" appears near the top of the screen. This is where you can edit the look of your gradient.

, These are the same squares you use to choose colors for the paintbrush or pencil, and are located at the bottom of your toolbar. Double click each square to change your colors.


The front square will be the color your gradient starts. For example, use red.
The back square is the color your gradient fades too. For example, use white.
The gradient in the top left corner will provide an example of how it will look.

, Up at the top bar, you'll see several little icons. These are for different gradient styles. Note that not all versions of Photoshop have all of these styles -- these are the most recent as of 2015. The best way to learn them? Just test them all!



Linear: The classic gradient, it resembles an evening sky. Just a gradual transition between two colors along a line.

Radial: One color starts in the middle, then blooms out in a sphere, gradually changing into the next color. Like looking into the sun. The first color is the ""sun"" and the second the ""sky.""

Angular: More specific, this sweeps the colors in a counter-clockwise arc around your starting points. Often leads to two solid colors with gradation around the edges.

Reflected: Makes a mirror image of a normal linear gradient. Basically, if you draw your ""line"" to the right, it will repeat the gradient to the left. You will get a reflected gradient. In this case, you would have three ""bars:"" white, red, then white again.

Diamond: Like the radial gradient, only you have a diamond or square in the middle, not a circle., Think of this as the place where you first color is strongest. This is where you have nothing but red. Remember, the gradient will fill the shape it is in. You don't have to put this right on the edge to make it fit.


You don't even have to click in your selection area or layer. If you want the fade to start ""off-screen,"" click off-screen. This can lead to more subtle fades.Don't release the mouse button until you're ready to set the gradient.

, You'll see a line follow you from your starting point, indicating the direction the colors will fade. Release the mouse to create your gradient.


Longer lines will create more gradual transitions.
Shorter lines will have abrupt changes between the two colors., Gradients are incredibly powerful tools in Photoshop. They are not just ways to create nifty fading colors, they can create any sort of transition or blending effect. You can use them with Transparency layers to slowly fade two layers together. Gradients can layer over text. You can use low-opacity gradients to artfully color images, even transition into black and white. Remember, anything you have selected can have a gradient applied to it."

, You can add more by clicking along the line. In the Gradient Editor, about halfway down, you'll see a bar with an example of the gradient in it. Underneath are two gray stoppers, which you can click on to change the colors.


Double click on the line to add another stopper. You can add as many as you want.
Click and drag a stopper down the screen to delete it. You can also click and press the Delete key.

, These little blocks change how solid the colors are, and can be lowered or raised however you want. They default to 100% opacity.


Like the color stoppers, you can add more for more complex gradients. Do this by right-clicking.

, This is where the two colors meet, each at 50% strength. You can slide this diamond between any two color stoppers to set the middle point.

, A ""rough"" gradient picks random colors for each spot that have similar values to your two end colors. The result looks a bit like a bookshelf, with slots of each color instead of one smooth, unbroken transition.You can adjust this further by clicking ""Noise"" from the Gradient Type pop-up menu.

, Gradient presets can be incredibly powerful. So don't do the work twice! If you make one you like, hit save. You can also go online and look up ""Gradient Preset Packs.""

Start by opening an image to which you’ll be performing a set of operations (such as applying masks, filters, type, etc.)., It’s a good idea to work with a copy of the image so you don’t overwrite an image with a mistake.


Click the “File” menu and choose “Save As.”
Place a check mark next to “As a Copy.”
Click “Save.”

, If you don’t see a panel in Photoshop that’s labeled “Actions,” press F9 (Windows) or ⌥ Option+F9 to launch it.You can increase the size of the Actions panel by dragging its lower right corner downward or to the right.

You can also click the menu at the top right corner of the Actions panel and choose “New Action…”

, Type a name for your new Action into the “Name” field. Use something that will jog your memory about what the Action does.


For example, if you are creating an Action to shrink an image to a specific size and then convert it to grayscale, you may call the Action “Shrink and Grayscale.”

, You can assign a key or combination of keys (e.g., F3, Alt+F2, etc.) to start the Action. This step is optional, as you can also run the Action from the Actions panel.Select a key from the Function Key drop-down menu.

If you do, the new file name will apply to every image on which you apply the Action. Instead, just navigate to a different folder and save it with the same filename.
Not all of the functions you record now can apply to all images. For example, if you use “Color Balance” in this Action, it won’t have any effect when running it on a grayscale image.

, Here’s an example for recording an Action to resize an image to 300 x 300 pixels at 72 dpi (dots-per-inch):Open the Image menu and select “Image Size.”
Remove the checkmark from the box labeled “Constrain proportions.”
Set each dropdown next to “Width” and “Height” to “Pixels” if they are not already set.
Type “300” into the “Width” box.
Type “300” into the “Height” box.
Type “72” into the “Resolution” box.
Make sure “Pixes/inch” is selected next to “Resolution.”
Click “OK.”

, When you’re done performing all of the commands you want in the action, click the Stop button (the dark gray square on the Actions panel).To add more steps, make sure the Action is highlighted in the Actions panel and click the red “Record” button (the circle) to record.
If you don’t feel you’ve recorded the action correctly, right-click the name of the Action and select “Record Again.”

, Click the arrow next to your new Action to expand all of the steps.If you want to change any of the parameters in the Action, double-click the step to launch its associated panel.

Alternatively, activate the Transform tool with Ctrl+T.",How to Use the Warp Tool in Photoshop1," Load an image that you would like to warp.;
, Click the layer that you want to warp in the Layers panel.


If the layer is locked, as it usually is on JPG and PNG images, click the Lock icon to unlock it. Alternatively, drag the layer onto the New Layer icon to create a duplicate, editable layer. The Warp tool does not work on the background.

, At this point, you can use one of the selection tools (such as the Lasso Tool or the Rectangular Marquee Tool in the Toolbox) to select the area you want to warp. Use these exactly as you normally would to select the portion of the layer you want.


To keep your work more manageable, consider making a new layer from your selection (Ctrl+J).

Note: If you select nothing, everything in the layer warps by default.

, This should put a grid-like mesh over the layer or selection.


At this point, you can start warping the image. Click here or scroll down to the section below to learn how to warp.

, At the right end of the options toolbar, you should see a button that looks like a curved grid over a curved arrow. Press this button to switch between the free transform and warp modes.

Clicking and dragging any part of this mesh will cause the image underneath to deform in the direction you drag it. This can take a little getting used to, so you may want to practice before you save your work.


You can click any of the control points (the dots highlighted on the edge of the grid), one of the intersections of the grid lines, or an area inside the grid — any will work.

, When you bend or curve your image with the warp tool, you will see short line segments with dots at the end appear in the grid. Clicking and dragging these ""handles"" allows you to fine-tune the curves in your warped image.

, You don't have to warp your image by free-hand — you can also warp it to one of several preset shapes. To do this, once your image is selected for warping, look for the Warp pop-up menu in the Options bar. Here, you can choose a warp style that fits your needs., In the Warp pop-up in the Options bar, there are several more options that can help you modify the warped image. These are:Change Warp Orientation: The button looks like a curved grid next to a down arrow and a right arrow. This turns the warped section between vertical and horizontal orientations.Change Reference Point: The button looks like a black square surrounded by a border of white squares.

Define Warp Numerically: Enter numbers in the Bend X and Y boxes to set precisely how much to warp the image.

Select an image to puppet warp.,
Lay down points on the image.,
Drag the points to manipulate the image.,
Use the Pin Depth feature to move parts of the image behind itself.,
Use the Puppet Warp options to edit the image.,
Confirm your changes as normal.",How to Use the Warp Tool in Photoshop3," In Photoshop, the Puppet Warp tool is a quick, freehand way of manipulating an image related to the Warp tool. To use it, follow these steps:


Create a layer with the image you want to warp.
Make sure the layer is selected in the Layers panel.
Select Edit > Puppet Warp from the menu bar.

, When the image is selected for puppet warping, clicking will add ""pins"" (signified by small dots). Dragging one pin after it's placed will warp that portion of the image. All of the other pins will ""lock"" the area around them in place, preventing it from being distorted.


Because of the way the pins work, it's usually a good idea to put a few pins in crucial locations on the image you want to warp. For instance, if you're using the Puppet Warp tool to move the position of someone's arm, you might put a pin on her hand, another on her elbow, and a third on her shoulder. This way, when you move any of the three, the rest of the arm won't deform by much.

, Once you've placed your array of pins, you can click and drag any pin individually to move it. This will warp the image accordingly, pushing or pulling the area around the pin as you move it. Puppet warping can take some time to master, but it's a quick, convenient way to make adjustments once you know how to use it.


With a point selected, you can use the arrow keys to make very minor adjustments.
Note that you can ⇧ Shift+click to select multiple points at once.

, If you want to warp the image so that part of it goes behind another part, first, select the pin(s) on the screen you want to adjust. Then, use the ""up"" and ""down"" buttons next to ""Pin Depth:"" in the Options bar to move the selected portion in front or behind the rest.

, The following selections in the Options bar can be used to modify the way that the Puppet Warp tool works:



Mode: Adjusts how drastic the changes you make are. ""Distort"" makes your image especially elastic while ""Rigid"" makes your changes more minor.Expansion: Allows you to expand or contract the outer edge of the mess formed by your pins.

Density: Allows you to change the spacing of mesh points. More points gives you greater precision, but can tax your computer. Fewer points make your changes quicker but less precise.

, When you're satisfied with your work, press ↵ Enter to apply your changes. Alternatively, click the check mark button in the Options bar.


As noted above, Esc or the cancel button in the Options bar will undo your work.

Select the Dodge Tool from your Tools and locate the tool's settings panel.






The settings panel is located at the top of the screen, beneath your main menu that includes File, Edit, etc.







,

In the navigation bar, adjust the brush size to match the size of your second largest tooth (114 for this image), set your Range to Midtones, and place your Exposure to about 40%.






Make sure your Airbrush Style is not selected, but Protect Tones is selected. Deselect Pressure for Size icon.







,

Using your Dodge Tool, start from one side of the teeth and click across to the other side.






Because your Exposure is set to 40%, you can click the same spot multiple times to increase its lightness. This will help you control which portions of the teeth need to be the least lightened (the corners of your mouth) and which need to be the most lightened (your front teeth).







,


Zoom out from your image using the Zoom Tool set on Zoom Out in the top horizontal navigation bar.
Evaluate your image to see if your teeth blend naturally with your image.
If the teeth are too white or not white enough, you can click Edit > Step Backwards until you have your original image. You can then adjust the Exposure of the Dodge Tool in the Dodge Tool Settings as shown earlier. The higher you set the Exposure, the lighter the effect will be.

Open the image that you want to change in the image editor of your choice and select the cloning tool (in Adobe Photoshop it is a rubber stamp icon).,
Zoom into the image to between 200 and 300%, focusing on the part where you want to clone your pixels to.,
Start cloning in easier areas, such as in sky or on very smooth or dark textures, first.,
Do not rush while working.",How to Use the Cloning Tool for Photoshopping," Carefully choose which part of the image you want to clone away.;
, This is done not only to give you a better view for fine details, but also to make sure you work on a smaller area of the photo at a time. From this area, select the pixels that you want to clone from. In Adobe Photoshop this is done by holding down the Alt or Option key while selecting the proper area. Choose an area that is near the part of the image that you want to cover to make sure that the colors and patterns match as closely as possible. For example, to clone over a person standing in front of a wall, take advantage of nearby wall textures.

, Select a nearby area and then click to clone that area over the part to be obscured. Use small strokes and take your time with detailed areas. Be sure to zoom back out from time to time to check on your progress as it is very difficult to spot mistakes while zoomed in. If you do make a mistake, use the Undo (Control-Z) command to undo the last stroke you made.

, Experiment with cloning specific details onto your image by picking sections that are farther away from the cloned area. For example, when cloning over specific details, pick a matching detail from another part of the image to prevent similar sections from appearing. Pay special attention to fine lines and ridges, duplicating them from similar areas whenever possible.

, To use the Puppet Warp, you’ll want to create a duplicate layer of the image. This helps prevent you from altering the original. Find “Background Layer” in the Layer palette. Click the Lock icon beside “Background Layer” twice to convert the layer into a normal one.


A dialog box will appear asking if you would like to make it into a layer. Click “OK”, then right-click on the layer and select “Duplicate Layer”. You now have the original normal layer and the duplicate layer of the image, as indicated in the layer palette.

, The workable area is the area that you want to change using the Puppet Warp tool. To select it, keep the duplicate layer selected in the layer palette. Click the Magic Wand (wand-like icon) tool in the left toolbar and select the background of the image, apart from the area you want to manipulate. After selecting it, press Shift+Ctrl+I (Windows) or Shift+Cmd+I (Mac). This will alter the image and select the area you want to manipulate.

, After selecting the workable area, press Ctrl (or Cmd) +J. This will create a new transparent layer with transparent background along the workable area only.

, Click the new transparent layer in the Layer palette.

, Click “Edit” and select “Puppet Warp.” This will create a wire mesh over the selected area, which will enable you to manipulate the image.

, Once the mesh appears on the image, the Puppet Warp options will be displayed: “Mode,” “Density,” “Expansion,” and “Show Mesh.” You can customize these options depending on your usage and preference.


The arrow beside “Mode” gives you three different options: “Rigid,” “Normal,” and “Distort.” Rigid is a less stretchy mesh, Distort is an extremely stretchy mesh, while Normal lies somewhere between both of them. If you choose a less stretchy mesh, you will be limited to a lower degree of transformation.
“Density” gives you three options: “Rigid,” “Normal,” and “Distort.” “Expansion” is used to expand or contract the mesh by increasing or decreasing the pixels. Just like “Mode,” both Density and Expansion have similar features enabling similar options.
By checking and unchecking the “Show Mesh” option, you can either show or hide the mesh on the image.

, After customizing the image, disable the visibility of the original and duplicate layer below the transparent layer. This is so you won’t be distracted from your work. To do this, check the eye icon in the check box beside the name of the layers. After that, select the transparent layer again.

, To do this, click the area you want to manipulate. This will anchor the movement of the area.


For instance, suppose you have selected the body of a woman raising a hand and you want to bend her arm a bit. Add pins at the points where you want to manipulate along the hand as well as along the elbow.
If you want to remove a pin, click it and press the Backspace key. This will delete the pin.
After adding the pins, press Esc to disable the wire mesh. Make sure all the pins are in place before pressing Esc since you can no longer add pins afterwards except by clicking Edit → Puppet Warp at the top menu again.

, To manipulate the image, you must drag the pins to their new positions. If you want to select multiple pins at a time, keep the Shift key pressed and select the pins by clicking on them. You can also manipulate the pins using arrow keys, rather than dragging. For the hand example, dragging the pins will change the position of the hand. To bring the hand down, you can move the pins at different joints of the hand.


To rotate a pin (e.g., the elbow joint), keep Alt pressed down and bring the mouse cursor near to the pin but not directly over it. Now, drag the cursor around in order to rotate it. The degree of rotation will be displayed on interface at the top side.

, Don’t forget to save your changes when you’re done. Just press Ctrl (Cmd)+S, enter a filename, select a destination folder to save in, and click “OK.”"

, Command+ click (Windows:Ctrl+click) here to open a sample picture in a new tab. You can use to follow along with this tutorial. Drag the photo to the desktop, then open up that image in Photoshop.


When you're done, your screen should look something like this:






, You can do this by clicking on the icon, or by typing the letter M. (For the remainder of this tutorial, the key shortcut will be shown after the tool name.) The Marquee tool is the most basic of all tools. It's something you're already familiar with: virtually every application and operating system selects things the same way: click and drag to select a region of the screen. Photoshop is no different.


Clicking and holding on the Marquee icon will give you a small popup menu where you can select the variations: Rectangular marquee (the default); Elliptical marquee, for selecting circles and ovals; and a single-pixel marquee for both horizontal and vertical.
For now, select the Rectangular marquee, place your cursor somewhere in the upper left of the image, then click and drag the mouse. You will see the selection expand, with the pixel values to the right of the selection. Drag towards the center, until the values are roughly W: 300 H: 200, then release the mouse button.
Click and hold in the middle of the selection, and move the cursor—notice how the selection moves with you. Drag the selection so that it surrounds the tan house on the hill, as shown:





From here, you can copy the selection, move it, apply filters to it—pretty much anything you can do in Photoshop starts with a selection.






, Closely related to the Marquee tool is the Lasso tool. Like the Marquee tool, the Lasso is used to make a selection. However, with the Lasso tool, you can make a freeform selections. Its variants include the Polygonal Lasso tool, and the Magnetic Lasso tool. Select the basic Lasso tool, and try it out.


Click and hold the mouse button, then draw a selection around the small white sailboat that's left of center in the window. When you get to the bottom, release the mouse button—the selection will auto-complete. Now press Command-D (Control-D on a PC). This will deactivate the selection. Note that this works for all selections.
Press Shift-L. This will change the cursor to the Polygonal Lasso Tool. (Shift plus the tool shortcut will cycle through the other related tools). Notice the black arrow on the top left of the Polygonal Lasso cursor: that's where the click point is.
Click once, anywhere on the image. Notice as you move your mouse, the starting point remains pinned, and a dashed line extends towards the cursor. Click again, and that next point becomes pinned. You can continue clicking until your selection is complete: as simple as a triangle, or as complex as you like. When you reach your last click point, double click instead of single click, and the polygon will automatically close.





Press the Escape key at any time to cancel the selection in progress.
Press Shift-L again. This selects the Magnetic Lasso. Like the lasso tools, the click point is the black pointer in the upper left of the cursor.
Try this: click and hold the mouse button with the cursor pointing at the water line of the bow (front) of the boat, and drag around the boat slowly. Notice as you drag, the selection actually snaps to the boat as you move!
At the top of the Photoshop window, you'll see some tool modifiers: Feather, Anti-alias, Width, Contrast, and Frequency. As you advance, try each of these and see what effect they have on your selections. Hover over any interface element to see tool tips for that particular tool or setting.






, This is the advanced version of the Magic Wand tool (which is still available as an alternate tool).


Try this: click and hold on the tan house in the middle of the picture. While holding the mouse, drag to the left or the right, ""scrubbing"" the house with the cursor. Notice how the selection grows as you do this. Make sure you select the roof, balcony, and all the rest of the house is selected. When done, you may notice that some of the shrubbery is selected, too:





There are two ways to eliminate the shrubbery with the Quick Selection tool. The first is to select the Subtract version of the tool.





The other way to subtract from the selection is to simply press and hold the Option (Alt) key, which temporarily switched the tool to the subtracting version (you can see the tool switch modifiers at the top of the screen as you do this.)
Either way, click and drag slightly on the offending shrubbery, and it will be deselected:





You can adjust the sensitivity of the selection by adjusting the size. The larger the size, the more will be selected. Try it out: click the standard Quick Selection tool, set the size to 100, then try selecting the house again.






, According to Adobe, this is the most used tool in Photoshop. It's one of the tools that absent anything else, can dramatically improve the composition of your photographs. When you select the Crop tool, you will notice small handles on the corners, and on the edges in the center of the image:


To crop an image, either drag the handles to surround the part of the image you wish to keep, or click and drag inside the image to draw the area to crop.However you do it, the result will be the area you're keeping will be normal, and the area to be cut will be dimmed. Make a selection similar to this, then press Enter:





Notice how that's changed the entire focus of the picture. Before you do anything else, click Undo (Command-Z, Mac, or Control-Z, PC) to restore the image to its original dimensions. If did make further changes, you can step back through your editing history using Command-Option-Z (Control-Alt-Z).
Perspective crop. Rather than just a plain rectangle crop, Perspective Crop lets you adjust the relative perspective of the image as you crop. While an interesting and powerful tool, well worth experimenting with, it's a more advanced feature that will be covered in more advanced tutorials.
The Slice tools, also part of the Crop menu, are designed to carve up an image for placement into web pages. Like the Perspective crop, this is an advanced feature to be addressed in more suitable tutorials.

, They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but sometimes a picture is not enough: you want words, too! Photoshop's text tool gives you a few options.


With the Text tool selected, click near the bottom left of the picture. You'll see a blinking text insertion cursor. Type ""Boats in the Bay."" Depending on your settings, it might be too large, or too small, or a hard to read color. The editor for the text attributes is at the top of the Photoshop window:






Font family. This menu, like all font menus, lets you select the desired font. You can select from the list, or type in the font name. It will autofill as you type. For the purposes of this tutorial, select Helvetica.

Font style. If there are related font styles for the font family (e.g., Bold, Italic, Light, Medium, etc.), they will be available in this popup menu. If the menu is grayed, that means there are no variations on the current font family. For our purposes, select ""Regular.""

Font size. This adjusts the size of the font. You have the option of entering in a specific font size, or choosing a size from a small list. For fast, flexible, and easy font size changes, click and hold on the T icon to the left of the field, and drag to the left or right: the size should change dramatically.

Antialiasing. This will determine the strength of the edge blending. ""None"" turns off antialiasing, and text is rendered like it was rendered in 1984: like blocky stair steps. Here's a comparison of the different antialiasing settings:






Justification. The icons say it all: this justifies all text in the selected layer to the left, center, or right.

Color. This color chip defaults to the foreground color when you first choose the Text tool. To change the color, select the text layer itself, or with the Text cursor, any part of the text in a field. Click on the chip, select a color, and any selected text, plus all future text will be that new color. Note: If you select a text field with multiple colors, the color chip will display a question mark (?). All other text attributes will show as blanks.

Warp. This bends, or ""warps"" the text on the horizontal or vertical axis. To use it, simply select the text layer, click on the Warp button, and work the Style and sliders to find the right look . For this, we'll use the Flag style, and set the bend to 100%.






Panels. The Panels button opens up two more palettes: Character and Paragraph. Use these to fine-tune the look of your text.

, To do this, click and drag from the top left corner of where you want your text box to appear, to the bottom right corner of the box. You'll see a rectangle on the screen, with handles on the corners and sides.


Type some a couple sentences into the box. Don't worry if the text is too big or too small. When you're done entering text, press the Enter key. If your text is too small, use the Font Size control (at the top) to make it larger. Conversely, if your text is too large, use the Font Size control to make the text smaller.
You can also adjust the size of the text field: hover over one of the handles for a couple seconds, and your cursor will change to a double arrow. Click and drag to resize the text box: the text will flow within the boundaries of the box.






, Save the file if you like, or discard changes. Either way, you can always get an untouched version here.

, This has been part of Photoshop since before version 1.0, and pretty much every paint application ever created!


The Brush menu is also home to the Pencil tool, the Color Replace tool, and the Mixer Brush.

The Pencil tool draws lines of varying thicknesses, and while you can use different brushes, the Pencil tool features no antialiasing: everything is very bitmapped.
The Color Replacement tool can be very useful for replacing one color (or range of colors) with another color.
The Mixer Brush. This mixes together different colors, much the same way that an artists mixes colors on a palette.


Pick a color for the brush. Click on the Foreground Color chip at the bottom of the tool list. A color picker dialog will appear. Pick any color that suits you. For this tutorial, we'll choose red. When you've got a color you like, click OK to close the window.





Pick a brush. The easiest way to pick a brush is with the brush picker at the top left of the Photoshop window. Pick any brush. Notice the Size and Hardness parameters. Size sets the diameter of the brush, and Hardness refers to the edges: a 100% brush has a crisp edge, while a 0% brush is feathered for a soft edge. Set the brush size to 30 and the Hardness to 50%. You can use the sliders or enter the number directly.





Scribble a bit with your chosen color. Get a feel for how the brush works. You can also adjust the Opacity and Flow, at the top. Opacity sets the transparency of the color. Flow adjusts how much color is placed on the canvas with each stroke.





To see the difference between Opacity and Flow, set the Opacity to 50%, then scribble over an area repeatedly, without stopping or clicking. If you're using red, you'll notice a nice pink blob. If you lift up your cursor, and then start scribbling again, notice that where the new scribble overlaps the old, it's darker. Where the scribble is new, is lighter. Opacity adds with every stroke—but not during a single stroke. Return the Opacity to 100%.
Set the Flow to 25%, the Opacity to 100%, and scribble again. Note now that as you go over your stroke, the color builds until it's completely red. The opacity is quickly build up to 100%. With a Flow rate of 100%, all the color is put on the canvas immediately.
When you're done experimenting, clear the canvas by pressing Command-Delete (Control-Delete). Your canvas will fill with the background color. Option-Delete (Alt-Delete) will fill with the foreground color.

, By default, it will select the Rectangle Tool. Click on the actual Shape menu, and select the Polygon Tool. This allows you to specify any number of sides, and automatically draw the desired shape.


Note the settings across the top. The Shape menu (shown open) lets you choose Shape, Path, or Pixels. Choosing Shape will give you a filled path (what you created with the Pen tool). The fill color is chosen using the Fill popup menu; the outline color (if any) is chosen using the Stroke popup menu; the stroke width is set with the stroke width menu; and the stroke options—dashed or solid lines and more—are set from the Stroke Options menu.





One other option to be aware of for the Polygon tool is the Sides field. This lets you specify the number of sides of the polygon—from 3 to 100. You can either enter the number directly, or click and hold on the word Sides, and drag left or right to increment or decrement the number.





To create a polygon, click and drag anywhere on the canvas. Your polygon will open out from the center of the click point. Before you release your mouse, it will look something like this:
br>






When you release the mouse button, the polygon will be filled with the fill color you've selected, and the border will have the stroke attributes you set.
Alternately, for quick-and-easy polygon creation, single-click anywhere on the canvas. A dialog will appear on your screen that lets you set the parameters all at once. Here's what it looks like, with the result shown beside it:






, Because this is the second tool in this menu, you will want to actually click on the tool palette icon, as shown, then select the Paint Bucket Tool, as shown:


You are probably familiar with this tool: it's in virtually every paint application on the planet. It will fill any give area with the color of your choice. While most applications require the filled area to be a solid color, Photoshop lets you adjust the tolerance so that any pixel that falls within the range of the original click location will get filled. For example, the right side of this image was filled with blue, using the Overlay mode, and a Tolerance of 165:





Press D to select the default Foreground and Background colors, then press Command (Control)-Delete to clear the canvas and fill with white.

, If the Paint Bucket Tool or 3D Material Drop Tool is selected, press Shift-G until the Gradient tool is selected. The Gradient Tool will let you fill an area with a smooth blending between 2 or more colors.


At the top of the window, click on the gradient palette, and choose the blue, red, and yellow gradient on the top right row by double-clicking on it.





Click and drag from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, and your canvas will look like this:





Like the Paint Bucket tool, you can apply a gradient to an image with different overlay styles. Experiment with those, to see how each one interacts with the gradient blend.
To edit a gradient, click on the gradient palette. The Gradient Editor will appear. Click on the colored tabs to choose a color for each point, and move the points to set the start and end points for each color. Click on the black tabs at top to assign opacity.





Close the Gradient Editor.

Select the Spot Healing Brush (J).,
Select the Dodge Tool (O).",How to Use Adobe Photoshop Tools3," Open up the sample file SamplePic.jpg."" If you've done the previous tutorials, and have saved your work in progress, you may have a couple text fields. Under the Layers tab on the right (or if not there, select Layers from the Windows menu), click on the eyeball icon for all layers but the actual image layer. After the text layers are deselected, click on the image layer so that it's active.

, The clone stamp lets you pick up part of the image, and copy it to another part of the image.



Select a brush. At the top of the window, to the right of the Clone Stamp icon, is the brush palette. Click on that, and select a brush as shown.





Using the Size slider, set the brush size to 50.

Set the clone source. Before you can clone the image, you need to select what you're actually copying. We're going to hide the white boat in the middle with water. Holding down the Option (Alt) key, and click on the image about where the water changes texture, as shown by the red target:





When you to this, the cursor will be the image of the source. Move the cursor next to the white boat, and match the break in the water texture as close as you can. It won't be perfect, but it's close enough. Your cursor and placement should look something like show here (enlarged):





Click and hold the mouse button, and paint over the boat as much as you can. You may start to see repetitive patterns, but we'll show you how to minimize those, next. Here's what your screen might look like after brushing out the boat:





Soften the edges of the cloned area. To do this, click on the brush palette at the top again, and this time set the Hardness to 0%. This will fade out the edges of the tool gradually. Select about the same clone source, then go over the outer edges of your cloned area. Click different parts of the water as you go, to minimize repeated patterns. When you're done, it should look something like this:





If you want a real challenge, try to clone out the mast. Use smaller brushes, and clone sources very near the mast itself.
Also in the Clone Stamp menu is the Pattern Stamp. Like the Clone Stamp, this paints over your image, but instead of using part of the image, it uses a pattern.





To create a pattern of your own, select part of the image using the rectangular Marquee Tool, then from the Edit menu, select Define Pattern... Name your new pattern, select the Pattern Stamp tool, then click on the Pattern palette (see above image). Paint over your picture, and the pattern will be ""stamped"" onto it:





Checking the ""Aligned"" checkbox will result in evenly-tiled patterns, like a checkerboard, even with multiple passes with the brush.
Unchecking the ""Aligned"" checkbox will restart the tile with every click of the mouse, which can result in a more natural looking pattern.
Checking ""Impressionist"" will give you random dots of color taken from the pattern. The dot size is determined by the brush size.



, The History Brush takes you back to previous versions of your image, but unlike simply saving a copy along the way, then reopening it, the History Brush lets you paint in prior versions.


Scroll to the top of the History tab. If it's not showing, select History from the Window menu. At the top of the History window, you'll see a thumbnail of the image. Click the checkbox next to that: that's going to be what we'll paint in.





Remember that white sailboat you Clone Stamped out of existence? We're going to bring it back! With your History Brush selected, use the Brush palette and set your brush size to 100, and the hardness to 100%.
Click and hold the mouse where the white sailboat used to be, and start painting. Your boat is painted back in!





Use the History Brush to paint the image back to the original.

, Similar to the Clone Stamp, the Spot Healing Brush will paint over your image with another part of the image. In this case, however, it works from the area around where you are painting. It can deliver amazingly natural results.


With the Spot Healing Brush selected, set your brush to a round brush, 50 pixels round, and 50% Hardness.
Locate the tan house on the hill, in the middle of the image. Starting on the right side of the house, make small strokes from the trees into the house. You will start to see the house disappear beneath the pine trees!





Continue painting away the house, until it's gone from view. You can work the edges to make the hillside look more natural. When you're done, it should look something like this:






, Dodging and burning have their roots in the days when photographers developed their films in a darkroom. Masking (dodging) parts of the photograph blocked the light getting to the photograph, effectively lightening the masked area; burning, or letting more light through, darkened the burned area. Photoshop's Dodge and Burn tools do the same thing, only far more reliably than a piece of cardboard with a hole punched in it!


With the Dodge Tool selected, set your brush size to 50 and Hardness to 50%. To the right of the brush palette, set Range to ""Highlights,"" and Exposure to 50%.
We'll add some light to the sailboat on the bottom right. Paint the boat starting around the words ""The Saint."" Notice how it's much brighter now. Also, notice that if you slip and paint over the wooden cabin, it doesn't change nearly as much: we've selectively lightening only the whiter tones. That little bit of sunlight to the rear of the cabin will also lighten up considerably.





Switch to the Burn Tool by pressing Shift-O. The brush palette and Exposure settings can stay the same, but change the Range to Shadows. Dodge the water around the boats. Notice how the water becomes much darker, but the bright boats are hardly affected at all. With judicious use of the Dodge and Burn tools, you can really make an image pop.





Switch to the Sponge Tool by pressing Shift-O. The Sponge Tool lets you selectively desaturate (remove color), or saturate (enrich color) an image. With the Sponge Tool selected, set the Mode at the top to ""Desaturate."" Desaturate the back of the boat until it's effectively black and white. Then switch the Mode menu to ""Saturate."" Paint the bow of the boat to saturate the colors. At first it just is a little richer, but will quickly become cartoony. Leave the middle of the boat untouched, for comparison.

Select the Pen Tool (P).,
Select the Direct Selection tool (A).",How to Use Adobe Photoshop Tools4," The pen tool is excellent for making very precise, editable selections. It's a more advanced tool that will take some practice to use well, but worth getting familiar with. Select it by clicking on the icon, or pressing P. Your cursor will look like the nib of a fountain pen.


Using the white boat left of center again, click on the bow where the hull meets the water, and drag along the water line to the middle of the boat. You will see two handles extend from the initial click point—the anchor point—in a straight line. When you reach the middle of the hull, release the mouse button.





Note that the handles remain. Now, click and hold on the stern (back) of the boat at the water line, and drag upward to about halfway up the backside of the boat. Do not release the mouse button yet.
You will see that the initial handles have disappeared, and a new set shows extending from the second anchor point. Notice also that there is an arced line extending from the initial anchor point, into the water, and up to the second anchor point.





If you move the handle under your cursor around the second anchor point, you will see that line bending like a rubber band. Don't worry if it's connected to the boat for the moment—we'll address that momentarily. Using the picture below, finish setting up the the anchor points around the hull of the boat, finally clicking on the initial anchor point to close the loop:





The line around the boat probably looks similar to the pic above, only loosely connected to the boat. Now we fix that, with the Direct Selection tool.

, Make sure the cursor is white, not black. If it is black, press Shift-A, or use the Selection Tool menu to select the Direct Selection tool.


Click on the first anchor point. The handles will appear as before. Click on the rightmost handle, and wiggle it: note the left and right handles move together around the anchor point. Now, press Command-Option (Control-Alt), click on the rightmost handle, and drag it upwards.





Note that only the right handle moves, and that the line between the top anchor point on the bow, and the point you are editing is now at least starting to be close to the hull. Drag the handle about halfway up the hull, and leave it there for now.
Click on the bottom anchor point on the stern of the boat. When you see the handles, click on the right handle, and pull it upwards slowly. You should see the line start to match up with the waterline. Adjust that handle and the left handle of the first anchor point until the line matches the waterline as closely as possible.
You may have to adjust the anchor points themselves—this can be accomplished by clicking on them and dragging, or clicking on them and using the arrow cursors to nudge them in any direction. When you're done, the bottom line should look like this:





Work your way around the boat, making the line as close to the boat as you can. It's not important to make a perfect selection at this point—only to get a feel of how the anchors and handles work. Stop when you get to this point:





There will be times when you don't want a soft, rounded corner, so we need to turn off the handles to make hard corners. The front edge of the cabin is one of those places. Locate the anchor point you placed there, then hold down Command-Option (Control-Alt), and click on that anchor point, and the one below it. Note that the handles disappear, and the line between the two points is straight, not rounded.





When you're done adjusting the handles, right click on the line, and choose Make a Selection from the menu. OK the dialog box that appears. The boat is now selected. If you wish to edit your selection, you can do so in the Paths window. Press Command-D (Control-D) to clear the current selection, click on the path (Work Path), make sure the Direct Selection tool is active, and edit away! When you're done, you can make a new selection.





Note: If you wish to save that path for later use, double click on the words Work Path, give it a name, and press Enter. The path will now be saved with your document.

Learn the tools palette.,
Understand the tools have several options.,
Understand the document window.,
Learn the Panels.",How to Use Photoshop CS31," Photoshop includes a large variety of tools for modifying images. Many of them can be found easily due to Photoshop's good design layout.;
, The menu bar is located at the top of the workspace and organizes commands by category. This bar is common among many programs, including Microsoft Word. Each category in the menu bar has an additional drop-down menu with multiple commands. For example, the ""File"" category will include any commands associated with the file, including Open, Save, etc.

, This is located on the left side of the workspace and contains tools for adding text, creating and editing artwork, images and other graphic elements. Hover your mouse over each tool for a brief description. They are divided into seven categories: ""Selection, Crop and Slice, Measuring, Retouching, Painting, Drawing and type, and Navigation."", The control panel (also called the options bar) displays the options (if available) for the tool you are currently working with. These options could include differences in the effect a tool will have when used.Many times when you select a tool, you'll have the option of different types of the tool you selected. This will display in a pop out format from the original tool you selected.

, This is the main portion of the screen where your current file is displayed. When you create a new file you'll be asked what dimension and background color you want to work with., These are ways to monitor changes you have made to your work and to make modifications. The Panels will display numerical data which can be modified to make changes to your information. Any sort of data about your image you can think of will be included here. Things like color, hue, saturation, etc. can be found in the Panels section of Photoshop.


Some Panels are included by default in the Panels sections, but more can be added by selecting ""Panels"" from the Window menu.

Understand that Photoshop works in layers.,
Open up an image.,
Select ""Image Size"" from the Image menu.,
Save the image.,
Save for web.",How to Use Photoshop CS32," You can add layers to your image to create modifications or you can modify the current layer. Layers can be anything from filters to new objects placed on the image.


Some finished projects will have hundreds of layers, each only accounting for a small portion of the total image.
If you are only making basic changes, you can probably just modify the image as a single layer.
Masks can be added to layers to determine the transparency of a layer. A completely black mask means the layer will not be at all transparent, while a white mask will make the layer almost entirely transparent.

, After opening the Photoshop program, decide what photo you want to mess with. You can open up an image on your computer or on an external drive by clicking on ""Open"" under the File drop-down menu in the upper left of the screen.


On a Mac, you can simply open a photo by dragging the photo to the Photoshop icon, and it should open.
Navigate to your photo in the appropriate folder, select it, and then click ""Open"". Photoshop can take a variety of document types, including .jpg, but the photo will be converted to a .psd once saved.
Once ""Open"" is clicked, the photo will appear in a new window. This will be your workspace for the project.When you are creating a new image, specify the image's size, resolution and background.

, Only do this if you are working with an existing image. The Image menu is located in the Menu bar.


Uncheck ""Resample Image."" Resampling changes the amount of data in an image and can negatively impact image quality.
Resize your image by adjusting either the width or height in either pixels or inches. To adjust the size of your image proportionally, select ""Constrain Proportions.""
Adjust image resolution, if you think it is necessary. A higher resolution will be needed if you intend to zoom in and make small changes to the photo. If the photo will be printed out and displayed on paper, a higher resolution is not as necessary.
300 dpi is the standard minimum of high resolution used for print.

, Use a new file name by selecting ""Save As"" from the File menu. Avoid modifying the original image's file.


Adobe Photoshop CS3 offers several file format options. For print, .tif format is best, while .jpg files are best for web use.

, A great tool if you are creating images for the internet, either on your personal website or Facebook. The ""save for web & devices"" option allows you to compress your image size down in file size. This function can also be used to create some interesting creations by modifying what colors are being used and how many colors are allowed.

Use the select tool.,
Move the image.,
Fill in the blank space.",How to Use Photoshop CS33," Before moving an object like a basketball, you first need to select it. Select it using the first four tools in your tool panel from the top down. The select tool looks like a simple mouse hand.


The rectangular icon includes tools for selecting large, not as precise areas of your image. Use this tool by clicking and dragging over the desired area. The tool will either select portions of the image as a square, a circle, a single row, or a single column.
The lasso icon is useful for selecting parts of your image with well-defined edges. Well defined edges mean a strong difference in lighting, color, or hue.
The brush icon is the quick selection tool. This is arguably the most useful tool in Photoshop. It allows you to make relatively accurate outlines of objects with well-defined edges. ""Paint"" inside an object in order to select it using this tool.

, Do this by using the move tool or copy the selection using Ctrl+c or ⌘ Command+c. You can move the image around using the tool with the cursor icon. If copied, you can move the image by pasting it in a different section of the image.


Once the image is moved, there will be a blank space in the image. Since you are moving the pixels from one area to another, there will no longer be any pixels in the original place of the image.

, A common way to fill in the space is to try to simulate what was behind the selected area in the original image. For example, if you selected a person standing in front of a wall, you could try to continue the wall design in the blank space.


One way to do this is by using the Clone Stamp Tool. This is the stamp icon in your tool bar. It will copy a section of an image and paste it wherever you click.

Modify color within your image.,
Paint the image.,
Modify color using layers.",How to Use Photoshop CS34," You can do this by adjusting Layers, Curves, Hue, Saturation, or a combination of these. These may be accessed in the ""Adjustments"" sub-menu from the Image menu.


Curves will adjust the lighting by modifying the contrast and saturation.
Hue is a color or shade of an image. Adjusting this value will change the entire color of the image.
Saturation can also be thought of as brightness. For example, the difference between a bright fire truck and a deep red can be thought of as saturation of the color red., Photoshop is also a powerful canvas for painting. The icons from the band-aid down to the teardrop are all tools used for painting.The brush allows for an incredible variety of paints and textures to be added to the image. You can even create your own textures to use with the paintbrush. Use the paintbrush by holding down the left mouse button and moving the cursor wherever you want to paint.
The brush icon with the teardrop next to it will mix colors together. This is useful if you want to blend two separate areas of the image together with each other., One way of isolating a modification is by creating an adjustment layer. This will be a layer that solely adjusts either one layer or all layers. There are a lot of easy-to-use adjustments which can be found in the Image drop-down sub-menu.

Understand shortcuts.,
Use the move shortcut.,
Modify an image.,
Select the lasso.,
Know the eye-drop shortcut.",How to Use Photoshop CS35," Shortcuts are a built in function that will allow your work flow to quicken and make certain things easier. Almost every action from the menu has a quick shortcut. Most shortcuts can be seen on the item you're trying to select off the menu., The move tool is an important function that you'll be using often. Quicken your process by pressing v to activate the move tool.

, Pressing Ctrl+t or ⌘ Command+t, will quickly select an image and allow you to easily adjust the size and location.


To keep the original dimensions of the image, hold ⇧ Shift as your adjusting the size. This will prevent you from breaking the image.

, To quickly select a portion, press l. This will convert your mouse-hand into the lasso, which will let you select an item quickly., The eye-dropper is an extremely useful tool. You can simply pull up your eye-dropper by pressing i. Use the eye-dropper to capture a color that you want to use in the future.

"
"
Start your file.,
Choose your dimensions.,
Choose your resolution.,
Choose your color mode.,
Choose your background.",How to Use Adobe Photoshop1," Once the program has started, you will need to open a new file in order to create an image. This can be done by clicking the main menu button and selecting “New”, or pressing “control/command N”.


Now you will be presented with a variety of options. This will allow you to customize your starting canvas. Don’t worry, however, as most of these options can be changed even after you have begun working on the file. Just be aware that changing certain options after beginning work will affect the image and need to be compensated for.;
, The first several options are for setting the dimensions of your canvas or work area. You can use a preset size (such as 8.5x11” if you want to make something to print on normal paper), a custom size (using the height and width controls), or choose the clipboard option (which will set the canvas size to the dimensions of whatever is currently in your computer’s clipboard, useful for pasting and editing existing images).

, You will want to set your resolution for the image, based on what you intend to do with it. The resolution determines how many pixels will be in one square inch of the image. The more pixels in an inch, the more detailed the image will be.


A higher number of pixels/inch will also result in a larger file. This will have various consequences. Larger files will require more processing power from your computer and may cause it to freeze or lag if your system isn’t powerful enough. Larger files will also take longer to download or upload and should only be put on the web as necessary.
Standard web resolution is about 72 pixel/inch. Standard print resolution is about 300 pixel/inch. You can set your resolution however you want, but be aware that using a resolution less than 300 for print will make your image look like there are too many pixels.. Using a resolution above 72 on the web will make your images take longer to download.

, Depending on what your image is for, you will need to change the color mode. This determines how the colors will be calculated and displayed. This is one setting which can be changed after the image has been created without too much consequence. RGB is the standard color mode. This is appropriate for images which will be viewed on a computer, as this is the method computers use to calculate and display images.
CMYK is another common color mode. This is the mode best used for images which will be printed, as this is the method used by printers in order to render colors. It will probably be best to create your image in RGB first and then convert it to CMYK before printing, since your computer will automatically display RGB colors.
Grayscale is the third most common option and is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. It is really only useful for creating images which will be printed in grayscale.
With any color mode, the higher the number of bits, the more colors will be able to be displayed. Increasing the bits will also increase the file size, so only use a higher number if absolutely necessary.

, This will mainly determine if your starting canvas is white or transparent. A white canvas will make it easier to see what you are doing but a transparent one will make most effects easier to achieve.


The best option would be to create all of your images on layers above the background, since this will make it so that you can switch back and forth between white and transparent fairly easily.
Start with a transparent background, which you then color white. Create every other image on separate layers above the background. Erasing the white as necessary will allow you to have the best of both worlds.

Use layers.,
Adjust layer modes.,
Adjust layer opacity/fill.,
Lock layers.When you are done with a layer, you may want to completely or partially lock it.,
Merge your layers.",How to Use Adobe Photoshop2," Using layers is probably the most important aspect of Photoshop. Layers allows you to separate your images and editing into pieces. The more layers you use, the greater your control will be. Edits on one layer will only affect that layer (though layer modes can affect how the layers interact). Also keep in mind that layers are stacked: upper layers will always appear above lower layers. Plan and adjust accordingly.


Sample layers would include (in no particular order): highlights, shadows, text, background, linework/inking, base colors, etc.
You can make a layer visible or invisible by click the box next to the layer where an eye appears.
Create new layers by clicking the “New Layer” button at the bottom of the layer window (should look like two overlapping squares), selecting “New->Layer” from the Layers menu, or by pressing Shift+Command/Control+N.

, Adjusting the layer mode will be important to creating your image. There are a wide variety of options for the layers and they each have a different effect on how the layer looks, as well as how it interacts with the layers below it. Normal is the default setting.


Experiment with the layer modes to learn about what they do. More detailed tutorials can also be found online.

, You can adjust the layer opacity (or how transparent everything on that layer is) with the “opacity” and “fill” drop-down menus on the Layer window. Largely these two options will achieve the same effect, so it may not matter which you choose.The only time you will want to choose “fill”, rather than “opacity”, is if you have applied effects to the image (such as stroke, shadows, emboss or glow). Using “fill” in this instance will preserve the effects but make the rest of your later more or completely transparent, depending on the fill level you have chosen.

, This will keep it from accidentally being altered. You can choose to lock it completely by selecting the layer and then pressing the lock button on the Layer window. You can lock transparent pixels, painted pixels, or position by pressing those buttons, if you would rather only partially lock the layer. They are located next to the lock button and their names should display when hovered over., When you are done or while you are working, you may wish to merge your layers. This will combine all of the selected separate images into one. Be aware that this cannot be undone. Right click layers and select merge up or down, depending on which layer you would like it to merge with. You can also click the merge visible option, which will merge all visible layers.

Understand selection tools.,
Understand brushes.,
Understand blur, sharpen, and smudge.,
Understand dodge, burn, and sponge.,
Understand the clone tool.,
Understand gradients.",How to Use Adobe Photoshop3," The selection tools work in a number of different ways to allow you to select parts or all of your image. Once your image is selected you can copy/paste or simply edit just the selection. You can see when something is selected largely by the “marching ants” which enclose it. To deselect and get rid of the marching ants, press control/command+D. Be aware that the image selection is dependent on the active layer, although you can also select “copy merged” from the Edit menu if you wish to copy all layers without actually merging the layers.Marquee: This will select a set shape, which you can change by clicking and holding or bringing up the menu for the button. It is used in much the same way that you select files on your computer, by clicking and dragging. Constrain a rectangle to a square or an oval to a circle by holding down the shift key while you are making your selection.
Lasso: The lasso tool is the same as the marquee, but allows “freehand” selection. The main lasso is the fastest but least accurate selection option. The polygon lasso is similar but requires you to click to create anchor points. The third option is the magnetic lasso, which helps you follow the edge of an object. All three lasso tools require you to close the object before it can be selected. Do this by clicking at the starting point (you will see a little circle appear next to your cursor). If you make a mistake, delete an anchor point by pressing the backspace button.
Magic Wand: This tool will select like-pixels, pixels which are similar in color. You can change how picky it is about the color by increasing or decreasing the tolerance. This will allow you to select only particular areas or entire objects.
Quick Selection: The quick selection is probably the most common and most useful selection tool for editing particular areas of an image. It is a combination of the magic wand and magnetic lasso tools. Click and drag to select the contiguous areas of an image you would like to alter.

, Brushes will be used to add pixels to an image. You can use this to simply make additions to a photograph, or you can use it to paint an entire image from scratch. Brushes are highly adjustable through the brush menu and come in a variety of preset shapes.


You can download more brush presets for free or at a cost from a variety of sources on the web.
Adjust the size, hardness, and opacity of your brush as necessary. A bigger brush will fill a larger area, a harder brush will give cleaner lines, and lowering the opacity will allow you to layer colors to gain more control.

, These tools will be all be under the same button, which looks like a water drop. Choose which you need by clicking and holding or pulling up their menu. These tools all affect the pixels which you touch with the tool and can be used to achieve a few different effects.


Blur: this tool will loosen and diffuse pixels, making everything you touch with the tool more blurry. How much more blurry will depend on the strength that you have chosen in the menu at the top.
Sharpen: This will do the opposite of blur, tightening and consolidating pixels. Use sparingly, as it can be a rather crude tool.
Smudge: This tool will take the color you have selected and smudges it onto the areas where you drag the cursor.

, These tools lighten and darken an image, respectively, where the sponge tool adds or decreases saturation. You can choose which one you want to use by clicking and holding on the icon which looks like a circle and a line. With these, you will brighten highlights and darken lowlights directly on the image.


Since this affects the actual pixels of the image, you will want to copy the image into a new layer and lock the original layer. Edit only the copy to avoid damaging the original image.
You can change which type of tones your dodge or burn tools are changing, as well as what your sponge tool does, using the options on the top menu. Try to select highlights for dodge and lowlights for burn, as these will protect your mid tones (unless you want to change your midtones, of course).
Don’t forget that you can also increase your brush size as well as the intensity of the tool, using the options at the top.

, This tool, the button for which looks like a stamp, is used to take a piece of an image and copy it somewhere else. This is used to cover blemishes on skin, delete stray strands of hair, etc. Simply select the tool, alt+click the area you want copied, and then click the area you want covered.


Pay attention, as the area being copied will move proportionally with the movements of the cursor as you cover the areas you are altering.

, This tool will let you fill in a gradient or fade. This can be on an existing layer or within it’s own layer. The way the gradient appears can be altered at the top, and the colors it draws it’s fade from are derived from the two colors selected in the colors menu (“eraser” and active color).


Use the tool by drawing a line (click a starting and ending point). How the gradient works will be determined by where you draw the line, as well as the length you give it. A shorter line will make the transition shorter, for example. Experiment to find how to get the gradient you need.

Click the color selection window.,
Use color codes.,
Understand Pantone colors.,
Use the eyedropper tool.",How to Use Adobe Photoshop4," In order to change your color selection, you will want to double-click on the color you wish to change at the bottom of the tool bar. This will bring up a window with several options, the clearest of which is to select the color you want from a mix of the box and the slider (both of which are largely self-explanatory).


If you see a warning exclamation appear next to the color slider, it means that the color you have selected cannot print properly, though it should display on a monitor just fine.
If you see a little box appear in the same area, this means the color you have selected will not display properly on the web. Select the “only web colors” box at the bottom if this is a concern for you.

, If you want to use a specific color, take note of it’s hex code. This will be located near the bottom of the window and will be indicated with a pound or hash sign. Type in this code manually to change the color.

, This is a system of specifically numbered colors which correspond to inks used to print images. This is used mainly for print media to most accurately produce colors. Choose Pantone colors in Photoshop by going to the Color Library and choosing the appropriate number. Resources for and information about Pantone can also be found readily online, as it is the industry standard.

, You can also choose colors from the image itself by using the eyedropper tool. This can often be imprecise, however, so zoom in to your image for more control over the pixel color you are selecting.

Clicking on the padlock will lock whatever layer (or layers, as you can Ctrl/Cmd-Click multiple at once) you have highlighted. It will also unlock it. Note, however, that this will never work on the background layer., The keyboard shortcut for locking layers is Ctrl/Cmd + /. This locks and unlocks all selected layers.



Mac: Cmd + /

PC: Ctrl + / , This shortcut opens everything up for editing, other than the background. Note, however, that the background layer, the one locked from the beginning, will not be affected. The shortcuts, depending on your system, are as follows:



Mac: Cmd + Opt + /

PC: Ctrl + Alt + / , You can actually lock certain parts of a layer for more precise editing. These buttons are all right next to the padlock button, and will display their names if you hover the mouse over them. Try out:



Lock Transparent Pixels: Icon is a checkerboard. This makes it so that you can't edit over anything transparent in the layer, meaning nothing underneath the layer will be accidentally affected.

Lock Image Pixels: Icon is a paintbrush. You cannot edit anything but the transparent parts of the layer.

Lock Pixel Position: Icon is a crossroads. Prevents you from moving the layer at all, though you can still paint, re-color, and add text."

Use the text tool.,
Choose your font.,
Convert to paths.",How to Use Adobe Photoshop5," The text tool will create text on a new layer. Begin selecting the text tool and then drawing your text box in much the same way the marquee tool is used. It will be easiest to create a new text box/text layer for each line of text you intend to use, as this will allow you better control over the alignment and space between lines.

, Choose your font, either from the Text menu or the options listed at the top of the window. Remember to choose a font which is appropriate for the image as well as the content of the text. You can change the size of the font using the text options at the top as well.

, You can convert the text to a path, if you wish to further distort the shape and size of the text. This will make each individual letter into a contained shape. Keep in mind that this can only be undone using the history menu.


To convert the text to a path, right-click the layer on which it appears and select “convert to shape”. You can from there choose the direct selection tool to make many different changes to the objects you have created.

Use filters.,
Use levels.,
Use curves.,
Use transform tools.",How to Use Adobe Photoshop6," Filters, selected from the filter menu and applied to either the visible layer or selection, can be used to achieve a wide variety of effects. When each filter is chosen, a menu with a number of options will be brought up. You can experiment or look online for more details for each filter. For example, you can use the “gaussian blur” to significantly diffuse the pixel on a layer. The “add noise”, “clouds”, and “texture” filters can give texture to your image. Other filters can be used to give dimension or distort images. You will simply have to experiment to find which is right for your project.

, Levels allows you control of an image’s brightness, color balance and contrast by specifically defining absolute white and absolute black for a given image. This is complex and will require experimentation and practice to execute perfectly. Many tutorials can be found online. Open the levels window by clicking command/control+L. , The curves menu allows you to adjust the tones within your image. Bring up this menu by clicking Image -> Adjustments -> Curves. You will see a line going diagonally across a box. The horizontal scale represents the input image and the vertical scale represents the output image. Click on the line to create anchor points and then drag those points to alter the tones in your image. This will give you more control over contrast than the contrast menu will. , You can use the transform tools to scale, rotate, skew, stretch, or warp an image. This can be done to a selected area, an entire layer, or a series of layers. Access these tools by clicking Edit -> Transform. This will give you a submenu with a variety of options. Choose which is best for you. Experiment or look up tutorials on the web.Remember to press shift if you wish to keep proportions constrained while using transform tools.

Save your file type.,
Save for the web.",How to Use Adobe Photoshop7," You will want to begin saving your work fairly early on in the creation process. This will keep you from losing data in the event of a crash. Save the file from the menu much as you would in any other program. This will bring up the usual save window, at which point you will need to choose the file type you wish to save it as.


If you are still working on a file, save it as a PSD or Photoshop Document, as this will keep all of the editing capabilities of the file intact. It will also preserve layers.
If you want to save the file to be uploaded to the web or added into another program, save a separate copy as an image file. The most common option will be a jpeg, though you will want to save as a gif if you wish to preserve transparencies.
There is also the option to save as a PDF. This is helpful if the image is largely text-based or is intended for printing on standard paper.

, If you intend your image to be used on the web, you may wish to save using this menu instead (found towards the bottom of the main menu). This will allow you to further compress the image or alter gif options.

The images faces don't need to be the same skin tone, or even of the same sex. Using Photoshop tools, you'll be able to convincingly merge the images.;
, You should be able to load them into layers, so that they'll appear open in two tabs.


Make sure to duplicate the image, so you may go back to the original image at any time if you made a mistake (or if you just want to redo everything).

, You'll want to remove the face, in order to place it on your background, or final, face.

, Click the lasso icon on the tools panel or select the L key. The lasso will allow you great flexibility to freehand select the face. You could also choose the pen tool, located on the tools panel. The pen tool is preferred because it allows you more control by setting anchor points.

, Make sure to include all the unique features of that particular face such as creases, moles, wrinkles, dimples or scars in your selection.


If using the pen tool, you can adjust your selection by clicking on the points while holding the Ctrl key to reposition. After setting anchor points, right click and select “Make Selection” from the drop down menu.

, Press Ctrl + C on your keyboard or click on Edit>Copy from the menu to copy the selection.

, Drag your desired face onto the face you'd like to replace.


You can also create a new layer by choosing Layer>New>Layer and Press CTRL + V or Edit Paste to paste the face onto the other head.

, Right click on the image and select convert to smart object. This will allow you to resize the image.

, While you are on the active layer, click Edit>Free Transform, or Press Ctrl + T and resize or rotate as necessary.


Change the opacity to 50 percent so you can see both images when resizing the faces.

, The best way to make sure both faces are in alignment, is to use the eyes and mouths as guides. Simply make sure the eyes completely overlap, then tilt your desired face till the mouths match up.


To tilt, click on the corner of the image and then gradually rotate till the images align.

, Your images are now aligned and you can return the opacity to 100 percent.

, Select the brush tool and use it to fade the edges of the face into the background image. You'll want to use the lowest percent of the brush, so that the edges aren't noticeable.


When using the brush tool to merge, black erases the top image and reveals the background, while white returns the background.

, Select Layer>New Adjustment Layer and choose Hue/Saturation. Be to put a check on Use Previous Layer to Create Clipping Mask.


Creating an adjustment layer is a safe way to make a variety of changes to the images, without losing any of your previous work.

, In this step you need to make the adjustments in Hue/Saturation by clicking Image>Adjustment>Hue/Saturation.


Enter values in the appropriate boxes or use the sliders to adjust.

, Use the same menu as you did when adjusting the color of the face.

, If you notice specific details that need attention, use the brush tool to make small changes. For example, if you notice the eyes are looking washed out, use the brush tool set to a soft setting and play with the brightness or color levels.

, Compare the images to see if your merged image looks realistic. If not, you may need to go back and re-align or blur the edges.

Learn the brush tip settings.,
Learn your way around the Preset Picker Contextual Menu.",How to Use Photoshop Brushes1," This is the most basic option for any Photoshop User; the Brush Tip settings allow us to modify the way to add colors on a Photoshop document using the Brush Tool.


Click on the Brush Preset Picker in the default Options Panel and see several built-in presets. On many of the presets you can easily adjust two very important values:
Master Diameter increases or decreases the size of the brush tip. The default shortcuts to increase or decrease are the Left Bracket key and the Right Bracket key respectively.

Hardness increases or decreases the brush tip’s border strength, 0% means a really soft border (color fades out) and 100% a precise border.
The shortcuts to increase or decrease hardness percentage are the Left Bracket key and the Right Bracket key respectively. You can even combine Foreground and Background colors. Most of the time the color that is applied by using the brush tip is the Foreground Color.

;
,


There are many useful tools at the Brush Preset Picker menu including Create a New Preset, Edit it, and Delete. Then there are some options to display the list of brushes in the Preset Picker panel. Besides, you can easily Manage the Brush list by loading, saving and replacing brushes in the list, or Append one of the existing Brush collections.

Choose a brush blending mode.,
Learn to use more Blending Modes


The Following Blending modes are just the same that can be applied to the Layers.They are fairly useful for adding color to objects (Darken, Multiply, Overlay) or add some lights (Lighten, Color Dodge).",How to Use Photoshop Brushes2," Each time we paint something using the Brush Tool we can chose a Blending Mode for the stroke. A Blending Mode is a way to mix the colors with the object(s) behind them using several mathematical formulas working over the RGB values of each pixel. Let’s try some of them -



Normal Mode, which paints the color as is without applying any transformation to the color pixels.

Dissolve Mode adds some noise at the edge of the brush stroke.

Behind Mode paints behind an existing stroke even if they are both on the same layer.

Clear Mode can delete a section of an existing stroke.

, You have a lot to experiment with here, no matter how many years you have been using Photoshop, you never stop learning about Blending Modes.

Select the Brush Tool on the Tools Panel to enable the Brush Preset options.
Click over the Brush Presets option on the left and then in the main area a list of all the active brushes.
Try them before moving forward in this guide, paint some random strokes using different presets and see what happens. Next we’ll create a Custom Brush, and apply several variations to it.

, One of the most powerful features of Photoshop is the ability to create custom brushes from scratch using any image as a source. This time we’ll make a brush using this image of a nice leaf.


Open your image in Photoshop, and double-click on the ""Background"" Layer in the layers palette to make it editable.

Go to the Channels panel (go to Window > Channel) and duplicate any of them (you can duplicate a channel by dragging the layer over the Create New Channel button at the bottom). Choose the Green for now, then hide the other channels for awhile.
With the ""Green copy"" channel selected hit Command + I to invert the colors,
Adjust the levels a little bit to make the leaf whiter.
Hit command (Ctrl) + A to select the entire image,
Hit command (Ctrl) + C to copy the ""Green copy"" channel to the clipboard and then delete it.
Remember to turn on the visibility of the RGB channel before moving forward.


Go back to the Layers Panel,

Select the only layer and go to Layer > Layer Mask > Reveal All.
Switch to the Channels panel again and select the Layer Mask channel added at the bottom.
Hit command (Ctrl) + V to paste the clipboard, and that’s it.
Go back to the Layers panel to see how it looks.


Add some adjustments to the leaf, go to Window > Adjustments to show the Adjustments panel.

First add a Black and White > High Contrast Red Filter, and then a Levels adjustment using the values shown in the image below.
Select the three layers, and merge them by pressing Command (Ctrl) + E.
Using the Transform Controls, resize and rotate the leaf as you wish, the only restriction is that the image cannot exceed the 2500 by 2500 pixels in size.
Hit command (Ctrl) + Click on the merged Layer miniature to select the leaf contour, and go to Edit > Define Brush Preset,
Type some name and voilá - a brand new brush tip ready to customize.


Once you’ve created the tip shape, you will see it in the Brushes Panel.

Create a Brush Preset.

Review all the possible variations of a brush preset, from the brush tip to color jitters and pressure controls.
Select a brush tip from the library or, as in this case, start working with a custom brush tip.

The Lock icon next to a brush attribute retains the setting even when you change your tip or preset.




Customize the brush tip.

The Diameter value is a pixel measured size of the Brush Tip, cannot be bigger than the tip image.
The Flip Axis checkboxes flip the tip on its respective axis, X or Y (Horizontally or Vertically) or even both.
The Angle value rotates the brush by the desired degrees.
Roundness defines the elliptical roundness of the brush tip where 100% is a perfect circle.
The Spacing is the percentage of space between images when you draw a stroke on the canvas, using a mouse or a pen tablet. The larger the percentage, the bigger space between color spots.
Edit the Hardness value of the tip. Anyway custom Brushes created from an image cannot modify its Hardness value, but it will work with the default round tip for instance.

This is also optional but you can do this to male and females if their teeth are showing in the photo.,
Now, click on the 'Doge' brush.,

, Zoom in (by pressing Ctrl + Alt and scroll on your mouse) to the persons eyes. Now select the normal brush tool and make it smaller.


Select the colour red. Now colour in the person's eyes. Only colour the bit that is already their eye colour. I.E - If their eyes are blue, colour the blue bit. Most new vampires have red eyes, so that would be a good option, although you can always make them golden sort of colour.







, Look at the box with the layers and click the drop down menu. Select 'Soft Light'. The eyes should look very realistic.

, Create yet another layer. Do exactly the same as what you just did, but with the lips. Select the colour red, and colour the whole of their lips. Now press 'soft light' again. If their mouths are closed, you should have coloured the whole lips and now they are very red and look extremely realistic. If their mouths are open, still colour the lips but NOT the teeth - obviously!

, Create yet another layer and zoom in on their teeth. Use the brush and colour the teeth in white. It doesn't matter if you make all the teeth look like one long tooth - because when you select 'Soft Light' it will make them separate again but very white!

, Go back to the background layer for this one. At the top, make sure 'highlights' is selected. And '15'.

, Keep clicking until the face has gone pale. Be careful not to overdo it! You may have to make the brush smaller and zoom in afterwards to get any places you missed or can't get at.,,"

, Opening most types of images in Photoshop will cause them to load into the background layer. The background layer can't be transformed or modified in any way, so you need to make a new layer before you begin. This is easy:Double-click the background layer in the Layers panel.
Name the new layer or leave it with the default name. Click OK and your background will be converted to a new layer.

, At this point, if you only want to transform part of the layer (as opposed to the whole thing), select the portion you want. You can use the Lasso, Marquee or the other selection tools just as you normally would.


If you don't make a subselection, the entire layer will be transformed by default in the next few steps.

, This opens the Transform tools for the selection. You're now ready to start manipulating your image.


In the section below, you'll learn how to use the different Transform options to get your image just how you want it.

, The Warp tool lets you bend, twist, and distort the image just how you wish. To use it, click the button in the Options bar that looks like a curved grid above a curved arrow. This will switch you into Warp mode and lay a reference grid on the layer or selection.


To warp your image, click any point in the grid and drag your cursor. The underlying image will curve and warp as it adjusts to your mouse.
There is a lot more you can do with the Warp tool. See our main article for more on this tool.

, To use this tool, in the menu bar, select Edit > Transform > Scale. A bounding box should appear around the layer or selection. Click and drag one of the ""handles"" on the bounding box to make the image larger or smaller., To use this tool, in the menu bar, select Edit > Transform > Rotate. A bounding box should appear around the selection. Move your cursor outside of this box and it should turn into a curved, double-pointed arrow. Click and drag to rotate the image.Note that you can also use the Rotate 180, Rotate 90 CW, and Rotate 90 CCW options in the Transform menu to turn the image the specified number of degrees. The Flip option will reverse the object vertically or horizontally.

, To use this tool, in the menu bar, select Edit > Transform > Skew. A bounding box should appear around the selection. Click and drag one of the side handles to adjust the selection. It will stretch and distort diagonally depending on how far you skew it., This tool is similar to the Skew tool, but it allows movement in any direction. To use it, in the menu bar, select Edit > Transform > Distort. Click and drag any of the handles in the bounding box that appears to distort the image., This tool allows you to simulate a 3-D perspective for your selection. To use it, in the menu bar, select Edit > Transform > Perspective. Click and drag any of the corner handles and move it horizontally or vertically. The corner across from it will move in the opposite direction automatically.

, Certain transformations occur relative to a reference point. By default, this is the center of the image or selection. However, you can click the button at the far left end of the Options bar that looks like a black square surrounded by white squares to change the reference point.


This will affect the way certain transformations work. For example, by default, the Rotate transformation turns the image around its central point. However, if you move the reference point, Rotate will turn the image around this point instead.

, For very precise transformations, consider using the manual transformation features in the Options bar (to the right of the reference point button). You can type in numerical values here to fine-tune your transformations. The options are:



X/Y: Your image's width and height in pixels. Changing these stretches or compresses the image.

W/H: Your image's width and height as percentages. These work similarly to the X/Y options. For example, changing W to 50 will make the image half (50%) as wide. The chain link icon between the two options keeps the image's dimensions proportional.

Angle icon: Rotates the image by the number of degrees you input.

H/V: Skews the image horizontally or vertically. You can use both positive and negative values here to skew in either direction.

, When you're satisfied, confirm your changes one of two ways:


Press ↵ Enter (⏎ Return for Macs).
Click the check mark button at the end of the Options bar.
Note that pressing Esc or clicking the cancel button next to the check mark will cancel all of your work.

, Once you get used to using the basic Transform tools, the Free Transform tools allow you to make the same sorts of changes with quick keyboard shortcuts and mouse commands. To turn on Free Transform, select Edit > Free Transform from the menu bar.

, The layer or selection should be bordered by a boundary box. Click and hold one of the ""handle"" dots on the edge.


In the next few steps, you'll learn how to use keyboard commands to make streamlined transformations.

, Moving the corner out will make the image bigger, while moving it in will make it smaller. It will automatically scale proportionately. In other words, it will keep its original height/width proportions no matter how big or small you make it.

, This works exactly like normal. The cursor will turn into a curved arrow once it's outside the boundary box, signifying that you can rotate by clicking and dragging.


Hold ⇧ Shift and drag to rotate in set 15 degree increments.

, The opposite corner will automatically distort in the same way relative to the reference point. As a reminder, this is the center of the image by default. However, you can change it with the appropriate button on the Options bar (see above).


Hold Ctrl and move the handle to distort freely (with no symmetry to the reference point).

, The cursor will become a white arrowhead with a small double arrow. Skewing to either side causes the image to bend diagonally.

, The corner across from the one you select will automatically move in the opposite direction to give a perspective effect.

, Unless you change the default settings, typing in one dimension for width will automatically adjust the height setting. This is what the small lock icon indicates.

, Once unchecked, you should be able to type in separate values for both the width and the height.

, Changing from ""pixel"" to ""percent"" will allow you to adjust the size in proportion to what it was before.


For example, if your file was originally 2200 pixels wide and 1400 pixels high, choosing 50 percent will reduce the file to 1100 pixels wide and 700 pixels high.

First, briefly acquaint yourself with the tool.,
Method: Double click foreground color at the bottom of the tools panel to open the color selection dialog and mix the color that you want to use for the replacement.",How to Replace Colors in Photoshop," Press and hold down your mouse button over the brushes icon in the tools palette until the drop-down appears and select the color replacement brush (moving your mouse over any of the eyedroppers will activate a small info field revealing that tool's name).


At the foot of the normal menu bar group you'll notice an automatic change when you click on any tool in the tool bar. This is the tool options bar. This bar automatically changes its functions with respect to the current tool in use. It allows you to adjust the way your current tool performs it's job.
With the Replacement brush tool selected, View the options bar from left to right. If you click on the first option you'll notice that you can choose the mode (color characteristic) whether Hue, Saturation, Color or Luminosity of the area you wish to change. Choose color for this ""how-to"".
The next option to choose from are the 3 eyedropper sub-tools. These have nothing to do with the Pipette ( the main eye dropper tool) found in the tool bar, they are, as stated, merely sub-tools of the Color Replacement tool. The sub-tool eyedropper to the left allows you to sample and replace as you go. The middle eyedropper samples the first color you click on and replaces that particular color only. The third uses the current background color as the replacement color.
The second to last option of the Color Replacement tool allows you to set the limits more accurately. For this how-to, ""find edges"" was chosen. For certain tasks ""contiguous"" or ""neighboring"" or even a combination of the eyedropper types may need to be used. The last option is Anti-aliasing, this option was activated (checked) for better results for this particular task.
In the options panel you can also increase the tolerance of your brush (in this case, greater varieties in color tone will be included or recorded in the area in which the color will be replaced) or you can decrease the tolerance (thereby a more specific color range will be recorded).;
, If you don't want to mix a color yourself you can click on the ""Color Library"" button while the color selection dialog is still open and choose a color from there.


Click on the letter ""i"" to activate the Pipette tool. Be sure to check the options palette to see how many pixels are being selected. Photoshop makes an average of these selected pixels so be careful not to have too many pixels in there because if you choose an area close to the edge of your subject unwanted pixels may be included outside of the target area, resulting in a less exact replacement area. A one pixel range was used for the profile pic of Dave's raves used here, but a 3 by 3 range gives good results as well. With the (still active) Pipette, click on the area whose color you would like to replace ( this clears the palette of any default color).
The color of the area you selected should appear below in the tools palette.
Click on the Color Replacement brush icon in the tools palette
Select the middle eyedropper sub-tool in the options palette. Before you brush anywhere, adjust the size of the brush if it's not the size you want it to be and then select the color you would like to use as a replacement color.
Once your color is selected begin painting (click down and hold while dragging your mouse) over your target area, if you paint beyond that area don't worry because Photoshop sees only the target area.
As previously mentioned, the profile picture for Dave's raves was used for this how-to. Since this pic was originally created in Adobe Illustrator CS4 as a vector illustration it has very sharp edges, even the shading. This makes finding the right tolerance levels pretty easy. The Color Replacement tool options panel settings used were; a 77 sized brush with 100% hardness and a 25% percent distance, angle=0, roundness=100. The sub-tool eyedropper settings; middle brush (with the target symbol at it's left bottom corner, Limits=find edges, Tolerance=21%, Anti-aliasing=checked).
Once all of your settings are made you can paint the target area.

Isolate the layer you're editing so that you don't remove anything essential.,

To duplicate, click on the layer in your panel and press Ctrl+J or ⌘ Cmd+J to make a second copy of your original. This way, if you make any mistakes, you can easily come back to your original., Some text, like that on a white background, just needs to be deleted. Some need a more complicated replacement. Photoshop has a lot of tools for seamlessly removing text, but you need to be sure you're using the right one. Look at the following scenarios before removing to figure out what works best for you:



Un-rendered text: If there is still a ""T"" in the layers panel where the text is, it means the text is still editable. Press ""T"" to turn on the text tool, then click on the text in the image to replace it. This is only if you added the text yourself earlier.

, Then use a brush to paint over the old text.



Complex background: You'll need to use complex tools to seamlessly replicate the background. The rest of the tutorial will be geared towards these complex jobs, and the tools needed to replace the text., You'll want precise, close control over the image, cutting it out closely so that you don't have to replace much of the background behind it. The closer you get, the better your final product will look.

, If your text is against a background, like the words on a soda can, use the selection tools to surround the text as closely as possible. Simply use your favorite selection tool to capture the text you want replaced. The little dancing line should hug tightly to your text.


Surround the text, then use ""Select"" → ""Refine Edge"" to get a perfect selection.
If you're struggling with selection tools, check out this Wikihow on removing items from images in Photoshop.

Alternatively, Ctrl/Cmd-click the a layer of pure text to select it. If your text is already it's own layer, hold either Ctrl or ⌘ Cmd and click the thumbnail (it usually looks like a ""T"") to select all the text immediately., To do so, click on ""Select"" → ""Expand."" You want a small border around the text -- this is the background that will be used to replace the text.

, This beautiful feature analyzes the image behind the text, then randomly replicates it in place of the words, letting you write in the new text later. To use it, make sure that:


You have your text surrounded by a selection -- the moving dotted edge.
You have 5-10 pixels of space around the text.
You have the layer selected with the appropriate background., The fill menu gives you different ways to fill in all the pixels you've just selected. They will seamlessly replace your text. The menu should have slots for ""Use"" and ""Blending."", Content Aware means that Photoshop will analyze the pixels already in the selection and use those to make a new background. It should be preselected, but grab it from the drop-down menu if need be., This fill is random, so if it doesn't quite fit you can go back to ""Edit"" → ""Fill"" and try it again for better results. If you're still struggling, try out:


Go to ""Refine Edge"" before the ""Fill"" and feather the edges of your selection. This will help it blend in better.
Edit the ""Blending Mode"" in the fill menu. Lower the opacity to 50% and try 2-3 fills on top of each other for a more random effect.
Use the Paintbrush and Gradient Tools, along with the eyedropper, to paint over any issues., If you know the font or want to choose your own, you can simply add it in now by pressing ""T"" to bring up the Type Tool. However, if you want the exact font, you'll need to do a little digging. You can download fonts for free online and add them to Photoshop (as .ttf files, most commonly). You can also look up specific fonts using the website WhatTheFont, which finds a font in the image you uploaded.

, While most fonts need to be tweaked, a simple replacement job might be done as soon as you type in your new font. Select the right font, color, and then write out the text. Place it roughly where it needs to go, then right click on the type in the layers pallet and select ""Rasterize Type...""


Rasterizing type makes it easier to adjust. However, you can no longer change the actual words once rasterized, so make sure everything is spelled right.

, To get to free transform, make sure your next text is selected in the layers menu. Then press Ctrl+T or ⌘ Cmd+T to transform the text. You can also select ""Edit"" → ""Free Transform."" This box allows you to resize the object, but that is not all:


Click on any point to change the size of the text from the point.
Hold ⇧ Shift to keep the total proportions the same while resizing.
Hold Ctrl or ⌘ Cmd while clicking a point to pivot or angle that point, allowing you to give the points perspective.
Hold Alt or ⌥ Opt to stretch, squeeze, or flip the text., Say, for example, that you want to replace text around a soda can. Getting the exact bend is going to be impossible without some finer control than ""Free Transform"" can offer. Instead, open up ""Filter"" → ""Liquify."" From here, use the brush to slowly curve the text exactly how you need it.


Make the brush as big as possible to adjust the entire block of text at the same time.
Lower the brush pressure for more subtle effects."

It should be the fourth tool down from the top of the toolbar. Quick Selection automatically finds edges you click near, adding them to your selection.


If you cannot find the tool, click and hold the Magic Wand tool -- it will appear in the small menu that pops up.;
, Click and drag through the image so that the things you want to save, the non-background, is selected. Keep clicking until everything you want to be saved is in its own selection.


If make a mistake, hold Alt or ⌥ Opt, then click on the area you don't want selected to remove it.

If the background is one color, or pretty small, selected the background, then hit ""Delete."" It's gone! Otherwise, this strategy of selecting the important parts of the image is much easier., This menu, found under ""Selection"" → ""Refine Edge,"" allows you to see what your image will look like without a background. From here, you have several options. First, select ""On White"" from the view box at the top of the Refine Edge menu. From there, use the following tools:



Radius: Allows you to shrink the edge. Coming in 1-2 pixels will eliminate bits of background, and is usually not noticeable.

Smooth: Takes out hard edges so you have a more rounded selection.

Feather: Blurs the edges, allowing you to eliminate rough edges or impossible to perfect selections, like hair.

Contrast: Makes harder edges and points harder. Opposite of ""Smooth.""

Shift Edge: Grows or shrinks the selection, all based on percentage of the original., Hit ""OK"" on Refine Edge, then right-click any of the selected areas. Select ""Layer Via Copy"" to separate the image from the background.Make sure you have a selection open when you right-click. If you don't, hit ""V"" to pull up the normal cursor, then right-click.

, You're free now to do whatever you want with the background layer. You can do this in pieces, slowly chipping away the background and creating new layers via copy, or simply delete the whole later. Either way, you're left with your image and no background.

Create a duplicate of your image, especially the important elements, before deleting anything.,
Use the Lasso Tool to get small, manually traced areas.,
Use ""Color Range"" to remove mostly single-color areas from the background.,
Use the Pen Tool to make exact, precise selections around things.,
Use layer masks to make the background invisible, but keep it in the image.",How to Remove the Background of an Image Using Photoshop CS62," Say, for example, that you have a picture of an elephant in the desert. Your goal is to remove the background so that you can add a new one behind the elephant, but the quick selection tools keep erasing part of the elephant as well. Luckily, you have several other tools and techniques for difficult areas.

, The Lasso Tool just follows you mouse, making a full selection after you trace it back to the beginning. While this is difficult to use for larger images, it is a great way to get precise selections. Zoom in, then use Ctrl/Cmd-Click to add small sections or use Alt/Opt-Click to remove small sections, that the bulk tools like Quick Selection missed., This tool easily selects large swaths of similar colors, like grass, sky, or a wall. However, if the image you want to keep is similar in color to the background it will not work. To use it:


Click on ""Select"" from the top menu
Choose ""Color Range""
Use the eye dropper to select what color you ""want"" chosen. You can find specific colors also by choosing them from the ""Select Color"" menu at the top., The pen tool is the easiest, most robust selection tool. As expected, however, it takes some time to learn. Simply click around the image to drop points, and the program will connect the dots. Click and hold the pen tool in the toolbox and select ""Free Form Pen"" for curved lines. When you've finished, right-click the line, and click Make Selection. This turns your line into a selection, which you can then copy out of the background.


If you mess up a point, simply Ctrl/Cmd-Click it to adjust it later on.
Alt/Opt-Click removes a point from the line.
Shift-Clicking draws a perfectly straight horizontal or vertical line from your last point., Layer masks are powerful tools that let you adjust the image, but still keep all the original image information. To use one:


Select the area you want to remove using the techniques above.
In the layer pallet, click ""Add a Mask."" It looks like a rectangle with a circle in it, and is near the bottom of the layer pallet.
Click on the black and white thumbnail that appears in the pallet. Now, use the Paintbrush or Pencil to fine tune the image by drawing over the layer mask. Any black marks you add ""erase"" the background. Draw over the mask in white to make the image ""reappear."""

Close Photoshop, or use CTRL-D to de-select the photo so you can continue doing other edits on it.",How to Remove the Background in Photoshop Elements 11," Removing a background is easiest when it is a very different color from the foreground (say, as in a graduation photo). It’s hardest when the colors are similar, for example, with a white horse standing in the snow. For best results, plan ahead: Shoot your foreground subject against a different and uniform color such as the sky or a painted wall. As an example, removing the sky in the top photo will be easy. Removing the background in the lower photo with smaller green trees will be hard.;
, Click ""Photo Editor,"" then ""Expert"" in the top menu bar.

,,, A sub-window appears at the bottom. In the bottom menu, click the pink Eraser and Scissor Icon.

, (You don’t have to be precise.)

, An area with similar colors is erased. Note the checkerboard, which means that all color is removed from that area. If too much is erased, then use ""Edit > Undo"" in the top menu, and try again in different spot. Trial and error is important to get the best results. Concentrate on easy areas first.


Hard areas are erased either by changing the parameters of the Background Eraser Tool, or by carefully painting out the background by hand. For best results, many photos require both.

, Your goal is to erase as much as possible, without erasing anything you want to keep in the photo.

, Identify areas where you still want more background removed.

, The basic Eraser would be useful, to refer back to the earlier example, erasing the snow in the background of a white horse.

, Carefully erase unwanted background. Drag the brush over small areas, using Undo whenever you have erased too much.

, Using the default file type PSD leaves you the most options for future editing. For a smaller file suitable for Web and email, choose JPEG, and then click OK to use the defaults.

, Later, when you cut-and-paste the photo on top of another, you will discover that the original background is gone, and your second photo is now the background.

While you could turn on the Eraser Tool (E) and start removing, this should be a last resort -- it is a difficult and time-consuming way to remove items in Photoshop.;
, This tool, resembling a brush with a dotted line near the bristles, should be the 4th tool down on your toolbar. If you can't find it, click and hold the Magic Wand button and it should appear. Click and drag the Quick Selection Tool over the item you want to be removed and it will select it for you. If you just want to delete the item without covering it up, hit Delete to remove it.


Use the keys to make the brush smaller or bigger. Smaller brushes will select more precise areas.
If you make a mistake, hold Alt (PC) or ⌥ Opt (Mac) and click on an area to remove it from your selection.

, You have a variety of options available to select items, depending on how precise you must be. If the background behind the object is simple, and the item is well defined (different colors, easy to see lines, etc.), then the Quick Selection Tool will work. But if you want to cut out something precise you can use the following tools:Shaped Selections: The second icon on the toolbar, these are basic geometric shapes that you can use to make selections. Hold shift while clicking to get perfect squares and circles instead of rectangles or ellipses.

Lasso Tools: These tools are mostly for manual selection. You click once and then drag the mouse, and the lasso follows you, making a selection when you join the ends together. Clicking again sets a point down, allowing you to make sharper angles. The Polygonal Lasso is for straight lines only, while the Magnetic Lasso tries to follow the shape of the image.

Pen Tool: The icon resembles an old-school fountain pen. Pen tools make adjustable ""paths,"" meaning you can adjust your selection as you make it. You place points down to form a ""skeleton"" outline of the object. You can then right-click and choose ""Make Selection"" to move on."", This will eliminate the item from your image, but create a new layer based on your selection. If you want to save the item you're removing, you can simply click and drag this layer into a new Photoshop Window to isolate it, or just turn it invisible in your original image to erase it for now.If you're not planning on covering over the spot, or are just trying to work quickly, use ""Select"" → ""Refine Edge"" to first get your selection as close to the item you're removing as possible.

, Layer masks will delete items while still leaving the picture information (the color, shade, shape, etc.) intact in your photoshop document. As long as you save the photo as a .psd file, you will be able to undo anything erased in layer masks. To use one:


Click the layer you want to erase things from.
In the bottom of the layers pallet, select the square icon with the circle in the center. If you hover over it should say ""Add Layer Mask,"" or something similar, depending on your version.
Click on the white box that appears.
Use the Brush Tool (B) and black ink to ""erase"" the items you don't want. Anytime you ""paint"" on the layer mask, it will erase the corresponding image on the layer.
Color the mask back in with white to undo your changes."
"
Select your item using the Quick Selection Tool.,
Expand your selection so that you have 5-10 pixels on either side of your item.,
Select ""Edit"" and then ""Fill"" from the top menu.,
Select ""Content-Aware"" from the drop-down menu.,
Re-do the Fill with new Blending and Opacity settings to fit your picture.",How to Remove an Item in Photoshop2," While you can use any tool you want, this is usually the easiest. Don't worry about getting a perfect selection -- just a roughly outline of everything you're removing should do.

, Do not delete the item immediately. Instead, use ""Select"" → ""Expand"" to grow the selection by a few pixels so that the background is visible all around the item.


If there are not enough pixels around the item to expand, or if the background is uneven, you can still use the patch tool to cover up holes., This will bring up the Fill menu, which will take your selection and randomly fill it in with pixels from somewhere else in the image., It will be the first menu in the Fill window. Make sure ""Color Adaption"" is also checked, then hit ""OK."" Your area should fill in with nearby pixels for a smooth transition., Every time you click ""Okay,"" Photoshop will randomly select new pixels. So keep trying if it doesn't work the first time. While the blending settings likely won't change too much, play with them slightly to get your exact picture exactly how you want it."

Use the rest of the Patch tools to perfectly retouch your image after removing items.",How to Remove an Item in Photoshop3," If the item you're removing has a different or uneven background, you can still replace it. Imagine an image where someone is standing by a fence. You want to remove him, but you also need the fence to be intact and straight ""behind"" him when you replace him -- not some random assortment of pixels. This is where the Patch Tool comes in., You can use any tool you want here. In general, the closer you can get the selection to the item the better, as you want to minimize the background surrounding your item.

, Don't un-click yet. For now, find an area in the photo that resembles the photo you're looking for.

, The patch tool will analyze the area you let go of the mouse, then copy it over where your removed item used to be. Try to find an area where all of the major lines match up to seamlessly.You can use other layers as well, as long as you select ""Sample All Layers"" from the top bar.
You can click and select on other open Photoshop windows as well to pull background from another image.

, These tools are seventh from the top of the toolbar. You can also press J to cycle through your ""Patch Kit."" As you hit J, watch the tool change in the upper left-hand corner. You have a variety of options, all of which are meant to help you seamlessly remove items from the image. While this method is concerned mostly with the Patch Tool, the rest are great for fine-tuning your image after removing the item:Spot Healing Brush Tool: Touches up the center of where you clicked with the pixels from the outside. For example, you could drag the brush along an power line in a shot and the brush will replace it with the blue sky surrounding it.

Healing Brush Tool: Replaces the area you're clicking with another area of the shot. To select the area you want to replace, Alt/Opt-click with the Healing Brush Tool on. Now, anywhere you click will be replaced by pixels from where you Alt-clicked.

Patch Tool: Fills in the area around your removed item with pixels from any area of the photo that you choose, or even other layers or photos.

Content Aware Move Tool: Allows you to copy and paste an item into an area with a similar background (like moving a pic of a bird from one side of the sky to the other), filling in both spots automatically.

, Select “Continuous” if erasing multiple colors in the background, or select “Once” if removing a background with one or two colors., This feature allows you to remove the background while preserving the sharpness of edges in your picture.

, A low tolerance level is ideal for erasing one to two colors, while a high tolerance level erases a larger amount of colors. For example, if erasing the blue background of a sky, set your tolerance level between 20 and 25 percent for the best results., For example, if removing a tree behind a vehicle, position the pointer near the edge of the vehicle. The pointer will turn into a circle with crosshairs at its center.

, Take care not to drag the crosshairs over the edges of the object against the background, since this erases part of your image.

, If you're using Photoshop CC, select ""Updates..."" instead. This will look for any updates available online for Photoshop and its plugins, including the Camera Raw plugin. The Camera Raw plugin adds support for various raw files, including the CR2 format.

, If the Camera Raw plugin has an update available, it will be listed in the Adobe Application Manager list. Select it and click the ""Update"" button.

, If the automatic update process fails, you can download the latest Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) update available for your version of Photoshop. You can see the version of Photoshop you're running in the program's title bar. Earlier versions do not support later ACR releases. Follow the links below and run the installer to install the plugin:Adobe CS4 - ACR 5.7 (https://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/thankyou.jsp?ftpID=4683&fileID=4375)
Adobe CS5 - ACR 6.7 (https://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/thankyou.jsp?ftpID=5603&fileID=5613)
Adobe CS6 - ACR 9.1.1 (https://helpx.adobe.com/camera-raw/kb/camera-raw-plug-in-installer.html)
Adobe CC 2014/15 - 9.7 (https://helpx.adobe.com/camera-raw/kb/camera-raw-plug-in-installer.html)

, After installing the latest version of ACR for Photoshop, try opening the CR2 file again. If the ACR update included support for your camera, the CR2 file will open in a Camera Raw window.


If you're using an older version of Photoshop with an older version of ACR, you may not be able to open photos taken with cameras released after that ACR version. For example, if you have a Canon EOS 5D Mark III, you'll need ACR 7.1 or later, which isn't available in CS4 or CS5. If this is the case, see the next section for conversion instructions., The conversion utility will only allow you to select folders, not individual files. Make sure CR2 files are properly sorted into folders so that you can easily convert them. You'll be able to convert files in subfolders as well.

, This utility will convert your CR2 files into a compatible DNG format. DNG is an open raw format that will still give you access to all of the raw colors. This converter is necessary if you are running a version of Photoshop that is too old to support your camera model.


You can download the latest version of ""DNG Converter"" from the Adobe Updates site (http://www.adobe.com/downloads/updates.html). Click the link for your operating system to download the correct installer.

, Double-click the downloaded EXE file (Windows) or DMG file (Mac). Follow the prompts to install the converter program.In Windows, this will involve clicking through some installation screens. For Mac users, you'll drag the DNG Converter program to your Applications folder.

, After installing, start Adobe DNG Converter from your Start menu (Windows) or the Applications folder (Mac).

, Click the ""Select Folder"" button to browse for the correct folder. If the folder contains other folders with more CR2 files, check the ""Include images contained within subfolders"" box.


When you run the converter again to convert newly-added files, you can check the ""Skip source image if destination image already exists"" box. This will prevent you from converting old files a second time.

, By default, the converted files will be put in the same location as the originals. You can choose a different folder if you'd prefer the converted files end up somewhere else.

, You can apply automatic formatting to the converted file names by filling out the text fields.


Click the first drop-down menu to select a format for the file name. You can then add additional text using the extra fields. For example, you could use the first field to label each file by four digit serial number, and the second to add the date.

, If you're using older versions of Photoshop, you may need to change the ACR compatibility to match your version.


In the ""Change Preferences"" menu, use the ""Compatibility"" drop-down menu to select the correct version. See Step 3 in the first section for a list on the version you need to convert to.

, This may take a long time if you are converting hundreds of images.

, Once the files have been converted, simply double-click one to open it in the Camera Raw plugin in Adobe Photoshop.

Elements is great for beginners because it costs less than $100 and it includes most of the features you will need to use.;
,,, This can be accomplished a few ways. The most basic is just ""auto-fixing"" it. If you are more experienced with Photoshop, there are alternative ways. What you are trying to do here is get rid of shine and redness.

, Grab the clone stamp tool, hit alt where the skin looks good near the pimple, and then draw over the pimple. Do this as much as you want to all the pimples.

, If they are over the eyelashes or eyebrows, it is too tricky to get rid of them, so just leave them there- no one will notice.

, Select your forehead, top of your nose, cheeks, and chin. Go to filter - blur - Gaussian blur. Blur your selection so that the skin looks perfectly smooth, but not too much that it doesn't look realistic. Play around with it a little! If you have freckles, do not select them.

,, Get your free selection tool, and feather it to 1-5px depending on your image. Select the whites of both eyes. Go to brighten/contrast, and brighten them.

, Take your burn tool and burn the outside of the colored part of your eye. Take the dodge tool and dodge the inner part, outlining the black (but not touching it). If you want to change the color, then select the colored part with your elliptical select (the circle one) and open a new layer. Fill it with the color you want. Experiment with the layer setting - soft light, overlay, anything you want.

, You do not want ever to make it black and white, as this will look terrible. It is a very amateur mistake. There are some great in depth tutorial on youtube for it though.

The easiest is to click and drag the images into Photoshop straight from your Desktop, Finder, or Windows Explorer window. However, you could also:


Click ""File"" → ""Open."" This will open two separate tabs above your image. Click and drag a tab to pull it out of the frame. Then click and drag the image to the tab you want both photos in.;
, This powerful feature lets you re-size, rotate, angle, and adjust an image's size. To use it, click on the layer you want and press either Ctrl+T (PC) or Cmd-T (Mac) to start transforming. You'll see a box with little handles that let you adjust things.


Hold Shift when re-sizing to keep the same dimensions.
Hold Ctrl/Cmd when re-sizing to only move the point you're clicking on, creating ""perspective.""
Hold Alt/Opt when re-sizing to keep all the angles of the image the same (the corners), but change the size.
Click just outside the edges of the image to rotate it., If you know you definitely don't want something, pull up your Eraser (E) and start hacking away. While working, here are some helpful hints:


Hit Ctrl-Alt-Z (PC) or Cmd-Opt-Z (Mac) to undo any accidental erasing. Hit Ctrl-Z or Cmd-Z to redo it if you go back too far.If you create a selection (the moving, dotted line) then you can only erase what is in the selection. This is a good way to protect areas you can't erase, by only selecting areas you need to erase from.
Erasing is permanent, meaning the pixel data is lost. There are steps below that let you make pixels invisible instead, saving them if you need them later.

, Layer masks are you best friend when merging. They allow you to erase parts of a layer without actually deleting the data, meaning you can easily undo it all if you mess up. To make one, highlight the layer you want, then click the small rectangle icon with a black circle in the center at the bottom of the layer's pallet. From here:


Turn on the brush tool. It will automatically be set to black and white.
Make sure your layer mask is selected. It is the second, all white square to the right of your layer.
Color in anything you want to be erased in black on the actual image. It will erase, not add black ink.
Anything colored in gray will partially erase, up until it is fully black or white.
Re-color the mask with white to make the image reappear.
Note that you can use gradients, weird brushes, stamps, and the pen tool as well! Any way you ""color"" the mask will show up., Instead, use the following tools to select your object, then right-click and choose ""New Layer Via Cut.""Shaped Selections: The icon looks like a dotted box, and is first up. If you click and hold the icon it exposes more shapes to use.

Lasso Tools: Click create a selection, finishing when you connect the two ends of you line or click again to finish it. There are also options for angular and ""magnetic"" (following colors) lassos.

Quick Selection Tool: Resembles a paintbrush with a small dotted line around the end of the brush. This is your most powerful tool. Click and drag it on an image and it will attempt to find and select the object automatically. Change the tolerance, shown above, for better results.

Magic Wand: Click and hold to find it behind the Quick Selection tool, or vice versa. The Wand selects all pixels in the same color range as the place you just clicked, which helps remove large swaths of background all at once.

Pen Tool: Icon looks like a regular fountain pen. This is the most powerful tool you've got, but also the most time consuming to use. The pen tool creates ""paths"" with anchor points that can b be adjusted on the fly, giving you more control than basic selections.

Change the opacity of your brushes and erasers for tighter control.,
Use ""Refine Edge"" to get perfect cuts and selections.,
Try the ""Auto-Align Layers"" if you're matching near-identical photos.,
Play with ""Blending Modes"" to match the lighting in your merged images.",How to Merge Photos Using Photoshop2," Partial transparencies also stack, meaning you can use this to ""shade in"" images realistically. If you need a partial edge or gentle transition, set the brush or eraser opacity to 10% or so. Now, every time you shade over that area, you erase 10% of pixels each time. So, if you erase it 10 times in one area, then move over and erase 8 times, then 6, etc, you would get a nice, gradual merge.

, Found through ""Selection"" → ""Refine Edge,"" this shows off what your image will look like without a background. This allows you to see your new photo perfectly, fine tuning it before merging it in. Any selection, on any layer, can be refined. When done, click ""Selection"" → ""Inverse"" and hit the Delete key to erase all the pixels you refined out.



Radius: Shrinks the edge all the way around. Each pixel you ""add"" cuts a pixel closer to your selection.

Smooth: Rounds the edges

Feather: Adds partial transparent ""blur"" to the edge of the selection.

Contrast: Makes harder edges and points. Opposite of ""Smooth.""

Shift Edge: Grows or shrinks the entire thing based on the percentage you supply., This feature will sync up the two images, like a group photo where one person closed their eyes. Pull in another copy where they have their eyes open, then select both layers by Ctrl/Cmd-clicking them. From there, select ""Edit"" → ""Auto-Align Layers.""


Select ""Reposition Only"" for the best results., Blending modes relate one layer to another. So, for example, if your bottom layer has strong lighting, you can tell your top layer to take some of these light pixels and use them to lighten up your top layer. Sound confusing? The best part is, it is simple and easy to experiment without permanent damages. To use them:


Click on the top layer of the ones you're merging.
Click on the drop-down menu, currently set to ""Normal"" above the layers.
Choose a new blending mode, noting how it changes your image. Try out

",How to Make Your Photos Look Better Using Photoshop1," When opened in Photoshop, it will appear as a layer named Background. The first thing to do before applying any finishing touches is to crop the photo, and remove anything that intrudes on the image. For this tutorial, we'll begin with this image:


You can download the full-sized version here.;
, Much of the time, our snapshots are taken without a lot of thought to composition. Either we're just capturing a moment, or are taking a lot of shots in hopes of finding ""the one."" Cropping can help you focus a picture on the subject and add a lot of strength to the image.

, The general idea is that a picture is divided into thirds, horizontally and vertically. Important elements of the image should be on or near the lines.


You can see the peaks of the mountains are roughly aligned to the vertical lines, while the sky and trees are defined by the horizontal lines. It is felt that this makes a more interesting image than having everything centered.
Press Enter to crop the image.

, Use this to clean up bits of the image that weren't cropped out, but are distracting. For our test image, we'll be trimming the trees at bottom left, bottom right, and upper right.

, This may make the image too dark, but it is only an intermediate step. Once the blend mode has been set, select Control-I (Command-I) to invert the image, or choose Adjustments from the Image menu, then select Invert.

, From the Filters menu, select Other... > High Pass... Make sure the Preview checkbox is enabled, then adjust the Radius slider to taste. Notice your image will change, with a nice, soft effect. The radius really depends on the resolution of your image. If it's very high resolution, you will use a larger radius than if it's a low-resolution image. Let your taste be your guide.


While we're using it with a landscape, this effect is also very nice with portraits.

, With the Background copy layer selected, click on the Levels icon in the Adjustments window.


Clicking the Auto button will automatically balance the levels between the brightest part of the image, and the darkest. You can use the sliders to fine-tune your image, or use one of the custom presets at the top of the Properties window.

, Click back to the Adjustments tab, and click the Curves icon (to the right, next to the Levels icon). This will let you fine-tune the contrast of the image.


Click about 1/4 of the way up the line and pull it down just a little bit. Click again about 3/4 of the way up the line and pull up just a little. This should form a kind of ""S"" shape, and your image should be much more dramatic.

, This will prevent the contrast from affecting the color information of the image.

, From the Layers window menu, select Merge Visible, or press Control-Alt-Shift-E (Shift-Option-Command-E on a Mac) to create a new layer that merges all the information into one layer.

, The Doge and Burn tools are ideal for bringing out highlights and shadows in an image. At the top of the Photoshop window, set the controls as follows: for the Dodge tool, set the Exposure to 5%, and the Range to Highlights.


Set your brush to a fairly small size (depending on the resolution of your image), and use the Dodge tool to boost the highlights. It's great for bring out details in an image, without over-brightening things
The Burn tool will darken things, and is well-used on shadows to give images greater depth.

Create a new layer.,
Add Image Effects to your Styles panel.,
Click the rain icon.,
Change the blend mode to Overlay.,
Adjust rain appearance.,
Change the rain angle with Free Transform.,
Add blurry foreground rain (optional).",How to Make Rain in Photoshop1," Click the New Layer icon at the bottom of the Layers panel, or use the File → New → Layer command in the top menu. Click Edit → Fill if a menu has not already popped up, and set the ""Use"" drop-down to ""50% gray."" Name this layer ""Rain"" and click OK.


This method works best for Photoshop versions CS6, CC, or CC14. It may or may not work on earlier versions, and the options may be in slightly different places, such as the Action panel instead of Style.;
, If the Styles panel is not already open, select Windows → Styles from the top menu to open it. Click the small arrow in the top right of the Styles panel, then select Image Effects from the drop-down menu. Click Append in the dialog box that opens. This will add a new collection of icons to your Styles panel.

, This is a grey, streaky icon that appeared when you added Image Effects. If you’re not sure which it is, hover the mouse over an icon and wait until the tooltip appears. The correct icon has the tooltip ""Rain.""

, In the Layers panel, with the Rain layer selected, change the Blend Mode dropdown menu from ""Normal"" to ""Overlay."" This will keep your rain high-contrast and distinct when placed over your original photo., After the last step, the words ""Pattern Overlay"" should have appeared beneath the Rain layer. Click these words and a menu will open. Reduce the opacity and change scale of the layer to achieve the desired effect, with the original photo becoming visible again. Press OK.

, By default, the rain falls at a 45º, but you can change this by rotating the layer. Use CtrlT (Mac: ⌘ CmdT) to activate Free Transform. Hover just outside one of the corners that appear, not on the corner handle itself, until the cursor becomes a bent arrow. Click and drag to rotate the layer to any angle. The rotated image won't cover the entire photo anymore, so correct this by holding down ⇧ ShiftAlt (Mac: ⇧ Shift⌥ Option and dragging a corner outward to resize the image. Press ↵ Enter (Mac: ⏎ Return when you are done to exit free transform mode.


If you can’t locate the corners, press Ctrl0 (Mac: ⌘ Cmd0).

, Your photo's rain effect should already be looking pretty good, but you can make the rain look more realistic and achieve a different aesthetic by adding a second layer of ""out of focus"" rain in the foreground. Duplicate the existing rain layer with the shortcut CtrlJ (Mac: {{keypress|cmd}J and use the Pattern Overlay menu described earlier to decrease the opacity and increase the scale, making blurrier, larger rain that looks like it's in the foreground of the photo.


This looks best if the two rain layers are at similar angles.

Create a new, black layer.,
Add a Noise filter.,
Change the scale of the rain.,
Set the blend mode to Screen.,
Convert the rain to a smart object.,
Add a motion blur.,
Add a levels adjustment layer.,
Adjust levels.,
Make final adjustments.",How to Make Rain in Photoshop2," Use the new layer icon in the Layers menu, or the File → New → Layer command. Using Edit → Fill, change the Use setting of this layer to Black and name it ""Rain,"" then click OK.


If you changed the default layer characteristics, make sure this layer is set to Mode ""Normal"" and Opacity 100%.
This method works best in Photoshop CS 6, CC, and CC14. In earlier versions, some menu options may be in different locations. Also, the motion blur effect in earlier versions produces wonky results in the edges of the photo. You can get around this by extending the canvas space around the image before you begin, then cropping it back after you're finished., In the top menu, use Filter → Add Noise to add a scatter of white dots to the rain layer. In the dialog menu that opens, set the amount to 25% (for moderate rain), change the distribution to ""Gaussian"" (for a less uniform, more natural appearance), and check the ""monochromatic"" box. Click OK.


See the Tips section below for an alternative to this step if you don't like the end result of this method.

, The white dots are probably quite small, so let's make them more visible. Open the scale menu with the top menu: Edit → Transform → Scale. Set the width (W) to about 400% and the height (W) to the same value. The white dots should now be more visible.


You can clink the link icon between the W and H values to automatically link the two together, so they change proportional to each other.

, The blend mode option is in the Layers panel, most likely set to ""Normal."" Change this to ""Screen"" and the original image should be visible underneath the white proto-rain.

, With the Rain layer selected, click the icon that looks like a little downward arrow and a series of horizontal lines, located in the top right of the Layers panel. Select Convert to Smart Object from the drop-down menu. This will let you edit the rain layer non-destructively, meaning your changes can easily be reversed or altered., Select Filter → Blur → Motion Blur. In the dialog menu that appears, set the angle of the rain to whatever you like. Set the ""distance"" value to 50 pixels – this is a good starting point, but if you dislike the result, you can undo it and try a different value. Click OK and wait a few seconds for photoshop to apply the blur effect.


The distance value determines how far the white dots get stretched to form rain streaks. Larger photos may look better with larger distance values.

, This will let you alter the brightness and contrast of the rain layer, which also has the effect or reducing or increasing the apparent amount of the rain. Begin by holding down Alt (Mac: ⌥ Option) and clicking the round New Adjustment Layer icon at the bottom of the Layers panel. A dialog box should appear when you click the icon. Check the box ""Use Previous Layer to Create Clipping Mask"" so these adjustments only apply to the rain layer, not to the original photo.


Alternatively, click Image → Adjustments → Levels, then right-click (One-button Mac: Ctrl-click) the layer and select Create Clipping Mask.

, If the Properties panel isn't open already, open it using Windows → Properties in the top menu.If there is no graph on the panel, select the adjustment view icon at the top of the panel (a spiky graph icon).Now adjust the sliders underneath the graph to alter the appearance of the rain. Move the black slider slowly to the right to make the rain darker, and move the white slider slowly to the left to add more contrast.


Try setting black to 75 and white to 115, or play around with it to find a setting you like.In Photoshop CS5 or earlier, look for the Adjustments panel instead.

, If you're happy with the rain's appearance, save your picture and congratulate yourself. Otherwise, the motion blur settings and level adjustment settings you've already tried out can be further tinkered with to your heart's content.


If you dislike how the rain is all slanted exactly the same direction, try using these commands: Filter → Distort → ripple (size large, amount 10%) and/or Filter → Blur → Gaussian Blur (radius 0.5 pixels)."

After downloading the images into your computer, you will probably want to rename them to more easily recognize them when bringing them into Photoshop. Develop a naming scheme for your workflow, and stick with it. For example, left camera eye image file names could contain the letter ""L"", and right eye image file names could similarly carry an ""R"".;
, As you're going along, you'll want to be able to see the images in 3D to see how they're coming along. You can buy or make 3D glasses.

, Create template files or Photoshop actions that you can use over and over whenever you want to create a new 3D image. This will make the process more efficient. Since pictures can vary so much, however, you'll have to be careful and each one will likely require individual editing.

, Open the left and right image pair.

, The right image should be in a separate layer (happens automatically).

, Double click the right image layer (by default, will be labeled ""Layer 1"").

, This option is generally below the Fill Opacity slider.

,, Select the background layer and then, using the Pointer tool, move the background image to align the focal point in both pictures. Wearing your glasses or using the ""Multiply"" layer style can help line up the focal points.

, Crop the image as necessary.

, Save your image and you can use it for whatever you want.

, Once the left and right eye pictures are open, convert them both to grayscale by clicking on the 'Image' menu bar and selecting 'mode' then 'grayscale'.

, Assign the left eye image red, green and blue channels by going back to the 'Image' menu bar and selecting 'mode' then 'RGB'(the image will still appear gray). Do not repeat this step for the right eye image.

, Now you are ready to merge the left and right images. To begin, make sure the left eye image is still selected 'Open the channels display menu' by clicking on the 'Window' menu bar and choosing 'channels'.

, Press the shift key to highlight both at the same time.


An alternative to this step is to use only the blue channel instead of the blue and green when pasting into the left eye image.
Important: only the blue and green channels should be shaded blue.
At this stage it doesn't matter which boxes to the left of the channels show eyeballs (eyeballs indicate which channels are displayed).

, Go back to the right eye image, select the whole thing (go to 'Select' menu bar, then press 'all' OR press Ctrl+A) and copy it (go to 'Edit' menu bar, then press 'copy' or press Ctrl+C). Switch back to the left eye image and paste (go to 'Edit' menu bar, then press 'paste' or press Ctrl+V).

, An eyeball should appear in all four channel boxes. At this point, you should see a blurred red and blue picture.

, You are almost done. But first the left and right eye images need to be better aligned. Start by highlighting only the red channel in the channels display menu (it should be shaded blue).

, The next step is crucial because it allows the red-tinted picture to be shifted over while the blue-tinted picture is still visible. Go to the RGB channel and click only on the square box to the left. An eyeball should appear in all four boxes, but only the red channel should be shaded.

, Pick a point in the center of the picture to match up; for example, if a person is your subject, eye pupils are a good target. Zoom in on the target by selecting the magnifying glass icon in the tool bar then click on the target until it appears fairly large.

, Select the 'move' tool located in the upper right corner of the tool bar. Using the up and down arrow keys, slide the red-tinted image over until your target matches up and no longer shows any rings of color.

, Objects toward the outside of your picture should still be haloed in red or blue. In other words, the overall goal in this step is to limit the colored tints as much as possible.

, Cut out excess red or blue at the far edges of your picture, crop it using the crop tool, also located in the tool bar (once you've outlined your picture with the tool, go to the 'Image' menu bar then press 'crop').

, Your creation is ready to be viewed! Just don your 3D glasses (the left eye should be tinted red) and watch the picture jump out at you from your monitor screen or a printed picture.

Open an image in Photoshop.,
Open the Layers panel.,
Invert the image.,
Arrange the inverted layer.,
Toggle the inverted layer on and off.,
Try working with the inverted and non-inverted image side-by-side.",How to Invert Colors in Photoshop1," Make sure that the photo lends itself to color inversion. The change will be most dramatic if the image is very dark or very light. Understand that the inversion will replace each color with its corresponding opposite: the brightness value of each pixel is converted to the inverse value on the 256-step color-values scale. Think about whether the photo will be more or less powerful, once inverted.If you aren't sure, it can't hurt to try!;
, Open the ""Window"" menu, then choose ""Layers"" to reveal the Layers panel if you can't already see it. Remember; you are not actually changing the colors of the original image file – you are creating a color-inverted layer on top of the base.


If you want to invert the colors in a specific section of the image, use the selection tools—Marquee, Lasso and Magic Wand—to mark out the part that you wish to invert. If you want to invert the colors across the entire image, then you don't need an active selection.If you're inverting a complex composition, you can add a new layer at the top of the layer stack. Then, press ⇧ Shift+Ctrl+E to create a merged version of your entire composite without changing the deeper layers.

, Click on the unlabeled ""Create New Fill or Adjustment Layer"" button at the bottom of the Layers panel; you can find the correct button by hovering over the options. Choose ""Invert"" from the drop-down menu that appears. Photoshop adds an ""Invert Adjustment"" layer to your layer stack immediately above either the topmost layer or the layer that was active when you added the adjustment.If you made a selection before adding the adjustment, Photoshop builds a layer mask for the Invert layer. The program inverts the colors in the area that you selected.

, Drag the Invert layer up or down the layer stack to a new position. Any given layer only acts upon the layers below it, so the inversion's position in the layer stack determines its impact on your file.

, Shift-click on the layer mask applied to your Invert adjustment layer to disable the mask and apply the adjustment to your entire file. Click on the layer mask icon to enable the adjustment again. Turn off the eyeball indicator at the left edge of the Invert layer listing to disable the adjustment itself.

, After inverting an image, select Create New Snapshot. Keep each image open in a separate tab. This way, you can work with both the original image and the inverted image.

It can, however, help you learn some of the basics of Photoshop and decide if you want to move on to the professional version.;
, Because Photoshop is one of Adobe Systems’ major programs, Adobe has a vested interest in making sure its customers can use Photoshop to do the things they bought it to do. Accordingly, Adobe offers a number of online tutorials for Photoshop at its websites https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/tutorials.html and http://www.photoshop.com/learn.

, Just as most of Photoshop’s plug-ins are produced by third-party vendors, there are a number of tutorial websites by other sources than Adobe Systems. Some of those tutorial sites are listed below. Many offer all their tutorials for free, some offer some tutorials free and charge for others, while still others charge for most of their content:Good Tutorials. A free site.
Kelby One. Kelby One charges for most of its tutorials, but you can preview the subject matter being taught in a given tutorial before you pay for it. Most of its classes deal with using Photoshop to enhance digital photographs.
Lifehacker. This how-to website includes a page described as a complete guide to Photoshop.PhLearn. This tutorial site focuses primarily on the photographic effects you can produce in Photoshop. It is the brainchild of Aaron Nace, a respected name among photographers.

You Suck at Photoshop. Although each video is focused more on entertainment than educational content, you can still learn quite a bit about Photoshop from watching a number of episodes – and laugh at your mistakes in the process.

, Many colleges and universities, particularly community colleges, offer online classes in a number of subjects, including Photoshop. There are also a number of online-based institutions that offer online Photoshop classes and tutorials. Some resemble classes; some resemble educational television classes.


Lynda.com offers around 300 Photoshop courses and more than 17,000 tutorials. It charges a monthly subscription fee for its classes. Like Kelby One, you can get an overview of a course’s content before you pay for it.
Creative Live offers popular instructors and displays both a catalog of previous classes and announcements of upcoming ones. They also devote one week a year to Photoshop classes. Unlike Lynda, Creative Live’s classes are free.
Photoshop User TV is backed by the same people who back the Kelby One tutorial site. You can search through the list of classes to find the one that addresses the aspect of Photoshop you wish to learn more about.

, If you like being able to ask questions to a human being and have the time to attending, Photoshop classes are available through your local community college or private training institution. You can also sign up through organizations like Ledet, who arrange for instructors to visit your city when they receive sufficient demand.

, If you don’t have reliable Internet access or ready access to classroom instruction, you can find instructional DVDs on Photoshop, particularly if you want to learn more about retouching digital photographs with it. The Digital Photoshop Retouching series on DVD includes instructions from experts such as Julia Kuzmenko and Krunoslav Stifter.

, While the above options are primarily devoted to demonstrative and hands-on learning, if you enjoy learning from a book, you can do so for Photoshop.


The ‘’Classroom in a Book’’ series features authors such as Katrin Eismann and Scott Valentine.
Carrie Beene’s ‘’Real Retouching: A Professional Step-By-Step Guide’’ gives specifics on photo retouching with Photoshop.

Width and height: Choose A4 for a typical sheet of paper, or 3000 pixels wide x 2000 pixels high for a landscape collage — or set any size you like.
Resolution: Enter 300, or 200 if using a slow computer. Switch to a smaller value if the collage is very slow to edit or open, or use a larger one if the pictures look pixelated.
Color Mode: RGB color
Background contents: Choose Transparent if you plan to add your own background image. Otherwise, choose White or Black.;
, Most collages look best on a wide, landscape style canvas. In the top menu, use Image → Rotate Canvas → 90 degrees to turn the document onto its side.

, If you’d like a background, choose any image file on your computer. Open the file using the File → Open command in the top menu. Drag the image onto your collage, or use the following commands:


Click the background image and press Ctrl+A to select it.
Press Ctrl+C to copy the image.
Click the collage window (called “untitled 1” unless you saved it).
Press Ctrl+⇧ Shift+N to open a new layer.
Find the Layers panel and click “Layer 1.” Type in a new name: “background.”
Press Ctrl+V to paste the image into the background layer.
Adjust the background image as desired. The slider above the name in the Layers panel makes it more or less transparent. Ctrl+T lets you resize or rotate the image.

, If you added a background, use this step to delete extra space around the image. Navigate to Image → Trim with the top menu. Check the boxes next to “transparent pixels,” “top,” “right,” “bottom,” and “left.” Click OK.

, If you'd like a frame, insert this by double clicking on the layer name ""background.” In the pop-up window, make the following changes:


Click on “stroke” and check the box next to it.
Change the position to “inside.”
Alter the size and color however you like.
Check “inner shadow” if you’d like a shadow inside the frame.
Click OK when finished.

, Go to File → Save and name your document “photoshop collage,” or a specific, memorable name. Save frequently as you work on the document, so your work won’t be lost by mistake.

, Now you can start inserting pictures. Use File → Open to open each picture you’d like to insert. Each one will open in a new window. Transfer them onto the collage in one of the following ways:


Drag the file directly into the collage document, without opening it, or open it and drag the image into the collage. Name the new Layer something descriptive. (To select more than one file at a time, hold down Ctrl.)

Or open the file with File → Place Embedded (or just Place in older versions.)

Or open the image and use copy paste functions to transfer it to the collage. See the information on adding a background above for more information.
If you only want part of the picture, select the rectangular marquee tool at the top of the Tools panel. Drag it over part of the image, then copy and paste it as described above.

, If you want to cut out shapes more complicated than a rectangle, use the Lasso tool in the Tools window. Draw carefully around the area you want to remove, then press Delete to get rid of it. For a quicker, less precise job, select the Quick Selection tool by pressing W.


Use Ctrl+Alt+Z to undo a mistake.
Press the magnifying glass to zoom in before selecting small or detailed areas.

, Select an image in your “photoshop collage” document by clicking its name in the Layers panel. Press Ctrl+T to enter Transform mode. You can now edit the image as follows:


To resize the image, drag any corner. Hold down Shift while doing this to make sure the image doesn't distort.
To rotate the image, move your cursor farther out from a corner until you see two arrows. Click and hold, then drag the image.
To move the image, click and hold anywhere inside the image and drag.
When you're done, press Enter or click the check mark near the top right corner.

, The layer at the top of the Layers panel will be on top of all other images. Click and drag layer names up and down the list to change which picture is on top of another.


Make sure your “background” layer is always at the bottom. Anything below it will not be visible.

, Save your changes using File → Save, then print using File → Print. Or if you think the collage needs some words or styling, read the section below and print once you're done.


Use File → Save As instead to change file formats. Choose PDF if you want your collage professionally printed or framed. Choose JPEG to make an image that other photo viewing software can open.

, Double click on a line in the Layers panel to open a Layer Styles window for that layer. Try adding a frame with “stroke” or a shadow with “drop shadow,” or playing around with other options.


Don't click the layer name itself, or you'll just be typing in a new name. Click the space next to it.

, Use the Image → Adjustments menu or the Adjustments panel tools. Play around with these, using Ctrl+Alt+Z to undo. You can use adjustments to make the image brighter, alter the color balance, and sharpen the image, among other options.


By default, any layer adjustment you add will apply to every layer (every image in the collage). You can change this by right clicking on the adjustment in the Layers panel and selecting ""Create Clipping Mask."" This applies the adjustment to only the layer beneath it.

, Explore the Filter top menu and play around with the tools. Try the tools listed under Artistic, Brush-stroke, Distort, Sketch, Stylize, or Texture.


To make the image stylistically blurry, use the Noise, Pixelate, Render, Sharpen or Blur filters.

, Press T on your keyboard, or click the T symbol on the Tools panel. Drag your cursor over the image to make a text box. Type in your text. Adjust the font size and appearance by highlighting your text and altering the values in the top tool bar. Move the text box by dragging the dots at the edge of the box.


There is no spell check. To check spelling, you'll need to copy-paste to a text editing program or online spell check.
Once you're done, click the black cursor tool to return to the default move tool.

Know the inversion command.,
Invert colors in a specific layer.,
Invert specific parts of a layer.",How to Invert Colors in Photoshop2," Inverting colors in Photoshop is as simple as the command Ctrl+I or Cmd+I, but there are a few things to check about your file and layers before you can get the color inversion exactly where you want it. To invert the entire image, simple open the image in Photoshop, and press Crtl+I or Cmd+I.

, If you want to invert colors in a specific layer in your Photoshop file: select that layer, and make sure it is rasterised. If not, right-click on the Layer label (under the Layers list) and select ""Rasterise Layer"". Once you ensure the layer is rasterised, you can press Ctrl+I to invert all visible colors in the layer.


You can only perform this on one layer at a time. It will not work if you have selected multiple layers.
You should perform this step after you re-size the layer or image to the size that you want. Enlarging an image after rasterising could lead to pixelation and a loss in resolution.

, If you want to invert specific parts of a layer, you can select the layer, and select the portion you want to invert using different selection tools available in Photoshop: try the Rectangle tool, Lasso tool, or Magic Wand. Add or subtract portions to your selection, as needed. When you are satisfied with the selection area you have created, press Ctrl+I to invert.


You can also select different portions one at a time and invert. However, if you select a previously inverted portion a second time by mistake, that set of pixels will be reverted to original color. Thus, it is better to invert for complete selection in one go.

Copy the new installer.",How to Install Photoshop 6 or 7 on Windows 73," You will be changing the setup file from a 16-bit installer to a 32-bit installer. In order to do this, you will need a packaging software such as WinInstall LE (freeware). In order to create the setup file, you will need to install Photoshop and WinInstall LE on a machine that is compatible.


You MUST perform these steps on a compatible machine. You can either use a Virtual PC (as outlined above), or another computer that has a 32-bit version of Windows. Running on a clean install on a virtual machine is preferred because there are no conflicting programs.

, Start Discover mode, which has a magnifying glass icon in the toolbar. This will open the Discover Wizard. WinInstall will take a before and after snapshot of your system files when you perform an installation. It will take this information and create a new 32-bit installer that can work on 64-bit systems.


You will need to create a name for the new installer, as well as a path for the new installer. WinInstall will ask which drives you want to have scanned. You should indicate the hard drive that you are installing Photoshop on.
After configuring the Discovery mode, WinInstall will analyze your system. This may take a few moments.

, Once Discovery mode is running, start the installation of Photoshop. Install it as you would on your 64-bit machine, including all of the options you would pick. Wait for the installation to complete.

, Once the installation is complete, run Discovery mode in WinInstall again. You will be given the option to run the After mode or start a new Discovery. Select After to create a new snapshot of your system. WinInstall will look at the Before and After, and build a new installation package.

, Move the new installer onto your 64-bit machine. Run the installer and install Photoshop as normal.

Open the first image in Photoshop.,

Copy your second image and paste it into the new layer.,
Add a layer mask to the layer containing your second image.,
Pick the gradient tool from the tool palette.,
Drag lines with the gradient tool to create a fade.,
Reposition your two images as needed.,
To fade an entire image, adjust its opacity.",How to Fade in Photoshop1," Start by selecting ""Open"" from the File menu and browsing for the image on your hard drive. Open it to load it into Photoshop.


It's easiest to get started if this first image is not a Photoshop image — this way, it will only have one layer. However, you can always use the ""Flatten"" feature to combine all of the layers in the image into one.;
, To fade two images into each other, we'll need to load a second image into its own layer separate from the first. Click on the ""New Layer"" button in the ""Layers"" tab on the right to create a new layer.


The ""New Layer"" button is at the bottom of the ""Layers"" tab — it looks like a small square of paper with one corner dogeared., Select the second image you'd like to use (you can use ctrl+A to select the entire image; for Macs, use command+A), copy it to the clipboard, and paste it into the new layer.

, To add a layer mask, click the Add Layer Mask button in the ""Layers"" tab. This button looks like a small square with a circle in the middle.


Alternatively, select Layer > Layer Mask > Reveal All from the menu bar.
Make sure that no part of your image is selected before you create the layer mask. You can use the Select > Deselect button from the menu bar to undo any selections you currently have., Look for an icon in the Tool palette (which is on the left by default) that resembles a square whose color shifts from a light shade to a darker one. If you can't find it, click and hold the paint bucket tool and use the gradient tool when it appears.


For our purposes, we want to use a black-and-white gradient. Select this from the ""Options"" bar., Hold down the shift key and click at a point on your second image where you'd like the fade transition to start and drag in the direction you would like to create the effect. Release the mouse button. You should see your two images ""blend"" together smoothly.


Try experimenting with different line lengths with the gradient tool — the longer the line, the more gradual the fade effect.

, Once you've gotten the hang of making one image fade into the other, try moving both images around in their layers until they're positioned for maximum effect. Repeat the steps above to re-apply the gradient as needed.


Note that your first image will be classified as a background layer by default. Photoshop doesn't allow you to move background layers, so, to get around this, hold down alt (option on Macs) and double-click on the word ""Background"" in the Layers tab.

, The steps above have assumed that we have wanted to fade one image into another with a gradient effect. However, if we simply want make one image transparent and lay it image over the other image, our task is a little easier. Simply select the layer you want to fade and change the value in the ""Opacity"" box under the ""Layer"" tab to fade it.


Note that higher values make the selection less transparent, while lower values make it more transparent. A value of 100% will make the image appear ""normal,"" while a value of 1% will make it appear almost completely transparent.

"
"
Open a new image in Photoshop.,
Unlock your background layer.,
Add a new adjustment layer under your first layer.,
Use a black-and-white gradient on a layer mask.",How to Fade in Photoshop2," As in the section above, start by selecting ""Open"" from the File menu and browsing for the image on your hard drive.

, As noted above, Photoshop won't let you move the image in your background layer by default. To ""unlock"" your image, either use the trick in the section above or try double-clicking on the image itself.

, To create a layer underneath your former background layer, ctrl+click on the New Adjustment Layer button (command+click on Macs). Choose the ""Solid Color"" fill layer type.


The New Adjustment Layer button looks like a small circle that is half white, half black.
Note that the color in the foreground will be the one used for the new layer. You can change the foreground color with the Color Picker tool.Aesthetically, fades to colored backdrops usually look best if the color used appears in the image itself. The eyedropper tool can help here by allowing you to lift colors directly out of the image., Now that you have an image on one layer and a solid-colored backdrop, it's relatively simple to fade from one to the other. Simply use the gradient tool (with a black-and-white gradient selected), hold shift, and drag a line from where you want your fade effect to start to where you want it to end (as in the section above.)


As also mentioned above, you may want to reposition your image in its layer to get the desired effect.

Select an area of your image.,
Add the selection to a new layer.,
Select ""Screen"" from the Layer Mode menu.,
Adjust the opacity slider.,
Alternatively, use a Gaussian blur.",How to Fade in Photoshop3," There are multiple options for selecting part of an image in Photoshop. Below are a few of the most common options.



Quick-selection tool. The icon for this looks like a paintbrush tracing a dotted line. ""Painting"" with this tool makes Photoshop automatically attempt to select the parts of the image you paint over along their defined edges.Marquee tools. The icons for these look like a dotted rectangle and a dotted oval. These tools allow you to grab rectangle or oval-shaped chunks of the image.Lasso tool. The icon for this looks like a rope lasso. This tool allows you to draw a selection freehand., Once you've selected a portion of your image, put this selection in its own layer. You can do this by selecting Layer > New > Layer Via Cut from the menu bar.


As a shortcut, you can also press ctrl+shift+J (command+shift+J on Macs).

, On the right side of the screen, under the ""Layer"" tab, select ""Screen"" from the dropdown menu., As noted above, there should also be an option under the ""Layer"" tab labeled ""Opacity."" Adjusting the value in this box will cause the layer (which contains the portion of the image you've selected) to become more or less transparent.

, The method above fades the entire selection uniformly. If, on the other hand, you want to the selection's edges to blur into the surrounding image, using a tool like Photoshop's Gaussian blur feature can be highly useful. The procedure for this is a little different, but it's not hard — just follow the steps below:Create a new adjustment layer from your selection.
Select Blur > Gaussian Blur from the ""Filter"" menu.
Input a value in the ""Radius"" box. This determines how greatly the blur/fade effect is applied to the image (larger values make the blurred area wider.)

Maintain variety: some close-ups of fire victims, broader shots of the burning building, and action photos of a fireman rushing out of the fray. If the photos are blurry, too dark, or simply lack to tell the story, cut them out.;
,, Choose File > File Info. In the window, enter your name in the “Author” entry. Write a brief caption in the “Caption” section describing where and when the photo was taken, what’s going on in the photo if it is not obvious, and the names of people in the photo if possible.

, In the top menu, choose Images. In the drop menu, click on Image size. Check the width and height in the “Documents” box (third and fourth entries) to be sure neither number is greater than 10 inches (25.4 cm) – adjust accordingly. Then, change the resolution (fifth entry) to 200.

, In the Images menu, hold the mouse over Mode and select CMYK from the menu. This may change the color composition slightly.

, Go to Images > Adjustments > Levels. You will see three arrows along a horizontal line. The one on the far left adds more shadows, while the one on the far right brightens highlights. The one in the middle adjusts mid-tones. While looking at the photo, move the arrows from right to left accordingly to create just enough contrast in the lighting without being overly dramatic. Err on the side of light, since printing presses tend to run colors slightly darker than what appears on the computer screen.

, In the toolbar on the left, select the square crop tool. It should look like a square object with a line going through the middle. Click and drag the object over the desired area, removing extraneous material. Adjust the cropping area by dragging any of the four corners from this selected area. When satisfied, hit ENTER. Avoid cutting off people’s limbs or cropping a location that could leave out important contextual information.

, Go to Filter > Sharpen > Unsharp Mask. In the window, maintain “Threshold” at 0, “Radius” between one and two, and the sharpening amount around 75 percent. While looking at the photo, adjust the sharpening amount by dragging the arrow just below it to the right or left. The trick is to sharpen the image as much as possible without appearing too grainy.

, After clicking File > Save As, go to the Art folder on the server. Look for drop menu with the file format and change it to .PNG or .JPEG. Name your photo with the original name and a suffix so that it is organized and obvious what image it came from and what its purpose is. For instance, your photo named DSC_001.JPG or DSC_001.CRW (Canon RAW) or DSC_001.NEF (Nikon RAW) after being edited will be saved as DSC_001_PrintEdit.JPG or DSC_001_PrintEdit.PNG. Make sure you don't overwrite your existing photo if you chose to save in the same folder you imported your original photo to. Now, hit “Save.”

On newer versions of Photoshop, you can click the Gear Icon to turn on ""Rubber Banding."" This gives you a preview of your line as you draw it, which is usually helpful for beginners.The rest of the settings can be left as they are.

, This creates an ""anchor point,"" or a little black square that helps define your line. Your line will be made up of anchor points and handles, but you'll get to handles later. For now, just place the beginning of your line.You can click and drag this point to start curving it immediately. For now, however, wait on bending and curving the line until a little later.

, Click on the second point in your line, but don't release the mouse yet. Instead, drag the point around to curve your line, getting used to how the line responds to your movements. The straight line with two circles on the end is your ""handle"" and this dictates how the line is curved. You can adjust these handles later, so they don't need to be perfect now.A longer handle leads to a slower, more gentle curve. A short handle is a sharper turn.
Crossing over the handle leads the line to curve back on itself. Try to use the handles to outline your curves, as if they formed a fence around the actual curve to ease it in the right direction.
Adobe recommends making the handle about 1/3 the distance to the next anchor point you're going to click., Finish drawing your line with the pen tool. If you need to get rid of a point, hit Ctrl+Alt+Z (PC) or Cmd+Opt+Z to move backwards. Hitting the Del key will delete only the most recent point. Keep adding points until your whole curve has the shape you're looking for., If you want a sharp angle in the middle of the curve, you need to avoid the handles. Hold down Alt (PC) or Opt (Mac) when creating new points to ignore the handles from the previous point., Don't worry -- it is easier than it sounds.

Set the color mode to CYMK because that’s the color mode needed when printing (add instructional step in between new template and new setting)
The final size of your card will be 3.5 x 2 inches but it is best to include a 1/8th inch 'bleed area' all around. The bleed area makes sure that the colors ""bleed"" out over the edges when the cards are cut, instead of leaving white borders. br>
Example: Anything past the orange line(s) would constitute the bleed area;
,


Click on View and under view click Rulers (as displayed in the image below).
Click on the top ruler and drag down to create two horizontal guide lines.
Create two more vertical lines. These lines mark the end of the actual business card.
You can also create safety guidelines just inside the bleed area to make sure your text does not extend too close to the edges.

,
Use light or dark colors so that any text or images stand out clearly against the background.
When using the gradient tool, draw a line across the entire image to create a gradual transition between colors. You could alternatively draw a shorter line within the image to create a more abrupt transition.

, You will need to add, at the very least, your name and job title, your company's name or logo, and your contact information.

, If you have an image of your company's logo, to open the image in Photoshop simple drag photo from whichever folder the photo is housed into Photoshop and drag it into the card template, avoiding the background.

, Right click on the text layer and open the Blending Options window. Select the Bevel & Emboss option and set the size to 2-3 to give the text a bit of depth. For dark text against a light background, select the outer glow option. With the color set to a light version of the background, set the spread and size to a small value to create a subtle glow instead of a broad halo.

, You can use large abstract brushes with the color set to match the center of your background gradient to create a nice subtle contrast. Another way to make brushes blend in is to select Blending Options in the brushes layer, select gradient overlay and modify the gradient with colors similar to your background.

, Open an image and select a portion using the quick selection tool. Copy and paste it into the card template. You can also create a composite using pieces of many images and brushes on a separate image. Arrange the pieces on separate layers and merge all the layers at the end before copying and pasting the composite onto your template as done in previous screen shots. Paste your image on a new layer in your template.

, Draw a rectangle along the safety guide lines (or slightly outside of them) using the rectangle tool. Make sure the path style is selected in the top left corner. Select the brush tool and choose a simple brush style with a size between 1-10 pixels. Select the Paths panel in the layers palette and right click on the Work Path. Click on Stroke Path and select Brush.

, Fine-tune your design to move text away from background graphics or remove effects that don't blend with the rest of the template. You may want to change some font colors of your background depending on what you want the design to look like.

Launch Photoshop.,
Open a video.,
Adjust import settings.,
Apply adjustments.,
Edit individual layers.,
Save your animated GIF.",How to Create Animated GIFs Using Photoshop1," To create animations with Photoshop, you will need to have at least Photoshop CS3 Extended. Versions of Photoshop starting with CS6 includes animation in all versions.;
, From the File menu, choose Import > Video Frames to Layers...


Select a movie file. Be aware that Photoshop will only import a maximum of 500 frames. If the movie file you've selected is longer than that, you will need to trim it.

, In the Import Video to Layers window, make any adjustments necessary. The options under Range to Import are the main ones you'll want to look at.


""From Beginning To End"" is the most straightforward. Photoshop will attempt to import every frame of the movie. If there are more than 500 frames, the movie will be truncated at that point.
""Selected Range Only"" lets you choose the in and out points using the controls at the bottom. Use the scroll thumb to quickly look through the movie, and drag the bookends below that to set the range of frames to import.
""Limit To Every Frames"" will cut your frames by at least half, at the expense of choppier animation.
""Make Frame Animation"" enables both the conversion of the movie into layers, and turns the layers into an animation. Deselecting it will still import the movie into layers, but does not then create an animation. For this tutorial, we will leave it selected.
When you're set up, click OK to import your movie. It will take a couple seconds, then you will see all the individual frames in the Layer menu, and each individual frame spread out across the timeline.

, You can use Photoshop's adjustment layers to add effects, color correction, brightness and contrast, and more. Adjustment layers are, by default, applied to all layers below them.


You can apply a wide variety of built-in adjustments. You can also add a new layer using an overlay to change the character of the video, or a new base layer to add a background.
For example, you could have a short video of somebody just standing there looking around. On the lowest layer, you might add a picture of the city—or the country—to place them in a particular environment. You could then add adjustment layer on top of everything, to give it a sepia tone. You could even recreate the look of the animated newspapers in the Harry Potter movies.

, Click on a frame in the Timeline window, and find the matching layer. By default, the frame number is the same as the layer's name, i.e., frame 18 can be found on Layer 18.


You can modify any individual layer, either to add effects, or clean up glitches, or whatever strikes your fancy. If you do this over several frames, you can even animate your effects.
For example, if you add a lens flare to one frame, in the next frame you could type Control-Alt-F (Command-Option-F on Mac) to bring up the same filter. Reduce the effect by 10%, then move to the next frame and repeat the process. Continue until you've reduced the effect to 0, and it will look like the lens flare is animated.

, From the File menu, select Save for Web... This will let you set the size and output options for the GIF, as needed to fit your requirements.

The standard sizes for GIFs can be readily found online. Use the specific settings in the upper menu set the size, not manual cropping or the more common Image Size menu.

, If the animations move too fast, you can create in-betweens. The button that brings up the menu is found next to the New Layer button on the animation menu. Fiddle with the settings until your animation looks correct.


You'll need to set the opacity to 79% for every in-between frame you create.

, The button is sometimes shortened to a small gray cross. The Actions Panel is where you can create, edit, delete, or run actions on any of your photos. It is usually grouped with the ""History"" tab.


Alternatively, you can click on ""New Action"" in the Actions panel menu.
If you cannot see the Action Panel, click on ""Windows"" --> ""Actions"" in the top bar to make it appear.

, When you create an action, you are prompted to fill in several boxes before you begin ""recording"" your action. While changing the default settings is not important when you first start out, these settings will give you greater control over actions as you learn more.



Name: Choose a name that helps you remember the action's function. If you want to create an action that crops your pictures into squares and adjusts the color, you could call it ""Polaroid,"" for example.

Action Set: An action set is a series or group of actions that are used together. You might make an action for levels, brightness, and contrast and group them in a ""Lighting Correction"" action set. If in doubt or just starting out, choose ""Default.""

Function Key: Allows you to map the action to a button, like F3, so that every time you press the button the action is performed.

Color: Color codes the action so that you can find it easier.

, Once you begin recording, everything you do in Photoshop will be remembered as part of the action. The small button on the actions panel will turn red to let you know you are recording.

, Start with something simple to learn how actions work. For example, click on ""Image"" --> ""Adjust"" --> ""Brightness/Contrast"" and play with the knobs, clicking ""OK"" when you are done. Not only will you have edited the image, you will have saved that precise change as an action. These changes are called ""Commands.""  


Note how your change will appear under your action in the action panel.
You can make as many commands as you want and they will all record as a single action.

, This button is located on the Action panel, or you could also click on the bright red ""Recording"" button. Your action is now saved.  

, Open up a different picture file, then click on your action in the action panel. Press the small gray ""Play"" button in the actions panel to start the action. You'll notice the image is edited exactly like the first one, as Photoshop performs all the same changes in the same order you performed them.

, The most powerful use for actions is to process many pictures at once, saving you time and energy spent performing the same steps over and over again. This is called performing a ""batch"" action. To work on a batch:


Click on ""File"" --> ""Automate"" --> ""Batch""
Choose the action to perform. This will choose from all current actions available. You may need to exit and select another action set if you have multiple sets and yours does not appear here.
Choose the files to edit. You can choose a whole folder, files open in Adobe Bridge, the files currently open in Photoshop, or even files you are importing to your computer from a digital camera.
Choose how to name and save your new photos.

, The action panel is incredibly robust, and you can tweak any action on the fly in Photoshop. Click on the right facing triangle next to your action to view all of the commands in that action. Double-click a step to change values, un-check the box next to it to omit it, and click and drag steps to reorder them.


If, for example, you want to use your ""Brightness"" action but all of your pictures are too dark, you can adjust the ""Brightness/Contrast"" command to raise the light a little more instead of creating a new action.

, Stops allow you to tinker with an image or add a specific command during an action, a useful trick if you want to type specific messages or paint a unique image on each image. To add a stop, click on the command right before you want the stop to happen, then click ""Add Stop"" in the actions panel.


When done, click the ""Play"" button to resume the action where it left off
Check the box ""Allow Continue"" for the option to resume the action without making any changes.

, Modal controls allow you to adjust certain commands every time you run an action. For example, if I am resizing images as part of a larger edit, but every image needs to be a different size, I can make turn the Command ""Resize"" into a modal control. Now, every time that step occurs in my action, Photoshop will stop and ask me how big the image should be. To make a command modal:


Find the command in your action panel.
Modal commands will have a small gray/white dialogue box next to them.
Click this box to toggle modal control on and off.
You can click this box next to an action to make all commands in that action modal.

, Click on ""Playback Options"" in the actions menu to adjust the speed. Choose ""Accelerated"" for the fastest results. This prevents photoshop from displaying every action as it happens instead cuts to the final image when it is finished.


If you want to see the process happen, choose ""Step by Step"" or ""Wait ____ Seconds.""

, You can only do this with full action sets. Click on the ""Save Action"" button to save a copy of your action to your computer.


Save actions into Photoshop's ""Actions/Presets"" folder to make them part of your program default. You can find this folder by searching in ""My Computer"" or ""Finder.""

,


Search online for ""Photoshop Actions"" to download any of the thousands of free, pre-made actions that you may need.You can load any action you create to use again by clicking ""Load Action""

, Droplets, a newer feature of Photoshop, are powerful tools that allow you to make multiple changes to files with one button. You can create a shortcut to a droplet anywhere on your computer, then click and drag photos onto the shortcut to automatically open Photoshop and edit them. To create a droplet:

Inverse the selection of your ellipse.,
Select “Fill”.,
Press OK. Once you have adjusted the settings after you press fill, press OK to apply the fill.,
Finished.",How to Create a Vignette Effect in Adobe Photoshop for Mac1," Photoshop may be in many places on your computer. The easiest way to find it, if you have any difficulty, is to use the spotlight search at the top right of your Mac screen.;
, The vignette looks good on just about any photo. Press open on the Photoshop main screen. Finder will appear. Choose whatever photo from your files you want to edit to get started.

, This tool allows you to draw any type of square or rectangular selection on your photo. You use it by simply click and dragging the mouse to make the rectangle bigger or smaller in any direction, then letting go when you are finished. It won't actually draw anything over your photo. It simply creates a selection so you can edit just that part of your photo without disturbing the rest.


This tool can be found in the tool bar on the left. It is located second from the top.
If you press and hold down on the tool, a small box will appear with different variations of the tool.
You can also elect it by using hot key ""M"".

, By doing this, you are beginning to create the selection that you will later use to be able to create the vignette.


Using the Marquee tool drag from just inside the top left of your photo and down to the bottom right.
More spaces on the edges will result in a larger vignette.

, The term ""feather"" on Photoshop means ""soft edges."" By softening the edges, this will make the vignette fade into the center of the photo. This step can be done two ways.


If you are using a mouse, right click in the middle of your rectangle and select ""Feather"".
If you are using a trackpad, click with two fingers and select ""Feather"".

, It should turn into an ellipse. Feel free to experiment with different pixel amounts. The more you play around with different sizes, the more you will learn and be able to use in future projects. 500 px is a good basis, but you may find you prefer a larger or smaller amount for your vignette.

, Since the vignette goes around the border of your photo, the selection needs to be inverted. Once the you have pressed inverse. the dashed lines should now appear around your ellipse as well as around the border of your photo. This step can be done two ways, depending on your hardware.


If you are using a mouse, right click and press ""select inverse"".
If you are using a trackpad, click with two fingers and press ""select inverse"".

, Fill means precisely that. It will take the selection and fill it up with something, in this case it will fill it with the color black. This is where your vignette will come from.


Again this can be done with a mouse or a trackpad by either right clicking or clicking with two fingers, respectively.

, Ensure that the color you are using is black.


You can play around with different modes to see which effects you like the most, however black is the setting used in this tutorial, as it is most true to an authentic vignette.
Raise the opacity to make it darker or lower it to make it lighter. Darker generally creates a more authentic vignette.

, You have created your vignette and now all that is left to do is admire your work. Get it printed and framed for your home or office, post it on the social media of your choice to show it off to your friends, or make your new background for your computer. Find another photo and try out the next method of creating a vignette.

, The page title is the first thing that is usually seen on your webpage and also plays an important role in how search engines index the page. The page title will appear at the very top when your webpage is opened in any Internet browser.


Dreamweaver 3 shows a title icon at the top-left that can be used to enter the webpage title. You can also create a page title by selecting ""Head Content"" in the View menu. You can enter the title in the title box that pops up.
Dreamweaver 4 already has the title box shown at the top of its user interface. Simply type in the blank area to create your page title.

Finished.",How to Create a Vignette Effect in Adobe Photoshop for Mac2," Photoshop may be in many places on your computer. The easiest way to find it, if you have any difficulty, is to use the spotlight search at the top right of your Mac screen.

, Use the same photo as the fill method or try a new one. The vignette looks good on just about any photo. Press open on the Photoshop main screen. Finder will appear. Choose whatever photo from your files you want to edit to get started.

, This tool allows you to draw any type of square or rectangular selection on your photo. You use it by simply click and dragging the mouse to make the rectangle bigger or smaller in any direction, then letting go when you are finished. It won't actually draw anything over your photo. It simply creates a selection so you can edit just that part of your photo without disturbing the rest.

If you press and hold down on the tool, a small box will appear with different variations of the tool.
You can also elect it by using hot key ""M"".

, In this method, you are beginning to create a border to help you draw within the lines.


Using the Marquee tool drag from just inside the top left of your photo and down to the bottom right.
More spaces on the edges will result in a larger vignette.

, The term ""feather"" on Photoshop means ""soft edges."" This method doesn't require soft edges. Feathering will turn your rectangle intro an ellipse, but by creating a rectangle first, it is easier to center. Using the Ellipse Marquee tool is more difficult to center. This step can be done two ways.


If you are using a mouse, right click in the middle of your rectangle and select ""Feather"".
If you are using a trackpad, click with two fingers and select ""Feather"".

, It should turn into an ellipse. Feel free to experiment with different pixel amounts. The more you play around with different sizes, the more you will learn and be able to use in future projects. 500 px is a good basis, but you may find you prefer a larger or smaller amount for your vignette.


This will serve as a guide to help you draw between the lines in future steps.

, The burn tool is located towards the middle of your tool bar. It looks like a hand making an ""O"". Similar to the Marquee tool, there are different variants. If you do not see it, look for a tool that looks like a lollipop. Press and hold on that tool and a smaller menu will appear, giving you the option between the dodge tool, the burn tool, and the sponge tool. The burn tool allows you to draw over your photo and darken wherever you draw.


It can also be selected using hot key ""O"".

, This will create your vignette effect. The burn tool darkens and takes the place of using ""fill"" from the last method.


Adjust the size, hardness, and exposure of the brush to find your own preference. If it is not as dark as you wish, draw over it again. These settings can be found in the top tool bar, above your photo.
It may be necessary to draw around your photo several times to achieve the darkness you desire.
This method is useful to slightly darken the edges when you want the subject to stand out.

, You have created your second vignette and now all that is left to do is admire your work. Get it printed and framed for your home or office, post it on the social media of your choice to show it off to your friends, or make your new background for your computer. Keep practicing both of these methods and soon you will be a vignette expert.

, Shift-Click or Ctrl/Cmd-Click on all the layers you want merged to highlight multiples. Then right-click on one of the layers and select ""Merge Layers"" to combine them all.


They layers will merge into the top-most layer, and keep that name., This is a good way to combine lots of layers quickly. Instead of clicking all the layers you want to merge, simply uncheck the little ""eye"" to the left of each layer you do not want to merge. Then right-click on any still-visible layer in the panel and select ""Merge Visible.""

, Most users can leave this at ""Acrobat 7.0"" for maximum compatibility. If you know your recipient is using Acrobat 6.0, you can select that instead. If you know they are using XI or newer, you can select that for increased password encryption.


Security envelopes are not compatible with 5.0 or earlier.

, You'll be warned that the settings will not take effect until you save the file.

, After you finish the creation process, you'll see your security envelope. you can go through and make edits to the fields, and fill in the appropriate information. You can include instructions for the recipient in the ""To"" box, but make sure you don't put the password here., Once you're finished, save the file to your computer. It will save as a regular PDF file. Once the file is saved, you can send it to anyone as an email attachment or upload it to a cloud storage service, and they'll need the password to open it.

Switch to the ""Rectangle Marquee Tool"" (M) and select the entire canvas.,
Switch back to the ""Move Tool"" (V).,
Use the ""aligning"" buttons on the top of the screen to center the text however you please.,
Use the arrow keys to move text along straight lines, preserving your centering.",How to Center Text in Photoshop1," Open you image and place your text on the page. It doesn't matter what you write, as any amount or type of text can be put in the dead center of the image., This method will center everything in the layer you have selected. So, if you have five different layers you want to center, you'll either have to do it by hand or put them in one layer. For now, just work with one layer.

, This is the second highest tool in your tool bar, the little dotted square with a little triangle in the bottom corner. Once selected, click and drag from the top-left corner until the entire canvas is selected.

, This is simply the normal cursor, and the top tool in your toolbox on the left of the screen. Not how the screen at the top of Photoshop changes with each tool -- the centering tools are in this menu.

, To the right of ""Show Transform Controls"" are a set of lines and boxes. These are alignment tools. Hovering over each tool will tell you what each does. You want to pay attention to two of them in particular:



Align Vertical Centers: The second button -- two squares with a horizontal line through the center. This makes the space above and below the text even.

Align Horizontal Centers: The second to last button-- two squares with a vertical line through the center. This makes the space to either side of the text even.

, Clicking and dragging text makes it almost impossible to hit the center. If you've centered multiple text blocks or images, but still need to space them out, use the arrow keys to move things along perfectly straight lines. If you only press the down arrow, for example, you'll preserve your horizontal centering.


Use Ctrl-click (PC) or Cmd-click (Mac) to move the text by even smaller, more precise increments.
These movements are always even. If you click the down arrow twice, clicking the up arrow twice will bring you back exactly where you started."

If the layer is locked, you'll need to duplicate it to unlock it. Press Ctrl/⌘ Command+J to duplicate the selected layer. See Unlock Layers in Photoshop for more details.
If you just want to center one aspect of a layer, you'll need to use the selection tools and then create a new layer from your selection. Right-click on the selected part of the image and select ""Create Layer from Selection."";
, You'll see the dashed selection box appear around the edge of the layer.


You can use this same method to center an object in the middle of your selection, instead of the middle of the image. Instead of pressing Ctrl/⌘ Command+A to select everything, use the Selection tool to define your own area in the image. When you follow the process below, the image will be centered in the selected area., You'll find this in the toolbox on the left side of the screen. It looks like a mouse cursor with a crosshair next to it. You can also press V to select it.

, You'll find this in the toolbar at the top of the window, or in the attributes window that appears beneath the toolbox on the left side of the screen. It looks like a skinny dark rectangle, with a white square to the right of it. This will align the selected layer so that it is vertically centered.The location of these buttons may vary depending on which version of Photoshop you are using, but they should always be present when you select the Move tool.

, You'll find this near the ""Align vertical centers"" button. It looks like a white box centered above a horizontal dark rectangle. This will center the selected layer horizontally.

, If the object you were trying to center was not centered already in the layer, you may have to make some manual adjustments to get it exactly centered.


You can create a guide that will show you the exact center of your image. Click and drag from the left ruler bar to create a vertical guide line. Slowly drag the line to the center until it snaps into place. Then click and drag a guide line from the top horizontal ruler, and slowly drag it to the center until it snaps into place. Where the lines meet is the exact center of your image. Use this to help make manual adjustments to the layer you are trying to center.
