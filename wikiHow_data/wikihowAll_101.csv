Open the Brushes palette using the Window → Brushes command in the top menu, or by clicking the icon that looks like a piece of paper, in the top options bar. Adjust the size and shape of your brush tool to suit your current project.


Sticking to the default brush is fine if you're new to Photoshop. You'll soon realize if your brush is too large or too small, and you can always return to this menu to make changes.
Choose ""hard edge"" for precise control over what you affect, or ""soft edge"" for a brush with a more diffuse edge.;
, When you have the brush or pencil tool selected, you can change the blend mode using a drop-down menu in the top options bar. Each of these modes uses a different formula to mix new color into the existing color on the canvas. The most common options are explained below.


In some versions of Photoshop, you may be able to alter the blend mode from the brushes palette.
Older versions of Photoshop may not have every blend mode available.

, In Normal mode, Photoshop won't blend colors at all. When using the Brush tool, the blend color will completely cover the base color. When the Edit tool is used, the edit value overrides the existing color. You probably won't be using this for your blend, but it's good to understand how the default blend mode works.


This is called Threshold when working with a bitmap or indexed-color image.In this case, the resulting color will be the closest possible match available in the color map.

, This very popular blending mode makes light areas lighter and dark areas darker.The end result is a picture with more significant highlights and shadows, and fixes issues with over- and under-exposure.


If you're interested in the technical details, this uses the Multiply and Screen formulas, described below.

, There are several ways to darken colors, each of which works a bit differently:


In Darken mode, each pixel's red, green, and blue value gets compared to the new color you're adding. For each of the three comparisons, the darkest value ends up in the final image.
In Multiply mode, each brush stroke will ""multiply"" the new color and base color's brightness. You can keep adding brush strokes, making the result darker each time.
Darker Color mode works similarly to Darken, except it compares the two pixels as a whole instead of looking at RGB values. Each pixel will either remain the old color, or be replaced by the new, whichever is darker.
Linear Burn mode darkens all colors, but tends to produce more blacks and extra-dark color areas than other modes.Color Burn is similar to linear burn for dark colors, but has a less pronounced effect on light colors.It may result in greater contrast and saturation.

, Each method of darkening a color has a corresponding opposite formula for lightening:


In Lighten mode, the red, green, and blue values of the base color and blend colors are compared. Lighter values of the blend color are used to lighten the image.
Use Screen mode to makes anything darker than white less visible.
Use Lighter Color to replace darker areas completely with the blend color.
Linear Dodge (Add) adds the values of the two colors together. If either color is white, the result will be completely white. If either color is black, there will be no change.Color Dodge has a lesser effect on darker colors, leading to greater contrast.

, The Behind and Clear modes are available in layered images. If the Behind mode is chosen, a color will be applied behind the layer and show only in transparent areas. The Clear mode is essentially an eraser, making all pixels in front of the background transparent.

, This will compare the brightness values of the base and blend colors, creating a result value by subtracting the smaller from larger values. This will bring the brightness closer to the blend color, whether it is darker or lighter than the base color.

, Mathematically, these do exactly what you'd expect to the two color values. In practice, this means that similar colors move toward black when using Subtract, and move toward white when using Divide., This is mostly used for special effects, not for touching up a photo. The blended color will look scattered or jagged instead of transitioning smoothly. Try this for an old-fashioned effect., The remaining modes have a more narrow effect. Each of these replaces one value of the base color with the corresponding value of the blend color. All other characteristics remain the same.


Hue (for example, a particular type of red)
Saturation (low saturation looks more grey, while higher saturation looks more vivid)
Luminance (how bright or dim the color looks)

, The Color mode replaces both hue and saturation with the blend color's values, leaving the luminance of the base color the same. This is often used to add color to black and white images.

Understand the capabilities of Flash.,
Decide how you will use Flash.,
Pick the right software.,
Find tools to help you learn.,
Understand vector graphics.,
Familiarize with Animation terminology.,
Understand basic Actionscript structure.",How to Start Learning Adobe Flash," Flash utilizes its own programming language, called Actionscript to create applications or assets in web design. Actionscript and Flash are also what powers Adobe Air - a common platform for mobile games. Flash can also be used to create and animate graphical elements for use in videos, games, or general design. Flash is popular for its use of vector graphics, a high quality and flexible image type.;
, The way in which you use Flash will determine which tools you need to get started. One could make a fully functional game, both coded and animated entirely using Flash. Likewise, one could create graphical assets and animations without ever interacting with Actionscript.

, Regardless of which path you choose, the most comprehensive tool to develop with flash is Adobe Animate (formerly Flash Professional). Adobe offers a 30 day free trial for their software. If you plan to work mainly with code, there are free options like FlashDevelop or ApacheFlex.

, Adobe’s own site offers a number of tutorials on the use of their products, including videos and extensive documentation. Flashkit is another free resource with many step by step instructions on different aspects of Flash capabilities.



https://helpx.adobe.com/animate/tutorials.html is Adobe’s own collection of tutorial’s for Animate.

http://www.adobe.com/devnet.html is a tutorial resource for Adobe developers.

http://www.flashkit.com/tutorials/ is a website with guides for many different Flash features.

, Vector graphics use polygons instead of pixel to render images on a screen. The advantage of this is the ability to manipulate and resize images without loss of quality. These qualities make vector graphics particularly suited to animation.

, Some of the most common concepts you will encounter when animating with Flash are the Timeline, Layers, Tweens, and Keyframes.


The Timeline is a toolbar in Flash that contains the individual frames of the animated content you are creating. It is essential to controlling the timing and order of its content.
Layers are an organization tool for the graphical assets you create. Layers separate graphical content and allow for modifications to be made without changing content stored in other layers.
Tweens are animations generated by Flash’s software. The user designates starting and stopping points and a movement pattern, and the software calculates the animation between the two points.
Keyframes denote points of change in an animation. The points designated for a Tween are keyframes; likewise each frame in a frame-by-frame animation is a keyframe.

, Actionscript is based off of Javascript, although the two are not interchangeable. Actionscript is an object-oriented programming language. At a basic level, what this means is the code can be easy to modify and update as your program develops. For those with no coding experience at all, it is best to start by learning the basic language terms (e.g. variables, booleans, etc.) and what they do before attempting to write any code.

Select ""gradient,"" then click on the gradient bar at the top. Adjust the hues and values as desired. Select an area using the Lasso or Magic Wand tools, then apply the gradient by clicking and dragging. The result is a smooth transition between two colors.

, Make a copy of the layer or area you're trying to adjust. Past it on a new layer above the original. Select an eraser tool with soft, diluted edges and a soft opacity blend between 5 and 20%. Gradually erase the top layer until you've achieved the desired effect.

, If you have two or more layers you'd like to overlap, adjust the opacity slider above each layer name. This controls how transparent each layer is.

, Choose a brush and find the tablet options in the brush settings panel. Enable ""transfer"" and set the brush to adjust opacity depending on the pressure you apply to your tablet. You can use this with any shape and type of brush, but there are great custom options from online brush makers that provide a milky or oily feel.


Once you've selected your transfer brush, just select the color you'd like to blend in and stroke lightly over the base image.

, Select the smudge tool in the Tools panel, represented by a finger icon. In your brush panel, select a soft, round smudge tool, and turn up scattering to about 20%. Smudge together colors near the border a painting-like transition.


You may need to play with the smudge strength value on the top bar to get the desired effect.

, Place one color over the other, on two layers. Click the New Layer Mask button in the Layers panel, next to the top layer. Select the mask and apply a white to black gradient within the mask. The 100% black area will display only the lower layer, and the 100% white area will display only the upper layer.

, Select the border area you'd like to blend. Navigate to Filter → Blue → Gaussian blur on the top menu. Adjust the slider to taste. To repeat this, select additional areas with the Lasso tool, then press Ctrl+F to apply the same filter.


Use command+F instead on a Mac.

, If you are using vector graphics, create two vector shapes of different colors. Alter the properties to add a feather radius. The shapes will blur along the edges, blending wherever they are near each other. Increase the feather radius value for a greater effect.

, Select the Mixer Brush from the Tools panel, represented by a paintbrush and drop of paint. (In some versions, you may need to hold down the Brush icon to reveal this option.) Visit the Brush settings menu to check out several new options. Each of these will imitate a painter's techniques, such as dragging two colors of wet paint together.

Horizontal Type Tool: used most frequently, the horizontal type tool lets you type solid letters horizontally from left to right. This is the one use if just normally click the Text tool.

Vertical Type Tool: Allows you to write your words up and down, instead of left to right.

Horizontal Type Mask Tool: This turns your text into a mask, which can be used for a variety of fun Photoshop tricks. Off the bat, it will basically map the layer beneath the text and use it to ""color in"" your type.

Vertical Type Mask Tool: Works just like the Horizontal Type Mask, but writes letters up and down instead of left to right., If you need complete control over your text, the Character and Paragraph menus are the place to go. The Character menu's logo is an A followed by a vertical line. Paragraph resembles a P with a double vertical line and circle filled in, but you can also click ""Window → ""Paragraph"" if you can't see it.


Click and drag the icons in each menu to test them. You can actually seem them function in real time. Most deal with line spacing.
The Character menu generally has more to do with the actual type, where Paragraph adjusts the overall block of text and it's alignment.If you can't access the Paragraph Options, right-click the text and select ""Convert to Paragraph Text."", The Blending Options allow you to add shadows, outlines, glows, and even 3D options, each of which is fully customizable.

It reassembles turning the lines of the text into 3D cylinders, like pipes.

Stroke: This outlines your text with the line of a color, thickness, and texture you get to choose.

The Overlays: These will change the color of your font, placing a gradient, pattern, or new color over the shape of the text. You can even lower the opacities of these overlays, allowing you to do some fun shading and blending.

Drop Shadow: Puts a moveable, short shadow behind your text -- like there was a wall a foot or two behind it. You can change the angle, softness, and size of the shadow., Adding fonts to a photoshop is incredibly easy. You simply download the fonts, then drag them into the program to link them up.

Unlike older graphic design programs, Photoshop 7 gives the designer the ability to add hair strand by strand to create truly dynamic and realistic effects.;
, To do this, create a new document and choose a transparent (non-colored) background and then choose dark gray for the color.

, For example, ""Hard round 5 pixels.""


Draw curly overlapping lines. Vary the pressure on your pen to get differing line widths. Play with lines a bit, making sure one line is long and that all the lines are curly.

, Name the paintbrush. It will now be stored in the Brushes palette. You can view it by opening it and selecting the new brush.

, Turn the Size control to ""off"" and turn up the Angle Jitter to 20 percent or more.

, From here, you can now turn up (by percentages) the color dynamics by changing the levels of the Hue Jitter, Brightness Jitter and Saturation Jitter.


This feature allows the graphic designer to create hair that has a more realistic look, avoiding a 1-tone hair color.

, Choose ""Pen Pressure"" under Opacity Control.

, Select ""New Brush"" from the options and give it a name.

, The process involves creating 2 layers. Select black (for this example) and begin painting black hair on the image you are working on.

Take your future projects further.",How to Create a Flash Animation," This is considered the ""traditional"" method of animation, in that each frame has the same picture but slightly altered. When the frames are played together, the images appear to move. This is the same basic technique used by traditional hand-animators, and is more time-consuming than tweening (See the next section).


By default, Flash will produce animations at 24 frames per second (FPS). That means one second of animation will have 24 frames, but not every frame has to be different. You can adjust this if you'd like, and many Flash animations use 12 FPS, but 24 will produce much ""smoother""-looking animation.;
, There are a variety of Flash animation programs available, but the most powerful is Adobe's Flash Professional CC. You can install the trial for free, or you can use another product if subscribing to Adobe's Creative Cloud doesn't appeal to you. The rest of this article will refer to Flash Professional or any other editing program as ""Flash"".

, Because frame-by-frame animation requires multiple images with slight differences, you will need to create all of these assets by hand. You can create them all before you begin, or make them as you go. You can use the Flash program to draw directly in your project, or you can draw your assets in your favorite image creation program.


If you want your images to scale without sacrificing quality, you will want to create them as vectors instead of rasters. Vector images will redraw themselves whenever they are scaled, which means there won't be any pixelation or aliasing. Raster images are the traditional images you're probably used to (photos, Paint images, etc.). These do not scale well, and can look quite ugly if you want to make them larger.

, When you first start Flash, you will have a blank layer and an empty Timeline. As you add frames, your timeline will be populated automatically. You can interact with layers much in the same way that you would in Photoshop.


Before adding your image, create a basic background for your movie. Rename Layer 1 to ""Background"" and then lock the layer. Create a second layer and name it whatever you'd like. This will be the layer that you create your animation on.
Add your drawing to the canvas in the first frame. You can either import your drawing from your computer, or you can use Flash's drawing tools to create a drawing directly in the program.
Your first frame will be a keyframe. Keyframes are frames that have an image, and form the backbone of your animation. You will be creating a new keyframe each time the picture changes.
Keyframes are denoted by a black dot in the timeline.
You don't need a new image in each frame. In general having a keyframe every four-five frames will produce a good animation.

, By turning your drawing into a symbol, you can easily add it multiple times in a frame. This is especially useful if you need to quickly create multiple objects, such as a school of fish.


Select your entire drawing. Right-click on the selection and select ""Convert to Symbol"". This will add the image to your Library where you can quickly access it in the future.
Delete the drawing. Don't worry! You will be adding it back to the scene by simply dragging the object from your Library. You can add multiple instances of the same drawing to your scene with ease!

, Once you have your first frame ready, you can add your blank frames that will exist between the first keyframe and the second keyframe. Press F5 four or five times to add blank frames after your first keyframe.

, Once you've added a few blank frames, you're ready to create your second keyframe. There are essentially two different ways you can do this: you can copy your existing keyframe and make small adjustments, or you can create a blank keyframe and insert a new image. If you are using art created in another program, you'll want the second method. If you created your art using Flash's design tools, use the first method.


To create a keyframe using the contents of the previous keyframe, press F6. To create a blank keyframe, right-click on the last frame in your timeline and select ""Insert Blank Keyframe"". Anything in your scene will be removed.
Once you've created your second keyframe, you will need to make adjustments to the image to give the effect of motion. If you're using Flash's design tools, you can use the Transform tool to select aspects of your drawing and move them slightly, such as the arm of a stick-person.
If you're inserting new art for each keyframe, you will want to ensure that it is placed in the same location or in the next logical location on the screen. This will ensure that the art doesn't jump around between frames.

, Now that you've created two keyframes, it's time to iterate. You will be repeating essentially the same process until you are finished with your animation. Add a few blank frames between each keyframe, and ensure that your movements look fluid.Make small, incremental changes. Your animation will look much smoother if you make very small changes to the keyframe. For example, if you want a stick person waving an arm, your second keyframe should not be the other end of the wave. Instead, use a few keyframes to transition from the beginning of the wave to the end. This will produce a much smoother animation.

, Flash contains a function called tweening, which allows you to essentially set start- and end-points for your object. Flash will then move and transform the object based on your settings between these two points, creating the illusion of animation. You will not need to create images for every keyframe like you would with frame-by-frame animation.


Tweening is especially useful for creating ""morphing"" effects, where one object becomes another one over the course of the animation.
Frame-by-frame animation and tweening can be used in conjunction in the same movie.
You can only have one object undergoing a motion tween at a time. This means that if you want multiple objects to animate at once, they will all need to be on separate layers.

, Unlike frame-by-frame animation, you will not need to create multiple objects to animate using the tween function. Instead, you will be creating one object, and then changing its properties during the tweening process.


Before adding your image, create a basic background for your movie. Rename Layer 1 to ""Background"" and then lock the layer. Create a second layer and name it whatever you'd like. This will be the layer that you create your animation on.
It is highly-recommended that you use Flash's built-in design tools or import your image from a vector-drawing program. Vectors can scale easily without distortion, while traditional raster images will not scale and transform well.

, In order to tween your object, you will need to convert it into a symbol. This is the format for objects that Flash uses in order to manipulate them. If you try to tween an object that has not been made into a symbol, you will be prompted to do so first.


Right-click on your object and select ""Convert to Symbol"" The object will be added to your Library, which makes it easy to clone objects., A motion tween moves the object from one location to another Right-click the symbol in your scene and select ""Create Motion Tween"". 24 frames will be added to your timeline, as this is the default length of a tween. Remember, by default Flash will animate at 24 frames per second, meaning that this motion tween will take one second to complete.


When you create the motion tween, you are automatically moved to the last frame of the tween.

, Once you have created the tween, you can move the object to the location that you want it to end up at. Flash will display the trajectory line, which is dotted to show the location of the object for each frame of the tween.


When you first create the trajectory, it will be a straight line from the starting point to the ending point.

, If you ran your animation right now, your object would move along the trajectory, but your background would disappear after one frame. To fix this, you will need to extend your background across all the frames of the animation.


Select your background layer in the timeline. Click the last frame on your timeline, which should also be the frame your motion tween ends on. Press F5 to insert frames up to this point, which will keep your background displayed during the entirety of the tween.

, Adding keyframes to your trajectory will allow you to transform your object during the motion tween. You can only make changes to an object if it is keyframed. To add keyframes to your trajectory, first select the frame in the timeline that you want to turn into a keyframe. Then, click and drag the object into the position you want it to be at during that frame. Your trajectory will adjust automatically, and a keyframe will be added to the timeline. Keyframes are denoted by diamond icons in the timeline.

, To change the path of your object, you can click and drag each of the frame position markers on the path to a new location. Avoid putting to much variation in the path, or the object will move in an erratic fashion (unless this is your goal!)., Once you have your keyframes and trajectory established, you can transform your object so that it changes as it moves through the motion tween trajectory. You can change the shape, color, rotation, size, and any other property of the object.Select the frame that you want the transformation to occur in.
Open the object's Properties panel. You can press Ctrl+F3 if the panel is not currently visible.
Change any values in the Properties window to affect the object. For example, you can change the hue or color, add filters, or change the scale.
You can also use the Free Transform tool to freely change the shape however you'd like.

, Test your motion tween by pressing Ctrl+↵ Enter. Ensure that the transformations look good and that the animation is moving at the correct speed. If your animation is moving too fast, you can either lower the FPS of the scene or increase the tween span.


By default, the FPS is 24, so try lowering it to 12. To do so, click outside the scene and then change the FPS in the Properties panel. Changing it to 12 will double the length of your animation, but may make it more ""jerky"".
To change your tween span, select the layer that contains the tween and use the slider to pull it out. If you want the tween to be twice as long, extend it to 48 frames. Make sure to insert blank frames in your background layer so that the background doesn't disappear halfway through the animation. To extend the background, select the layer, click the last frame of the animation in the timeline, and then press F5


, You can add sound effects to actions that occur in your animation to help make it stand out and give it some personality. Music makes your animation more immersive, and can make a good animation into an incredible one. Flash supports a variety of file formats, including AAC, MP3, WAV, and AU. Choose the on that gives you the best quality for the lowest file size.


MP3 will typically give you perfectly acceptable sound quality while keeping the file size to a minimum. Avoid WAV files if possible, as these are often quite large.

, Before you can add sounds to your project, they need to be added to Flash's Library. This will allow you to quickly add them to your project later. Click File → Import → Import to Library. Browse for the sound file on your computer. Make sure that the sound file has an easy to remember name, so you can quickly find it from the menu later.

, This is not strictly necessary, as you can add sound to existing layers, but putting each file on its own layer will give you much more control over fading in and out, when to start and stop, and it is easier to move sounds around.

, On the sound's layer, select the frame in the animation that you want the sound to start at. Press F7 to insert a blank keyframe. For example, if you want to include a music file that plays for the duration of the animation, select the first frame on the music file's layer. If you are adding dialog for a character, select the frame where the character begins talking.

, In the Properties frame, you will see a Sound section. You may need to expand it to see the options. Click the ""Name"" menu and select the file you want from your Library.

, Once you've selected a file, you can configure how it will play. What you select will be based on what you need the sound to accomplish in the animation. You can change the Effect, the Sync, and the Repeat settings of each sound using the menu underneath the Name menu in the Properties frame.


Effect - This lets add effects to the sound, such as fading in and out or adding echo. You can select from preset settings in the drop-down menu, or you can click the pencil icon next to the menu to create your own custom settings.
Sync - This determines how the song is played in the animation. Event will play the sound until it is finished. If the same sound is triggered again before the first one ends, the the original will keep playing until it finishes. Start works like Event, but stops if the sound plays again. Stop stops the sound in that frame. If you want to use this in conjunction with other sound properties, create a new keyframe where you want the sound to stop and use this option. Stream will attempt to match the sound that is playing with the number of frames on other layers. This is best used for dialogue.
Repeat - This setting allows you to set how long the sound repeats. You can set it to play only once, or have it loop as many times as you want. If your animation is a looping animation, you should set your music to loop infinitely.

, When you are finally finished with your project, save it as an SWF file. This is the format used to play the movie. You can play it in virtually any web browser, or use a dedicated Flash player to watch it. There are also a variety of sites that you can upload it to for others to see, such as Newgrounds, Albino Blacksheep and Kongregate.

, This guide addresses the basics of creating an animation, but there is so much more you can learn and do. Add a few buttons and branching paths, and you've got a choose-your-own-adventure game. You can take a crash course in ActionScript and gain much more control over the finer details of your animation. Keep experimenting, and you'll soon find yourself learning all kinds of tricks and implementations.

These videos are Flash objects, but cannot be accessed the same way that a normally-embedded Flash object can. If you are trying to save a flash movie but cannot find the actual SWF file for the video, you are probably trying to access an RTMP stream.

, There are a few programs that specialize in capturing the streams for RTMP files. Some of the more popular programs include:


Replay Media Capture
StreamTransport

, Most of these programs will attempt to install browser plugins and toolbars that can slow down your web browsing experience. Make sure to disable and decline any extra installations during the program’s setup.


These programs are notoriously finicky and there is a chance that they will not work with your particular system setup or with the specific video you are trying to capture., RTMP capture programs must be running before you load the video. They will automatically begin capturing the playback when the video starts.

, After a moment, the stream should appear in your RTMP capturing program. You will need to play the entire video in the browser in order for the whole thing to be captured.

, Once you are done streaming, select the appropriate file in your RTMP capture program and save it wherever you’d like on your computer. There will likely be several options to pick from in the capture program, due to ads that are often played with videos. Inspect the file details to see the length, which will help you determine which of the files is the correct one.

, You may need to use a specialized video player to watch the videos after saving them. VLC player and Media Player Classic are two of the most popular free options available.

Once you're in Photoshop, go to ""File"" and then ""Import."",
Check the appropriate selections under ""Range To Import"".,
Go to ""Window"" and check ""Animation."",
Go the bottom left on the animation frames and check ""Forever."",
Go to the ""Rectangle marquee tool"" on the upper left of the left toolbar.,
Reduce the image size of the video.,
Go to ""File"" and click on "" Save for Web & Devices."",
Change the setting to ""GIF"" to make sure it's animated.",How to Make an Animated GIF from a Video in Photoshop CS5," Click on ""Video Frames to Layers"" (This can only be done in Photoshop version CS5 (32 bits) or newer versions. Mac users do this by going to going to Finder-->Applications-->Photoshop CS5-->Photoshop CS5 right click and select get info. There should be a check box there to open in 32 bits).


Select your video and click on ""Load"". Make sure that it is a video that can play in Photoshop. The formats supported are .MOV, .AVI, .MPG, .MPEG, and .MP4.;
, To select only a few frames, check ""Selected Frames Only."" This option will allow your GIF to be converted much faster. The size/layers will also be smaller so that you can easily edit the GIF. If you do this, move the slider in the video to your starting point, then hold shift and drag towards the ending point to ensure that a section has been highlighted.


Your video will now be converted into layers so you can make it into a GIF.
If you have a high frame rate video (over 60 frames per second) then check ""Limit to Every frames"" and type a number in place of 'x'.
This will select every 'x'th frame which will make conversion faster and image size lower (and lower quality) by dividing frame rate by 'x'. You would want a frame rate of around 15-30.
Then continue by clicking 'OK'

,


Go to the animation area and trim any unnecessary frames until your animation is looking the way you want it. This is also the time to add any new frames. Remember that if the amount of frames is low, the size will be smaller and it will take less time to load when you post it on a website.
Check the time of the animation as shown on the screenshot at the right. Bigger numbers means slower animations that run less smoothly.

, This will ensure you that the animation will loop forever.

, Make a selection on the section you want to focus on. Go to ""Image"" and click on ""crop"". This will reduce the image to only the that was highlighted as your area of focus.

, To do this go to ""Image,"" then ""Image Size"" and choose the new dimensions. It's recommended that you pick out the right size as doing otherwise could make your GIF look odd. You generally want to choose half the dimensions of the original GIF.


Go to ""Image"" and click on ""Crop."" This will crop unnecessary space from the picture and will lay focus on your subject of the animation.
Add or make any final changes. Your animation should be done now.

, This will optimize your image.

, Look to see if the animation appears correct in your browser by clicking ""Preview"" at the left bottom. If you want to change anything, you can always click "" Cancel"" and go back to Photoshop. *Note that the settings in the GIF menu apply compression. A lower file size will load faster in a browser but may look bad. Gif compresses by throwing away colours as you can see if you experiment with the settings. It's useful to choose ""2 up"" on the upper tabs of the save for web dialog box. This allows a view of ""before and after"" and includes a preview with a file size.


If everything looks fine, click on ""Save."" Fill in the file name and save it.

Zoom in on your image.,
Select the eye using the magnetic lasso tool.,
Feather your selection.,
Select the ‘unsharp mask’ tool.,
Adjust the contrast.,
Repeat the process with the other eye, being careful to use the same levels/numbers as you did on the first eye.,
Finished! ",How to Make Eyes Pop in Photoshop1," Use the magnify tool to zoom in on your image, focusing on one eye at a time. This will make it easier to focus on your work, and to see the detail of the changes you are making.;
, The magnetic lasso tool is a selection tool that allows you to select a rough outline of a shape, and it ‘magnetically’ selects the surrounding image to create a smooth, even selection. This is much easier than using the regular lasso tool, as you don’t have to draw perfect lines in order to get the whole eye selected. Click the magnetic lasso tool on your sidebar, and then carefully outline the shape of the iris (only the colored part of the eye).

, The feather tool allows you to blend an edited and an unedited portion of an image, so that any changes you make to a small area won’t be so harsh. You can find the ‘feather’ tool on the layer tab on the top menu bar. Change the number in the feather box to ‘10’ - you can play around with this number to see what you prefer, though.

, At the top menu bar, select the ‘Filter’ tab, and scroll down to the ‘unsharp mask’ tool. This tool, although it may sound like the opposite, works to sharpen the iris and bring out the details and color in the image. Once you click the button, you have the ability to adjust the settings on the mask. Change the ‘radius’ to 3.6, and the ‘threshold’ to 0. Then, move the ‘amount’ slider to adjust the total amount of sharpening you do. Play around with this until you find a happy medium that you like.


Keep in mind that less is more; sharpening the eye too much might take the realism out of the image.

, The last thing you can do to finish up your project is to slightly adjust the contrast. Select the contrast tool from the photo editing tab at the top menu bar, and move the slider (or change the number) to alter the contrast. A little goes a long ways with this tool, so be careful that you don’t overdo it.

, When you think you’re done, zoom out to make sure the overall image is enhanced and doesn’t look too cartoonish.

You can search for objects by a number of criteria: New General Catalogue (NGC) numbers, IPPPSSOOT names, proposal IDs, location, and even names such as ""Eagle Nebula"" which are referenced against the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED)or the SIMBAD Astronomical Databasewhen necessary.

,, These cameras give the best images for compositing into coloured final products.

,, This should return 62 results.

,, You can expand an image by clicking ""Interactive Display"" under a thumbnail., The second last item in the name (f814) is the filter used to take the image. The item directly before it (wfpc2) designates it was taken with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2.

, The three images will later be combined to each represent one of the three colours in an RGB (Red, Green Blue) image.


An example of a good set of filters would be WFPC2 F450W (Blue), WFPC2 F555W (Green), and WFPC2 F814W (Red).

,, Download and install either the Windows or Mac version depending on your operating system.

, For now, select hst_05237_02_wfpc2_f814w_wf_drz.fits.

, Play with some of the buttons and notice the changes to the image preview.

,, Find the ""Stretch"" drop-down which contains a number of pre-sets and select Log(Log(x)).

, Change the file name to match the filter (for example, save hst_05237_02_wfpc2_f814w_wf_drz.fits as f814.tif).

,, For now, use f814w.tif and call the layer f814w.

, In Photoshop you can use File -> Place to accomplish this easily (be sure to rasterize the placed images).

,,,, Then hide it by clicking the eye beside the layer name.

,,,,,, Then use the crop tool to loose everything else. You may need to rotate your selection or all three layers to get the region you want––just remember that all three layers must remain selected so that you don't undo your work from above.

,,,, It should automatically set the size to the size of the image you copied; the only thing you need to change is the bit depth of the image from 16bit to 8bit and the name of the image to the name of the layer you copied. (If you copied the layer called f814w, call the image f814w.)

,, At this point you can close the original three layer image.

,,, If the merge option is greyed out, your images are either not flattened or are not 8 Bits. You can fix this in the Image -> Mode menu.

,, For this guide, it should be Red: 814, Green: 555, Blue: 336.

,


The outcome of the image will be affected by the filters chosen, and the settings used in FITS Liberator.

,


Play with your results and you can make something truly beautiful. The image to the right is of NGC 6357 and was made using WFC F658N for blue, WFC F660N for red, and an average of the two for green using the same method with heavy post-processing.

Gradient controls are represented by an icon shaped like a box with color fading from black to white. Click this and apply a gradient of your choosing.;
, Resolution is a matter of preference, but a closer view will allow for greater precision. To change your color mode to RGB, click on ""Image"" from your menu bar, and ""Modes"" from the submenu. Here you should be able to choose your desired color mode., Apply a gradient to your new layer by using your gradient tool again. This time, use the gradient editor and select two variations of blue such as midnight blue and royal blue or dark blue and sky blue to be applied to your new layer.


New layers can be created or adjusted through the Layers Panel, accessible from the submenu under the ""Windows"" heading on your main menu bar, or through the hotkeys Ctrl+⇧ Shift+N.Take care to keep the topmost part of your layer the part with the darker blue.

, Now that you've got your colors and layers ready, you can have Photoshop render clouds. From the main menu bar, click through: Filter → Render → Clouds. This will create your clouds.

, Type in the shortcut Ctrl+L to make the Levels dialog box to appear. Here you should change the levels of the clouds by adjusting each of the three of the arrows evenly through the middle of the distribution.

Start Photoshop and create a new document by typing CTRL+N.,
Add the front and side of the Box.,
Align the front and side.,
Distort the front and side.,
Move the box.,
Add a box shadow to the document.,
Click Image>Adjustments>Hue/Saturation.,
Make some minor adjustments to the box, so that it doesn't show a shadow, because our box has a shadow, and the shadow on the box, just doesn't look right.,
Fix the fact that the document is much bigger than the box.,
Look at and use your finished product.",How to Create a Product Box in Photoshop," To have plenty of space to work with, for ""Name:"" enter ProductBox, ""Width:"" enter 600, for ""Height:"" enter 600, ""Resolution:"" enter 72, and ""Background Contents:"" enter White. Click ""OK."";
,


Create a front and side for the product box as separate documents, or open the front and side images downloaded from the ""Things You'll Need"" section below. For this How-to, the images being used are the downloaded images. If you want to create your own front and side, download the images from below and use them as a starting point for your own images.
Activate the product_box_front document by clicking its toolbar. Press CTRL+A to select the entire document, and then CTRL+C to copy the contents of the document.
Activate the ProductBox document we just created by clicking its toolbar. Type CTRL+V to paste the front of the box into the document.
Activate the product_box_side document by clicking its toolbar. Type CTRL+A to select the entire document, and then CTRL+C to copy the contents of the document.
Activate the ProductBox document we created, and type CTRL+V to paste the side of the box into the document. You can now close the front and side of the box documents, you don't need them anymore. Our new ProductBox document should look something like this:

Notice the front and the side of the box are sitting on top of each other. We're going to fix that.

, Now we are going to move the front and side of the box in place, and then distort them to give the box a 3D look.


Give the layers some names. In the Layers Palette, right click the layer that contains the front of our box and select Layer Properties. Change Name: to Front. Now do the same for the layer that contains the side of our box, and change the name to Side.
Click on the Front layer in the Layers Palette. Type V to make sure the Move tool is open. Inside the document, drag and move the front of our box to the right till the front is nearly to the edge of the document.
Click on the Side layer in the Layers Palette. Inside the document, drag the side of the box till it's lined up with the left edge of the front of the box. Your document should now look like this:
If the two layers are lined up correctly, then the front and the side should look like one flat image.


Making sure the Side layer is selected in the Layers Palette, click Image>Adjustments>Brightness/Contrast. Set the Brightness to -20. Since the light is supposed to be striking the product box from the front, the side of the box should be a bit darker than the front.


, This is the tricky part. We need to distort the front and the side of the box using the Distort tool.


Click the Front layer in the Layers Palette. Now click Edit>Transform>Distort. This creates a distort box around the front of the box. Grab the square handle on the top right corner, and drag it down about 150 pixels.
Grab the square handle on the bottom right corner, and drag it up about 150 pixels.
Grab the square handle on the center right side, and drag it in about 200 pixels. Make sure the right side of the front is straight. Adjust the corner handles a little bit to straighten out the side if you need to. Now hit ENTER to confirm the distortion. Your document should now look like this:
If your image doesn't look pretty close to this, distort the image more until you achieve the right effect.


Now we need to distort the side of the box. Click the Side layer in the Layers Palette. Click Edit>Transform>Distort. This creates the same kind of distort box around the side.
Grab the upper left corner square handle, and drag it down about 75 pixels. Now grab the bottom left corner square handle, and drag it up about 75 pixels. We don't want the box to look as deep as it does, so grab the left center side handle and drag it in about 150 pixels. Hit ENTER to confirm the distortion. Your image should now look like this:

If your image doesn't look pretty close to this, distort the side a bit more until you achieve the right effect.

,


Click the Front layer in the Layers Palette. We want to link the Front and Side layer, so that if you move one, they both move. So click the small box next to the layer name on the Side layer.
This shows a little ""chain link"" in the box. This means the two layers are linked together.


Use the move tool(V) to move the box up into the right hand corner of the document. Now when we move the Front layer, the Side layer follows with it. Your document should now look like this:
If your document doesn't look pretty close to this, move the box a bit more until you get the right position.



,


Click and hold down the left mouse button on the Front layer, and drag the layer down to the New Layer icon at the bottom of the Layers Palette.This creates a copy of the Front layer named Front Copy.


, Set ""Lightness"" to -100.


Click ""OK."" This makes your Front Copy layer completely black. Now move the Front Copy layer below the Front layer. Do this by left clicking and holding down the Front Copy layer, and drag it below the Front layer. Now you can't see the Front Copy layer because its behind the Front layer. Right click the Front Copy layer and select ""Layer Properties."" Rename this layer to ""Box Shadow.""
Click ""Edit"">""Transform"">""Distort"" with the Box Shadow layer selected. We are going to distort this layer so that it looks like a shadow being cast behind the box. Drag the top left corner handle down until its level with the side of the box. Now drag the top right corner square handle until the back of the Box Shadow layer is running at the same angle as the bottom of the box. Now drag the bottom right corner handle until it meets the bottom right corner of the box. Make any adjustments to the corners until it looks ""right"". Hit ENTER to confirm the distortion. Your image should now look like this:


, We need to make some minor adjustments.


Click Filters>Blur>Gaussian Blur. Set ""Radius"" to 10.

Click ""OK.""
Make sure the Box Shadow layer is selected, and set the Opacity to 50% in the Layers Palette.


, Crop the document just a bit until its just as big as the product box.


Type C to open the Crop tool. This tool works a bit like the Square Marquee tool. Draw a box around the entire product box including the shadow. You should now see a dark area around the image, with the inside light box being just as big as the product box and shadow.

You can adjust the size of the crop by dragging the square handles in and out. Once you are satisfied, hit ENTER to confirm the crop.

, That's it, you're done! Your final image should look something like this:

, If your camera has a ""bracketing mode"", set the camera to take at least three shots with at least a stop of exposure difference., Attach it to the camera and start composing your shot., If the camera has a bracketing mode, take the three bracketed photos. If the camera is not on a tripod, try and hold the camera as still as possible.

If there is too much camera shake, Lightroom will not be able to align the images when blending them. 

, If the camera doesn't not have a bracketing mode, you will have to manually bracket your photos.

Raise each photo's exposure by a stop, starting with the underexposed photo. If you are not using a bracketing mode or a tripod, be very careful when recomposing each shot after adjusting the exposure. There is a lot of room for error when not using a tripod and manually adjusting the exposure.

, Make sure to import all the photos into a single folder so they are easy to select.

, A menu will appear with multiple options. Put your mouse over the ""Photo Merge"" option. Another box will appear with two options. Click on the ""HDR..."" option.

, If you took your bracketed images without a tripod, you should enable this setting. It will attempt to align your photos to correct for hand shake.
The second setting is ""Auto Tone"". Don't click this option. It will edit the HDR image for you. We are going to edit the image ourselves to obtain the best results possible.
The last setting is ""Deghost Amount"". The more movement in a scene, like trees or clouds moving, the higher you should set the deghosting setting.

, Then click the ""Merge"" button on the bottom of the window. This will start the blending process.

The more settings that were selected before merging, the longer it will take to create your final HDR image. The final image, that will be ready for editing, will be in the same folder the bracketed images were imported into.

, Editing HDR images isn't an exact science because every image is different. There are some rules to follow that will help create realistic and natural looking images.

, If it's to far to the left, the picture is too dark and the exposure should be raised. If the histogram is too far to the right, it is to bright and and the exposure of the shot should be lowered.





, This is going to increase the dynamic range of the photograph which will increase the detail in the shadows and highlights of the image., This should start making the image look more natural., When adjusting the sliders the picture will go black or white depending on the slider you are adjusting. Adjust the sliders until you see a change in the image.

Some color will appear telling you that part is absolute white or absolute black depending on the slider you are adjusting. Once you see a little but of color, leave the slider there and check the image. This should help the image to look more natural.

, Move the slider in small increments and pay attention to how it changes the image. It can bring more detail to certain parts of the image like the sky, but can also create ghosting and artifacts that will make the image look unnatural., To finish, look at you final image and tweak any sliders that might need changing.

, Punch out the ID card insert after printing and laminate using a butterfly pouch. If you are trying to create ID cards that are the same thickness as professionally printed PVC cards (30 mil) you will need to use 10 mil butterfly pouches. Print@Home kits include laminators with the necessary heating capacity to laminate these thick pouches. Kits using Artisyn synthetic papers create ID cards that look exactly like professionally printed PVC cards.

, The cards are then printed in high definition on durable PVC composite cards from a Fargo printer and mailed next day.

Apply for a data entry contract that has on the job training.,
Apply for a data entry certificate or diploma program.,
Apply for a specialized medical or legal data entry associate's degree.,
Gain experience from taking a variety of different data entry jobs.",How to Learn Data Entry2," As a first job in the data entry profession, you may find an employer who is willing to train you over a period of months to use a specific type of software. These jobs are often low-paying, so you may want to supplement job training with other certificates.

, Research online programs that range from 1-subject certificates to 2-year associate's degrees. Look for the following courses to be included in your program.


A data processing course. In order to complete this course you will need to type at least 25 WPM. You will learn how to type and format for maximum organization and efficiency.
A Microsoft course. Students should learn how to work with all aspects of the basic window's system, including Word, Excel, Access and even PowerPoint.
A bookkeeping course. This course trains students in how to keep track of basic financial data and formulas on spreadsheets. It will teach computations and organized tracking.
A computer computation course. This similar course teaches more advanced computer and software calculations that could be used with many software programs. After basic math, this will give you enough math knowledge to work in data entry.

, These 2 industries have specific language, terms and needs. Many law and medical data entry jobs will require a qualification or applicable experience.


Advanced medical data entry is called medical billing and medical coding. This usually requires an associate's degree and it can significantly increase your job prospects and pay. Medical coders and billers learn the information needed to submit medical procedures to insurance companies.
Legal data entry is valuable to the still growing legal profession. You may be called upon to transcribe complicated legal documents at an office or at home. Seek an associate's degree in order to be eligible for legal data entry.

, In order to work from home or garner a higher salary, you must have a proven record of accurate, speedy work. If you have the basic qualifications to work in data entry, work experience may be enough to help you learn other necessary skills.


For example, audio transcription may not require extra training. However, by taking a few speech, focus group or dictation transcription jobs, you may be able to increase your WPM and make more money.

Try logging in as root with the default password.,
Try common passwords.,
Use a password auditing tool.You can use a variety of tools to try thousands of dictionary words and letter/number/symbol combinations by brute force until the password is cracked.",How to Hack a Database2," Some databases don’t have a root (admin) password by default, so you may be able to get in leaving the password field empty. Some others have default passwords that can be found easily by searching database tech support forums.

, If the admin secured the account with a password (a likely situation), try common username/password combinations. Some hackers publicly post lists of passwords they’ve cracked while using auditing tools. Try some different username and password combinations.


A reputable site with collected password lists is https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords.
Trying passwords by hand can be time-consuming, but there’s no harm in giving it a shot before breaking out the big guns.

,


Tools like DBPwAudit (for Oracle, MySQL, MS-SQL and DB2) and Access Passview (for MS Access) are popular password auditing tools that can be run against most databases.You can also search Google for newer password auditing tools specifically for your database. For instance, a search for password audit tool oracle db if you’re hacking an Oracle database.
If you have an account on the server that hosts the database, you can run a hash cracker like John the Ripper against the database’s password file. The location of the hash file is different depending on the database.Only download from sites that you can trust. Research tools extensively before using them.

Another site with exploits is www.exploit-db.com. Go to their website and click the Search link, then search for the type of database you want to hack (for example, “oracle”). Type the Captcha code in the provided square and search.
Be sure you research all exploits you plan to try so you know what to do in case of potential issues.

, Wardriving is technically legal. Doing something illegal from a network you find while wardriving is not.

, If you’re doing something you’re not supposed to be doing, it’s probably not a good idea to do it from your own network. Connect wirelessly to one of the open networks you found while wardriving and run the exploit you’ve researched and chosen.

The colours usually reflect what your phrase will be. The page colour is changeable, though, so don't worry too much.

Open one of these programs from your desktop. You can do this by clicking on the start button, then clicking on All Programs > Microsoft Office > Microsoft PowerPoint / Microsoft Word.;
, This button is in the same place for both PowerPoint and Word.

, A small window will pop up with the various types of graphics that you can insert into your presentation or document, depending on the the program you chose earlier. To explore all the variations of Smart Art, follow the next seven steps. If you do not want to do this,(although it is highly recommended if you have never used the SmartArt feature before) skip down to the Tips section of this article.

, Lists are the most basic forms of SmartArt. They are intended for information that does not have a specific order.

, Processes are a slightly more sophisticated form of SmartArt. They show a sequence of steps or events. The designs are quite similar to the ones in the Lists category, but they contain directional arrows, similar to the ones in a flow chart.

, Cycles are more similar to Processes than to Lists, however while they contain arrows like a Process, most graphics in this category have a circular pattern that never ends, similar to the concept of evaporation and condensation. Processes have a strict beginning and end, or cause and effect.

, Hierarchies are unique in the sense that they are unlike Lists, Processes or Cycles. An appropriate use of a Hierarchy graphic would be a family tree or a display of various company positions. It shows various ""parent"" pieces of data that can represent an ""umbrella,"" like the term ""mammal."" These serve as broad titles for more specific names that are classified in the ""umbrella term."" In this case, a more specific word would be ""cat"" or ""dog."" You can have various levels in the hierarchy until the terms become more specific.

, Relationship graphics are simple: they explain how two pieces of data are connected. They are the explanation behind the arrow in the flow chart.

, The purpose of a Matrix graphic is extremely similar to one of a Relationship graphic; it is simply meant for more data. Most designs contain 3-5 boxes of supporting data surrounding a central data space, meant for a title or ""umbrella"" term.

, The Pyramid graphics are for comparing amounts of data. An appropriate situation for the Pyramid graphic to be used is a dietary guide, like the Food Pyramid.

Match case. Check this option to look only for text typed in the same case as what you typed in the ""Find what:"" field. Checking this box will force the search to ignore ""Match"" and ""MATCH"" when you type in ""match.""
Match whole words only. Check this option to look only for a text string when it appears in a word by itself, not when it appears as part of another word. Checking this box means that the string ""match"" will be ignored when it appears in such words as ""matching"" or ""matchless.""
Sounds like. Check this option to find homophones of the word you typed in. If you typed in ""fair,"" this option would also find instances of ""fare.""
Find all word forms. Check this option to find singular, plural, present tense, past tense, and participle forms of the word you're searching for. If you check this option, typing ""matched"" will also find ""match"" and ""matching.""
Ignore punctuation characters. Check this option to ignore the distinction between words with punctuation in them and words without it. If you check this option, typing ""can't"" (contraction of ""can not"") will also find ""cant"" (a synonym for ""angle"").
Ignore white space characters. Check this option to ignore intervening spaces between characters in the text string.

If you want to work with the entire document, do nothing.

,, The ""Use wildcards"" checkbox is found with the other search options. If you don't see the box, click ""More >>"" to display the search options.

, Wildcard characters replace 1 or more regular characters in your search text. You can type the character directly or select it from a list by clicking ""Special"" and selecting it from 1 of the options at the top of the dropdown list. A list of wildcards is given below:


Question mark (?). The question mark wildcard represents a single character. You can type ""r?t"" to find all 3-letter words that begin with ""r"" and end with ""t,"" such as ""rat,"" ""rot,"" and ""rut.""
Asterisk (*). The asterisk wildcard represents a string of 1 or more characters. You can type ""r*t"" to find all words that begin with ""r"" and end with ""t,"" such as ""rat,"" ""rot,"" ""rut,"" ""rant,"" ""rest,"" ""rivet,"" ""resist,"" and ""restaurant.""
Brackets (). The brackets wildcard represents 1 of a possible list of characters. You type the list of characters between the brackets; anything outside the brackets is presumed to be the beginning or ending of the text string. Typing ""rt"" will find ""rat"" and ""rot,"" but not ""rut."" To specify a range of characters, place a hyphen (-) between the first and last character, which must be specified in ascending order. Typing ""at"" will find ""rat,"" ""sat,"" and ""tat.""
Braces ({ }). The braces wildcard represents repeated appearances of the character it is placed after. Typing a single number finds that number of occurrences of the character, so that typing ""des{2}ert"" finds ""dessert"" but not ""desert."" Typing a number followed by a comma means to look for at least 1 occurrence of that character, so that typing ""des{1,}ert"" will find both ""desert"" and ""dessert."" Typing a number followed by a comma and then another number defines a range of times the character appears; typing ""7{1,3}"" will find 7, 77, and 777.
At sign (@). The at sign wildcard represents 1 or more appearances of the character preceding it. Typing ""be@t"" finds both ""bet"" and ""beet."" (This is the same as typing ""be{1,}t."")
Less-than sign (<). The less-than sign wildcard represents the beginning of a word. You type this wildcard, followed by a text string in parentheses. Typing ""<(out)"" will find ""outermost"" and ""outlying,"" but not ""about"" or ""router.""
Greater-than sign (>). The greater-than sign wildcard represents the end of a word. You type this wildcard, followed by a text string in parentheses. Typing "">(end)"" will find ""bend,"" ""rend,"" ""fiend,"" ""friend,"" but not ""endless"" or ""tender.""
Not sign (!). The not sign wildcard can be used by itself or with other wildcards to indicate that the character or range it precedes is not to be found in the search results. Typing ""r!(a)t"" will find 3-letter words that begin with ""r"" and end with ""t"" other than ""rat,"" such as ""rot"" and ""rut."" Typing ""at"" will find all 3-letter words that do not begin with ""r,"" ""s,"" or ""t"" but end with ""at,"" such as ""bat,"" ""cat, ""eat,"" ""fat,"" ""hat,"" ""mat,"" and ""vat.""
Backslash (\). The backslash serves 2 purposes. When followed by a number, you can use it to reorder items. For example, you can change the Vietnamese name ""Tran Dien"" to its American form, ""Dien Tran,"" throughout your document by typing ""(Tran) (Dien)"" in the ""Find what:"" field and ""\2 \1"" in the ""Replace with:"" field. The other way to use the backslash is to put it in front of any of the wildcard characters to flag Word that you are searching for the punctuation marks instead of using them as wildcard characters.
Parentheses. Use parentheses to group text characters to be operated on by the wildcard, as noted above for the less-than and greater-than sign wildcards and also to note which wildcard should be evaluated first. Typing ""<(be)*(ed)>"" will find all words that begin with ""be"" and end with ""ed,"" such as ""bedecked,"" ""bejeweled,"" and ""besotted.""

If you have done it correctly, you should be able to type in your abbreviation, as many times as you like, hitting the space bar each time, without expansion, but if you hit your chosen expansion key, you'll have the abbreviation expand immediately.",How to Type in Shorthand With WordPerfect2," A problem with having the expansion attached to space bar is that you often will think up a good abbreviation, but can't use it because it is a ""proper"" word and it can expand unexpectedly into something different. An example would be a simple, logical system for abbreviation for days of the week/months of the year. Use the first three letter. Except words like Mar (March), Jan (January), Wed (Wednesday), Sun (Sunday) etc will spoil the system.

, If your abbreviation for ""march"" is ""mar"" typing ""mar"" will give you ""march"" but typing ""Mar"" will expand to ""March"", unless at the beginning of a sentence, in which case it will always expand to ""March"".)


Note: The QuickCorrect file is attached to the Language of the document in ""Tools>Settings"". This means that you can create many different ""libraries"" of QC abbreviations, and use the same abbreviation for different expanded functions, simply by changing the Language.

, In WordPerfect, unlike MS Word, it is possible to remove the expansion from the space bar and assign it to a key of your choice. To accomplish this you will need to know about (a) macros and (b) keyboard maps. A macro is in effect a ""mini program"" created by the user to do repetitive or difficult tasks simply. A keyboard map is an on-screen text listing of what each keystroke/ combination (eg F12, Shift F10, Ctrl H etc) has attached to it, if anything. To view the keyboard map (you are able to have as many different maps as you wish):


Click on ""Settings"" (as above).
Choose ""Keyboards"". Select your desired keyboard and click on ""Edit"".
On the left is the list of keystrokes, on the right are the Category/Features, as well as various tabs. By use these tabs you can (a) assign a function/feature to a key combination (b) assign text/keystroke (c) assign a program or (d) assign a macro to the key combination.

, Press Ctrl F10. Assign a name to the macro.

, When you are finished press Ctrl F10 again.


To execute or run the macro, press Alt F10 and type the macro name and hit Enter.

, Before you start, ensure that in the QuickCorrect function the ""Replace Words as You Type"" box is NOT checked. (This means that you can type the abbreviation as often as you like without it expanding.)

, Press Ctrl F10. Name the macro (for example, ""expand"")

, Check the ""Replace Words as You Type Button"".

, Hit the space bar (this will cause your abbreviation to expand).

,, (This is because you are no longer using the space bar to expand the abbreviation.)

,, This should result in your abbreviation expanding to ""calculation"" (or whatever).

, Select your macro. It should read something like this:


Application (WordPerfect; ""WordPerfect""; Default!; ""EN"")
QuickCorrect (State: On!)
Type (Text: "" "")

QuickCorrect (State: Off!)
DeleteCharPrevious ()


Note: At the end of the first line the expression ""EN"" will vary, depending upon what version of WordPerfect you are using.

,

, Using this macro doesn't make much sense if it takes more keystrokes to execute than it saves typing, so it will be assigned to a single key. Choosing which key is pretty important as choosing a ""bad"" key will make your hands work unnecessarily hard. This key will have an existing function attached to it, but you can re-assign it to a different combination (for example, the ""Alt"" keystroke). This ""good"" key can actually vary on different keyboards, as not all keyboards have exactly the same layout.


Note: Previously we created a button with the ""QuickCorrect"" function in the menu bar. You should now do the same with the ""Keyboard"" function.

, Click on your Keyboard button. Choose your keyboard map and click on edit.

,,, Return to your document.

,


Important Note. Very Important. For the third time, very important. If you use WordPerfect's spelling checker you MUST select the Option ""Prompt Before Auto Replacement"" prior to using the spell checker for the first time. Failure to do this will result in any abbreviations in the text of the document being expanded. The good news is that this option is a ""set and forget"" and only needs to be done once. That is - Until you (a) reinstall WordPerfect or (b) move to a different computer with WP installed.
Note: Your QC abbreviations are stored in a file with the extension *.uwl (User Word List) which, along with any of your template files (*.wpt) are all you need to copy to bring all these functions with you.

Keep the ""Alt"" function for letters, for example, Alt A, Alt B etc, free to assign ""secondary"" abbreviations, such as abbreviations which are specific to a particular topic or type of work, for example, medical, legal etc.

",How to Type in Shorthand With WordPerfect3," This consists of creating ""hot keys"" with partial or complete words. These hotkeys should be given priority over some of the existing ones such as Bold Face (Alt B etc), as they are already assigned to F (Function) keys, or can be.


Some examples: Ctrl A ""ation"", Ctrl B ""because"", Ctrl J ""just"", Ctrl H ""that"". What your own list will be like will depend entirely on your own work and your own typing.

Eg To assign ""ation"" to Ctrl A.



,, Scroll down to Ctrl A.

, Type ""ation"", click on ""assign keystrokes to key"".


OK.

, Use the same styles to color other text, as you would for this WordArt text. Just be sure the WordArt piece has been selected, before you begin to select your color. If you do end up selecting your color, you'll be selecting a font color for any additional text near the insertion ""I"" point on the screen.


Learn how to copy the piece of WordArt to an alternate location, if you'd like. Use the Copy and Paste technique to copy and paste the item from one area to another, through the use of Windows clipboard (which is where all copy and pasted items are temporarily stored).

Page Layout: This tab is mostly there for adding the final touch to your document and fixing it a little. You can change the orientation, the size of your document, and pretty much you can do things you normally can't do basically.







References: This tab is for inserting references. For example, adding citations, a table of contents, footnotes, bibliography, captions, etc.







Mailings: This tab is for making envelopes and labels, starting a mail merge (sending the same document to different people),







Review: This tab is for things like spelling and grammar, translating, a dictionary, a thesaurus, adding a comment, etc.







View: This tab has something to do with how your document looks like. It's sort of similar to Page Layout, except it's more of adjusting things, like zoom in, zoom out, etc.







Format: This tab only applies with pictures, clip art, word art, or photos. This tab is for adjusting the image(s) and text, like changing the brightness, contrast, effect, color, etc.

"
Create a cover page.,
Decide if you want a table of contents.,
Create sections and section breaks.,
Add content.,
Decide on whether or not to add tables.,
Add graphs and charts (graphics).,
Do some formatting.,
Include columns.,
Margins.,

You should now be done, reread your document, go to the Review ribbon, and click Spelling and Grammar, Update the Table of Contents, make sure everything is in order and looks good.,
Now that your document is finished and you have set the properties, you are done.

",How to Use Microsoft Word 2007 to Create a Professional Looking Document," On the ribbon labeled Insert, look at the section marked 'Pages'. Click Cover-Page, and select one. When deciding which to select, think, 'What type of paper am I writing?' Choose a cover page that fits well with your document, so if it is a wordy essay, a more empty and colorless page usually be best.;
, Use for longer papers, or documents with sectional content. On the References ribbon, go to the section labeled 'Table of Contents' and click on Table of Contents. Choose one of the preset ones or create your own hitting the insert table of contents button. This will open up a dialog box and will give you several options. Set them to whatever you wish, and then hit enter. It will not have anything yet, but that's okay, because you can update it automatically once you have finished.

, This works well with the Table of Contents, and makes your document easier to use, for either a printed document or an online one. On the Page Layout ribbon, in the page setup tab, click on 'Breaks', this will give you a drop-down menu of options. The menu has a divide, saying section breaks. Choose the one that you feel would work best, and you now have that break. Now go to the home ribbon, and in the Styles tab, select Heading 1. Use a different heading for sub-categories. Now just type the section title, and you have your new section. A cool way to see your section made is to go to the View ribbon, and in the Show/Hide tab, click document map. This will open a sidebar, which can help you navigate the document. You may want to go back to the table of contents to update it. If so, click inside of it, and now there should be a button above it saying update. Click it, and you should now have your new section in it.

, Fill in your section(s) with all of your data. Do not put charts/pictures in yet.

, If you need side-by-side information, the simplest way is a table. Just go to the Insert ribbon, and click Table, which will give you a drop-down of a 10x8 table. Move your mouse around to how many columns/rows you want, and click. Or if you want more rows, click insert table, which will open up a dialog box. Select the options which fit best. You may also want a preset table. Just rest your cursor over the option saying Quick Tables. If you do not find a quick table that you want, look online for a download. To customize a table, just click on the Table ribbon, and you will be provide with plenty of options for coloring, styles, etc. Look around, and see what looks the best for your document.

, Another way to make your paper look professional is the use of SmartArt. SmartArt is perfect for any information you wish to show more visually. To access SmartArt, go to the Insert ribbon, and click SmartArt, which is in the Illustrations tab. After clicking, a dialog box will open up, with all sorts of really interesting yet simple and presentable display options. On the left are buttons for different categories. Look around, and if you see one that interests you, click on it. To the right, there will be an image of the graphic, with a caption underneath, explaining how the graphic best fits in a document. Check everything out, and when you are done, click OK. The graphic will be inserted, and you can now customize it however you wish using the tools in the ribbon.

, Your document shouldn't just be the usual overflow of information. It hurts readers eyes, and it causes people to not want to read it. Think about the following steps, and use those which work for your document.

, A simple and easy to use trick, which splits your document in two, three, etc. Columns can be good for various purposes. To use columns, click the Page Layout ribbon, and on the Page Setup tab, click Columns. Choose your settings and give it a shot. If it seems like it would work in your document keep it. If you don't like it, just click on the one column button, and your back to your previous layout.

, Depending on your paper, changing up the margins can really help make it look official. There are several ways you can change your margins. You can go to Page Layout, and click Margins, and choose a preset or customize them. If you want to see the changes instantly however, make sure the ruler is visible. If it is not, then select the view tab, and turn on the ruler. Now that it is visible, put your cursor where there is a change in shading. This is the paper's margins. Drag it to where you wish, and release. Your margin has been set. To change indentations drag the sliders on the ruler to the desired spot.

, To edit a footer, double click at the bottom of the page. Double Click the top of the page to edit the Header. You can also go to the Insert ribbon and add them from there. Once you are in the Header/Footer editing mode, you can add titles, page numbers, etc. Go to the Design ribbon, and click on which of the options you choose. There are dropdown menus giving you presets of Headers/Footers and Page numbers. For page numbers, click the Page numbers button, and in the dropdown select where you want the page number to appear. Now you should have a list of examples, and you may select whichever you like. You can edit settings as well. You can change whether your document has a different first page, different odd and even pages, etc. If you want different headers for different sections, deselect the Link to Previous button, or else the new header will show up in previous parts. You may also set the distance of the Header from the op of the page, and set the distance between the Footer and the bottom of the page.

, To use Quick Parts, go to the Insert ribbon, and select quick parts. Click whichever you want, and place it wherever you wish.

, Usually Drop Cap is used for stories, articles, etc. Drop Cap sets the first letter of the Paragraph Larger than the others. If you plan to use Drop Cap, you probably will want to change the font, or else it looks bad. Experiment with which font looks the best, usually a fancier font like Old English Text works well.

, If you want a clear gap between parts, but you don't want to just have a huge empty area in your document, then use dividers. There are several dividers. You can use horizontal lines, underlining, bordering, etc. To insert a horizontal line, go to the Home ribbon, and in the paragraph tab, click the drop-down arrow button below the Paragraph mark (backwards 'P'). Click Horizontal Line. To insert a different style of horizontal line, click Borders and Shading. Now in the dialog box, go to the bottom left corner, where it says Horizontal Line. Now you should have several presets. To insert a border, without using boxing in anything, go to the same drop-down arrow, and click the picture with a line only on the bottom. To use underlines, on the last line before the divide, select any text there is, and hit Ctrl+U. To make the underline go all the way to the other margin, place your cursor to the right, and click. If this doesn't work, just use spaces until you get to the margin.

, For documents using citations, footnotes are great for keeping information and citings organized. To insert a footnote, hit Ctrl+Alt+F. You can also go to References and click Insert Footnote. To add a Citation, click Insert Citation, and then click Add New Source. When the dialog box is open, go to the top-left corner, and click where it says 'Document From Web site'. This gives you several types of sources to choose from. When you choose which type of source you are using, Microsoft Word gives you the areas of information to fill in, making it simple to cite. When you finish your document, you can click the button that says 'Bibliography' and select either Bibliography or Works Cited. Once you click it, Microsoft Word automatically creates a Bibliography or Works Cited based on the citations you have created. You can also change the style of citation such as MLA, APA, Chicago, Turabian, etc.

, Now click the large circular button in the top left corner of the window, and go to Prepare. Click Properties, and fill in the information. You may also want to encrypt the file, to do so, click the circular button again, go to Prepare, and hit Encrypt.

Use Word's built-in text converter utility.,
Use Word's Open and Repair feature.,
Use a shadow copy of the document.,
Rebuild the file header by taking parts from other Word document file headers.,
Use a third-party recovery utility.",How to Repair a Word Document," Even if your file is corrupt, having a duplicate means you still have a chance to recover the information in it if you should accidentally destroy the file in trying to repair it. Put this backup on a flash drive or other removable media.


If you have a previously saved version of the document, you may want to back it up and then open it on the same computer or another computer. If you've made few changes from the previous version to the current one, you may find it easiest to recreate the changes.;
, Your document may not be corrupt. If you have trouble opening other Word documents on the same computer, your version of Word may be at fault, not the document.

, If you have a copy of your document on another computer or sent it via email, you may still have a good copy of the document to work with.


Look at the date/time stamp for the file if you have it on another computer. If it's the same as the ""corrupt"" file, but it still opens, you may have a problem with the operating system on the computer with the corrupt file or with the hard drive itself.
If you emailed the document recently, check the Sent Items folder of your email program for the email that you attached the document to. You can then download it to a different folder on the computer where you found the corrupt file, or to another computer, to see if Word will open it.

, Running CHKDSK lets you check for corruption at the file system level. If there is none, the problem is indeed with your document. If there is, CHKDSK's file system repair may fix your document.

, If you can open the document with your version of Word, saving it in a format such as .rtf (rich-text format) or .txt (ASCII text format) may strip out whatever codes corrupted the file in .doc or .docx format. After opening the converted document, you can then re-save a new version of the document in .doc or .docx format to see if the problem returns.


Be aware that .txt format does not support text-formatting features such as bold, italics, and underline. If your document featured extensive formatting, save it in .rtf format to preserve the formatting before re-saving it in .doc or .docx format.
Note also that some Word documents may be corrupted in such a way that a file saved in a different file format in Word may not be able to be opened again.

, If you can't open the document in Word, you may still be able to open it with a different word processing program or with a text editor program that reads the .doc or .docx format. Either of these may let you recover the text from your document.

, If your Word document was saved in the older .doc format, you may be able to recover it with Word's ""Recover Text from Any File"" converter. How you access this utility depends on your version of Word.


In Word 2003, select Open from the File menu.
In Word 2007, click the Microsoft Office button in the upper left and then select Open from the File menu.
In Word 2010, click the File tab and then select Open from the File menu.
From the Open dialog in your version of Word, select ""Recover Text from Any File"" from the Files of type dropdown list and then select the file you wish to convert. Your text will be recovered, but any formatting or graphics will be lost. (Header and footer text will be saved but will appear in the body of the recovered text; the headers and footers themselves will be lost.)
After using this utility, reset the Files of type dropdown list to one of the Word document formats to prevent Word from using the recover text utility unnecessarily.

, This feature repairs (or attempts to repair) Word documents on opening as a matter of course. To use this feature, follow these steps:


Choose the Open option for your version of Word as described in the previous step.
Select the file you wish to open and repair in the Open dialog.
Click the down arrow beside the Open button and select Open and Repair from the menu.

, Windows Vista and Windows 7 have the capability to create shadow copies of some documents. You can check to see whether a shadow copy of your Word document exists by right-clicking it and selecting Properties from the popup menu. On the Properties dialog, select the Previous Versions tab and select one of the available versions listed.


The Previous Versions tab appears only if your hard drive is NTFS formatted.
Before you can use the shadow copy feature, you must first configure it.
Be aware that a shadow copy will not be as complete as a backup you created.

, You'll have to open several uncorrupted Word documents with a file editor program to identify the header components. By comparing them with the file header of your corrupt file, you may be able to identify corruption in its file header. You can then replace the corrupt header components with good components from another Word document to fix the file.

, If neither of Word's recovery features works, you may need to use a third-party recovery application such OfficeRecovery or Ontrack Easy Recovery to repair your Word document. However, if your file is severely corrupted, a third-party utility may not work either.


Be aware that some third-party recovery utility programs may come with hefty price tags, depending on how many features they contain. Also, be cautious when downloading programs like these off the internet, as they may contain malware.

Look in the printer manual if you cannot find any duplex printing settings.,
Change the settings as indicated by your printer manual.,

The easiest way to check is to open a Microsoft Word document. Press ""Print"" and look for a box to check that specifies ""double-sided,"" ""2-sided"" or ""duplex"" printing. Be sure to check the preferences or settings in the Print menu.
Although duplex printing relies on the printer, larger corporate printers are more likely to support this type of printing, because it reduces waste and can be done quickly. Smaller, at-home ink jet printers are less likely to have the option.;
, The index may indicate options for types of printing, or you can do an online search for ""duplex"" printing and your type of printer.

, On some printers, you may have to change the default setting to duplex printing, instead of choosing it each time your print.

, You can ask an IT person or a colleague from a different department to check whether their assigned printer does this.


Go through the steps in your ""Application"" folder or ""My Computer"" to add a device. Add the printer that supports 2-sided printing.
If you can set your computer up with a copier or scanner that does 2-sided copies, it may also be able to print double-sided sheets from Microsoft Word.

In manual duplex printing, Microsoft Word prints every other page on the first side of the sheet, and then you reinsert the paper to print even numbered pages on the back side of the paper.

,, Save your settings.

, Press Ctrl + F9 in Windows or Command + F9 on a Mac to create the field code brackets {}. The brackets will be highlighted with a gray color. In order to over line the text you want, you'll need to create a specialized field code. You will not be able to select text and apply the effect; instead, you will be typing the test you want over lined into the field code function itself.


Field codes will work on all versions of Word, for both Windows and Mac.

, Type the following in between the brackets: EQ \x \to(). There is a space between ""EQ"" and ""\x"", as well as a space between ""\x"" and ""to()"". Make sure not to include any extra spaces, or the function will not work.


If you copy the formula from this article and paste it into your document, Word will most likely add spaces at each end, which will cause the field code to not work. Type it out yourself for best results.

, Place your cursor between the parentheses in the field code. Type the text you want, including any spaces. Your function should look like this: {EQ \x \to(your text goes here)}. Keep your cursor in the field code when you are finished.

, Once you are finished entering in your code and text, you can convert the field code into the finished product. With your cursor inside the field code, press Shift + F9. This will convert the code, displaying the text you entered in the parentheses with a line over it.


Using the overline effect will most likely skew your line spacing, so be sure to review your whole document to see if anything was affected.

, Field codes are powerful scripting tools, and can cause problems if not used correctly. If the formula was entered incorrectly in any way, the code may disappear, or your program may even crash. Make sure that you aren't inserting extra spaces or characters, and that the formula is typed exactly as seen above.


If your code disappears, press Shift + F9 to toggle it back to the code view. You can then review your code and make any necessary changes."

, You will have dozens of different ready-made postcards to choose from. Select the one that's closest to what you want.


In Word 2007, the easiest method will be to type ""postcards"" into the search bar at the top of the new document window. This will pull up templates for you to download.
In Word 2010 and 2013, there are special sections for postcard templates. Click ""Cards"" and then select ""Postcards.""If you purchased blank postcards, search for their manufacturer. If you cannot locate a pre-installed template, check the manufacturer's website for available downloads.

Print out your cards.,

Ready your cards for mailing.",How to Make Post Cards in Word3," Make sure your home printer can print on cardstock. Load a sheet of cardstock (or blank postcards) into your printer's paper tray. Print out however many copies of your postcard that you want.


If you are printing both the front and back of your postcards, print a page of ""fronts"" first. Then, load the cardstock back into your printer's paper tray before printing the ""backs."" If you're unsure which side your printer prints to, try doing this using a test page on normal printer paper first.

, Unless your postcard takes up the entire sheet of paper, you will need to cut your printout into separate cards. If you have a paper cutter, use that to quickly make consistent cuts into multiple copies at once. Otherwise, hand cut them one at a time with a pair of scissors. Some blank postcards are perforated so that all you will need to do is tear where necessary.

, If your Word document didn't include addresses, write them in. You can also add a handwritten message to any available blank space. Affix a stamp to the top right corner of the addressed side, and your card is ready to post.

Lay out the billing information.,
Display the total bill amount.,
Include the terms of payment.,
Save the invoice.",How to Make Invoices in Word," Although a pre-made template is actually not a ""new"" document, you begin as though you were actually creating a new document.


In Word 2003, select ""New"" from the File menu.
In Word 2007, click the Office button in the upper left and select ""New"" from the File menu.
In Word 2010, click the File tab and then select ""New"" from the options at left.
Do not click the New toolbar button in Word 2003 or the New button on the Quick Access Toolbar in Word 2007 or 2010. These buttons will only let you create a new document using the default Normal.dot or Normal.dotx template. (Do use this method when creating an invoice from a blank document.);
,


In Word 2003 and 2007, select Invoices in the ""Available Office Templates"" on the left pane of the New Document task pane. Select the type of template from the list in the center window; then select one of the invoices displayed of that type.
In Word 2010, select Invoices in the Office.com Templates section under ""Available Office Templates."" Double-click the folder for the type of template you want to create; then select one of the invoices displayed of that type.

, Click the Download button at the right of the screen. You can then make changes to the invoice, using the information under ""Method Two: Creating an Invoice from a Blank Document,"" and save it.


You can also access invoice templates for Microsoft Word and Excel directly from the Microsoft website at http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/results.aspx?qu=invoices&ex=1. Be sure to select an invoice for your version of Word.

,, Your heading should include your business name and the word ""Invoice"" or a descriptive term for the type of invoice it is, such as ""Price Quote"" if you're only quoting a price for your services instead of billing for them.


You can place the heading either at the top of the page or in a Word header. If you put it in a header, and you anticipate the invoice running to a second page, you can use the Different First Page option to set up a more complete header on the first page and a summary header on the second.
Your business name should be displayed in the same font as it is on your other company materials.
Your invoice descriptor should be in a point size large enough for the person reading your invoice to identify it as the kind of invoice it is.

, You should display the issuing date for the invoice near the top of the document, to the right of the invoice descriptor. It doesn't need to be as large as the descriptor, however.


Word has an Automatic Date feature that automatically inserts the date for you. While this feature is handy, if you print and mail your invoices, you shouldn't use it for invoices you send electronically, since it always displays the today's date whenever it's viewed. Although the saved date for your invoice document won't change, the accounts payable person will likely look at the date on the invoice when figuring when to pay you by.

, The number should also appear at the top of your invoice. Numbering your invoices provides you a way to track invoices when you have multiple unpaid invoices out. You can number invoices either of two ways:


Global numbering, regardless of your client. This method lets you keep all your invoice documents in a single folder.
Individual numbering for each client. Use this method if you prefer to create separate invoice file folders for each client. You may wish to include the client's name or a portion of it with the invoice number, such as ""Swithin1.""

, Include your address and the name and address of your client on your invoice.


Your contact information should include your name (or that of your accounts receivable person), your company's address, phone, fax (if any), and email.
Your client's information should list the company name, the name of the accounts payable person, the client's address, and, optionally, phone, fax, and email.

, Word's Tables feature provides an easy way to lay out the rows and columns for your billing information, such as quantity, item/service description, unit price/rate, and total price for the quantity purchased.


Word's Tables feature also features the ability to do calculations. Instead of manually calculating the total price for quantity purchased, you can set up a field calculation to multiply the quantity by the unit price to produce it. You can then sum all the subtotals to produce the total bill.

, This should appear at the right, just below the list of itemized charges. You can display the amount in boldface to make it easier to see.


If you're charging sales tax, you should display a subtotal of the itemized charges, with the tax listed beneath it, with the percentage to the left of the tax dollar amount, then the adjusted total below that.

, You can display the terms of payment either above or below the billing information. Common terms of payment are ""Due on receipt,"" ""Due within 14 days,"" ""Due within 30 days,"" or ""Due within 60 days.""


You may also wish to include a memo at the bottom covering methods of payment, general information, or just a thank-you to the client for using your services.

, Give your invoice a meaningful name that describes the type of invoice it is. You can also include your company name and possibly the invoice number and the client name.

If you want to print an entire sheet of the same name tag, choose this option before you close the box. Look for a check box labeled something like “Print entire sheet of same label.” Type what you want the label to say in the Address box.

, Clicking the New Document button will open a page that looks like your sheet of labels. This allows you to type whatever you want into each separate label box., Once the label template is open on your computer, go through and type each name into a box. Use the available borders and designs to make them more interesting. Add small pictures or icons to enhance the name tags.You have almost unlimited options for how to create the name tags. Make them simple with Times New Roman font and black letters. Or make them silly with rainbow letters and Comic Sans font.
Add job titles, like Senior Executive or Program Director. Include a department name, like Accounting or Human Resources.
If you need to print more than one full sheet of name tags, continue entering names on the second page.

, Open the label package if you haven’t yet, and put one or more sheets of labels in the printer’s feed tray. On your computer, click the print button if it is visible, or “File” on the toolbar and locate Print there."

It’s up to you if you want to use live, green leaves or fake leaves off of a decorative plant. Don’t use dead leaves because they are too brittle. Use a paint pen to write the names on the leaves.

Choose large leaves or small leaves depending on your preference.

, Grab some thin rectangles of wood at a craft store or hardware store. Buy chalkboard paint from a craft store or home improvement store. Paint the wood pieces and let them dry. Once they dry, use white or multicolored chalk to write the names. Use hot glue to attach a safety pin to the back.For events, set chalk out so that people can write their own names on their name tag.
If you can’t find wood pieces, look for chalkboard paper that could be cut. Another option is to cut squares of sturdy plastic or cardstock and paint them with chalkboard paint.

, You'll be able to change any element of the template you'd like, including color, images, font, and layout. Pick the template that most closely matches the vision of your business card in your head. Click the ""Create"" or ""Download"" button to open the template in Word., If you're using Office 2010 or newer (and the template was designed for 2010 or new), you'll see your text appear in all of the business cards on the page.

, You can select any of the text on the business card and change the format. You can switch fonts, change colors and size, and more, just like you would regular text.


Since this is a business card, make sure that the font you choose is legible.

, Make absolutely sure that your business cards do not have any typos or other mistakes. Your business card is one of the first impressions people will have of you, so you don't want to start off on the wrong foot.

, If you're going to be printing the cards at home, you'll need high quality stock paper. Stick to white or off-white, and pick your finish. Most business cards don't have a finish, but some people prefer a glossier card. Many print shops will be able to open your saved business card template and print them for you as well.


When purchasing paper, make sure that your printer at home can handle it. Check your printer's documentation or support site for details on the type of paper that it supports.

, Once the cards are printed, you'll need to cut the sheet up. Each sheet will typically have ten cards on it. Don't use scissors or other methods of cutting that rely on you keeping a straight line. Instead, use a paper guillotine or precision paper cutter. Many print shops have these tools available for customers, or can do the cutting for you.

See how major papers place pictures and headlines to attract the reader’s eye. Understand how the basic elements of a newspaper work together.


Stories: This is the meat of the paper, where the majority of the text is.
Images: Photos and graphics are an essential piece of newspaper design. The break up large swaths of text and help provide context for stories. Also important for images are the captions explaining the significance of the image.

Design different pages. The front page will look significantly differently than inside pages, and different sections will have slightly different styles.
Draw lines to see how columns will affect the flow of your paper. Too many columns will make your text too crowded, while too few columns will lead to your stories appearing blocky.
Try placing text blocks in different places on your scratch page. Wrap text around images, or try placing an image directly above or below the story that it’s related to.
Experiment with headline placement. Headlines need to grab the reader’s attention, but they can’t be so large that they’re distracting.

, The average American newspaper is about 15”x22”. You can recreate this size in Word, but printing it from home will be next to impossible. You could potentially get this size custom printed, but it can be spendy.


Instead of making a standard newspaper size page, you can make a newsletter format. These typically have two columns, and fit on standard 8 ½”x 11” paper.
How you fold the paper will affect how you design it. A typical newspaper is folded in half horizontally, so important content will go on the top half of the front page.

, If you are managing a newspaper design, you will most likely have a variety of contributions from different writers or editors. Make sure that all of these are in compatible formats where you can drop the text into MS Word without too much trouble

Try different headline sizes until you come to a good mix between size and noticeability.
Make sure that your design styles apply uniformly throughout the paper. Layouts can change between sections, but basic decisions like font and size should remain constant.

, Traditional newspapers use color sparingly for both dramatic effect and for economic reasons. Color printing is significantly more expensive than black-and-white printing. Decide what elements of your paper, if any, necessitate the use of color.


If you are distributing the newspaper digitally, use color photos as much as possible. Avoid colored fonts and logos with a variety of colors.

, In order for your resulting print to look like a newspaper, it must be printed on both sides of the sheet. Check your printer properties in the ""Print"" dialogue box to see if your equipment supports double-sided print jobs.

, Your final review will help you catch any straggling spelling and punctuation errors, as well as style issues that you want to change before you go to print.

Customize the selected template by changing the clip art and graphics such as company logo, to suit the user preferences including position, size and other specific likes. Where the format allows for font change, text format, color scheme and paper layout, do so to suit user preferences.
You may sometimes find that some clauses are too restrictive or that entire articles do not apply to the user’s situation. These parts may be removed, however you must make sure that they do not affect the validity and structure of the entire agreement.

Let’s use the example of a business plan booklet for a start-up. After filling in the Business name, contact details and other information, Click on the “Save” button. If you are saving in Microsoft word format, simply use the ""File > Save As"" function of the word processor you are using inside the software.
After saving, any additional changes can be done easily by using the ""Find and Replace All"" button in the saved ms word document saved. However, using the ""Saved-Template” makes it easy to automatically customize the document by filling in all the user specific information and update the whole booklet. Remember to save the document as a template for future use.

,


The saved template is good for use in subsequent jobs. For example, if the booklet being made is a Newspaper or magazine, one of many pieces filled in a template makes good and coordinated effort and saves a lot of time going through one after another for quality checkup.
Saved template can be used anytime for customization of new services on your booklet and printing. Use the ""File > Print"" or ""Ctrl + P"" function of word to printing of your booklet. If you need a preview before printing then follow ""File > Print > Print Preview"". Templates are not software, they are just documents created by professions who may not be software programmers. However, they make work easier, faster and more convenient simply because the user focuses on crucial information and leaves the formatting to be done by the template and the entire booklet is done.

You can load a database of recipients or manually enter them, and then use placeholders, or ""Fields"", to automatically fill in each recipient's information in their own copy. This allows you to create one document that you can send to hundreds or even thousands of people.;
, You can manually enter each recipient during the Mail Merge process, which is fine if you have just a handful of people you're messaging, but you'll find things a lot easier if you have a spreadsheet or database of your recipients before you start.

If you select ""Labels"", the Label Options will appear, allowing you to choose the type of label paper as well as the size of each label.

, Recipients are the most powerful part of Mail Merge, as they allow you to replace placeholders, or ""Fields"", in the letter with each recipient's personal information. You can manually enter your recipients, load a database or spreadsheet file, or load your Outlook contacts.


If you select ""Type a New List"", a new window will open which will allow you to manually enter each recipient's information. This is useful if you don't have access to a spreadsheet with your recipients' information in it, but it is also the slowest way to enter the data. You can click Customize Columns... to create custom fields for the data you are entering.
If you select ""Use an Existing List"", you can browse your computer for a variety of different spreadsheet and database files, including Excel and Access. You can also click the New Source... button and connect to an SQL server online.

Click here for instructions on writing an effective email newsletter.

, You can use the preview in the window that appears to see how it will appear on each copy of the Mail Merge.

, These fields will then be replaced with the data from the recipient database when the documents are generated.


For example, if you want the document to display the recipient's first and last name, you would select ""First"", push Space, then click the ""Insert Merge Field"" button again and select ""Last"".
For another example, you can use the ""Address Block"" button to create envelopes with each recipient's address printed on it. Type your own address into the return address area of the envelope template, and then add the ""Address Block"" to the recipient area of the template.
You can select any field that contains recipient data. Make sure that it applies to all of the recipients on the list, as blank fields will be very obvious when reading the document.

, This make it easier to tell how the fields look while editing.

, The display will toggle to show the Mail Merge document filled out with your first recipient's information.

, Click the ""Check for errors"" button to have Word scan each document in the Mail Merge to ensure that all recipients have valid data for each of the fields. Any invalid results will be reported, allowing you to fix them before proceeding.

, Once you have finished checking for errors, you can finish the merge process and create the individual documents. You have three options when you click the ""Finish & Merge"" button:""Edit Individual Documents"" - You will be able to choose which entries you want to perform this action on. Once you do, a new document will be created, with each entry as a new page. You can then go through and make manual edits to each one.
""Print Documents"" - You will be able to choose which entries you want to perform this action on. Once you do, the documents will be sent to your printer, where each individual one will print.
""Email Documents"" - You will be able to define the Subject line as well as select the Field that contains the recipients' email addresses. You will then be able to send the bulk email message off using Outlook. Note that this will immediately send the message, so make sure everything looks good!

, English letters corresponding to variables can be inserted by simply typing them.

, If you know the name of a symbol, simply type \ followed by the symbol name. For example, for the Greek letter theta, type \theta and press Space to convert it.

, Note that in the previous step, it is only when Spacebar is pressed that the symbol is converted, this is generally true when editing the equation.

, For example typing a/b (and then pressing Space) puts a on top of b as a fraction.

, Brackets, or parentheses, (), are used to group parts of the equation in the editor. For example: (a+b)/c will put the expression a+b on the top of the fraction but will not display the brackets.

, For example: a_b makes b the subscript of a, and likewise a^b makes b the exponent of a. Subscripts and superscripts can be used simultaneously and are also how the equation editor adds limits to integrals, for example: typing \int_a^b and pressing Space gives the integral from a to b.

, Trigonometric functions such as sin and arctan are recognised, as well as other functions such as log and exp, however you must press Space after typing the function name in order for the editor to recognise it as a function.

, Font changes can be made as you are going along. To toggle bold and italic text use the normal shortcuts: Ctrl+B or Ctrl+I. To type text within an equation that looks 'normal', enclose it in quotation marks. To make a character into a script character use \script, for example: \scriptF would change the F into a script character.

, Typing equations is much faster than selecting symbols and structures from the menu, but does require learning the shortcuts. Using the steps above, you can probably guess most of the shortcuts you will need."

Open both programs on your computer.,

Split information within a column in Excel.,
Continue using the wizard to split merged columns.,
Open the Access program on your computer.,
Import an Excel spreadsheet into Access.,
Go through the steps on the wizard that appears within Access.,
Finish the importing process.",How to Import Excel Into Access," You will need to purchase and download a Microsoft Office package that includes both Exceland Access. You can do this online through the Microsoft site.


Once the programs are downloaded, click ""Start"" in Windows and select ""All Programs.""Click on ""Microsoft Office,"" and then select ""Access"" (or ""Excel"") from the drop-down menu. You may already have an Excel spreadsheet created that someone else sent you or that you downloaded from elsewhere. Having Office on your computer allows you to open it.;
, It will make it easier if you do a few simple steps before you import the Excel spreadsheet into Access. The key is that your data must be consistent between imported spreadsheets.It's a good idea to make sure that the first row in the Excel spreadsheet contains your column headers (or field names), and that these are very clear and easy to understand.For example, for a column containing people's last names, you may want to call the column header/field name ""last name."" Be clear and precise because it will make it easier when you try to match column headers in one Excel sheet with another.
Access allows you to link common fields between two or among many spreadsheets. Let's say you have an Excel sheet that contains payroll information. It includes people's first and last names, addresses, and salaries. Let's say for the sake of argument that you want to match that sheet within Access to a second Excel sheet that contains information about campaign finance contributions. This second sheet contains people's names, addresses, and donations. What Access allows you to do is to match different column headers with one another. You could link name headers to see which people of the same name appear in both databases, for example.
Scan the Excel sheets to make sure that each type of data is handled the same way, and clean it up before importing it into Access.It must be what Access calls ""relational."" For example, if the hypothetical spreadsheet for payroll contained first name, last name and middle initial in one column, but the second spreadsheet contained only first name and last name in separate columns, Access will register this as no match. There needs to be matching column headers/fields.

, To take care of this issue, you may want to split information in a column within Excel, so that it doesn't erroneously register as a ""no match"" in Access.


As an example, you may want to split the first name into its own column, the middle initial into its own column, and the last name into its own column. If it's already done the same way in the second spreadsheet, when you link, say, last name with last name in Access, it should generate matches when the names are the same.
To split a column in Excel, highlight the column that has information you want to split in it. Click on ""data""in the toolbar within the Excel program. Click on ""text to columns."" Generally, you will choose the option ""delimited."" Click next.

, Now you are ready to complete the process of splitting merged information in one column into multiple columns.


Choose how the data within the column is ""delimited."" This means that each piece of information in the column is separated by something. Most common choices include a space, a comma, or a semi-colon. Often the information is just separated by a space. As in the following example: let's say the name ""John A. Doe"" appears in a single column. The first name John is separated from the middle initial A by a space. The last name Doe is separated from the middle initial A by a space. So choose space in the delimited wizard.
Click next. Click finish. The program should split John, A., and Doe into three columns. You can then give the new columns new header names to indicate the kind of information housed in them (last name, first name, etc.). It's a good idea to create several blank columns to the right of the data you're splitting before you do it because it will push the data into the new blank columns (instead of columns that already contain information).

, Go to the start menu, choose Microsoft Office, and click on Microsoft Access. You need to open a new blank Access database to import the Excel sheet into it.


Choose ""blank desktop database"" to create a new database within the Access program.
Give it a new name if you want. Click ""create.""

, The next step is to pull the Excel spreadsheet (or more than one) into the Access database.


Click on ""External Data"" in the toolbar once you are within the Access database manager. Choose ""Excel.""In some versions of Access, you will find this function by clicking on ""file"" in the toolbar and ""Get External Data.""Where it says ""file name,"" click ""browse."" This will allow you to find your Excel sheet on your computer.
Leave the box checked that says ""import the source data into a new table in the current database."" It will be checked by default.
When you find the Excel spreadsheet you want to import on your computer, click on it. Click ""OK."" This will take you into the wizard for importing Excel into Access.

, To complete the process of importing your spreadsheet, you need to complete the steps in the wizard.


Choose the worksheet within the Excel spreadsheet that you want to import. Sometimes, this is simple because the Excel spreadsheet is just one sheet. However, sometimes people create multiple pages within a single Excel spreadsheet, which you can see by clicking on the tabs at the bottom of the spreadsheet. If this is the case, you need to tell the Access wizard which spreadsheet you are choosing. Click next.
The next page has a box asking if the first row in the Excel sheet has column headings. This means the row in a spreadsheet that identifies the data in each column (such as last name, address, salary, etc.). It's a good idea if you cleaned up your Excel sheet first to make sure that the first row has clearly defined column headings. Then, just check yes that the first row contains column headings. This is the simplest approach. Click next.
If your first row does not contain column headings, the next page asks you if you want to rename what are called ""fields"" in Access (these are column headings). If you did not already name each field something clear and easy to recognize before importing (recommended), then you can do it here.

, There are only a few steps left in the importing process. The next page in the wizard will ask if you want to identify a primary key.


You don't have to do this, but you can. A primary key means the computer program will assign each row of information a unique number. This can be helpful later on when sorting the data. Click next.The final screen in the wizard has a space providing a default name. You can change the name of the Excel sheet you are importing (it will become a ""table"" in Access on the left side of the page when you finish importing it).
Click ""import."" Click ""close."" You will see your table on the left side of the screen. It is now imported within Access.
If you want to link more than one data set, repeat this process with another or multiple Excel spreadsheets. Now, you are ready to match the data in the sheets within Access.

Check out the available desktop Office replacements.,
Download the software.,
Run the installer.,
Get acquainted with your new program.,
Consider cloud-based Office alternatives.",How to Get Microsoft Office For Free4," There are several programs available that can give you most of the features found in Office, and even some that Office doesn't have. These programs are all able to open and edit Office documents, as well as a variety of open formats. The most popular suites are FreeOffice, OpenOffice, and LibreOffice.FreeOffice is considered the most user-friendly of the options, while OpenOffice and LibreOffice are more powerful. If you are familiar with Office, consider FreeOffice or LibreOffice.

, Once you've settled on a choice, you can download the installer for the program you want. Visit the following sites to download the installer for your chosen program:

LibreOffice - libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/

FreeOffice - freeoffice.com/en/download

OpenOffice - openoffice.org/download/index.html


, You'll be given the option to choose which of the productivity programs you want to install. By only selecting the ones you plan to use, you can cut down on installation time and hard disk space., All three Office alternatives listed above look and behave differently, and they are all full-featured software programs. As such, they'll all have a bit of a learning curve, especially if you're used to using Office. The basic features should be fairly straightforward, and you can look on YouTube or here on wikiHow for instructions on performing more advanced tasks.

See Use OpenOffice.org Writer for details on using Writer, the OpenOffice Word alternative.
See Use LibreOffice for tips on getting familiar with the LibreOffice word processor.

, As online tools become more powerful, there is less and less need for installing productivity programs on your computer. Besides the Office web apps detailed above, there are several other cloud-based productivity suites you can use. All of these services allow you to upload and then edit Office documents.Google Docs is the most famous of the cloud-based options. You can create and edit documents, spreadsheets, and presentations using Google's online tools. You can access everything from Google Drive, where your documents will be stored. If you have a Gmail account, you have access to Google Docs. See Use Google Drive for details on creating and editing documents.
Zoho is another cloud-based Office replacement. Its interface is much more similar to the Office interface than Google Docs. Like Google Docs, you can create documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. See Use Zoho Docs for instructions on using Zoho.
OnlyOffice is an online Office alternative that allows you to create documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

Open Microsoft PowerPoint (version doesn't matter) and open a new presentation.,
Open an internet browser of your choice (Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.),
Go back to your PowerPoint presentation and right-click on your blank slide.",How to Fake a Blue Screen (BSOD) with PowerPoint,"


Only one slide will be necessary.
If there are any text boxes on the screen, click on their outlines and press your delete key. Only a blank slide is needed.;
, and go to images.google.com, or go to google.com and click on ""Images"" in the top right next to the apps grid. From there, type ""BSOD,"" ""blue screen,"" or ""blue screen of death"" into the search bar and press enter. Using the tips below, choose a picture and click on it. Then click the ""View Image"" button, right-click the image and select copy.


For the most accurate results, add your operating system (Windows XP, 7, 8, etc.) into the search bar as well. True blue screens for a PC vary by operating system.
When looking for an image, it's best to choose one that is not small or blurry. Those will make the blue screen look unrealistic when put into full screen.
Somewhere on your blue screen image (depending on the operating system) you should find an error code such as ""irql_not_less_or_equal"" or ""page_fault_in_nonpaged_area."" For even higher accuracy, google those error codes and don't use ones that would never make sense for your specific computer. However, this is a very small detail and shouldn't matter for most uses of a fake blue screen.

, When you right-click the slide, you should see at least one option of pasting. Click one of them; the option you select should not matter. Your blue screen image should then appear on the slide. After clicking your image, use the dots surrounding the image to stretch it out and fit the entire slide. Once it fills the slide, click on the 'Slide Show' tab and start the presentation or press F5 to make it full screen. You should now have successfully created a fake BSOD using Microsoft PowerPoint! (You can take the presentation out of full-screen mode by pressing the Esc key.)


If your image is blurry or fake-looking once the presentation has been put into full screen, it can most likely be concluded that the image's resolution is too small. Delete this image from the slide by clicking the image and pressing the delete key and repeat the process with a different blue screen image.
If your image has black margins after being fully stretched out and put into full screen, PowerPoint most likely isn't set up correctly. Go to the ""Design"" tab, click ""Page Setup,"" change the size to the 16:9 option, and press OK. When put back into full screen, the black margins should no longer be present.
If no pasting options are present, go back to the image you copied online, right-click it and select ""save image as"" instead. Open the folder you saved the image to and drag it into the slide. This should work the same way as a paste would.

Microsoft releases trial versions of Office in the hopes that if you like it well enough, you will be willing to pay for the full version, which costs a minimum of $139.99 (or $109.99 for the Word application alone).;
, Microsoft Office is available on a subscription basis, and you can get a free month's subscription by visiting the official Microsoft site. Click the green button that reads “Start your free month” to begin the process.


The trial month of Microsoft Office includes a full-featured suite of programs, plus some other perks like 60 minutes of free Skype calling time to any phone. If an update to the software is released during your trial, it will apply to your version of Office automatically.

, Like many subscription services, an Office subscription will start to cost you money every month (either $9.99 a month, or $99.99 at once for an entire year) if you don't cancel it before the trial ends. Make a note somewhere you'll see it, and be sure to cancel at least a full day ahead of schedule to avoid any complications.

Install a torrent client.,
Search for an MS Office or MS Word file to download.,
Download the torrent file.,
Install Word.",How to Download Microsoft Word for Mac2," In order to use torrent files, you will need to install a torrent client. Download and install uTorrent, a free BitTorrent client, if you don’t already have it.


Other torrent clients include Vuze and BitTorrent.

, Search the internet for a Mac Torrent file to download. You will likely find many possible links, so you will need to ensure that you are downloading a good file.


Look at the Seeders (S) and Leechers (L) count to see how good the connection is. More seeders means a faster connection and also increases the chance that the torrent is clean.
Read the comments for the torrent you are downloading to ensure that other users were able to get it working OK and that they did not encounter any viruses.
Mac operating systems are less susceptible to viruses than Windows operating systems are, but you are still not protected from everything. Torrent files are one of the most popular way to spread viruses, so be careful.
Do not click on the ads that offer to speed up your downloading time. Download speed will depend mostly on your internet connection and the number of torrent seeders.

, Make sure to click on the correct button when downloading the link: it will usually read “Download Torrent” right under the filename. Depending on your internet connection and the number of seeders, this process could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.


For more detailed information on using torrent files, see this guide.

, After you download the torrent file, it will be delivered as a DMG file to your computer. Run the installation, and enjoy using Microsoft Word on your Mac!


You may need to install a crack as well. Read the README file included in the download to see what extra steps you might need to follow in order to get Word running.

"
"
Know what you're getting into.,
Find a torrent.,
Acquire the crack.,
Open the package and follow the instructions.",How to Download Microsoft Word2," Obtaining a copy of Microsoft Office (or even just Word) without paying for it involves piracy. Understand the punishments for piracy. Unlike some companies, Microsoft is highly vigilant about piracy; though they're unlikely to pursue legal action against you, there's no way to be sure. In addition, because of the sophisticated anti-piracy measures Microsoft installs in its software, you'll probably need to run a crack, which is a small program that hacks the program's security system to trick it into thinking you paid for a license. Cracks sometimes contain spyware or viruses, so be very careful before running them.

, Use a torrent aggregator like http://torrentz.eu to search for “Microsoft Word” or “Microsoft Office.” Review your results, taking time to read user comments and check the overall rating of the torrent so that you can be sure it's legitimate. Once you find a torrent you like, download it and run it in your torrent program of choice. (If you don't have a torrent program, µTorrent is a good choice.) If there are enough seeders (people sharing the program), the download should begin at once.


Some torrents come with a crack included. If you can find such a torrent that has a good rating, download it and save yourself the trouble of finding the crack yourself.
The latest version of Microsoft Office is Office 2013. However, for most people, Office 2010 should work just as well. If you're having trouble getting the latest version, try an older one.
A torrent for an office suite the size of Microsoft Office is likely to take some time to finish, even with plenty of seeders. Leave the program running and come back later to check on it.

, If necessary, search for a software crack of your version of Office online. This is highly dangerous for your computer, as malicious and invasive programs abound in the seedy underbelly of the web where most cracks reside. Be sure your antivirus program is up to date and running in the background.

, The first thing you should do if you downloaded a version with an included crack is read the Read Me file. It should give you detailed instructions on how to use the crack to fool Office into licensing you for use. Most cracks get a bit of initial data from the program to be cracked (which you'll have to acquire manually by running the program) and then using it to generate a passkey. Whatever the case, follow the instructions closely and enter the key into Office once you have it. From this point, you should be able to use Office freely.


Don't send any information to Microsoft if prompted! They'll likely figure out what's going on and lock you out of the program or otherwise get you in trouble.
If your instructions include dubious steps (such as opening or modifying System files, or running other programs aside from Office), don't follow them without getting expert advice from a trusted friend first. Chances are, they're a malicious practical joke that could end up harming your computer badly.
You can throw out the crack program once you're done with it. It doesn't need to stay on your computer for Office to recognize you as a legitimate user.

Get a free suite.,
Use an online alternative.",How to Download Microsoft Word3," There are many, many office suite programs available, and not all of them cost money. In fact, some of the best suites for home, student, or small business use are free. Although they aren't usually quite as full-featured or always as stable as Microsoft Office, they're all more than capable enough for the average user who just needs to be able to type a business report or term paper.



OpenOffice is probably the most talked-about and most popular free office suite available. It's an open-source program, which means that anyone with some programming skill can contribute to it. OpenOffice's Writer word processor handles Word documents with ease, and can even export its own files as Word documents.

LibreOffice is an outgrowth of OpenOffice that natively supports Microsoft's Open XML protocol (whereas OpenOffice requires a free plug-in to handle it). It's fairly new, but powerful and well-regarded. Most of OpenOffice's development team now develops for LibreOffice instead.

IBM Lotus Symphony was developed by IBM using OpenOffice as a starting point. It's sleek and fast, and can do almost everything OpenOffice can do.

, In addition to traditional software packages you can download and use offline, there are a number of powerful word processing and office options available for use online, some of which are free. The advantage of these is that your work is always wherever you need it to be.



Microsoft's own OneDrive cloud storage actually has a free, full version of Office for personal use available entirely online. You can type, format, save to your hard drive, and even print documents from OneDrive's Word Web App. The only restriction is that you can't use it for a group – not even a very small group like a family business. Just sign up to OneDrive and access Word from a drop-down menu near the top of the home page.

Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware is designed more for groups (such as businesses and nonprofit organizations) than individual, but there's no restriction on individual use. It's a free, open source, comprehensive wiki management tool that includes a powerful online office suite along with a dazzling array of other tools you may or may not find useful.

ThinkFree Online is a sleek, graphically pleasing free online office suite with basic functions including a word processor and a spreadsheet program. It's compatible with many devices, and offers viewing and direct editing modes for quick document manipulation without logging into the full online program, if you're in a hurry.

Codabar: Used for libraries, blood banks, airbills
Code 39: Used for various purposes

Customize gluepoints by using the toolbar of the same name.,
Click on the Connector icon on the Drawing toolbar.,
Click on the type of connector you want and then select a gluepoint.",How to Use Gluepoints and Connectors in Open Office Draw," All Draw objects have associated invisible gluepoints. Most objects have four gluepoints.


Note: Gluepoints are not the same as the little blue or green “handles” of an object. You use the handles to move or change the shape of an object, but the gluepoints are used to “glue” a connector to an object.;
, It will probably be around the center of it. Once clicked on, it will bring up another gluepoint toolbar so that you can add and subtract them.

, They become visible if you click the Gluepoints icon.

, Connectors are very useful in drawing organization charts, flow diagrams and mindmaps. Even when objects are moved or reordered, the connectors remain attached.

, Hold down the mouse button and select the desired gluepoint for the other end. As you can see, it doesn't always take the expected route.

Prepare a setup page or draft, with snap lines, to assist in drawing the various hierarchies and responsibility paths and typical boxes that you will use in drawing the chart.,
Place individual boxes as needed.,
You can also select an object and use the menu command Edit > Duplicate in order to make copies of one or more boxes (see Figure 3).,
Check out the completed draft.

,
Now, you will add text to individual boxes.",How to Use Charts and Diagrams in OpenOffice.Org Draw1,";
, Individual boxes are placed and dimensioned according to ‘feel’. The exact size (particularly width), position, and color can be fixed later.

It is sometimes easier to draw only one box per level, to duplicate this box and then move it to the desired position.

, The spacing of the duplicated object(s) to the original can be input in the placement fields for X and Y axes


Note that positive values for X and Y are (relative the original object) to the right and downwards respectively.
Which replication technique you choose to use is up to you. There are other methods as well.

,,


If the text formatting is as you want it, you can input text. Depending on the length and formatting of the text it may be necessary to adjust the size of the box and the spacing to neighboring boxes. Adjustments can be made initially with the mouse and then “fine tuning” is possible with the Position and Size window.
Now you can set up the fill colors and store the drawing. The connections between the boxes are not drawn with ordinary lines but with the Connectors which Draw uses. How you draw these connectors and add text to them is described in detail later in this chapter.
You can also use text frames for the boxes. These have the advantage of automatic line breaks. This screenshot shows the individual editing steps of text input, adding lines and setting the background color for a text frame.

, The necessary symbols are selected from the toolbar and dragged into position.

, The individual symbols must be exactly positioned if the connectors which join them are to form a vertical line. The midpoints of all the symbols which lie in a vertical straight line should have the same X coordinate and those which line on the same level should have the same Y coordinate.


Select the shapes which are to lie in a vertical straight line with one another and center them with Modify > Alignment > Centered.
For those on a horizontal line select the shapes and center them with Modify > Alignment > Center.

, After adding text and setting the fill color you can join individual symbols together and add text to the connectors where necessary.

These buttons determine how the horizontal position of a glue point will change when you resize the object containing the glue point.,
To add text to a connector double click the connector.,
If you draw a connector and and then click on it, only the end and control points become active.,
When you add text to a connector, the location of the text is referenced to this rectangle.,
You should take particular note of the following fields in the Text dialog.",How to Use Charts and Diagrams in OpenOffice.Org Draw3," Connectors are lines or arrows whose ends automatically “dock” to a gluepoint of an object. Connectors are particularly useful when drawing organization charts, flow diagrams and mindmaps. The connecting lines between the symbols remain intact even after the moving and rearranging of the various drawing blocks.

,, If the type of connector you want is not shown, click on the small black triangle in the right upper part of the Connector toolbar. In the list which appears click on Visible buttons. Here you can activate additional connector types.


Connector types fall into one of four groups:

Standard connectors – the line segments run vertically and horizontally. All angles are right angles. The connector does not bend around the objects it binds.
Line connectors – consist of a line segment and two smaller horizontal or vertical segments at the ends.
Straight connectors – consist of a single line.
Curved connectors – are based on Bézier curves.



, From the context menu choose Connector to change from one connector type to another (as well as some other properties). With the Line menu you can change the appearance of the line (color, arrow style and line style) but not the connector type., As you move the cursor over an object you can see the available connection (glue) points. To connect two shapes move the mouse cursor over a gluepoint, click on it with the left mouse button to establish the first point, and then drag the mouse cursor (left button still pressed) to the other gluepoint and release the mouse button. The ends of the line are now docked and the connection is established.

,, This is useful when the final position of the object is not yet fixed. When you move the object Draw will automatically select the optimal location for the connector ends.


As with all other objects, connectors have one or more control points to simplify the construction of the drawing. You can use these points to change the shape, length and proportions of the connector line.







,, Gluepoints can be edited using a separate toolbar. This toolbar is context sensitive, that is it appears automatically when you click on the button Glue Point select the menu command Edit > Glue Points. #The following briefly describes the function of each button on this toolbar.

, With this button you insert a new gluepoint.

, If the object is filled you can place a glue point anywhere inside the object. With unfilled objects you can place a glue point only on the outside frame but after inserting it you can then drag it inside the object. Activate the Glue Points button on the Draw toolbar as described above.

The glue points remain visible as long as the button Glue Points is active. They appear as small blue crosses. A selected glue point has a gray square behind the cross. You can move a selected glue point with the mouse or delete it with the Del key.







,


You can choose one or more directions for a particular glue point. The directions specify the direction permitted for a connector to join to the glue point.

, If for example you activate only the button, every connector will be forced to come to the glue point from the left side of the point.


In the screenshot is a glue point in the circle with a left entry and one in the square with a right entry. The effect of this is shown in the right drawing after adding a connector between the two glue points.

, For the example above, the connection inside the circle would change as shown below:


If the Glue Point Relative button is active (it is active by default) the glue point will move when you change the size of the object, as shown below:






If the Glue Point Relative button is deactivated, the remaining buttons on the toolbar, previously grayed out, become active. With these buttons you can decide how a glue point will be placed when the size of the object is changed.

, The distance of the glue point to the left edge, vertical line through the middle, or the right edge will remain fixed when you change the size of the object. If the width of the object becomes less than the distance the glue point will be attach to the object frame.


This example shows what happens when the object width is changed and the glue point is set to have a fixed distance to the left frame.

These buttons determine in a similar manner the vertical position of a glue point when the size of the object is changed.

, The end and control points will become active and you will see the familiar flashing text cursor (the cursor position is determined by the last used setting). At the same time the Text Formatting toolbar will appear (under the menu bar). This toolbar allows you to set the desired text properties and you can directly input the text., In spite of this a connector has its own object frame – in this case an invisible one. You can picture it easily by imagining a rectangle enclosing the start and end points of the connector (see Figure 14).

, The exact position of the text can be set in the Text options dialog (Figure 15). This dialog appears when you double-click on text and then choose Text from the pop-up menu or when you single-click on the connector and select Format > Text from the menu bar.

, In the Text anchor section you can see the possible locations for the text. In the above example the text is anchored at the top left. In the Spacing to borders section at the lower left you can input also negative values of spacing, to position the text outside the frame."

The anchor location of the text is not important at this stage. Select the object with the text (in this case the connector) and click on the Fontwork button.






This opens the Fontwork dialog. To make the text lie along the inclined line, click on the Rotate icon and set the distance to the line you wish.

, This opens up many other possibilities to manipulate the text with the button, or place the text under the line by assigning a negative value to the spacing between text and line.


In addition it is possible to use the Fontwork dialog to generate curved text which follows the shape of a curved line. It pays to experiment a little to investigate some of the possibilities.

Save the file as a plain text file.,
Open the file in Excel.",How to Convert Word to Excel1," When you import a document into Excel, certain characters will be used to determine what data goes into each cell in the Excel spreadsheet. By performing a few formatting steps before importing, you'll be able to control how the final spreadsheet appears and minimize the amount of manual formatting you have to perform. This is especially useful if you are importing a large list from a Word document into Excel.


This method works best when you have a list of multiple entries, each formatted the same (list of addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, etc.).;
, Before beginning the conversion process, you'll want to ensure that each entry is formatted in the same way. This means fixing any punctuation errors or reorganizing any entries that don't match the rest. This will ensure that the data transfers properly.

, Displaying the normally hidden formatting characters will help you determine the best way to split up the entries. You can display them by clicking the ""Show / Hide Paragraph Marks"" button in the Home tab or by pressing Ctrl+⇧ Shift+*


Most lists will either have one paragraph mark at the end of each line, or one at the end of the line and one in the blank line between entries. You will be using the marks to insert the characters used by Excel to differentiate between cells.

, Excel will use space between entries to determine the rows, but you'll need to get rid of it for now to help the formatting process. Don't worry, you'll be adding it back in a little bit. This works best when you have one paragraph mark at the end of an entry and one in the space between entries (two in a row).


Press Ctrl+H to open the Find and Replace window.
Type ^p^p into the Find field. This is the code for two paragraph marks in a row. If each entry is a single line and there are no blank lines between them, use a single ^p instead.
Enter a delimiting character into the Replace field. Make sure that it isn't a character that appears anywhere in the document, such as ~.
Click Replace All. You'll notice that the entries may combine themselves, but that's not a concern right now as long as the delimiting character is in the right place (between each entry)

, Now that your entries are separated so that they appear in subsequent rows, you'll want to define what data will appear in each field. For example, if each entry is a name on the first line, a street address on the second line, and a state and zip code on the third line, you can


Press Ctrl+H to open the Find and Replace window.
Remove one of the ^p marks in the Find field.
Change the character in the Replace field to a comma ,.
Click Replace All. This will replace the remaining paragraph symbols with the comma separator, which will separate each line into a field.

, Once you've done the two Find-and-Replace steps above, your list will not look like a list anymore. Everything will be on the same line, with commas between every piece of data. This final Find-and-Replace step will return your data to a list while keeping the commas that define the fields.


Press Ctrl+H to open the Find and Replace window.
Enter ~ (or whatever character you chose originally) into the Find field.
Enter ^p into the Replace field.
Click Replace All. This will break your entries back into individual groupings separated by the commas.

, Now that your formatting is complete, you can save the document as a text file. This will allow Excel to read and parse your data so that it goes in the correct fields.


Click the File tab and select ""Save As"".
Click the ""Save as type"" drop-down menu and select ""Plain Text"".

Someone searching for library materials will likely need the computer for a shorter amount of time, and more people can access they do not need to wait for someone writing a report or surfing the Internet. The catalog computers are usually located around the library at small stations without chairs.;
, If you are using a university library, you might need to input a student ID and password before you are allowed access to the network. At a public library, however, there is a higher probability that no card or log in information will be necessary.

, On a computer set up to serve as a library catalog, the catalog is usually already open. In fact, the computer may even be set up so that the catalog is the only thing accessible without a special password. If the catalog is not open, though, it will usually be located as an icon on the desktop. Double-click the icon to open to catalog.

, Every catalog is set up differently, but for most, a search bar will be in the middle or at the top of the computer.


Click in the bar and type a keyword, title, or author.
There may also be a drop-down box next to search bar. Click on this box and specify whether you are searching by title, author, or keyword.
Click on ""Search,"" ""Go,"" or the equivalent search button.

, Browse through the list of search results until you find the right book or a title you want to look at.

, Click on the title to go to the book's information page. This page will contain further information about the subject of the book, as well as the call number.

, If you have a good memory, you do not need to actually copy it down. Otherwise, jot the number down on your cell phone or using a pencil and paper. Many libraries keep pencils and paper next to the catalog computer for this purpose.


Some libraries might also allow you to print catalog results. Catalog printouts are often free, but you should check the library’s policy before proceeding.

, If you already found what you know you want, more searching is not necessary.

, It is a bit rude to leave the catalog open to your page, so click on ""Back"" or ""Home"" until you return to the catalog home page.

Know the rules.,

Leave the computer as you found it once you finish.",How to Use Library Computers2," Make sure that the computer you use is designated for word processing instead of being a catalog computer. Oftentimes, especially at a public library, this will be made obvious through the use of signs. In some instances, a catalog computer may not even have a word processor or Internet browser on it.

, At small colleges, reserving the computer is not usually required. At a public library, however, reservations are almost always required. This is also true at some larger universities.


Reservations usually have a time limit, but this limit may get lifted or extended if no one else is waiting for the computer.
Access is typically on a first-come-first-serve basis. If no one is presently on the computer, you can take the current time slot. If all the computers are in use, your name will go down on a waiting list.

, If you have a student ID and are using a university computer, or if you have a library card and are using the computers at a public library, you do not need a guest pass. Some libraries offer guest passes to those who are not actual patrons, though.

, You will almost always need to log onto a library computer before you can use a word processor or Internet browser. Type in your student ID, library card number and PIN, or guest pass information.

, Under most circumstances, the word processing and browser icons will be visible on the desktop. Otherwise, go to the ""Start"" button on the taskbar and find the program from the program list located there.

, The rules are generally posted near the computer area or next to the keyboard. Specific rules can vary, but there are some standard rules that will apply at just about every library you visit.


For word processing, do not save anything onto the library server. If you are using a university library computer, it might be connected to the university network. In that case, you might have designated space on the server to save work, but you should not save it onto the library computer since it will only get cleared out by the end of the day or week. At a public library computer, you will need to have a USB drive to save any work.
For Internet use, do not download any information directly onto the library computer. Use a USB drive instead. Moreover, you should not attempt to access any pornographic or illegal content while on the library computer. These computers usually have filters on them to block out the majority of such content, but you should not attempt to bypass those filters.

, The vast majority of libraries, both public and university, will charge a fee for color pages and transparencies. Most public libraries will also charge a smaller fee for black and white copies, but a few college libraries may allow students to print out a limited number of black and white copies for free.

, Close any programs and log off. You do not want to leave the computer logged into your account since any rule violations will automatically get filed under your account information.

,


One of the major pre-requisites is that the table must be in your own schema.
There are also certain types of synonyms that you can not rename in Oracle. These include public synonyms as well as types with dependent tables.

, You will need to know the table name in order to enter the command that allows you to alter it.

, If you are unsure of dependencies, you can use the “TOAD” tool to check the table’s status.


First, select the table you plan to rename in the schema browser,
Then find the “Used By” tab. Any dependencies will be listed in this section.

, Keep in mind if you attempt to use the same schema, you will receive an error message in Oracle. The error message will appear on screen as the following: ORA-14047: ALTER TABLE|INDEX RENAME may not be combined with other operations. For example, “priority.table_name” can not be changed to “priority.new_table_name.”

, You will type in the following to make the adjustment: “ALTER TABLE original_table_name RENAME TO new_table_name;” The original name will represent the former table, sequence, view or private synonym.

, Once you have renamed a table, all of the objects including indexes should move with the change. If the renaming is not successful, you will have to perform some troubleshooting to determine why you are receiving an error message.

Once you make a new note, you'll see that it appears in the center column as an untitled note, above the welcome note that comes prepackaged with Evernote. The content of the note appears in the right column. The note is made up of a few distinct parts:


At the top there is a field for entering a title; next to that there's a drop-down menu that tells you what notebook the note is currently filed inside. (Notebooks will be covered in another step.)
Below the title field, there's clickable text that reads “Click to set source URL....” This is for noting where you copied note information from if you retrieved it from an online source.
Next to the URL entry text, there's a field for entering tags (searchable keywords).
Below the URL and tag areas, there is a suite of word processor controls for things like formatting, font, and text size.
The lowest, and primary, area of your note is the entry field. Right now, it's blank.

, Enter information into the various fields to create a useful piece of information. Evernote will save and update the note automatically as you fill it in.


Start by clicking in the title field and giving your note a name. This helps you to find it more easily, so it's a good habit to get into before you have hundreds of notes.

If you can't be bothered to enter a title, Evernote will treat the first part of your note's text as its title.


Skip to the tags field and give your note a tag. Tags are another way to search for notes. They're usually related to the subject matter of the note.

Unlike Twitter, you don't necessarily need to start your tags with a # symbol. You can if you want, of course.
Try to keep tags short and to the point. If you were doing geological research, you might tag all your research notes with the word “geology,” for example.
You can add as many tags as you want.

, It doesn't matter exactly where you place the tab stop for now, as you'll be moving it soon.

, To do this, open the Tabs window by either double right-clicking on the tab stop in the ruler, or expanding the Paragraph group (from the Home ribbon) and then clicking the ""Tabs"" button at the bottom. From the Tabs window, you can select your preferred style of leader dots.

, To do so, first click and drag the right indent marker over to the extreme right past the point where you want the TOC page numbers to align. Even if you move it out into the gray margin area, that's okay for now (this is temporary; you'll be moving the indent marker back again).

, Click and drag the tab stop to the exact spot on the ruler where you want the TOC page numbers to align.

, Drag it back to the left, past the tab stop. Set the indent marker on the ruler where you want the text to wrap to the next line.

Visit your local public library's website.,
Do a search of public libraries with an online library.If your public library does not have e-book lending services, or if you are uncertain about what public libraries are available in your area, you can access a searchable database of libraries with online e-book services.,
Find out if your university has an e-book library.,
Check out university resources.,
Do a broad Internet search.,
Consult websites that provide online library lists.As you search for online libraries, you may stumble across a handful of websites that do not actually offer online library services, but instead provide a list or directory of online libraries available.,
Read the terms of services before borrowing.",How to Find an Online Library," Nowadays, many public libraries work in cooperation with various e-book providers to establish a collection of digital books available for lending. Your local library may be included. These e-books include both current and classic selections and are often available in both text and audio form. Digital lending technology makes it possible for these libraries to lend out a restricted number of books for a restricted period of time. When the time expires, the books automatically stop working on the patron’s computer and are once more made available to other patrons.;
, Be aware, however, that you will need a library card before you can check out digital books from a public library’s collection. Many libraries require you to be a citizen of the county or city that they are based in before you can apply for a library card.

, Just like some public libraries have an e-book collection, some university libraries do, as well. Many of the e-books available through university libraries are academic in nature, but you might be able to find some that are not. To borrow e-books from a university’s online library, you usually need to have a valid and current student ID number.

, If your university does not have an e-book library, it might be able to point you to a few free online libraries you can make use of. In addition to free online libraries, some universities partner with massive online libraries that offer a paid service. This service is paid for by the university, making it free for students to use. These libraries typically specialize in offering digital versions of academic journals and other periodicals, but they do occasionally offer digital books. The resources will be strictly academic in nature, however.


Even if you are not a student at the university, a university website might be able to direct you to a helpful resource. Only students with valid student IDs can access paid services for free, but any free resources listed by the library will generally be available to the public.

, One of the fastest ways to find an online library is simply to do a search using your favorite Internet search engine. A good set of basic search terms to use would be “online libraries” or “list of online library services.” An even better set of basic search terms would be “free online libraries” or “free list of online libraries.” Even though the concept of a library connotes the idea of a free lending service, some websites claiming to offer online library services first require you to sign up for a paid membership.These websites are fine if a small fee does not bother you, but free online libraries often have comparable collections.


Narrow your search down to specific book types. If you are interested in a more specific type of book, such as novels or academic journals, specify that in your Internet search. Try a search like “free online novel library” or “free academic journal collection.”
Know what to expect. Free online libraries usually allow you to “borrow” a book and keep it forever, which could be considered an advantage over online libraries connected to public libraries or universities. Independent online libraries rarely have the latest and greatest novels, though. Instead, they usually only provide books for which the copyright has expired or current Kindle or Nook e-books that are being offered by the author for free., These lists can be very valuable since they provide you with lists and a brief but informative explanation of what makes a certain library’s services stand out above the rest.

, Before borrowing from any online library, make sure that you understand the rules and conditions of borrowing. Some libraries are free while others require you to pay a small membership fee for partial or full access. Some libraries allow you to keep the books you check out forever, while others place a limit. Libraries may also place a limit on how many titles can be checked out at once or during one day.

Determine what you want the database to do.,
Make sure the database is large enough with room for growth.,
Decide between custom and off-the-shelf database software.,
Take the time to research all options.,
Consider web enabled options.,
Include free database software in your investigation of how to choose database software.,
Think about who will be using the database software.,
Look for security features.,
Find out whether you need a non-relational database.,
Spend some time learning the basics of databases.",How to Choose Database Software," Base your decision on how the software meets the needs of your organization, rather than familiarity with the platform that the program is developed in.;
, Most likely, multiple users will need access to the database at the same time, so the database should support multiple users. Even if you start with a single user, plan for growth of your organization, and expect others to need access to data.

, Microsoft Access and SQL server are some common packages that are easy to use for building a simple database. If you need more advanced designs, it may be better to purchase a system that contains most of the features you need and have it customized, rather than build a custom application.

, While it can be overwhelming and time consuming to examine products in detail, it can take much longer to try to get a database to work if it just doesn't meet your needs.

, Databases hosted on an Internet site have a smaller footprint, without the need for a server and related expenses like support and backup.

, Simple programs like MySQL are free, or very inexpensive, and are useful for many small applications. They can be customized while still saving on overall expense.

, It should be simple enough for the most inexperienced user, with features to ensure that data is entered correctly and checked for errors. Ideally, the database should offer the ability to customize interfaces for power users and administrators.

, Any database that stores private information should be protected from intruders. Companies that collect credit card information are required to encrypt data stored in databases and meet other requirements.

, Most database platforms are relational databases that that use structure or schema, based on tables and fields that relate to each other and include common elements. Non-relational databases are useful for capturing values from non-standard elements like web content, emails and documents.

, Knowing the lingo will make it easier to communicate with vendors and compare options. Get to understand the types of databases and platforms, including Microsoft Access and SQL server as well as free database options.

A blank database is a standard Access database, and is good for local use. Creating a blank database will create one table as well.
Web databases are designed to be compatible with Access’s web publishing tools. Creating a blank database will create one table as well.
Templates are pre-built databases designed for a wide range of uses. Pick a template if you don’t want to spend a lot of time putting the database structure together.;
, Once you’ve selected a database type, give it a name that reflects what it’s for. This will be especially helpful if you’re going to be working with several different databases. Type the file name of your database in the ""File Name"" box. Choose ""Create"" to generate the new database file.

, If you are creating a blank database, you’ll want to think about the best way to organize your data, and add the appropriate structure. There are several ways that you can format and interact with your data in Access:


Tables – This is the main way that data is stored in your database. Tables can be compared to spreadsheets in Excel: the data is organized in rows and columns. Because of this, importing data from Excel and other spreadsheet programs is a relatively straightforward process.
Forms – Forms are the way that data is added to your database. While you can enter the data into the database directly into the tables, using forms allows for quicker and more visual data entry.
Reports – These summarize and display the data in your database. Reports are for analyzing data and returning answers to specific questions, such as how much profit was made, or where customers are located. These are usually designed to be printed out.
Queries – This is how you retrieve and filter your data. You can use queries to display specific entries from multiple tables. You can also use queries to create and update data.

, If you are starting a blank database, you will automatically begin with a blank table. You can begin entering your data into this table, either by hand or by copying and pasting from another source.


Each piece of data should be give its own column (field), while each record should be a separate row. For example, each row would be a customer while each field would be a different piece of information about that customer (first name, last name, email address, phone number, etc.).
You can rename the column labels to make it easy to tell what field is what. Double click the column heading to change the name.

, If you want to import from a supported file or location, you can set Access to grab the information and add it to your database. This is useful for grabbing data off of a web server or some other shared resource.


Click the External Data tab.
Select the file type that you are importing. In the “Import and Link” section, you will see a few options for data types. You can click the More button to see more option. ODBC stands for Open Database Connectivity, and includes databases such as SQL.
Navigate to the location of the data. If it is on a server, you will need to provide the server address.
In the next window, choose ""Specify how and where you want to store the data in the current database."" Choose ""OK."" Follow the steps to import your data.

, You will want to keep your different records in different databases. This will help keep your databases running smoothly. For example, you may have a table of customer information and another table for order information. You will then be able to link the customer information into the order information table.


In the Create section of the Home tab, click the table button. A new table will appear in your database. You can enter information in the same way you did for the first table.

, Each table will have one primary key that is unique for each entry. By default, Access creates an ID column that increases in number for each entry. This is set as the primary key. Tables can also have foreign keys. These are fields that are linked with another table in the database. The linked fields would contain the same data.


For example, in your Orders table, you may have a Customer ID field to track which customer ordered which product. You can create a relationship for that field with the ID field in your Customer table.
Using relationships helps keep your data consistent, efficient, and readable.

, Click the Relationships button in the Relationships section. This will open a new window with an overview of all of the tables in the database. Each field will be listed underneath its table’s name.


You will need to have created the field for the foreign key before you create the relationship. For example, if you want to use the Customer ID on the Orders table, create a field in the Orders table called Customer and leave it blank. Make sure it is the same format as the field you are linking (numbers in this case).

, Drop it to the field that you created for the foreign key. Click Create in the window that appears to set the relationship for the fields. A line will appear between the two tables, connecting the fields.


Check the box to “Enforce Referential Integrity” when creating the relationship. This means that if data is changed in one field, the other field is automatically updated. This will help keep your data accurate.

, Queries are actions that let you quickly view, add, and edit the data in your database. There are a wide variety of query types, ranging from simple lookups to the creation of new tables based on existing data. Queries are essential tools for building reports.Queries are broken down into two main types: Select and Action. Select queries pull data from tables and can make calculations. Action queries can add, edit, and delete data from tables.

, If you want to create a basic select query, use the Query Wizard to walk you through the steps. You can access the Query Wizard from the Create tab. This will allow you to view specific fields from a table.

, You can use criteria to narrow down your select query and only display the information you need. To start, click the Create tab and select Query Deign.

, The Show Table box will open. Double-click the table that you want to run the query on, and then click Close.

, Double-click on each field in the table that you want to add to the query. The fields will be added to the Design grid.

, You can use several different types of criteria, such as text or functions. For example, if you wanted to only display prices higher than $50 from your “Prices” field, you would enter >=50 into the criteria. If you wanted to only show customers from the UK, you would type UK into the Criteria field.


You can use multiple criteria per query.

, The Run button is located on the Design tab. Your Query results will be displayed in the window. Press Ctrl + S to save the query.

, A parameter query will allow you to specify what you want to retrieve each time the query is run. For example, if you have a database with customers from various cities, you can run a parameter query to ask which city you want to display results for.

, Add fields to be retrieved in the query by double-clicking them in the table overview.

, Parameters are denoted by “.


You can end parameters with “?” or “:”, but not with “!” or “.”

, You can use multiple parameters to create a custom range for your query results. For example, if the field is a Date field, you can return a range of dates by typing Between And . You will receive two prompts when you run the query., You can use queries to pull specific data from existing tables and create a new table with this data. This is especially useful if you want to share specific parts of your database, or create specific forms for subsets of your database. You will need to create a regular select query first.

, Double-click on the tables that you want to pull your data from. You can pull from multiple tables if necessary.

, Double-click each field that you want to add from the table overview. It will be added to your query grid.

, If you want to specify specific data from a field, use the criteria section to set the filter. See the “Creating a Select Query with Criteria” section above for more details.

, Before you create your table, run the query to ensure that it is pulling all of the correct data. Adjust your criteria and fields until you get all of the data that you want.

, Press Ctrl + S to save the query for later use. It will appear in your navigation frame on the left side of the screen. Click on the query to select it again and then click on the Design tab.

, A window will appear asking for your new table name. Enter the name for the table and click OK.

, Your new table will be created with the query you established. The table will appear in your navigation frame on the left.

, You can use an append query to add data to a table that already exists from another table. This is useful if you need to add more data to a table you created with a make table query.

, This will open the Append dialog box. Select the table you want to append.

, For example, if you created a table with the criteria “2010” for the Year field, change it to the year you want to add, such as “2011”.

, Make sure to set the correct fields for each column that you are appending. For example, when using the above changes, data should be appending to the Year field on the Append To row.

, Click the Run button on the Deign tab. The query will be run and the data will be added to the table. You can open the table to verify that the data was added correctly.

, Forms allow you to easily see the data for each field, as well as quickly switch between records or create new ones. Forms are essential for extended periods of data entry, as most people find them much easier to work with than tables.

, This will create a form based on the fields contained in the table automatically. Access does a pretty good job of automatically creating fields that are the correct size, but you can resize and move around any elements on the form that you want.


If you don’t want a specific field to be displayed on the form, you can right-click on it and select Delete.
If your tables have relationships, a datasheet will appear beneath each record, showing the connected data. You can edit your connected data this way much easier. For example, each sales rep in your database may have a customer database attached to their record.

, The arrow buttons at the bottom move from record to record. The fields will be populated by your record data as you switch between them. You can use the buttons on the edges to move to the first or last record.

, This is located in the upper-left corner, and will allow you to start changing the values of your table by using the form.

, You can edit the text in any field of each record to change the data in the table. The changes will reflect automatically in the table, as well as in any connected tables.

, Click the “Add Record” button near the navigation buttons to create a new record at the end of the list. You can then use the fields to input data into the blank record in the table. This is a much easier way to add new information than through the table view.

, Make sure to save your form by pressing Ctrl + S so that you can easily access it again later. It will appear in your navigation frame on the left side of the screen., Reports allow you to quickly display summaries of your data. They are often used for income and shipping reports, and can be tailored to just about any use. Reports draw data from either tables or queries that you have created.

, Select the type of report you want to create. There are a few different ways you can go about creating a report. Access can create your report for you automatically, or you can create a custom one.


Report – This will create an auto-report with all of the data from your source. Nothing will be grouped, but for small databases this is probably sufficient for showing what you need.
Blank Report – This will create an empty report that you can fill with your data as you see fit. You will be able to choose from any available field to create a custom report.
Report Wizard – The report wizard will guide you through the report creation process, allowing to to choose and group your data, and then format it accordingly.

, If you’ve selected to create a blank report, you’ll need to select a source for it. First, click the Arrange tab and then select Property Sheet. Alternatively, you can also press Alt + Enter.


Click the down arrow next to the Record Source field. A list of your available tables and queries will appear. Select one and it will be assigned to the report.

, Once you have a source, you can start adding fields from it to your report. Click the Format tab, and then click Add Existing Fields. The Field List will appear in the right frame.


Click and drag the fields you want to add into the Design frame. The record will appear in the report. As you add additional fields, they will be lined up automatically with existing fields.
You can resize fields by clicking on the edges and dragging the mouse.
Delete fields from the report by clicking on the heading and pressing the Delete key.

, Groups allow you to quickly parse information in a report, as they allow you to organize related information. For example, you may want to group sales by region or by salesperson. Groups allow you to do this.


Click the Design tab, click the Group & Sort button.
Right-click on any part of the field you want to add to a group. Select Group On from the menu.
A header will be crated for the group. You can adjust the header to whatever you want to label the group.

, Once your report is finalized, you can save it and then share it or print it like any document. Use this to share company performance with investors, contact information to employees, and much more."

Consider the needs of the business.,
Install or otherwise obtain MS Access to create your inventory database.,
Craft your MS Access database.,
Finish building your MS Access database, fine-tuning it according to your notes and other guidance.,
Populate the inventory database with information.

,
Link the MS Access inventory database to other technology as appropriate.",How to Make an Inventory Database in Access,"

Think about what this resource should look like from a nontechnical point of view before starting to implement an inventory database with MS Access.



 


Develop sketches, mockups and other resources for implementing the inventory database. Think about what key details will be needed, as well as who will be using the software, and plan accordingly. This includes brainstorming what aspects of inventory are most applicable. For instance, you can consider whether age factors can affect turnover for items, or whether various small differences in products need to be noted.






Figure out how to implement your MS Access tool within an overall software architecture. Sometimes, businesses with SaaS or cloud products need to think about how their MS Access databases will interact with other programs. Rely on skilled IT staff, as necessary, to work through this issue.





;
,


Make sure you have the computer and tools you need and you know where the database will be hosted--on the computer, on internal servers or by a third party.







,

Add specific fields as necessary. Usual additions to MS Access databases for inventory include dates as well as quantitative fields like ""units ordered"" and ""units received."" As noted above, locations for production or product details may also apply.






Populate the fields with all appropriate information from preexisting paper or digital forms of documentation. If information is missing, gather it and add it to your fields.







,


Link or establish relationships between the fields. Figure out which values you will need to have returned when using the database and create a strategic way to store them. Experts advise against having duplicate data in multiple fields. Instead, find a way to return more than one field with a query.







,, Some advanced database managers use technologies like MySQL or other database tools to structure queries for databases. This may, or may not, apply to your database handling situation.


Delegate advanced work to specialized database managers as necessary. Many companies and businesses employ these individuals to handle higher functions of databases. Make sure the correct staff implementation is in place to most accurately handle your finished product.

The application is available in various iterations, including Office 365, which you can ""rent"" for less than $10 a month, by purchasing Microsoft Office for Windows on disc at a retail store or online, or by buying Access as a separate application from Microsoft online. Access is not available on any other operating system other than Windows.


All of the latest information on Office is available at Office.com. If you want the Windows version of Office on Mac, get a compatible copy of Windows and run it alongside OS X with Mac's Boot Camp software.;
, You can use cloud storage such as Microsoft OneDrive or DropBox so that your files are available from anywhere that you can access the Internet, store your files locally on your computer or other network, or save copies in multiple places to be really secure.

, Unless you have the CD you will have to download and execute (double click the file) a Setup file and then install over the Internet. You can choose which applications to install -- Office includes Access in the main suite unless you deselect it deliberately. Your computer may restart one or more times during the process.

, To find the program, click the ""Access"" icon in your All Apps list on the Start menu. The app appears giving you choices of what type of project you want. With a blank database you can keep reports of people you owe money to -- or people who owe money to you -- or for lists of invoices, large databases of postal or e-mail addresses, or other large amounts of data.


Access is a much more powerful tool for these chores than is Microsoft Excel. Access can work easily with Excel by importing data from (and exporting data to) that application via buttons on Access' External Data tab.
To make it easier to start the program in the future you can right-click the icon and choose ""Pin to Taskbar"" to pin the icon to your taskbar.

, You can play around with the other options when you get more experience with the basics. The program starts with a new file named ""Database1"" by default and a brand-new table in front of you called ""Table1.""


Databases store data in raw format in tables that tell Access where to allocate space on a hard drive for the data you put into each table cell.
You can also use the ""Tab"" key to get to the next field or use your arrow keys.

, A menu appears; from this menu you choose a data type for the field; options include ""Short Text” for short text boxes, such as for names or postal addresses, ""Number,” “Currency,” “Date and Time,” or one of the other choices.

, Note that the first field of the table fills in with ID numbers automatically as you add items in the rows and column(s) at right, hence its name ""ID"" -- you can change this behavior as you gain experience using the software.

, Specifically, create new columns, add data to rows, and rename columns as you need.

, To do so, click the “File” tab and then click “Save As.” Leave the choices as they are by default and click “Save As” again. Click ""Yes"" when Access asks if it can close all objects to save. The file is saved.


If you ever choose to move your database to the cloud or another device, Access can help you format your data for the new platform. Just click ""File"" and then ""Save As"" and you’ll see the formats available in the window pane at right.

For example, a customer that was entered into the database twice may have two different IDs and potentially different spellings. On the other hand, if the name is common it could be two different customers. You'll need to compare the data available and check each result carefully to determine what is and isn't duplicate.;
, It is recommended that you create a new backup before making big changes. This way you can restore the database if you accidentally delete the wrong entries.


Click the File menu and select ""Save As"" or ""Save & Publish"".
Click ""Backup Database"" in the Advanced section. Follow the prompts to backup your database.

, In order to avoid data conflicts, try to ensure that no other users will be adding data to the database. This isn't required, but can save you some headache later if things go wrong.


Set your database to Exclusive mode if you can. This will prevent any changes from being made by other users. Click the File menu and select ""Options"", then select ""Client Settings"". In the ""Default open mode"" section, select ""Exclusive"". If you don't have many people using the database, you generally don't need to worry about this.

, The Query tool can find entries that contain duplicate content. The process for starting the wizard varies depending on the version of Access you are using:2013/2010 - Click the ""Create"" tab and then click ""Query Wizard"".
2007 - Click the ""Insert"" or ""Create"" tab and select ""Query Wizard"".
2003 - Open the Database window and select the ""Queries"" tab. Click the ""New"" button.

, This query compares fields to find duplicate entries.

, All of the tables in your database will be listed. Select the table you want to check for duplicates.


For most duplicate checking, you'll want to keep the ""Tables"" view selected.

, Select all of the fields that you want to compare for duplicate data. Include enough fields to make a judgment. Duplicates are only returned if the fields match character for character. You can use expressions to find partial matches.Avoid using general fields. Avoid using fields like the date or location to reduce clutter when comparing entries.
Without enough fields to make a distinction between records, or with fields that are too general, you'll get a lot of duplicate results.

, An additional field or two can help you decide if the data is actually duplicate. For example, an Order ID field will help you determine if the same name twice are separate entries. Include at least one field to help make this distinction and prevent accidental data loss.

, You'll be prompted to give the query a name. Click ""Finish"" to see the results.

, Any potential duplicates based on your criteria will be displayed. Go through each of the results and use the knowledge you have about your company to decide if the entry is a duplicate. Make absolutely sure that a record is a duplicate before you remove it.


If you can't decide, recreate the query with an additional field to help you make your decision.

, Right-click on the left column and select ""Delete Record"" to remove a duplicate. You can select multiple records to delete them all at once.You may want to merge some data from one of the duplicate records into the record you plan to keep.
Make sure to not delete all of the records that appear on the duplicate result list, or you won't have an original record left.

Text within a bookmark can be edited the same as text outside the bookmark. If you cut or copy a portion of the bookmarked text to a new location, the moved text is not bookmarked. If you add to the text within the bookmark brackets, the new text becomes part of the bookmarked text; if you delete part of the text inside the bookmark brackets, the bookmark remains with the remaining text.

If you copy a bookmarked item to another document, including the bookmark brackets, both the original and the new document will have bookmarks. For this reason, it's a good idea to display any bookmarks before editing your text to make sure the bookmarks end up where you want them to end up when you're done editing.

,
Select the type of positioning from the ""Object Position"" dropdown list.,
Set the text alignment.,
Click ""OK"" to close the dialog box.",How to Position Graphics in Microsoft Publisher1," Microsoft Publisher graphic images can be positioned either of 2 ways, inline or exact. The type of positioning you want depends on how you will use the graphic.


Inline graphics are treated as part of the text block they accompany and will move as you type, remove, or replace the text in that block. Inline graphics are best suited for charts, graphs, and example photographs and drawings that illustrate the points made in the text adjacent to them.
Exact position graphics are placed in a specific location on the page and do not move unless you specifically move them somewhere else. They are suited for such things as byline photos at the top of the first page and attention-grabbing images at the top, center, or bottom of a page. Microsoft Publisher uses exact positioning as its default setting for any graphic image you add to a publication.;
, This displays a popup menu.

, This displays the ""Format Picture"" dialog, which displays a set of tabs at the top.

,,


Choose ""Inline"" to make the graphic an inline graphic.
Choose ""Exact"" to make the graphic use exact positioning.

, The alignment options differ for inline and for exact position graphics, as described below.


The 3 radio button options under ""Horizontal alignment"" govern the position of an inline graphic relative to the adjacent text. Select ""Left"" to place the graphic to the left of the text, ""Right"" to place it to the right of the text, and ""Move object with text"" to let the graphic move when the text is edited.
The 4 boxes under ""Position on page"" govern the position of an exact positioned graphic on the page. The ""Horizontal"" and ""Vertical"" spin boxes specify the numeric distance and the ""From"" dropdown after each spin box determines whether that distance is from the top left corner, center, or top right corner.

, The graphic is now of the type and in the position you specified.

"
"
Select the graphic you wish to move.,
Move your cursor over any part of the graphic other than the sizing handles.,
Press and hold your left mouse button.

,
Drag the graphic to where you want to place it in the publication.

,
Release the mouse button.",How to Position Graphics in Microsoft Publisher2," The graphic will be surrounded by white, sizing handle dots.

, Your cursor will change to a 4-headed arrow.


If your cursor passes over a sizing handle, it will instead change to a 2-headed arrow. If you continue to move your cursor toward the center of the picture without pressing your mouse button, it will change to a 4-headed arrow.

,,, Your graphic is now in its new position.


This method produces the same results as using the ""Position on page"" options in the ""Format Picture"" dialog to position an exact position graphic. You'll find this method easier to use because you can see where the graphic is being positioned as you move it. You'll also use this method to position copies you make of a graphic in their desired locations.
You can also move your cursor over the graphic without first selecting it. Your cursor will change to a 4-headed arrow; once you hold down your left mouse button, the graphic will be selected and you can then drag it to its new location

, Your cursor will change to a 2-headed arrow. If you place it over a sizing handle at the top or bottom, it will be a vertical arrow; if you place it over a sizing handle on either the left or right side, it will be a horizontal arrow; and if you place it over a corner handle, it will be a diagonal arrow.

,, Drag your cursor toward the center of the graphic to make it smaller or away from the center to make the graphic larger.

, Your graphic is now resized.


Be aware that significantly resizing a graphic will change its resolution. Making a graphic twice as large will reduce its resolution by half, while making it half its size will double its resolution. Graphics for printed publications should have a resolution of 200 to 300 dpi, while graphics for the Internet should have a resolution of 72 to 96 dpi. For this reason, it is helpful to choose graphic images as close to the size you need in the beginning so that you have to resize them only slightly, if at all.

,, Drag to the right to rotate the graphic clockwise or to the left to rotate the graphic counterclockwise.

, Rotated graphics can be more visually appealing than graphics in their normal orientation and provide an illusion of movement without the distraction an animated graphic can produce.


You can also rotate a graphic in Microsoft Publisher 2003 and 2007 by selecting ""Rotate"" or ""Flip"" on the ""Arrange"" menu and then clicking ""Free Rotate"" after first selecting the graphic. This will put rotation handles on each corner, after which you move your cursor over one of the handles and drag the picture clockwise or counterclockwise.

, You'll choose ""Flip Horizontal"" to flip the graphic side-over-side (around its vertical axis) or ""Flip Vertical"" to flip the graphic top to bottom (around its horizontal axis). Where these commands are located depends on your version of Publisher.


In Microsoft Publisher 2003 and 2007, select ""Rotate and Flip"" from the ""Arrange"" menu. Select ""Flip Horizontal"" or ""Flip Vertical"" from the ""Rotate and Flip"" submenu.
In Microsoft Publisher 2010, select ""Flip Horizontal"" or ""Flip Vertical"" from the ""Rotate"" dropdown in the ""Arrange"" group on the ""Home"" menu ribbon.
When flipping a graphic, consider any details that may be reversed when you flip it. Items such as reversed text or even the way clothing wraps around a man's or woman's body can make a flipped graphic look ""wrong.""

Start Microsoft Access and open your database;
,
Start the User-Level Security Wizard by clicking on the Tools menu, point to Security, and then click on User-Level Security Wizard.,
Click Next

By default, Access will create a unique, 4 to 20 character string at random that is case sensitive, and associates an identity to the workgroup, otherwise referred to as a WID.,
Ensure that the ""I want to create a shortcut to open my secured database"" option is selected, before clicking Next.

,
Click Next

The wizard then will ask you what objects in your database do you want to secure.,

Click Finish.,
The Security Wizard will then tell you that it encrypted the database and that you must exit Access and open the database in the future by using the shortcut on the Windows desktop to the database's WID.

",How to Establish User Level Security in Microsoft Access,",


The wizard will immediately ask you to create a workgroup information file. It will create an un-secure backup of the database, and then move to secure the current database. You will need to put in information about the users who will develop and use the database.







, For security purposes the WID is hidden here.







,, By default, Access will secure all existing database objects and all new objects. You can select objects that will not be secured, meaning ALL users will have full permissions for that object. It's recommended that you don't bypass security for any object within your database.







, The next screen allows you to include pre-defined groups within your workgroup. If you click on each group (do not put a checkmark beside any yet), you can read a brief description of each group. To make it easier to track, it's recommended that you change the Group ID of any groups you include to something easier to work with.







,


In addition to these available groups, Access creates two other groups, Users and Admins. By default, all database users are added into the Users group. Those users who are in the Admins group have full permissions and are the only users that can create permissions and groups. For this exercise, the ""No, the Users group should not have any permissions"" option will be selected.







, NOTE: When entering passwords, they are shown in plain text for all to see.

, By default, the Admins group will be present. If specified that the Users group shouldn't have permissions, then the Users group will not be present.







,, You will want to remove the .bak file extension and replace it with a .mdb extension. For example: You can store your backup to C:\reunion\backup.mdb

,


Access will then create the workgroup information file(WID), a secured version of your database, an unsecured version to the location you specified, and a One-Step Security wizard report.
The One-Step security wizard report lists the name of the secured and unsecured databases, the name and properties the WID, the name of all secured and unsecured objects, group names and properties, and all user information.
It is recommended that you print a hard copy of the report and place it in a secure location because of the sensitivity of some of the information contained.
Do not save the report.

The second line, the TO line, tells where the database is to be backed up. It goes directly under the BACKUP DATABASE line, without indenting, and is written in the form TO backup_device , where ""backup_device"" represents the device on which the backup will be created, and the phrase in brackets specifies up to 64 devices on which backups can be created. (The brackets indicate that specifying additional devices is optional, while the comma indicates that commas separate the names of the backup devices listed.)
The optional third line, the WITH line, is typically indented and lists the options with which the backup will be created, such as the name of and description for the backup set, whether the backup medium is to be formatted before the backup is created and whether the backup should be created in a compressed format. The line's format is ""WITH with_options "", where ""with_options"" represents the name of an option and """" specifies additional options that go with a particular option. (The brackets indicate that specifying additional options is optional, while the comma indicates that commas separate the names of each option. Also, subsequent options are typically given their own lines to make the code easier to read.);
, You'll need to know the name of the database to be backed up and the backup device or devices to which the database backup will be written.


The database's name goes in the BACKUP DATABASE line; thus, if the database to be backed up where named ""Fred,"" the statement would be written as ""BACKUP DATABASE Fred.""
Databases can be backed up to physical devices, such as disk or tape, or to a logical device. If the database is to be backed up to disk, the TO line is written ""TO DISK = ,"" with the pathname to the disk specified after the equal sign. If the database is to be backed up to tape, the TO line is written ""TO TAPE = ,"" with the pathname specified after the equal sign. If the database is to be backed up to a logical device, the word ""TO"" is followed by the name of the backup device; if the backup device were named ""Barney,"" the format would be ""TO Barney."" If there is a second device named ""Wilma,"" the TO line would be written ""TO Barney, Wilma"" or ""TO Wilma, Barney.""

, Database backups can be compressed or uncompressed, be appended to existing media sets or be placed on new media sets, or given names and descriptions of their contents. All these options can be specified on the WITH line, in any order.


Compression options are either ""COMPRESSION,"" to compress the data when the backup is created, or ""NO_COMPRESSION,"" to create the backup without compressing the data.
Naming the backup set is done with ""NAME =,"" followed by a name of up to 128 characters, without spaces. Describing the backup set is done with ""DESCRIPTION =,' followed by a string of up to 255 characters that contains the description.
If the backup is to be added to an existing media set, this can either be explicitly stated by typing ""NOINIT"" or not specifying anything. If the backup is to be saved onto a medium for the first time, or all previous backups are to be overwritten, type ""FORMAT,"" optionally followed by a comma and ""MEDIANAME=,"" a comma and ""MEDIADESCRIPTION ="" if you wish to specify a name of up to 128 characters for the backup medium and a description of up to 255 characters.

, The BACKUP DATABASE statement may be preceded by other statements, such as the USE statement to define the name of the database to be backed up and the EXEC statement to define the logical device to which the backup will be created.

Publisher lets you make a 3- or 4-panel brochure design on any of a number of paper sizes. Before deciding on whether to make a 3-panel or 4-panel brochure, you may want to fold a sheet of paper of the size you want to print your brochure on in thirds or quarters to help you decide which design you want to make. (A misprinted document is a good choice for this.)
Page size options are not available if you choose to make your brochure from a blank size template.

, If you plan to mail your brochure to prospective customers, you'll want to allow panel space for a mailing and return address. (You supply the mailing addresses from a mail merge from a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or a Microsoft Access database.) If you plan to hand it out instead, you won't need to allow panel space for a mailing address, although you'll likely want to have your company name and address on the brochure.


In Publisher 2003, select ""Include"" under Customer Address to include a mailing address or select ""None"" to exclude it.

Order form. Choose this option if your brochure is a sales brochure from which customers can order the products described in it.
Response form. Choose this option if your brochure is intended to present your current products or services and solicit information from your customers about new products, changes to products, or improvements to services they'd like to see.
Sign-up form. Choose this option if your brochure is a sales brochure selling a service for customers to register for.
Form designs are not available if you choose to make your brochure from a blank template.

, Each brochure template comes with a default color and font scheme, but if you wish to use a different color or font scheme, you can do so by selecting the appropriate new scheme. Choose a new color scheme from one of the named color schemes in the Color Scheme dropdown and a new font from the Font Scheme dropdown.


You can also create your own custom color or font scheme by selecting the ""Create new"" option from either the Color Scheme or the Font Scheme dropdown.
If you are producing other marketing materials in Publisher, such as flyers, gift certificates, or special stationery, you should choose the same color and font scheme for all these materials to present a consistent brand identity for your business.

""Address only."" Choose this option to display only the mailing and return address on the mailing side of the postcard invitation.
""Map."" Choose this option if your invitation is to an event and you plan to include a simple map to direct people to its location. This option is more commonly used for invitations to business events, but a map can help people find their way to the site of a wedding reception or graduation ceremony as readily as to a sale. (You'll need to replace the placeholder map with your own.)
""Speaker notes."" Choose this option if your invitation is to an event featuring a political, business, or motivational speakers to include a short list of the most important speakers.
""Promotional text."" Choose this option if the invitation is to a sales event and you want to list some of the major items for sale in a special offer that's explained in greater detail on the other side of the card.
""Appointment text."" Choose this option to make note of the time and place of an event. You can add your contact phone, fax, and email. (You can change or delete the line ""To confirm or cancel appointment"" if it's not appropriate to your invitation's purpose.)
These options are not available when creating a postcard invitation from a blank template.

, A postcard invitation differs from an invitation card in that the latter is enclosed in an addressed envelope, while the postcard invitation carries the mailing information on its back side. Including your information for the return address is handled the same way in Microsoft Publisher for postcard invitations as your version of Publisher handles your personal or company information if you choose to include it on an invitation card.


To handle the mailing addresses, you can create a mail merge using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, an Access database, or a Word document.

, As with invitation cards, click the ""Create"" button at the bottom of the task pane in either Publisher 2007 or 2010, while Publisher 2003 assumes the postcard is being created from the moment you choose ""Postcards"" from the New Publications task pane.

If you don't see the design you want and you have an Internet connection, you can download additional templates from Microsoft.;
, Most flyers are handed out directly to customers (handbills) or placed at locations where people can take them with them as reminders of the event they promote. However, sale, fundraiser, and special offer events are often sent as direct mail to targeted customers to elicit a greater response than would be achieved by handing out or placing flyers. Adding an address to a flyer in Publisher creates a second (back) page, the top third of which includes spaces for a mailing and return address. (You supply the mailing addresses from a mail merge from a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or a Microsoft Access database.) To make the flyer a self-mailer, do the following:


In Publisher 2003, select ""Include"" under Customer Address to include a mailing address or select ""None"" to exclude it.
In Publisher 2007 and 2010, check the ""Include customer address"" box to include a mailing address and uncheck the box to leave it off.
The option to include a mailing section on the back of the flyer is not available if you choose to make your flyer from a blank template.

, Some of the available templates include a sunset graphic as a placeholder image and offer you the option of including or excluding the graphic in your flyer. Including a graphic can add visual appeal to your flyer, particularly if the graphic is relevant to the specific event, announcement, or offer it is promoting. If you keep the placeholder graphic in when creating your flyer, you can later change it for your own graphic image.


To include the graphic placeholder in Publisher 2003, select ""Include"" under Graphic to include it or select ""None"" to exclude it.
To include your own graphic in Publisher 2007 or 2010, check the ""Include graphic"" box to include the graphic and uncheck the box to exclude it.
This option is not available if you choose to make your flyer from a blank template. You can, however, insert a picture or other graphic object with the Insert Picture feature in your version of Publisher.

, If you're using your flyer to get information from the people who see it, or to promote a sale or special offer, you'll likely want to add tear-offs to get that information from them or to put a coupon in their hands to encourage them to come. The Tear-offs dropdown offers several options:


None. Choose this option if your flyer is designed solely to present information to the reader without offering him or her any incentives or soliciting information from the reader in return.
Contact information. Choose this option if your flyer is designed to solicit customers and have people tear off your contact information while the flyer remains posted to attract other customers. (Some templates are already designed to feature this kind of tear-off and so do not support the Tear-offs dropdown options.)
Coupon. Choose this option if your flyer is promoting a sale or special offer and you wish to offer a discount to people who respond to your advertisement.
Order form. Choose this option if your flyer is promoting a special offer on a product or service and you are soliciting orders from customers with it.
Response form. Choose this option if your flyer is promoting a product, service, or event and you are trying to find out if someone is interested in it to follow up with more information. (Some templates are already designed to solicit this information and so do not support the Tear-offs dropdown options.)
Sign-up form. Choose this option if, as for the response form, your flyer is promoting an event and you are trying to find out if someone is interested in it and, more importantly, willing to take part in or assist with it. Sign-up forms are more likely to be used with posted flyers, while response forms are more suited to self-mailers. (Some templates are already designed to solicit this information and so do not support the Tear-offs dropdown options.)
Tear-off options are also unavailable if you are creating your flyer from scratch.

, Each flyer template comes with a default color and font scheme, but if you wish to use a different color or font scheme, you can do so by selecting the appropriate new scheme. Choose a new color scheme from one of the named color schemes in the Color Scheme dropdown and a new font from the Font Scheme dropdown.


You can also create your own custom color or font scheme by selecting the ""Create new"" option from either the Color Scheme or the Font Scheme dropdown.
If you are producing other marketing materials in Publisher, such as brochures, gift certificates, or special stationery, you should choose the same color and font scheme for all these materials to present a consistent brand identity for your business.

, If you're using Publisher 2003, the program prompts you for this information the first time you use it. Afterwards, you select this information from Personal Information in the Edit menu to insert it in your flyer. In Publisher 2007 and 2010, you can select your company information set from the Business Information dropdown or select ""Create new"" to create a new information set. This information will be inserted into your flyer.

Edit the text as necessary.",How to Design a Calendar in Microsoft Publisher3," Both of these buttons are found in the Objects toolbar. The Word Art button displays a pair of capital A's leaning to the right, while the Text Box button resembles a newspaper page, with a capital ""A"" in the upper left.


Use the Word Art option for short, decorative text. Word Art offers the option to shape the text layout as well as change the font, size and color or bold and italicize.
Use the Text Box option for longer text. You can change the font, size and color or bold and italicize, but you can't change the shape and layout as you can with Word Art. You can, however, change the color of the box the text appears in.

, The order in which you do these two steps depends on whether you're inserting Word Art or text in a text box.


If you're inserting Word Art, select one of the style options from the Word Art Gallery, then select your font options and enter your text. When you click ""OK,"" your text will appear surrounded by sizing handle dots. You can move this text to the place you want by placing your cursor over the text so that your cursor pointer becomes a four-headed arrow. Use your mouse to drag the Word Art text where you want it.
If you're inserting a text box, move your cursor to where you want to put the text box, then drag your mouse button to create the text box in the size you want. (The box will appear surrounded by sizing handles when you release the cursor, allowing you to re-size the text box if necessary.) Type your text at the cursor.

, Once you've placed your text as Word Art or in a text box, you can modify its appearance as you wish by first clicking on it and following the instructions below.


To modify the appearance of Word Art, use one of the options in the floating Word Art toolbar to change the color, shape or formatting � or to choose a new option from the Word Art Gallery.
To change the appearance of text in a text box, click on the box with your right mouse button to display a floating menu. Choose an option in the Change Text sub-menu to alter the text's appearance, such as Font to change the font and point size. Select Format Text Box to change the text box's appearance, such as adding a fill color to the box or a border. To change the text itself, click on it to highlight it and type the new text, or place your cursor at a point in the text to insert or delete individual text characters.
You can make changes to either Word Art or text box text, but you cannot directly change one into the other. You can, however, select the text from a text box or Text field in the Edit Word Art Text dialog, copy it to the Clipboard by pressing Ctrl-C on your keyboard and then paste it into the other place by pressing Ctrl-V.

By holding your left mouse button down and moving your cursor toward the center of the frame, you make it smaller. If you instead move your cursor away from the center of the frame, you make it larger.

, You do this in Microsoft Publisher's Insert Picture dialog, which lists the folders on your computer. You navigate to the folder that contains the photo you want to insert in your publication. How you access the Insert Picture dialog depends on your version of Publisher.


In Publisher 2003, select ""Picture"" from File.
In Publisher 2007, either select ""From File�"" from the Picture submenu of the Insert menu or click the ""Insert Picture"" button on the Picture toolbar.
In Publisher 2010, select ""Picture"" from the Objects group in the Home menu ribbon, from the Illustrations group in the Insert menu ribbon, or from the Insert group on the Picture Tools Format ribbon.

, Embedded pictures become part of the destination publication file; if you change the original picture in another program, you won't see the changes in the embedded copy. You can also move the original picture to a different location on your computer, and the picture will still appear in the publication. Linked pictures are connected to, but not physically part of, the destination publication file; any changes you make to the original picture in another program will appear in the publication file as soon as you open it.

, Follow the instructions that come with your scanner or camera for connecting it to your computer and for having the image ready to be scanned or taken.


If you have more than one scanner or camera attached, select which device you're going to use to transfer the image to your publication.

,, This displays the Insert Picture from Scanner or Camera dialog box. If you have more than one scanner or camera attached to your computer, you can select which device you're going to use to transfer the image to your publication from this dialog.


In Publisher 2007, you can also click the ""Insert Picture from Scanner or Camera"" button on the Picture toolbar.
If you have more than one scanner or camera attached to your computer, you can select which device you're going to use to transfer the image to your publication from this dialog.

, If your photo is coming from a digital camera, or if you wish to customize your scanner settings, you can customize your settings by clicking ""Custom Insert."" If your photo is coming from a scanner and you don't wish to customize your settings, click ""Web Quality"" if your publication will be published digitally or ""Print Quality"" if your publication will be printed out, then click ""Insert.""


If your scanner doesn't support an automatic scan, you'll have to use the ""Custom Insert"" button.
When customizing your settings, follow the instructions that accompany the scanner or digital camera you're using.

, For a photograph being scanned, this means perform the scan. For a photograph on a digital camera's memory card, find the folder that contains the photo you want and browse for the picture itself. Click ""Get Pictures"" to transfer the photo to your publication.


Your scanner or camera needs to be either Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) or TWAIN compliant to allow you to transfer images into Microsoft Publisher, and you must have installed the interface software for your device before you can transfer images directly.
Many newer desktop and laptop computers come equipped with memory card readers, as do printers capable of printing copies of digital photographs. If you don't want to connect your camera to your computer, you can instead insert its memory card in the card reader and follow the instructions under ""Adding a Photo From a File"" to insert the photo in your publication. If your computer doesn't have a built-in card reader but does have a USB port, you can buy a separate memory card reader that connects to the USB port.
Microsoft Publisher 2010 does not support the direct input of photographic images from a scanner or digital camera. Instead, you can transfer images from your scanner or digital camera into the Clip Organizer and bring them into your publication from there. While this sacrifices the immediacy of direct transfer into Publisher, it can be beneficial if you decide to use the digital image later in another publication.

Share your Notebook.,
Close your notebooks, if you feel you will no longer have a need to work with them.",How to Use OneNote 2013," Simply click on the application from the Start menu/Start screen, program screen containing all your programs after swiping up (or if you have a Start menu under the All Programs list).


Be careful when opening the Windows Start menu if you are running this on Windows 10. Windows 10 has an integrated OneNote that you should be aware of. The integrated OneNote has a lot less features than OneNote 2013 and if you have that 2013 version should be avoided. (Also, if you didn't update to the overhaul-update in November 2015, your notes on the integrated OneNote won't sync to OneNote 2013 and you'd be fried with lost notes everywhere!) Microsoft gave Windows 10 users a ploy type of program in hopes that people will be like ""Wow!"" in hopes that it would be enough for people to purchase the full version of any of the Office suites which all contain the program.;
, You should have a notebook that says ""__(name)______'s Notebook"" if you are signed into your current Microsoft account (includes Outlook, Hotmail and Windows Live Hotmail), or Office 365. There should be some setup instructions.

, If you want to create a new Notebook click 'Add Notebook' on your left or you can import files as a Notebook. If you've created notebooks on other Microsoft account linked apps or other computers and would like to retrieve them on the computer, after letting your named Notebook load in it's entirety single-click the notebook drop-down and click ""Add Notebook"" then choose one of your open Notebooks in your Microsoft account.

, Although you get a ""Quick notes""(unremovable) section and ""My notes"" section installed to each notebook by default, you can create other sections by clicking on an empty page or on the plus sign to the right of the last section in that particular notebook typing your Notebook sections' name and clicking onto the first page blank page created to save your name.

, Click 'Add Page' and name it whatever you like. OneNote will send you directly to the title portion of the Note, but as you type, the title will appear in the Notes list on the right hand side bar. By default, OneNote will save two how-to like notes in your named Notebook's QuickNotes folder, (one called ""OneNote: one place for all of your notes"" and the other called ""OneNote Basics"".

, Besides the Ribbon and toolbar set (that a majority hate for whatever reason it is)(You'll understand what each section of the Ribbon contains by the end of this article and probably be ready to work and get your notes written and potentially be using your notes soon enough, you have a drop-down list of all your notebooks you've opened, a set of visualized tabs for all your Notebook sections (much like tabs that a regular notebook has with those plastic edges and a thin piece of cardboard and writing on them) as well as a portion for the note itself, while to the right of the note is a listing of Notes inside each section of the Notebook.

, These are all there, even without touching anything (found underneath the Ribbon bar after clicking the Home button).


You can also use the copy, cut and paste options in this part of the bar too, as well as change the text and background colors for text portions of a note as well as create individualistic styles (such as adding to-do like boxes and many other flag-like options from the one box underneath the Home button of the program.
Also from here, you can begin numbered and bulleted lists by clicking the button that describes the list type you'd like.

, Besides adding text, you can also add blank space lines, tables/charts, attached files and linked files, spreadsheets (with Excel 2013 installed) and diagrams (with Visio 2013 or as far back as Visio 2003 installed), screen captures (most must be done with the OneNote Clipper (which is installed by default when you install OneNote for the first time and can't be turned off - ever), many types of image files, audio clippings (if you have access to a microphone that is associated to your computer), video clippings (if there is a webcam associated to your computer), equations and various symbols...all of which can be found underneath the Insert drop-down portion of the Ribbon.

, Besides many drawing tools that will allow you to draw and erase digital ink onscreen, this menu also contains an ""Ink to Math"" option, as well as...at times, an ""Ink to Text"" (but most often Ink to Text is disabled).

, Not only does OneNote 2013 contain ways to spell and grammar check (using the Spelling) tool option on the ribbon, but it also contains ways to research information (such as a translation tool and dictionary as well as a basic search method on Bing) and a separate Thesaurus option/tool from the same portion of the toolbar.

, Use the View menu. Although by default your are shown your notes in ""Normal"" view, there are other ways that notes can be displayed. Also found here are ways to Zoom In/Zoom Out as well as add ruler-lines (by clicking Rule Lines) and adding colors to the background of the document by clicking the ""Page Color"" option.

, With your notebooks synced to one account, you'll never be lost without your notes; so that whether you are at another place in town at a town/village WiFi spot on a PC/Mac or you are able to sign into the account on the OneNote app on your phone (all Windows Phones have this feature installed, as well as Android and iPhones have Microsoft linked apps you can install that will allow you to view your notes), you'll never leave without all your information in one place., (When the program synchronizes, the area of the screen will add a blue set of arrows where your named notebooks are labelled). If you haven't seen this and need to synchronize, right click the option and click ""Synchronize this Notebook Now"" or press ⇧ Shift+F9 then wait for the ""icon"" to disappear and make no other corrections otherwise you'll be out of sync again with the server.

, Right-click the Note section tab, click Section Color and choose your color from the drop-down section that appears.

, Find the Note on the right hand side of the screen, single click the Note, right click this Note title then select ""Move or Copy (Ctrl+⇧ Shift+M)"" locate the Notebook you'd like to place it in on the list of opened notebooks that displays and click either ""Move"" or ""Copy to"" button to do the selected deed.

, Find the Note on the right hand side of the screen, single click the Note, right click this Note title then select ""Delete"", or once you've single clicked the Note, you can press the Delete key on your keyboard.

, Drag the note to place it directly above or directly below the Note that is the parent note in the list of all your notes in the selected notebook section, right click the note and click ""Make Subpage"" (there is no keyboard shortcut for this task). To restore it to it's former location, click the ""Promote Subpage"" from he right-click context list to the Note in question.

, To do this, click 'File' on the left hand side and click 'Share'. Next click 'Invite People' and simply type their email addresses in. You can also right-click a Notebook from your Notebooks list and select Share this Notebook to get you to the same place where you are typing in their email addresses and sending away to the people.

, But realize that closing your notebooks in OneNote won't delete them. Much like closing a paper-like notebook, closing a digital notebook is used the same way - it just makes it disappear until you need it again. Click the Notebooks tab that holds your notebook, right click your notebook and select ""Close this Notebook"" to hide it from your view.

Online Videos can be pulled from sites like YouTube or Vimeo. However, these videos will only work if your computer is hooked up to the internet whenever you show the presentation. If you aren't sure you'll have WiFi later, you could be without a video.

Video on my PC takes a video you have already saved to your computer. If you save the PowerPoint on another hard drive (like a USB), you need to be sure you transfer a copy of the video to the drive as well. Once you have clicked the ""Video"" tool and selected ""Online Video"", there opens a smaller window that gives three options

, There are three methods for adding videos from the internet:



Personal drive: You have the video on a cloud drive, like Dropbox or Google Drive.

YouTube: you use the Youtube address, or URL.

Embed Code: Click on the ""Share"" button on the video page, then copy and paste the ""Embed"" code for the video., Locate your video that is in your PC from the small window that will open up. Select the video to place it in the presentation.


Again, if you plan on moving the presentation, like using a USB drive to carry it or move it, make sure you copy and paste the video you attached into the USB as well. Powerpoint needs to find the video to play it, and if you're on another computer that doesn't have the video you inserted, there will be no video for Powerpoint to play., Once your video is placed you can shrink it, move it, and adjust it to fit into your presentation. You can also right-click it and adjust the ""Preferences"" or ""Settings"" to make it auto-play, to make it full-screen, to adjust volume, and more.

Start with the simplest element – a straight line.,
Click on the Line icon on the Drawing toolbar and place the mouse pointer at the point where you want to start the line (see Figure 3).,
Hold down the Shift key while you draw a line to restrict the angle of the line to a multiple of 45 degrees (0, 45, 90, 135 and so on).

,
Keep the Ctrl key pressed while drawing a line to have the end of the line snap to the nearest grid point.,
Hold down the Alt key while drawing a line results in the line extending outwards symmetrically from the start point (the line will extend out equally each side of the starting point).,
While you are working with this line, look at the information field on the status bar.",How to Draw Lines in Open Office Draw,";
, Drag the mouse while keeping the mouse button pressed. Release the mouse button at the point where you want to end the line.


A blue or green selection handle appears at each end of the line, showing that this is the currently selected object. The colors depend on the standard selection mode – green with a normal selection and blue if you are in the point edit mode (this effect is easily apparent if on the Options toolbar both Simple Handles and Large Handles are switched on.







,,


The spacing (resolution) of the grid points can be adjusted under Tools > Options > OpenOffice.org-Draw > Grid.







, This lets you draw lines by starting from the middle of the line.


The line just drawn has all the standard attributes (such as color and line style). To change any of these line properties, select the line by clicking on it, then right-click and select Line.


, A description of the current activity or status of selection is shown when you are working with an element or elements.

You can add text to all these shapes.

"
"
Know that there are two ways to add text to a drawing; A dynamic text frame as an independent Draw object or as text in a previously drawn object.,
The text tool is activated by clicking on the icon Text for horizontal or for vertical script


(to be able use this latter option you must activate support for Asian languages under Tools > Options > Language Settings > Languages).,
After activating the Text command mode, click at the location where you want to position the text.,
Observe the information field in the status bar: it shows that you are editing text and also provides details about the current cursor location - paragraph, line, and column numbers.,
After choosing the Text icon, you can also draw a frame with the mouse to contain future text.",How to Draw Basic Shapes Using Open Office Draw3," In the latter case the text is integrated with the object.

Use dynamic text frames







,






Text frames can be moved and rotated like all draw objects.







, A small text frame appears. It contains only the cursor. You can move the frame if desired. The Text Formatting toolbar appears and you can choose the font type, font size and other text properties and begin to type in your text.


The text frame grows with the text. You can insert a line break with the Shift+Enter key combination.






The Enter key begins a new paragraph. Neither line breaks nor new paragraphs terminate the text frame.







,


Text properties can also be changed during text input. Any changes will be reflected from the cursor position onwards.







, Line breaks are inserted automatically at the right edge of the frame when the text fills the frame width. You can however—just like when editing other text—insert your own line breaks, begin new paragraphs or change any of the text properties.

"
"
Be aware that a text element is associated with most Draw objects.,
In the middle of the Draw object you will see a black bar as the text cursor; start typing to input text.",How to Draw Basic Shapes Using Open Office Draw4," By means of these elements text can be added to an object.

The exceptions to this are control elements like buttons or list boxes, as well as 3D scenes and their associated elements and groups.







, The status bar shows at lower left “Text Edit” and the position of the cursor within the text.


Text can contain paragraphs and these can be in the form of bulleted or numbered lists. For a new line without beginning a new paragraph, use (as in text documents) the key combination Shift+Enter. To end the text input, click next to the object or press the Esc key.

Firstly, make sure you have Microsoft PowerPoint!,
Create an Introduction slide, explain what the game is about and what the objective is: What they have to do in order to escape the room, for example, do they have to find a code for a safe in the room?

,
Now, click new slide.,
Here is my method on how to make the game interactive.,
If you want an object to do something, then duplicate the slide and change the object.,
Make sure that you cover each side of the room.,
To create Arrows in order for people to turn around the room, you can find an arrow in the shapes.,
All of the above explains the basics of the game.,
Once they have finished, whether it be through a shaft, a locked door or a key-pad door.,
I hope this Article helped and good luck with your game.

",How to Make an Escape the Room Game With PowerPoint 2007," It doesn't matter if it's an earlier version or the most recent version as long as it is PowerPoint. My method should work the same on all.;
,, You now need a background as this will be the first part of your game. You could create this on PowerPoint using shapes.

, When designing your background, make sure that objects in the room are click able. A way you can do this is right click, you should see something say Hyperlink. Click on this, but first duplicate the slides a few times so when they click on an object that doesn't do anything it doesn't finish the presentation.

, For example if it was a piece of paper. Have a close up on the paper and what it says, for example a code for a safe.

, This may take a while, but go into detail and try to make it look as professional as possible.

, Basically, if they go left, place a hyperlink on that arrow to take them to that side of the room, or if the other way, the same thing.

, You now need to decide how they escape the room. Don't tell them this though! That's why it's an escape game, they need to work it out. You could provide possible clues though, if you like.

, Congratulate them on their victory.

Select starting zone -> Insert -> Action -> Hyperlink to -> Next Slide



,


Start a blank new slide; this will be the first racetrack.
Insert a rectangle to cover the whole slide. This will prevent players from taking shortcuts off the tracks.

Select rectangle -> Insert -> Action -> Mouseover -> Hyperlink to -> Next Slide -> Check ""Highlight when mouse over""


Whenever the player's cursor goes off the tracks, they will be sent to the next slide, which will be a ""game over"" page that we will create later.

,


Insert another start button from the previous slide to the same place in this slide. The player's cursor will start in this area. (If you copy and paste the image from the previous slide, they will be at the same position, but you will need to undo the hyperlink on this new one.)
Start building a racetrack by inserting arrows of different shapes

Insert -> Shapes -> Block Arrows


Connect them end to end to form a path.
You can rotate them by holding down the green circle.
You can also flip them to create a turn in the opposite direction.
Insert a checker flag icon to indicate a finishing area, and your track is complete.

,


Insert a flag icon at the start of the racetrack to represent the AI driver. Scale it down so that it is less than the width of the racetrack.
Now add its custom motion path:

Animation -> click down arrow to go to the bottom -> Custom Path


Plot a path within the track from start to finish. When you're done with the last path point, press Esc to finish. Try to stay along the center of the track.

,
Adjust the difficulty by modifying how fast the AI driver finishes the race.

Change the duration of its animation; the shorter the duration, the faster the AI drives, the harder the game becomes.
You can test it by pressing the Preview button at the top left.


Undo the ""Smooth end"" feature or else it will appear as if the AI driver slows down near the finishing line.

Call up the custom path configuration window by clicking the little expansion button -> Set ""Smooth end"" to 0 sec.



,,


Recall the AI driver's finish time that you set in step 6; set the timer to transition to the next slide to be the exact same duration.
Disable advance slide on mouse click again to prevent cheating

Transitions -> Advance Slide ->After hh:mm:ss -> enter the same duration as the AI driver animation -> uncheck ""On Mouse Click""



,


Use Word Art to print out ""GAME OVER"" and ""Exit""
Hyperlink ""Exit"" to End Show on mouse click.
Uncheck ""Advance Slide On Mouse Click"" for this slide as well to prevent cheating.

,


Repeat steps 3 ~ step 10 to add more racetrack slides alternated with GAME OVER slides.
Make sure that the starting zone is the same position as the finishing zone of the previous track.
You can copy and paste to reuse the same GAME OVER slide:

Right click existing GAME OVER slide -> Copy -> right click after the next racetrack slide -> Paste Options -> Using Destination Theme



,


Once you have enough tracks that you want, add a finishing slide with messages such as ""You won!""
Now you can set winning conditions to connect the tracks.

Mouseover hyperlink the finishing zone of each track slide to the next track slide; hyperlink the last track slide to the YOU WON slide. For example:
Select finishing zone -> Insert -> Action -> Mouseover -> Check ""Highlight when mouse over"" -> Hyperlink to -> ""Slide ..."" -> Select next track slide, or winning slide if this is the last track


Do this for each finishing zone on every racetrack slide.

Once you have started SmartDraw, select one of the two Flowchart options.,

Start with the basics.,
Hold down the CTRL key and then press a directional key.,
Double click on the Start text in the box.,
Start adding the processes.,
Be prepared to move things around.",How to Make a Flowchart Using SmartDraw,";
, This will bring you to the flowchart options. You will see three different layouts and several examples. Choose one of the top three layouts. That will bring you to this screen.

, Those are the Start/End symbol, the Process symbol, and the Decision symbol. You will also need the connecting arrow that will connect the various steps together. As you become more familiar with the program, you can add to it.


The oval signifies the beginning or the end of the process. You could put Start and End or fill in whatever you are going to call the beginning and the end. For example, if you want tickets to a show and you were going to flowchart it, your start or beginning would be simply stating the task.

Determining if the family can afford to go to the show.


The rectangle will indicate a process. A process is basically a step. In the example above, it would be as follows:

Find out how much the tickets will cost.
Check the bank to see if we have the money.


The diamond shape indicates a decision needs to be made or has been made.

Do we have enough money?


To put in decision choices, like Yes or No, you can easily type them onto the arrows.

, The direction depends upon the layout you chose. When you press down the CTRL key, you are telling SmartDraw to add the symbol that you have selected at the left of your screen.


If you are just demonstrating a method, where there is no decision to be made, you could continue to place the boxes in whichever way you want. However, most flowcharts require decisions to be made and dealt with.

, Type in what you want the process to be about.

, Hold down the CTRL key and press the right directional arrow (or whichever direction you need it to go). This will give you a single symbol of whatever you have selected at the moment.

, When flow-charting your process, you will realize things really aren't being done correctly, and you can easily come up with an alternative. It is the visualizing that you are doing while creating it that will help you find the answers.

You can do this by adding a blank slide with a plain black background, or you can make the words fade out to black before you move on to the next slide.

If you're using Office 2007 or 2003, click here.
If you want to play multiple songs throughout a presentation, you could try to line them up by spacing them out between your slides, but you'll likely find it easier and less jarring to create a new file that combines all of the songs into one, back-to-back. See the next section for details.;
, You can insert MP3 and WAV files.


If you want to use a song from iTunes, you'll need to convert it to MP3 first by right-clicking on the song in iTunes and selecting ""Create MP3 Version"". Click here for more details.
WAV files can be quite large, and can make the PowerPoint presentation difficult to share. Consider converting the WAV file to MP3. You can do this by importing the WAV into iTunes, or by using a free online converter. Click here for more details.

, Select ""Audio from My PC"" from the list of options.


Note: The ""Online Audio"" option no longer works, so if the song you want is online, you'll need to download it to your computer first., You can select any WAV or MP3 file that's stored on your computer or on any network drives.

, There are two basic options for setting when your music starts. You can either have the song play when you click the button or you can have the song play automatically in the background. There are two presets which allow you to quickly select one of these options:


If you want the song to start automatically and play in the background across all of your slides, select the ""Play in Background"" option in the Playback tab. This will set the song to start automatically, continue playing when slides are changed, loop when finished, and hide the sound button. The song will start playing immediately when that slide is opened.
If you prefer to click the button to start the sound instead, select ""No Style"" from the Playback tab. The song will play when you click the audio button. You can change the look of the button using the Format tab. This will let you design a button or import a picture to use instead.

, PowerPoint includes some basic audio editing tools that allow you to change where the song starts playing from, adjust the volume, fade in and out, and more. Select the audio object to open the Playback tab if it isn't already.


Add bookmarks to the track. When you hover over the audio object, you'll see a track time slider. Select a spot on the track and click the ""Add Bookmark"" button to create a clickable bookmark at that point in the track. This will allow you to quickly jump to specific spots.
Click the ""Trim Audio"" button to cut out unnecessary parts of the song. Useful for songs that are too long, or that you only need a piece of. Use the sliders in the Trim Audio window to select the new starting and ending point for the song.
Use the Fade Duration options to set the fade in and fade out times. The longer the duration, the more gradual the fade will be.
Use the Volume button to adjust the master volume for the song. Make sure to test the song before the presentation and adjust the volume accordingly so that you don't startle the audience.

, PowerPoint 2007 and newer will embed the MP3 file into your presentation file. This will allow you to share the file with others without having to worry about sending the music file along with it. Keep in mind that the size of the presentation will increase based on the size of the MP3 file.


If your presentation file is under 20 MB, you can probably attach it to an email to send to others. If it's any larger, you may want to consider using a service like Dropbox or Google Drive to share it.

Understand the process.,
Download and install Audacity.,
Open the tracks you want to combine in Audacity.,
Open the window showing the second track.,
Press Ctrl + A to select the entire song.

,
Press Ctrl + C to copy the selected song.

,
Open the window containing your first track and put your cursor at the very end of the song.

,
Press Ctrl + V to paste the copied song to the end of the first song.

,
Repeat for any additional songs you want to add to your soundtrack.

,
Cut out extra silence.,
Save the newly combined file.,
Insert the MP3 into PowerPoint.",How to Add Music to PowerPoint2," You can try to space out your music files in your presentation so that the songs flow from one to next, but any changes in your presentation can create jarring transitions or too much silence. If you want a constant background soundtrack for a long presentation, it will be much easier to stitch each audio file into one continuous track and then set it to play from the beginning.

, This is a free, open-source audio editor that will allow you to quickly combine your music files. You can download Audacity from sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/.

, Click the File menu and select ""Open..."". If your files are all in the same folder, you can hold Ctrl and select each one so that you can open them all at once.

, You will be adding each track to the end of the first song, so open the window showing the second song on your playlist.

,,,,,, You can look at the graph to see when the song is playing audio and when there is silence. You may have some extra silence between your added songs that you can remove before adding it to PowerPoint.


Click and drag to select the portion of the track that is silent. Make sure you don't delete pauses during a song, as it can make the song sound off. It's also good to leave a second or two of silence in between each song.
Click the ""Cut"" button at the top of the window to delete the selection.

, Now that you're finished adding tracks, you'll need to save your new file as an MP3 so that it can be loaded into PowerPoint


Click the File menu and select ""Export Audio..."".
Ensure that the ""Save as type"" field is set to ""MP3 Files"".
Name the file so that you know it is the combined soundtrack and save it in an easy to find location.
Click Save and then click OK, unless you want to change any of the MP3 tag information.
Wait for the export to complete. It may take a few minutes for Audacity to put together and save your new MP3 file.

, Follow the steps in the first section of this article to insert your combined song file into PowerPoint and have it play automatically in the background.

Click the ""Multimedia Settings"" tab and select the ""Continue slide show"" option.

,
Select the ""After"" option and then set how many slides you want the music to continue playing for.,
Package the file.",How to Add Music to PowerPoint3," If you want the song to start when you start your presentation, open the first slide. If you want it to start at a specific point in the presentation, open the slide you want it to start on.

, You'll be able to browse for either WAV or MP3 files.


In Office 2003, click the Insert menu, select ""Movies and Sounds"", and then select ""Sound from File"".
Since PowerPoint 2003 and 2007 cannot embed MP3 files, you'll have the most success if you create a new folder on your computer and put the presentation file along with the audio file in the same spot.
You can embed WAV files, but this can create a very large presentation file. It is recommended that you use a linked MP3 file instead., In the ""Sound"" tab, you can select either ""Automatically"" or ""When Clicked"" from the ""Play Sound"" menu.


If you set the song to play automatically, check the ""Hide During Show"" box to hide the button for the audio file.

, Normally, the song will stop playing as soon as you move on to the next slide. By creating a custom animation, you can force the music to continue playing longer.,, Set this to the number of slides in your presentation to have the music play in the background the entire time. Click ""OK"" after you're finished.

, Since the presentation will not have the music file embedded, you will need to ""pack"" the presentation and the audio together using the ""Package for CD"". This will allow you to easily share the presentation with others. You won't need to actually burn it to CD.>


Click the Office button, select ""Publish"", then ""Package for CD"".
Enter the name of the folder you want to create in the ""Name the CD"" box.
Click ""Options"" and ensure that ""Include linked files"" is checked.
Click the ""Copy to Folder"" button. A new folder will be created with your presentation and the audio file, along with a PowerPoint player so that anyone can view the presentation, even if they don't have Office.

, Choose a background color for your slides by going to Format> Background and choose the color background you want for your slides (black or blue is best for Who Wants to be a Millionaire). If the color you want isn’t there, select “More Colors” or “Fill Effects” to choose the color you want.

, This will be the first slide your player will see when they start the show. Possibly feature a short introduction and then have the menu appear. The main menu should feature:


Welcome
Who Wants to be a Millionaire title
Links to begin the show and “How to Play” slides, or rules right there on the first slide

Consider allowing the player simply click anywhere on the screen or use the -> key to advance to the next slide, but links are recommended. To create a hyperlink, simply highlight the text, WordArt, action button, shape or object you wish to be able to click on, right click on it, and select Hyperlink. Once the dialogue box appears, select “Place in This Document” on the far left side of the dialogue box. From here, you can select which slide you wish to hyperlink the text or object to.



, On the question slide, you should show or mention the money tree, how much the contestant is going for, what they can walk away with,. Under AutoShapes> Basic Shapes, select the Hexagon. This is a lot like the shape of the box that the question and choices appear in on the show. Draw your shape (short and wide), like the shape of the box that the question appears in on the show. Color it black, blue, or whatever color you like. Next, draw a text box overtop of it, and type the first question in there. Now, create 4 more boxes (the choices to the question will appear in these). Make sure to make them smaller than the question box, and put them in the four spaces below the question where the choices would go on the show. Draw text boxes overtop of these, type in the choices, and you’ve written the question. Now, create hyperlinks that enable the player to answer the question...

, After the contestant has read the question and four choices, make sure to create links so the contestant can click on the answer that they choose. Click the cursor inside the first text box. This time, instead of highlighting the text to hyperlink it, click on the outline of the box as to highlight the box. Right click on the outline of the box, select “Hyperlink,” and choose what slide you would like to hyperlink it to.


Create a slide before-hand congratulating the player for getting the question correct. They should be directed here via hyperlink by clicking on the correct answer. Hyperlink all the other answers to a slide telling the player they got the answer wrong.

, You can make the question and choices appear, one by one, like on the show, using special effects. Here’s how to do it:


Highlight the outline of the question box, like you did to hyperlink the four choices. Make sure to highlight the box, and not the text. Next, go to Slide Show> Custom Animation. The Custom Animation task pane should appear on the far-right side of the screen. Under “Add Effect,” select Entrance> and then however you want your text to come in. You can have it appear, fade in, pop up, dissolve, and all kinds of stuff.
Now, a new animation should be in the white space. Right click on it. Select “Start After Previous.” Next, select the first answer choice text box. Under “Add Effect,” select Entrance> and then the way you want it to appear. If you want to, you can select “Random” to make it random how the text comes in. Once the animation has appeared below the previous one in the task pane, right-click on it and select “Start After Previous.” Right-click on it again. This time, select “Timing” and scroll to or type in the number of seconds you will give your player to read the question before the answers begin to appear (i.e. 5-10. You don’t want your player sitting there for 15 seconds, thinking, “What’s happening? Are the choices going to appear or what?”)
Next, highlight the second choice. Under Add Effect> Entrance, select the way you want the second choice to appear in the slide show. Once it appears in the task pane, right-click on it, and select “Start After Previous.” Now, right-click on it again and select “Timing.” Now, scroll to or type in the number of seconds you want your player to wait in between ‘’choices’’. 1.5 – 3 seconds is good for this, depending on how fast of a reader your player will be (Keep it 3-4 seconds for younger children who will be playing the game.) Repeat this step with the last two choices.
You can repeat this with each of your questions, or copy and paste your question slides, so then when you paste it, all the effects will already be there, and all you have to do is change the question. However, if you are copying and pasting your slides, make sure to change the choices’ hyperlinks to the corresponding slides on your new question!

, On the real show, this is a huge milestone that is rarely accomplished, so make this slide bright and fun! You could also offer the contestant to play again or Exit the slide show (see Tips).

Continue to Final Jeopardy.",How to Make a Jeopardy Game on PowerPoint," In Jeopardy, the contestants are provided the answer, and they have to respond with the question. There are two rounds with 30 possible questions each, and then a final round of one question and answer.


Each round is split into 6 categories with 5 questions in each one. Each question in a category is progressively “harder” than the one before it. Harder questions are worth more points.;
, For a full game of Jeopardy, you will need to come up with 12 categories of questions. Each category will have five questions in it that should all be related to that category.

, Remember to make them increasingly difficult, though each category should have about the same difficulty. This guide goes into great detail about how to create the perfect Jeopardy questions.


The clue should be in the form of an answer, and the contestant responds with the question. For example: Clue – “This is the largest of the oceans.” Response – “What is the Pacific Ocean?”

, After two rounds of play, contestants go to Final Jeopardy where they can wager some or all of their points on getting the correct response. This question has its own category, and contestants are given more time than usual to answer. The Final Jeopardy question should be the most difficult in the game.


All contestants write down their Final Jeopardy answers at the same time, giving all contestants a chance to score.

, Having your questions and answers written out beforehand will save you a lot of time as you create the game. Enter the questions and answers into a word processor so that you can quickly copy and paste them into your game.

, Create a new project and put your game’s title on the first slide. Feel free to fancy it up however you’d like.

, This slide will be your clue selection screen.

, Create a table in the second slide by clicking the Insert menu/tab and selecting Table. Make this table 6X6, so that it is 6 columns across and 6 rows tall.


Enter your first 6 categories into the top row, one category per cell.
In each column under the category, enter the values 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 in the remaining cells. These are the standard values for clues in the television version of Jeopardy, but you can use whatever values you feel work the best.

, Once you have the table filled out, you can start formatting the table to make sure it looks good. This includes centering the text and ensuring that all cell sizes are uniform.

, This can be a little time consuming since you have to click the New Slide button for each one. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + M to create new slides.

, Scroll back to Slide 3 and begin entering your clues into each slide. Be sure to go in order (1st category, 2nd category, etc.) to that you can easily link to the correct clue. Copy and paste the clues from the document you created earlier.


You can format the clue slides however you’d like. You may include the category or point value, or just put the clue in.

, This will allow the contestant to place a wager on their answer, potentially netting them a lot more points. In the television version, there is one Daily Double available in the first round.


Since a contestant wagers before seeing the clue for a Daily Double, you will need to create an extra slide for this. The first slide they see will be the Daily Double slide, and then once the contestant makes the wager, you can proceed to the actual clue.

, This button will link back to the category slide. You can insert an image of your own choosing, pick a piece of clipart, or just use a text link.


Once you have inserted your button, select it and click the Insert tab/menu. Click Hyperlink. This will open a new dialog box.
In the left menu, select “Place in this Document”.
In the main frame, select the clue table slide and then press OK. The button will now link back to the clue table when you click it during the presentation.

, Once you’ve got all of your clues entered, you can start linking them to their respective values. To do this, highlight the first “200” in the first category in your clue table. Click the Insert tab/menu and select Hyperlink. Link to the first clue slide. When you click on the “200” during the game, it will link to that clue.


Repeat this for each of the clues until all of your point values are linked. Be sure to link to the appropriate Daily Double if you have one.

, On your clue table slide, create a button or link to the second round. This will ensure that you don’t have to scroll through your slides to get to the new categories. You can just create the button now, and link it once the new categories are made.

, Once again, you will be creating a 6X6 table. If you want to keep your formatting consistent, copy and paste the table from your first round and change the category headings.

, In the second round of Jeopardy, the point values for each clue are doubled. Enter the following values into each category: 400, 800, 1200, 1600, and 2000.

, Follow the steps from the previous section to link your next set of 30 clues. The second round of Jeopardy typically has two Daily Doubles available.

, At the bottom of your second clue table, create a link to the Final Jeopardy slide. You don’t have to make the link active until you actually create the slide.

, Place your Final Jeopardy clue on the slide. This clue should be one of the most difficult in your game.

, You will need to have the answers to all of your clues, a piece of paper to keep score, and a buzzer for each of the contestants (any item that they can use as a buzzer will work, such as a bell. Your contestants could even clap their hands instead of buzzing).

, When you start the presentation, your title screen will appear. Click the mouse and you will be taken to your first clue table. Whoever you determined gets to start first will then pick their first category and value.


Read the clue out loud. Once you are finished reading, allow your contestants to buzz in. The first one to buzz in will have a chance to answer. If the answer is incorrect, wait for another contestant to buzz. If the answer is correct, that contestant gets the points and can choose the next clue.
If a contestant gets an answer wrong, they will lose the amount of points that clue was worth. In the television version, contestants can have negative points.

, If no one buzzes in before the timer goes off, read out the answer and let the last person who picked a clue pick again.

, Once the entire table has been answered, click the link at the bottom of the table to move to the second round.

, You can use a piece of paper or a computer to keep quick tallies of the score. This will help the contestants know how much they can wager on Daily Doubles.

, For Final Jeopardy, read the category first and give everyone a chance to write their wager. Once all of the wagers are written, you can show the clue.


Make sure that no one can see anyone else’s answer. Set a timer so that everyone knows how long they have to answer the clue.
Once the timer is up, go down the line and ask contestants to reveal their answers and wagers. Add or subtract points from their score and determine the winner of your game!

Write out your core concepts.,
Decide between a standard or swimlane format.,
Layout your flowchart.,
Separate complex processes.",How to Create a Flowchart1," The key to a successful flowchart is its readability. Make sure that your core concepts are simply stated, and that the progression from concept to concept is explained in simple steps.


Make sure that you have a distinct end point for your chart planned. This will help make it easier to read.;
, A standard flowchart breaks a process down by its key concepts and required actions. If you have multiple groups involved in the process outlined by the flowchart, a swimlane format can help show who needs to do what. Each flowchart step is placed in the “Lane” for the group responsible for completing the task (Marketing, Sales, HR, etc.).


Swimlanes are typically formatted horizontally or vertically. The starting point is the top-left corner of the chart.
Swimlanes can be difficult to design if you have multiple concepts that have to travel back and forth between departments. This will lead to muddled charts.

, Before you start designing your flowchart through software, draw it out on a scratch piece of paper. Place your starting concept at the top, and expand the chart out below it.


Most flowcharts operate on a basic binary principle. At points in the process where variations occur, the reader is presented with a Yes or No question. The answer will guide the reader to the appropriate concept.
Use different shapes to represent different types of concepts or decisions. Adding visual cues will help with readability and comprehension.

, If areas of your flowchart are becoming too dense, separate the subprocess into a new flowchart. Add a box as a reference to the subprocess in the original flowchart, and have the reader return to it when they get through the expanded section.

Right-click on any column heading and select Column Width from the menu. Enter 2.14 into the field and press Enter. This will change all of the cells into perfect squares.
Turn on Snap to Grid from the Align menu in the Layout or Page Layout tab. This will make any created objects adjust their size to match the grid, helping you to create uniform shapes.

, If you plan on exporting the spreadsheet to Word or another program, you will want to make sure that the margins line up. Use the Margins menu in the Page Layout or Layout tab to adjust the margins to match the software you are exporting to.


You can adjust the orientation of the document (portrait or landscape) using the Orientation menu in the Layout tab. Flowcharts that go from left to right should be formatted for landscape.

, Click the Insert tab and select the Shapes menu. Select the shape that you want to create and then draw the size of the box using your mouse. Once you create a shape, you can change the color and outline style using the tools in the Format tab that opens.

, To add text to shapes, click on the center of the shape and start typing. You can adjust the font and style in the Home tab. Keep your text short and to the point, and ensure that it is easily readable.

, Open the Shapes menu from the Insert tab. Select the line style that most suits your needs. Hover your mouse over the first shape. You will see small red boxes appear on its edges that show where lines can be connected.


Start the line in the red box, and drag it to the second shape.
Red boxes will appear on the second shape. Place the endpoint of the line on one of these boxes.
The shapes are now connected. If you move one, the line will stay connected, and adjust its angle appropriately.
Add comments to connecting lines by inserting a Text Box, available from the Insert tab.

, Using a grid will allow you to create uniform shapes. To enable it, click on the canvas to make it active. In the Format tab, click Align and then select Grid Settings. Check the boxes for displaying gridlines and snapping objects.

, With the canvas active, select the Insert tab and click the Shapes menu. Select the shape you would like to add. Use your mouse to draw the shape to the size you would like. Once you create a shape, you can change the color and outline style using the tools in the Format tab that opens.

, To add text to a shape in Word 2007, right-click on it and select Add Text from the menu. For Word 2010/2013, simply click the shape and start typing. You can adjust the font and style from the Home tab.

If you would like to change your choice of whether to play the sound automatically, or after a mouse click, access the drop down menu in the ""Sound Tools - Options"" contextual tab in the Ribbon.






By default, PowerPoint 2007 leaves the sound object as a visible object in your slide. This can be toggled by clicking the box labeled ""Hide during show,"" located in the ""Sound Tools - Options"" contextual tab. This will help you have a cleaner presentation when playing a sound automatically, but if you have selected to start the sound playback upon clicking the object (see Step 3), you will not be able to do so if you've elected to hide the object during the presentation.






Increasing the file size limit for embedded sounds will absorb the sound file, if it is under the limit, into your presentation's single "".pptx"" file. If the sound(s) you have included in your presentation are above the limit you specify, you will need to include the sound file(s) in the same location as your "".pptx"" file, wherever you save it or share it (e.g., you would attach the "".pptx"" file and the accompanying "".mp3"" file in email if you were to be sending your deck to a colleague).

Let the audience ask questions.",How to Use Prezi," The bulk of your work with Prezi will occur in the online editor. Prezis are saved to the cloud and can be accessed anywhere that has an internet connection. There are several options to pick from when joining Prezi:


Public. This is the basic membership, and comes with a small amount of online storage. All presentations made with this membership are public and can be viewed by anyone. This is the perfect option for a classroom presentation.






Enjoy. This is the starter paid membership. It comes with more storage, and your presentations are private. You can also use your own logo.






Pro. This is the most expensive form of Prezi. You can use the Prezi Desktop program to create a Prezi without internet access, and you get significantly more online storage.





;
, If you want to share your Prezi with a small audience, you can use the iPad to make it more interactive for the viewer. You can download the Prezi app for your iPad and iPhone. The app is free and lets you access your Prezi from anywhere that your device has internet access.


You can navigate the Prezi by swiping your fingers and pinch-zooming







, Once you have an account, you can log in to the Prezi website and begin creating your presentation. Click the Create link at the top of the Prezi homepage. Under “Your Prezis” click the “+New Prezi” button. This will start the editor

, The underlying functionality of Prezi means that you do not have to think in linear slides as you would PowerPoint. You are free to move the frame around your presentation landscape however you feel is best. This means, however, that a Prezi that is not planned properly from the beginning can quickly become a jumbled mess with no sense of direction.


Draw out an overarching design of the Prezi. Think of how the presentation would look if it was completely zoomed out. Some of the most successful Prezis have a structure that the path of frames will follow.

, Use the main points of your presentation as the anchors for the path your Prezi will take. Think of these main points as “focal” points; you will be focusing on these and using the surrounding landscape to build on them frame by frame.

, The path is how the presentation transitions from frame to frame. Instead of going in a linear motion, the path can be set in any order, and the ""camera"" will move around the presentation as it follow the path.

, When you are planning out your Prezi, think about how you will be moving the camera over your landscape. Because Prezi allows for full zooming and rotations, there is a temptation to change the perspective often during a presentation. This can lead to motion sickness in the viewer, and distracts from the content of the presentation.


Try to layout out your landscape so that the camera moves in a relatively linear fashion, either horizontally or vertically. Avoid rotating as much as possible unless it significantly enhances the message
Save the zoom in and out feature for transitions between large sections. Zooming too much can be disorienting and distracting.
Use the special features of Prezi sparingly to emphasize their effect on the audience.

, Because you have an essentially limitless canvas, make your focal points big to begin with. Then, as you add more details, you can add smaller objects and use small amounts of zoom to focus on them.

, When you first create your new Prezi, you will be asked to choose a template. The template of your Prezi defines how the text, colors and objects will all interact on the landscape. You can pick between 2D and 3D template. 2D themes are flat and the camera moves across the canvas. 3D themes allow you to zoom in and out of the background.


Think of the template as a metaphor for what you are presenting. For example, if you are talking about surmounting obstacles to get where you are, choose the template of the mountain climbers.
Avoid changing your theme after setting up your Prezi. The changes will push all of your text and objects out-of-whack. Pick a theme in the beginning and stick with it.
You can turn a 2D background into a 3D one by right-clicking on a 2D theme and selecting “Change background”. Click on the Edit button next to the 3D option and you will be able to add up to 3 images that can be zoomed between.
You can use the same “Change background” option to open the Theme Wizard, which will allow you to adjust the colors of the elements in your Prezi.

, Be sure to begin with the main points of your presentation. These will be the centerpieces of each section. You can add text, images, and other objects anywhere on the canvas. Continue to refer to your plan as you begin laying out the Prezi on the screen.


To add text, simply double click anywhere in your Prezi. This will create a text box and you can begin typing or copy text from the clipboard. To split up a large block of text, select the text that you want to move and drag it elsewhere in the Prezi., Once you have an object on the canvas, click on it to open the Transformation Tool. The object will be highlighted by a box surrounded by tools to modify the object.Click and hold the Plus or Minus button to scale the object.






Click and drag the corner of the box to resize the object.






Click and hold the Hand icon in the center to drag the object around the canvas.






Rotate the object by clicking and dragging the circle sticking out from one of the corners of the box.






Edit the frame by clicking the Open Frame button at the top.






Delete either the frame or the frame and the content by clicking the delete buttons next to the Open Frame button.







, If you are going to be focusing on images in your Prezi, remember that they will take up the entire screen when zoomed in on. This means that lower quality images that look good as a part of a webpage will look grainy when they are scaled up to fit the screen.

, If you leave a fair amount of white space around your objects, Prezi will be able to easily focus on them when the camera zooms in. This will help make the text or image stand out to the audience.

, If you want to surprise the audience with a fact or image, make it very small. This will make it illegible until the object is in focus. If the text is small enough, the audience won’t even see it coming.

, Frames come in two forms in Prezi: visible and invisible. Visible frames highlight the object on the screen, and include a circle, brackets, and a filled oblong shape. Invisible frames allow you to define objects and sets of objects as the focus. Both types of frames will let you control how much zoom and object receives.Invisible frames also allow you to create clickable sections of your presentation that can link to other parts of the Prezi or to the web. This is perfect for interactive presentations.







, If you have a paragraph of text in one frame, and want to highlight a key segment of it, create a frame around the text that you want to highlight. Create a path to it, and the camera will zoom in on just the framed text. This is useful for noting key figures or powerful phrases in a block of text., Prezi doesn’t use font sizes, which can make it difficult to get headings and paragraphs to feel uniform. In order to match size, select the text that you need to resize. As you move the mouse to change the size of the text, look at the text that you are trying to match it to. Once the two are the same, the text that you haven't selected will become darker, signifying that the two are the same size.


You can use this same procedure for matching the size of pictures and other objects.






You can see when sections are aligned when a dotted blue line appears between the two.







, A good Prezi will be able to be understood when the presentation is zoomed all the way out. This means that your key points should be large enough to be read when the camera is pulled back. They should also be aligned in a way that makes logical sense.


You can return to the overview by creating an invisible frame around the entire project. Link to this frame when you want to pull back and show the whole project. This is especially useful when transitioning between major points.







, If you are using specific styles of frames to highlight your important ideas, stick to using those throughout your entire presentation. The same goes for colored text and other stylistic objects. A sense of design unity throughout the presentation will leave a stronger lasting impression and convey information more clearly.

, In the Edit screen, click the “Edit Path” button on the left side of the workspace. This will allow you to start creating your path. Click on your first object, and then simply click on each consecutive object in the order that you want to present them.


Remember to try to keep the path moving in a fairly linear route to minimize disorientation and increase the amount of information that the audience retains.







, If you need to adjust the path, simply click and drag a path point from one object to another. If you want to add a step between points, click the small plus sign icon next to a step and drag it to an object. This will create a new stop in the path.


If you drag and drop a point on the path to an area with no object, that step will be deleted.







, Don’t get too hung up on your pathing while you are adjusting your layout. Get the layout solid first, and then go through and set your final path. This will make organizing your content much easier., Before presenting your Prezi, run through it a few times to make sure that it flows well. Practice your timing for moving between frames. Ensure that everything receives the correct focus and that your transitions are not too jarring.


You can add small notes to your frames that the audience is not likely to see that can aid you in your presentation. Consider putting hard-to-remember figures, dates, and important points in an out of the way place for quick reference.

, When you are presenting, clicking Next will take you to the next stop on the path. If you want to zoom out, scroll around, or click on other parts of the presentation, all you need to do is click the Next button to return to the path.

, Don’t rush through the frames during your presentation. Allow the audience time to process the information, and to settle from the previous transition. If you go too fast, the transitions will become overbearing.

, Because Prezi is not composed of slides, it’s very easy to move around the presentation. Use this ability to clarify audience questions and to easily backtrack to missed information. Zoom out to quickly find sections of your presentation that relate to the questions being asked.

Twenty prepackaged layouts are shown. You can choose the one you want, use it as it is or modify it to your own requirements. At present it is not possible to create custom layouts.


Table Design

Eleven standard table styles are provided in this pane. You can further modify the appearance of a table with the selections to show or hide specific rows and columns, or to apply a banded appearance to the rows and columns.


Custom Animation

A variety of animations for selected elements of a slide are listed. Animation can be added to selected elements of a slide, and it can also be changed or removed later.


Slide Transition

Fifty-six transitions are available, including No Transition. You can select the transition speed (slow, medium, fast). You can also choose between an automatic or manual transition, and how long you want the selected slide to be shown (automatic transition only).


Workspace

The Workspace has five tabs: Normal, Outline, Notes, Handout, and Slide Sorter. These five tabs are called View Buttons. There are also many toolbars that can be used during slide creation; they are revealed by selecting them with View > Toolbars. The actual Workspace section is below the View Buttons. This is where you assemble the various parts of your selected slide.
Each view is designed to ease the completion of certain tasks. In summary:

Normal view is the main view for creating individual slides. Use this view to format and design slides and to add text, graphics, and animation effects.
Outline view shows topic titles, bulleted lists, and numbered lists for each slide in outline format. Use this view to rearrange the order of slides, edit titles and headings, rearrange the order of items in a list, and add new slides.
Notes view lets you add notes to each slide that are not seen when the presentation is shown.
Slide Sorter view shows a thumbnail of each slide in order. Use this view to rearrange the order of slides, produce a timed slide show, or add transitions between selected slides.
Handout view lets you print your slides for a handout. You can choose one, two, three, four, or six slides per page from Tasks pane > Layouts. Thumbnails can be re-arranged in this view by dragging and dropping them.




Normal view

There are two ways to place a slide in the Slide Design area of the Normal view: clicking the slide thumbnail in the Slides pane or using the Navigator.


To open the Navigator, click the Navigator button in the Standard Toolbar or press Ctrl+Shift+F5 and select a slide by scrolling down the Navigator list until you find the one you want and then double-click it.


Outline view

Outline view contains all of the slides of the presentation in their numbered sequence. Only the text in each slide is shown. Slide names are not included.
Outline view serves at least two purposes.

Making changes in the text of a slide:

Add or delete text in a slide just as in the Normal view.
Move the paragraphs of text in the selected slide up or down by using the up and down arrow buttons (Move Up or Move Down) on the Text Formatting toolbar.
Change the outline level for any of the paragraphs in a slide using the left and right arrow buttons (Promote or Demote).
Both move a paragraph and change its outline level using a combination of these four arrow buttons.
Comparing the slides with your outline (if you have prepared one in advance). If you notice from your outline that another slide is needed, you can create it directly in the Outline view or you can return to the Normal view to create it, then return to review all the slides against your outline in the Outline view.






If a slide is not in the correct sequence, you can move it to its proper place:
Click the slide icon of the slide you wish to move, as indicated below.
Drag and drop it where you want it.

, A thick black border is drawn around it.
Drag and drop it to the location you want.

As you move the slide, a black vertical line appears to one side of the slide.
Drag the slide until this black vertical line is located where you want the slide to be moved.



,
Use the Shift key: Click on the first slide, and while pressing the Shift key, select the final slide in the group. This selects all of the other slides in between the first and the last.
Use the cursor: Click on the first slide to be selected. Hold down the left mouse button. Drag the cursor to the last slide thumbnail. A dashed outline of a rectangle forms as you drag the cursor through the slide thumbnails and a thick black border is drawn around the selected slides. Make sure the rectangle includes all the slides you want to select.

,
Drag and drop the group to their new location. The same vertical black line appears to show you where the group of slides will go.

Selection of a group of slides works in a rectangular fashion. Slides that do not fall within a rectangular area cannot be grouped.



,,
Delete or rename the selected slide.
Change the Slide Layout.

Understand what a spreadsheet is.,
Understand the way a spreadsheet is organized.,
Extrapolate the data for interpretation.",How to Read and Interpret a Spread Sheet," In the present day, a spreadsheet is used to organize data in boxes (known as cells).

Spreadsheets are sometimes just glorified lists detailing names and numbers. Other times, they add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers and percentages to make data make sense.





;
, Think in lines. Data is presented either horizontally, vertically, or both.

A typical spreadsheet looks like a table with names or categories on the left or right going down (vertically) and another set of names or categories on the top or bottom going across (horizontally). The data is represented in between this area.






To find a particular data point, follow one vertical category that you need to a horizontal category that you need on the same line.







, You have to understand what is happening in each cell. Sometimes data is just a number that means something to someone. Other times, data is a calculation based on other data. This can be as simple as a sum of data points, or as complicated as finding the average of certain data points and comparing them to other averages. It's just a matter of who has created the spreadsheet and what their intention is.

, Refer to the table or figure as “Table 1” or “Figure 2” in the text, using a capital letter. For example: “See Figure 1 as an example of this type of horse.”

If you have the data in written form, assess how manageable it is on the page. You may want to consider a spreadsheet if you have tried to calculate the results manually.
A spreadsheet will electronically calculate the sum total of your data. Most spreadsheet software will also calculate averages, multiples and a great many mathematical formulas, quicker than it can be done manually.;
,


Storage: Not only can you use the spreadsheet to collect and calculate data, it is a great way to store data, on a simple file on your computer. This paperless system not only keeps your carbon footprint small, it saves space, time and physical storage.
Search Files: A computer spreadsheet will have a search function that allows you to quickly source specific information on your document that would involve a manual search on paper. For larger documents, this saves a lot of time and manpower.
Transferable: With an electronic file, a document containing spreadsheets can be emailed to your colleges and clients. Faxing and mailing documents is time-consuming and costly.
Calculate Data: Using the spreadsheet to calculate, formulate and total your data will minimize the risk of human error in calculations and allow you to use multiple mathematical formulas to effectively display your results.

,


A spreadsheet will make your work easier if your data is too involved to manage on paper. Although the process of input might be lengthy for larger documents, the storage, search and emailing capabilities will make your material easier to manage, easier to archive and much easier to share with others.

Decide if a data entry form works best.,
Add the titles to be used in the data entry form.,
Open the data entry form to start entering data.,
Enter data for a new row.,
Click the Close button in the dialog box (data entry form) to finish adding data.",How to Create a Form in a Spreadsheet1," Use a data entry form when you have a simple form of text boxes that list the column headings as labels. A data entry form allows you to view and enter data more easily than moving from column to column, especially when you have multiple columns of data that do not fit on your screen horizontally. For example, you may have a customer listing with contact and order information that spans 10 columns. It is much easier to enter name, address, phone number, email, order date, order type, etc. with a data entry form than entering the details directly into each cell in each column.;
, Enter a title at the top of each column you want to use in the data entry form. Excel uses these titles to create fields on the data entry form.


For example, if you have “Name, Address, Phone number, Email, Order Date, and Order Type” as your column titles from left to right in the worksheet, you will see those same titles in the dialog box (data entry form), but listed one under the other.
Before you take the next step in the process, check that you have the Form button available on the Data tab. If you do not, add the Form button to the Quick Access Toolbar. Click Customize Quick Access Toolbar, select the More Commands option, change Popular Commands to All Commands, scroll down the list and click on Form. Then click on the Add button, and click OK.

, Click in any cell below the titles and go to the Data tab. Find the Form button and click on it. Excel displays a dialog box, showing each column title that you entered earlier in the worksheet as a vertical list of fields. The dialog box acts as the data entry form.


The Form button is either on the Data tab or the Quick Access Toolbar.
If you have named the worksheet you are working in, the dialog box (data entry form) will have a title. The title will be the same as the name of the worksheet. If your worksheet does not have a name, the title of the dialog box (data entry form) will be the word ‘Sheet’ followed by the worksheet number.

, Use the TAB key to move to the next field in the data entry form. Press the RETURN key after entering data in each field in the data entry form. The data entered will be added as the next row in the list on the current worksheet.

, Excel then closes the data entry form. You do not need to press the RETURN key for the last row.

If you are not currently logged on with a Gmail account, you will need to log on before you can continue.


You can share the forms with other people, allow people to complete a form online and collect all the responses in a spreadsheet.

, Google Forms opens a new form. There are two main tabs at the top of the form – Questions and Responses.

, For each question, you need to write the question and state what type of answer you expect. If this is the first time you are creating a form, you can use the Take Tour button to familiarize yourself with the options available. You can include 9 different types of questions in your form.Use Short answer when you want the answer to be one or two words.
Use Paragraph when you want the answer to be one or more sentences. For example, your question might be ‘What are the benefits of exercising regularly?’.
Use Multiple choice when you want the answer to be one of a list of several options. For example, ‘Which sport do you enjoy most?’ Provide a list of sports to choose from. Each item in the list appears in the form next to a small round button.
Use Checkboxes when you want multiple answers from a list of several options. For example, ‘Which sports do you enjoy?’ Provide a list of sports to choose from. Each item in the list appears in the form next to a small square.
Use Dropdown when you want the answer to be a selection from a menu. For example, ‘Which season is most popular for your favorite sport?’ Provide a list seasons. The list appears in the form as a drop down box with the first season visible.
Use Linear Scale when you want the answer to rate the options on a numerical scale. For example, ‘How interested are you in the NFL?’ A scale question appears in the form showing a scale of 1 to 5. You can increase or decrease the scale when you create the question. The maximum scale is 1 to 10.
Use Multiple Choice Grid when you want several answers to a question. For example, ‘Which months do you play which sports?’ Provide a list of months as the rows and a list of sports as the columns. A multiple-choice grid question appears in the form as a grid with the row items listed vertically and the column items listed horizontally.
Use Date when you want the answer to be a specific date.
Use Time when you want the answer to be a specific time.

, Click on the Responses tab to display the available choices. Choose either Create a New Spreadsheet or Select existing spreadsheet.


If you create a new spreadsheet, give it a name and click Create. Google links the new spreadsheet to the form. When people fill out the form, Google puts the answers to the questions in the spreadsheet. Each answer appears with a timestamp.

Save the form as a template.",How to Create a Form in a Spreadsheet3," Use a custom form when you want to create a form that other people will fill in and you want to have a specific layout and impose limits on some of the values that people can enter. For example, you might be collecting data about specific sports and want to know which sport an individual plays, how often each month, what percentage of free time is spent on the sport and other details.


Although you can use a data entry form to collect this data, creating a custom form with complex fields such as “list boxes”,” combo boxes”, “spin buttons”, and “scroll bars” allows you to capture this information efficiently because you can limit what each person enters.
You can also position the complex fields anywhere you want on the form, not just in columns as with a data entry form. Each list box, etc. is a complex field on the form. You need to create each complex field separately.

, The Developer tab appears to the right of the View tab. The Developer tab gives you access to the tools you require to create a custom form.


Click the Microsoft Office button followed by the Excel Options button.
Click on the check box named Show Developer tab in the Ribbon.
Click the Developer tab to display the available tools. Excel uses special terminology for complex fields such as list boxes. They are called “controls”. You will need to use the Insert Controls icon that looks like a briefcase with a hammer and a wrench.

, Type each title in its own cell. For example, if you are collecting data about people of different ages in different cities, you can enter Name, Age, City.


Think about the layout you want in the form when entering titles. You want to leave one or more empty cells either below or to the right of each title so there is space to enter data next to each title.

, Type each item of data in its own cell. For example, if you are collecting data about sports, you can enter Baseball, Football, Hockey, Tennis, Golf.

, The INDEX function returns a value from a specific range of data. Enter the INDEX function in the cell destined to display the chosen selection from a control. For example, if A1 is going to contain the selection and the range C1:C5 contains the data, enter INDEX(C1:C5,A1,0) into A1.

, Use a list box when you want a user to choose from a list of finite items. For example, if you are collecting data about sports, you can limit the sports to Baseball, Football, Hockey, Tennis and Golf. Anyone filling out the form can only choose from those sports. Set the location and values for each list box. Click Insert in the Controls section. Then click List Box (Form Control) under Form Controls.
Click the worksheet location where you want the upper left corner of the list box to appear, and then drag the list box to where you want the lower right corner of the list box to be.
Click Properties in the Controls section. In the Format Object window, enter the range where the data is located (C1:C5 in our example) and the cell where the result is to be displayed (A1 in our example).

, A combo box is almost identical to a list box. However, it combines a text box with a list box. Use a combo box when you want to give a user the option to choose from a list of finite items or to type an alternative. For example, if you are collecting data about sports, you can list Baseball, Football, Hockey, Tennis and Golf as choices, but a user might play soccer or some other sport. Anyone filling out the form can either choose from the sports listed or type soccer or another sport in the text box part of the combo box. Set the location and values for each combo box. Click Insert in the Controls section. Then click Combo Box under Form Controls.
Click the worksheet location where you want the upper left corner of the combo box to appear, and then drag the combo box to where you want the lower right corner of the combo box to be.
Right click the combo box and then click Format Control. In the Format Control window, enter the range where the data is located (C1:C5 in our example), the cell where the result is to be displayed (A1 in our example), and a number in the Drop Down Lines box. The number you enter determines how many lines are displayed in the combo box before it is necessary to scroll down to see other items in the list.

, A spin button appears on the form as a button with an upward pointing arrow on the top half and a downward pointing arrow on the bottom half. Use a spin button when you want a user to select a number from a range of numeric values, including dates or times. For example, if collecting data about sports, you might want to know how many times a month a user plays a chosen sport, but you are going to put any results where the answer is more than 20 all together. In this case, you can set a maximum limit for the spin button to 20. Anyone filling out the form can choose a value from 1 to 20 by using the down or up arrows on the spin button. Set the location and values for each spin button. Click Insert in the Controls section. Then click Spin Button under Form Controls.
Click the worksheet location where you want the upper left corner of the spin button to appear, and then drag the spin button to where you want the lower right corner of the spin button to be.
Right click the spin button and then click Format Control. Enter numbers in the value and change fields. Enter the cell where the result is to be displayed (A1 in our example) in the Cell link field.

, A scroll bar supports a range of values using scroll arrows or the scroll box. Use a scroll bar when you want a user to select a value from a large range of values such as percentages. For example, if collecting data about sports, you might want to know what percentage of a user’s free time is taken up playing a chosen sport each week. In this case, you can use a scroll bar for the range of percentages, setting 1 as the minimum value and 100 as the maximum value. Anyone filling out the form can move the scroll arrows or scroll box to choose the percentage of time spent. Set the location and values for each scroll bar. Click Insert in the Controls section. Then click Scroll Bar under Form Controls.
Click the worksheet location where you want the upper left corner of the scroll bar to appear, and then drag the scroll bar to where you want the lower right corner of the scroll bar to be.
Right click the scroll bar and then click Format Control. Enter numbers in the value and change fields. Enter the cell where the result is to be displayed (A1 in our example) in the Cell link field.

, This removes access to the control tools. Take this action when you have finished adding all the controls you want on the form. You need to take this step so that when you send the form to users they can only enter data in the complex fields (controls) in the form. They will not be able to alter the range of data that can be entered in any complex field (control).


Click the Microsoft Office button followed by the Excel Options button.
Click on the check box named Show Developer tab in the Ribbon.

Note that to add cells together you may alternatively type a comma between the referenced cells , but use of the colon allows you to select a range of cells whereas the comma requires you to list each cell individually. You can also sometimes type the numbers themselves in order to simply add numbers, but this method won't keep track of a referenced cell's value in the event it changes.;

Now you have a second sum that can subsequently be added to the first sum. Note that you may repeat this process with multiple rows in the event you wish to subsequently add more than two sums together.

Determine the user level of sophistication with spreadsheets and the needs that your application must meet.,
Decide whether you want an installed program or a cloud-based solution for your spreadsheet software.,
Evaluate your budget for spreadsheet software.",How to Choose a Spreadsheet Program,"

New users will probably require much less in terms of capability from spreadsheet software than ""power"" users. Microsoft Works, that program included with the Windows operating systems, will probably be more than enough to meet their needs. Users looking for a spreadsheet for a Mac might look into NeoOffice, the Mac operating system version of OpenOffice.



 


You may need to purchase additional training for your staff if the program you choose is too difficult for your average user to learn.






Those who are already proficient in a big-name, purchased spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel will likely have the least trouble adapting to a new program.

,


Computing ""in the cloud"" means that very little information is stored on your computer. This eliminates the need to back up data and makes sharing information between team members much easier.
Installed programs typically have better developer support and can ensure a higher level of security for the data involved.
Some installed programs are specific to a certain operating system. For example, there is no Mac version of Quattro Pro.
A cloud-based system ensures that there will be no compatibility issues between the PCs and Macs in your group. This is especially good for those independent contractors who work with several clients and other freelancers.

,


There are new free cloud-based computing options introduced every day. Some of the more popular cloud-based options without an upfront or subscription fee are Google Docs, Zoho and EditGrid. Choosing a free spreadsheet solution allows you to divert those budgeted funds into other matters.

, Enter a name for your ledger. This will allow you to easily know what the ledger contains without having to open it.

, When creating a ledger, you will need to indicate the balance that the ledger is starting with. If you are creating a ledger for your bank account, this would be the amount currently in it.

Understand the work breakdown structure.,
Gather necessary information about all steps or processes included in a greater project.,
Build timelines.,
Lay out all of the bars on the graph.,
Evaluate dependency or relationships between phases or processes.,
Implement the Gantt chart in software.",How to Create a Gantt Chart," The Gantt chart is meant to help with a comprehensive goal of planning and implementing a work breakdown structure, which is the overall structure of the project. Knowing more about what this means can be useful for those who are planning to build a Gantt chart or use a related software resource.


Learn about terminal and summary elements. Terminal elements and summary elements are two different types of project phases or modules that have their own timelines within a Gantt chart. Understanding how they differ and how they relate to each other can be useful.

, This information is what the project manager will use to build the Gantt chart.

, While looking at all of the assembled information, determine how long each project step or process will take. Add this into the mix, and plot lengths for individual bars that will represent phases or processes.


Shift times for results. With a general time frame in mind for each step or process, situate these within the greater Gantt chart to arrive at a deadline for each element. It can help to stagger processes to ensure smoother operations or eliminate cluster dates, which can overwhelm the project manager.

, The Gantt chart assembles all pieces relative to a fixed deadline. Within a greater project deadline, the timeline for smaller processes becomes clear for those who are looking at the Gantt chart.

, Looking at the Gantt chart can also make it clear which parts of a project are dependent on others. Software tools can have advanced features that can help human decision makers to learn more from viewing the visual Gantt chart.

, Many project managers choose to take all of the information on a Gantt chart and input it into a software environment. For example, the Excel spreadsheet tool can be an effective home for a Gantt chart. Choose appropriate software and digitize the Gantt chart to help work it into a greater software architecture.
