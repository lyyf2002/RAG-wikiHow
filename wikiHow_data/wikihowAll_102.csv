Decide how you want to backup the file.",How to Back Up Microsoft Outlook1," All of your Outlook information, including emails, folders, contacts, calendars , and more, is stored in a single .pst or .ost file file on your computer. Copying this file will create a full backup of your Outlook information.;
, You'll need to navigate to C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\. There are a couple of ways that you can do this:You can open an Explorer window and navigate to this folder, but you'll need to display hidden files first. Click the ""View"" tab and select ""Hidden items,"" or click the ""View"" menu, select ""Folder options,"" and then check ""Display hidden files and folders."" This will allow you to see the ""AppData"" folder in your User folder.
You can press ⊞ Win, type %appdata%, and press ↵ Enter. This will open the ""Roaming"" folder. Go up one level so that you're in the ""AppData"" folder, then open ""Local"" → ""Microsoft"" → ""Outlook.""
In Windows XP, the location is C:\Documents and Settings\%username%\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook\.

, These are the data files for that user's Outlook program. The files will be named after the email address they are associated with. Most users will have .pst files, while Exchange users will typically have an .ost file.


Copy the file by selecting it and then pressing Ctrl+C or right-click it and select ""Copy.""

, There are several ways that you can securely backup this data file, depending on your needs. Creating multiple backups will help ensure that your file stays safe in case something goes wrong.


You can copy the file to a USB drive. Most .pst files will be around 10-100 MB in size, which should fit on most USB drives.
You can burn the file to a disc. This allows you to file the disc away, but may not be the best use of a whole disc due to the relatively small file size. See How to Burn a DVD for more details.
You can upload the file to a cloud storage service such as Google Drive or OneDrive. This has the benefit of giving you access to the file anywhere you can connect to the internet. See How to Back Up Data for more details on uploading files to a cloud storage service.

On this screen the tool bar is located on the upper right but this could also be on the top or left of the screen. Once you have found this tool bar click on the sketch tab and then the rectangle icon. This will be the top of your stool.;
, After clicking the rectangle icon, an image like that in figure 2 will pop up. This is just asking what plane you would like to make your rectangle on. Start on the front plane to follow along.





, After clicking the front plane the plane will not face the screen on its own. At the top of the screen you will see another tool bar, you will need to click the cube looking icon 5 in from the left and then click the front view icon that is highlighted to the right. This will center your view to the front plane.






If you chose to start on a different plane you will need to click that plane icon to center on that plane. The icons will state which plane they are when you scroll over them if it is not clear.

, Now it is time to start creating your stool. Make a rectangle by clicking anywhere on the plane, drag the mouse any direction, and click again. It does not matter the size or shape of your rectangle because you will dimension it next. Under the sketch tab used in step 1 you will see an option at the top titled smart dimension. Click this and then click the top and bottom lines of your rectangle. In this case I chose to make the height 2 inches (5.1 cm) and did this again by clicking the sides of the rectangle and typing 2 again to form a 2 by 2 inch square.






This is only to create a model stool, if you plan to use this to create a life size stool multiply all units by 10.

, Now you will need to give the square you just made some depth. Above or next to the sketch tab you will see a tab titled features and then see an extrude option, click it. On the left you will see the screen shown to the right. The only thing you should have to do is type .25 inches (0.6 cm) in the depth bar as in the screen-shot but also make sure the direction is set to blind.






For anyone who set their square to 20 by 20 inches you will want your depth to be 2.5 inches (6.4 cm).

, Now for the center leg of your stool you will need to go to the sketch tab as in step 1, select the circle option and create a circle inside the square you have. Then go to smart dimension as before and center it by clicking the center of your circle and the top of your rectangle and set the dimension to 1, or ½ of whatever height you set the square to if you didn’t make it 2. Do this again for the sides of the side of the square to center your circle in the square. You will also need to set the diameter of your circle to .75.






Make sure that on the bottom of your screen on the right you see a small text that says fully defined. If this says under defined you will need to go to the display/delete relations option under the sketch tab and click ‘Fully Define Sketch.’ This will show you the dimensions you forgot so that you can specify.

, As done before, you will need to go to the features tab and select extrude again. The same type of image as in figure 5 will appear on the left. The only thing that should be different than in figure 5 is that you should set the depth to 2. The image on the screen should look similar to figure 7.

, Now it is time to make your stool more appealing. Go to the features tab and click fillet. Then click the edge between the square and cylinder. You will see a screen similar to that in figure 5 but you will set the radius to .25.





, Repeat the previous step, but instead of selecting the edge in figure 8, select all four edges of your square as seen in figure 9. Set the radius to 1. You are now finished with your stool.

Assess your needs.,
Determine your budget.,
Search online for some of the most popular CAD software.,
Download trial versions.,
Consider any future costs.",How to Choose CAD Software," CAD software varies enormously in terms of both functionality and cost. The various programs available can be roughly classified using 2 different criteria: 2D versus 3D modeling, and polygonal mesh versus NURBS modeling.


2D CAD programs provide an interface for designing in 2 dimensions. You can use a variety of shapes and tools to construct floor plans, elevations, and sections. You will not be able to create perspective drawings or renderings, and you will not be able to rotate your design and view it from additional angles. 2D CAD software usually falls on the lower end of the price range, and offers relatively high ease of use.
3D CAD programs provide a fully 3-dimensional interface. These programs allow you to design complex buildings and objects as solids; you can also pan, zoom, and rotate the design environment to view your model any way you need to. 3D CAD applications will often have a built-in function for rendering drawings, and they also provide support for exporting models to more sophisticated rendering applications. 3D CAD programs are generally more expensive than 2D applications.
Some CAD programs model solid objects using polygons (in a process known as polygonal mesh modeling). To model a sphere, for example, the program approximates the sphere's surface using many small polygons, such as squares or triangles. Modeling using polygonal tools can often be easy, but the results aren't capable of producing fine detail in intricately curved surfaces.
Other CAD programs model solid objects using NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational Basis Spline) modeling. A NURBS is a curve which is handled through a variety of ""knot"" points - points located near the curve which allow the user to pull and adjust the curve's shape minutely. NURBS modeling is capable of producing smooth, fine detail in the most intricately curved objects. Many CAD programs (such as AutoCAD) will provide support for both polygon and NURBS modeling.;
, The functionality of different CAD programs corresponds to their price tags. The array of software available ranges from cheap and simple home remodeling software (aimed at private consumers) to full-featured, professional-quality design suites sporting an inaccessibly high price tag (these programs are marketed to design firms). Plan a budget that reflects how much you require from your CAD software.

, Read reviews and visit the manufacturer's website to compare cost, functionality, and ease of use. Take your operating system into account - some applications will only run on Windows, while some are designed exclusively for Linux or Mac. AutoCAD (produced by AutoDesk) is the industry standard, and at the other end of the spectrum Google SketchUp provides a free 3D modeling tool aimed at students.

, Nearly all CAD programs are offered as a trial version. These versions offer limited functionality and can usually be downloaded for free from the manufacturer's website. Use the trial software and decide if the program is right for your needs.

, If you are buying CAD software for a company, remember that you will need to budget for training your employees on the software, maintaining the software, and upgrading to new versions when necessary. If you are a private consumer, you will be more likely to be able to use an outdated version of the software without problems.

Finished.",How to Create a Basic Laptop Design in the Solidworks CAD Program,"

Select ""new part"" in the new SolidWorks document menu and then press “OK.”



 

;
,

Click on Sketch at the top left corner of the screen.
Select any of the three planes shown (The top plane was chosen in this example).







,

Use the line tool at the top left side of the screen to create a rectangle.






This rectangle will be used as the base of the laptop.







,

Select the lower line of the rectangle and hold the “Ctrl” button on the keyboard while selecting the predefined origin of this shape.






By simultaneously having these two objects selected, a relation is able to be made.

, Make sure the two objects are still selected.

The left side of the screen’s properties menu shows which lines are selected and contains a small sub-menu that says “Add Relations.” The Midpoint button must be selected from this menu.
The midpoint button will center the bottom line with the origin as well as move it to the origin.







,

Select the ""Smart Dimensions"" button at the top left side of the screen.






Then, click on two opposite corners of the rectangle to dimension the diagonal length.






The length used in this design is 15 inches (38.1 cm).







,

This dimension is done using a very similar method as the previous step.
Instead of selecting two opposite corners, the top and bottom lines are selected and dimensioned.






The vertical length used was 8 inches (20.3 cm).







,

Now that the rectangle is dimensioned, the Exit Sketch button at the top left of the screen is selected and the Features tab under that button is clicked.






In the Features menu, click Extrude Boss/Base button after selecting your sketch from left menu.











In this example, Sketch 2 is selected.
From here, the rectangle that was made can be extruded to any desired length and the green check mark can be selected to confirm.






In this example, the rectangle was extruded by 0.3 inches (0.8 cm).







,

The next step is to create the hinges for the laptop screen.
First, select the side face of the laptop.






Then click the sketch tab at the top left of the screen. In the Sketch menu, select the ""Sketch Button"".






When the sketch is selected to be on the plane specified, click on the ""Space Bar"" on the keyboard to open up another menu.
The orientation menu box will appear in which you are able to change the views of the shape. Click on the picture of an arrow sticking out of a flat plane (the normal button). The normal button is used to change the orientation to a view that is normal to the plane selected.






When the normal plane is being viewed, the sketch for the hinges can begin.







,

In this sketch, create a rectangle (in a similar fashion to the first sketch) on the left side of the plane as shown.







,

Like before, this rectangle needs to be dimensioned and certain parts of it need to be given relations.






Below, the edge of the previous rectangle and the left side of the new rectangle are both selected. The relation added to them is co-linear (similarly to the last sketch). The same is done to the bottom of the rectangle and the top of the previous rectangle.






When that is done, the width and height of this rectangle is decided by using the smart dimension button as done before.






The dimension result should look something like shown below.











When they are completed, you can select Exit Sketch.







,

The hinge sketch can now be extruded in the same way as was done in the previous sketch.






The direction of the extrusion can be changed with the button shown below.











“Through all” should also be selected from the left side menu in order to have the hinge extruded up to the other end of the laptop base.






When everything is confirmed, select the green check box.












,

Select the inside face of the hinge and create a sketch.






When the sketch is created, change the orientation to the normal face of the sketch.






In this sketch, the cuts are going to be created to turn the long rectangle into two normal sized hinges.






The rectangles that will make the cut should look like the picture shown below.

















,

A horizontal line should be created at the center of the object.











When this line is created, the “Trim Entities” (also around the top and left of the screen) button should be selected. This button allows you to trim away certain parts of the sketch.











In this example, the entire bottom of the sketch was trimmed away as well as the lines in between the rectangles.






When this is complete, the sketch is finished and the Exit Sketch button can be selected.







,

The features tab should be selected and the “Extruded Cut” button should be pressed.






This will cut through the piece and create the two desired hinges.






The picture below shows the complete hinges.







, A very similar method to creating the hinges is used when creating this piece.

The side plane is selected for the sketch and the orientation is changed to a view normal to the plane.






A rectangle is then created and dimensioned to the shown specifications.











The ""Exit Sketch"" button can be selected after this is done.






The screen piece is then extruded exactly as the hinges were.
This model now somewhat looks like a laptop as shown below.







, This cutout will be made using the same commands as shown before.

The top plane of the first rectangle is selected for the sketch and a rectangle is drawn as shown.
















In this example, the touch pad was extrude cut 0.1 inches (0.3 cm) into the material after the Exit Sketch button was selected.

















,

The cut-out for the keyboard is also made in a very similar way with the shown dimensions.












,

The screen is made similarly too (on the inside plane of the screen extrude) with the shown dimensions below.






















,

Now you are capable of completing more complex designs and can apply what you learned in this tutorial on other projects!

Create a business plan.,
Choose a name.,
Register your name with your Secretary of State or County Clerk, by filling out and submitting a ""Doing Business As"" (DBA) application.,
Put up a website.,
Order stationary and business cards.,
Choose a type of accounting software.,
Take on your first clients.,
Consider starting work from home while you have a small client base.",How to Build an Accounting Practice1," While you are in school or employed by an accounting firm, develop a financial, management and marketing plan for your business. Make sure you include at least 5 years of financial and other support, so that you will have time to grow your business.


At this point, you should decide if you want to take on partners. If so, you will need to enter into a partnership and register it with your state. You should also do research about competition, pricing and services. If you have experience in a niche market, research where and how you can take advantage of this competitive edge.;
, Accounting firms should have simple names that identify their name and the services they provide, so that a potential client can easily find them.

, Submit other business licenses as required by your state or country.

, Few businesses can survive in today's business world without a website. Make sure you have a professional look, contact information, a description of services and a scheduling program so that new clients can find you using a search engine and contact you.

, Place your website, email, telephone number, address and title on a simple business card so that you can market yourself to people in the community.

, It is a good idea to choose a software, like Quickbooks, that is commonly used, so that you can help clients to use this software for more complicated bookkeeping. Train thoroughly on this software.

, Begin by approaching friends or family members about doing their individual or business taxes for a reduced rate. Then, ask them to refer you to other clients. In order to afford to build your accounting practice infrastructure, you will need a base of clients.


Many accountants start their own business as a part-time endeavor. If you work at a large niche accounting firm, you may be able to take certain accounting projects on after work. You will need to prepare yourself for the possibility that you will only have part-time employment for at least a year. It is reported that home-based accountants work approximately 10 hours less per week than accountants employed at firms.

, The American Institute of CPAs reports that home-based accounting practices have a higher success rate than other home based businesses. Building a client base can take a few years, so wait until your client base is on the rise to choose a brick and mortar location.

Choose ""File"" then ""Save As"" to save the file into Excel. Access the second line near the bottom of that window to do this. Select the line that says ""Save As Type,"" and then pick your version of Excel from the offerings.
Select the ""Data"" tab and press ""Import External Data."" This will open up the ""Text Import Wizard."" You need to save the file as ""Delimited Text.""

, Many times, when you bring a text file into Excel, not all of the formatting transfers the same. Text files do not often paste into the same columns; they could be one giant sentence or paragraph.

, This can easily mean you need to separate the data into cells, rows and columns to fit your needs. It is not difficult, however, and you will be finished in a few minutes.

Make customer satisfaction a priority.,
Hire competent employees as your client base starts to grow.,
Choose a physical location carefully.,
Network.,
Expand your marketing before and during tax season.",How to Build an Accounting Practice2," The following are good practices to adopt early on in your accounting practice.


Have a personal meeting to discuss a new clients accounting needs. Ask open-ended questions about ""How,"" ""What"" and ""Why"" your client wants to grow their business or save for the future. Ask them what services they are looking for, and suggest ways to save them money.
Keep in touch by phone throughout the accounting process. Relationships can become impersonal if you communicate through secretaries or by email. Call the client to inform them of changes or issues and try to have a friendly conversation before diving into business.
Offer to train your clients to improve their bookkeeping. You can offer this as a free service or discounted consultancy fee. If they are genuinely interested, and you think this will save them money or avoid audits, then suggest ways that you can help.
Ask for referrals. Offer a small discount for any new client that comes by way of referral. Do this only after you feel comfortable that you have secured a regular client. It will cost less to keep your old clients than to go looking after new ones.

, Pay attention to an increase in business, and hire proficient accountants or assistants before the work load gets to be too much to handle. This means hiring people before the end of the calendar year, so that you have trained professionals for the busiest part of the tax season.

, Moving your growing practice from a home-base to a physical location is an excellent idea once you start to hire employees and meet with new clients. Scout a location that is in a business hub, has some space from competitors and has ample parking.

, It will be easier to find clients if you become part of the local business network. Go to mixers, professional development courses and even fun events in your town. Mingle with people you don't know and give out your business card to whomever you think would be a good contact.

, If you are new to the accounting community, put more money into print advertising, radio advertising and online advertising just before the rush of tax filing. Create a clear, professional message that touts any new or special services you offer.


You will need to have a larger marketing budget the first few years of your practice. Consider buying a client list of local businesses or home addresses and sending out a direct mail piece. Do not underprice yourself, but advertise any specials or niche services that you can offer.

Identify your accounting requirements.,
Look at the features provided by the accounting software you are considering.,
Determine whether the accounting software is compatible with your operating system, network and other computer programs and applications.,
Find out if the software is user friendly.,
Assess the amount of support you will get from the vendor.,
Evaluate the software program's security.,
Request a demonstration.,
Ask for a free trial.,
Read reviews and talk to other customers.,

, They should cover all of your basic needs and provide options that might help your accounting and financial functions run smoothly.

,


Have your information technology department work with the accounting team to establish whether the accounting software can be integrated into the current system.

, In most businesses, everyone from the Chief Financial Officer to the Accounts Payable Clerk uses the accounting software in place. You want it to be easy to understand and use for everyone.

, You want to make sure you buy accounting software that will be updated and upgraded when necessary.


Understand the process of getting help when you have problems with the software. There should be a support line available to you, with a live person ready to help troubleshoot whatever problems you might encounter.
Look for online and desktop support as well. A good accounting software program will have screen tips, a help index, tutorials and online demonstrations. Look for printed and digital user manuals that are clear and easy to access and understand.

, Your financial data is sensitive, so you want to make sure security and confidentiality is guaranteed. This can be complicated when most accounting software is web-based.


Expect advanced security features, such as login authentication and data encryption.

, Vendors are often willing to come to your office and provide a demonstration on how the software works.


Have several different people on your team try it out. Compare it to how your current software works as well as other programs you are considering.

, Some companies will allow you to try their software free of charge for a few weeks or months. The only way to really know if the software will meet your needs is to use it on a daily basis for a while.

, This will help you establish whether the accounting software delivers on its promises and determine whether there are challenges to anticipate.

, Compare the prices of each accounting software program you are considering and measure what you get for your money.

Answer the question, ""What kind of manufacturer am I?"",
Once you understand what kind of manufacturer you are, you can then search for software vendors who are good at that and have a strong customer profile matching your type of manufacturing.,
Analyze your company's operation and identify the most pressing challenges that new software must address.,
Prepare an RFI (Request for information) with a list of 15 - 20 of your primary requirements.,
Screen all the RFPs returned and then choose 2 or 3 for a demonstration.,
The last step is to check references.",How to Select Software for Your Manufacturing Company," There are these essential types: Make stock repetitive standard products, make to order or configure to order, simple job shop - all custom, mixed mode - combination of custom and standard (OEM) products, recipe batch like food chemical and beverage industry continuous process like extrusion;
, Next, sort out the vendors who have a profile for your companies your size and with your profile and who price their software in a range you can afford. This is not easy to determine since vendors do not publish their specific product costs that would allow you to project a true total cost.

, This could involve anything from tracking customer contacts, preparing quotes for customer projects, better scheduling, managing engineering changes or even things like preparing shipping documentation. You want also look look at improving your operational processes.

, Each one must be clearly defined with your expectations of what the software must be do to address them. For example, let's say you want your new software to interface with a specific CAD (Computer Aided Design System), then prepare a bill of materials and then a shop work order for that job. You will want to be the vendor understands every detail in this scenario to see if their program qualifies. Ask each vendor solicited to respond by a certain date

, Demonstration scripts should be prepared which include input from every department. Bring in each vendor and have them show how their software meets your scripts. Be sure to record and qualify all promises made by the vendor during the script presentation.

, Be sure they are recent, not old ones who have been using the software for years. Further, they should be around the same size and doing similar manufacturing that you do. Pay an onsite visit if at all possible. That way you will get the best information feedback.

, Start by getting a good vector graphics editor such as Adobe Illustrator. Making images using vector graphics is the easiest way to grasp graphics design, so spending some money on something like Illustrator or Fireworks will be a great help. Inkscape is a nice free and open-source alternative for beginners.

, These skills include:


HTML
CSS
JavaScript
jQuery
PHP
SQL
Bootstrap


Of course there are many tutorials on the Web where you can learn these languages. But we want to know about the best place for learning. The most famous place (if you search on Google) is W3Schools. The six languages listed above are enough for a start. However there is no end of learning, especially in a Web Developer's life. The main purposes of these languages are:








HTML: For the main content of the webpage,
CSS: For the page style,
JavaScript: For dynamic content,
jQuery: For easy JavaScript scripting,
PHP: For server side scripting,
SQL: For database management.
BootStrap: Rapid development for websites that is mobile ready first.


Please find and study these tutorials on W3Schools. Also you should study other stuff in W3schools as well, because they are extremely helpful.







, These technologies will enable you to create a website that does not require you to make individual HTML pages but allow you to use templates to display multiple pages within the same design.

, Create a web site that uses AJAX so you can utilise the server-side power of PHP without having to refresh the page thus saving bandwidth and enabling you to create 'interactive' web applications.

, Install a web server on your Computer so that you can work on scripts locally without an Internet connection. If you choose the PHP route try http://www.wampserver.com/en/. If you use ASP.NET use IIS available on most versions of windows.

, Get yourself some script examples to ""tinker"" with: Finding a script to dissect is the best way to learn. Try CMS's like Drupal and Joomla, The best time to start making websites is as soon as possible, for two reasons; they can take a lot of time to complete, and you learn a lot just by making them. Don't worry too much about making it perfect the first time; one of the best things about websites is that they can always be improved at any time!"

So as to form yourself and your business to stand out from the competition, you want to exhibit a clear understanding of who you are and what your skills entail. Designers are typically a square measure breed and are sometimes humble in nature.


However, once you have achieved some success through your skills, you will have earned your right to elbow the competition and mark your presence. There exists many ways to promote your business, including, word of mouth, social media and simply handing our business cards. You will soon discover which one or combination works better for your particular business model. The last thing you want to do is sit back in your favorite chair and wait for the customers to find you. This spells doom for any new business.

, While several designers approach comes with a “wait for inspiration to happen” quite angle, however the very fact is that simply a little little bit of coming up with will facilitate that inspiration return plenty a lot of quickly. As such, it’s necessary to set up and analysis well before going into the net coming up with method. coming up with will be additional divided into 3 parts:


Researching concerning the client’s company
Asking the shopper what he desires and expects from the net
Pondering upon what his competitors do and therefore the connected business trends

, though coming up with could be a feverish and fewer fascinating method (and numerous designers square measure inclined to skip it), pre-design coming up with saves some time, cash and resources the simplest. you'll be able to scan a lot of concerning “design planning” here.

, The cycle of an internet style project ends at analysis and analysis of your designed work. having the ability to just accept and implement feedback effectively is a crucial attribute of the artistic professionals. Like all different same factors, having an honest eye in citing mistakes in your own work could be a quality that success-oriented net designers ought to possess. the net designers ought to act as a devil’s advocate and decide the success of their web site being within the target audience’s shoes. what is more, taking a while to own others check your work for mistakes can go a protracted ways in which further.

, It is a general thought that graphic designers, because of their special effects skills, may be net designers and the other way around. whereas this may be true in theory, there square measure only a few professionals that bridge the gap between print-based comes and web-based comes on a daily basis.


The reality is that net coming up with could be an utterly separate field of coming up with, having its own flare and experience. These square measure 2 totally different mediums and then the target market and objectives of a websites square measure entirely different from a chunk of graphic style. there's forever the likelihood that a graphic designers advances to the extent of an internet designer once he learns bound technical skills, however it’s necessary to not assume that a rock star graphic designer can instantly achieve success once coming up with for the net. For the success of your net business, you ought to commit yourself to the sector of net coming up with and specialize yourself in it.

, The world of technology changes virtually on a daily basis, and to stay pace with it, an internet designer has to be technologically in tune with the changes within the business. Slice out a phase of your work-day or week and dedicate it to learning new things in your field. resolve what’s new, what’s trending, and what’s falling to the edge. If you don’t need to check your competitors subtract your business by showing to be newer and freshman than you, hang to the current tip.

, If we have a tendency to divide the success factors of an internet designer, net coming up with soft skills is also one in all the foremost necessary ones. As mentioned earlier, the sector of net coming up with keeps change at a quick pace. each different day there's a replacement technique being introduced. notwithstanding you aren't the one programming these new tricks, a flourishing designer has to learn and perceive the way to apply these techniques well.


Apart from different core style skills, it’s necessary to own full grasp on subjects like, the foremost trendy hypertext mark-up language committal to writing, top quality CSS for best cross browser compatibility, good basic computer program optimization practices, JavaScript UI techniques, and to create a foundational web site therein you'll be able to add a lot of pages or content with the passage of your time. Having even simply a general understanding of those multiple skill-sets will definitely land you an honest job or higher purchasers.

, Experience counts, typically even over your qualifications or skills. Likewise, an internet designer’s success depends plenty on your expertise within the field. whether or not it’s your leader or your potential shopper, folks have an interest in knowing what proportion previous expertise you've got, that firms have you ever worked with, and what comes you've got worked on. From your perspective, having a broad expertise within the field can assist you to quickly establish style solutions as they're conferred to you in conferences.


If you're still in school, don’t simply await school to finish so as to begin operating, it’s well worth the time beyond regulation to begin performing on net comes immediately. The a lot of expertise you get underneath your belt, the faster you’ll move up within the world of net designers.

, Being organized is vital for each person to achieve success. Likewise, within the case of net coming up with, your work will get extremely untidy occasionally, and this might lead you to several issues. therefore initiate with organizing your laptop by classifying texts, pictures, graphics, videos and even sound files in separate folders and label them fittingly. Maintaining a things-to-do list might also facilitate the net designers keep themselves organized, amplify their time well and end the duty easier than expected.

, Web designers, either freelance or salaried workers, ought to have business mentality once approaching any project. style within the universe is all concerning acquirement, creating worth assessments, and equalisation prices. A flourishing net styler doesn't solely design the websites for his or her purchasers, they produce business solutions for them further. If you're sensible at understanding an organization’s promoting desires and might get into the minds of the potential guests, you'll actually have a position over your competitors. However, if you discover managing the business facet of style a trifle tough to try to to, it’s price trying into operating with a bigger studio which will war the foremost responsibilities for you.

, Web coming up with isn't a single show. whether or not you're employed in a very huge style studio or with a little shopper, team work is inevitable. whereas an internet designer’s work doesn't need an over sized team of execs (in several cases it will desire you’re operating all alone), it’s necessary to grasp simply however typically your ability to figure with others and delegate tasks can get play over the course of a project. Being an honest team player suggests that understanding your role within the larger theme of things, and being useful to others – because the recent spoken language goes: 2 heads square measure forever higher than one. Learn to effectively collaborate with others, and watch your work improve!

, Maintaining an honest portfolio is crucial to any designer’s success… however net designer’s face a singular problem: your work has to keep current! whereas an advert designer will in all probability flee with keeping comes from the 1980′s in their portfolios as a result of the styles square measure still relevant, take into account however awful your web-design portfolio would be if you unbroken comes from the 1990′s!


The portfolio is that the best medium for net designers to showcase their skills and aesthetics, however a lot of significantly, it shows potential purchasers that you just square measure current, relevant, and active within the style world of immediately, not five years past. instead of without aim speech act concerning the websites you've got done, portfolio offers you a solid proof to indicate the planet what you're capable of. You’ll desire a portfolio that covers each side of net designing… together with layouts, content management, composition, typography, colors, techniques and style rationales. Showing your potential purchasers the complete scope of your work can assist you not solely to urge purchasers, however it'll additionally assist you to justify charging more cash as well!

Avoid SQL injections.,
Never open any filename based on a parameter which the user supplies.,
Sanitise any data that you write to a page.,
Never pass a user-supplied variable to a shell.,
Use functions like PHP's eval very, very carefully.,
Check the referrer on all HTTP POST requests that have side-effects.,
Never allow an HTTP GET request to have a side-effect.,
Verify credentials at every step.,
Don't store passwords as plain text.,
When using a database, do not store database login information directly in the root folder of your application.,
Don't depend on robots.txt to hide sensitive areas of your site.,
Get into the correct mindset.",How to Write Secure Software for the Web," SQL injections are possibly the most common way in which web software is compromised today. The example from Wikipedia follows. Consider the following line of pseudocode.statement := ""SELECT * FROM userinfo WHERE id = "" + a_variable + "";""
This works fine if ""a_variable"" can be trusted. However, if it's a user-supplied variable, an attacker could supply this:1;DROP TABLE users
Which would result in this query being executed:SELECT * FROM userinfo WHERE id=1;DROP TABLE users;
Which is obviously a terrible thing to have. The solution is to sanitise any user-supplied variables, religiously. PHP has the mysql_real_escape_string function for MySQL. Other database libraries for other programming have the same thing. Use them, and you'll be much safer. There are also object-relational mappers (like Django for Python) that save you from having to write SQL code at all, and take care of escaping strings before passing them to your database; consider using one of these.;
, For example, if you were displaying a file to a user, you might be tempted to have a URL like display.php?file=something.txt, and in your PHP code use this:require(""/www/awesomeapp/text-files/"" . $_GET);This is extremely dangerous, as it will allow them to use sequences of ""../"" (taking them to the parent directory) to include any file on the file system, for example by going to display.php?file=../../../../../etc/passwd.
At best, this will allow them to gather information about your server's configuration, which could provide information useful for a different attack. At worst, if PHP's require or include functions (or an equivalent in your language) are used to include the contents of the file, it can allow code execution (by manipulating the User-Agent header then including the file /proc/self/environ).
The solution to this is to either find some other way to include the file that does not do so based on user input, or very carefully sanitize the supplied file name. Check each character for validity, and discard any forbidden ones using the principle that the characters which are not allowed are forbidden, and not by simply removing harmful ones. In other words, don't try to replace bad characters in a string. Make a list of the ones that are explicitly allowed and scan the string for those, removing anything that is not in the list of allowed ones. That's 1) simpler 2) defends against attack vectors you hadn't thought of., Your code might accept a parameter called ""person"" (i.e. index.php?person=Bob, and your code would contain something like this:<h1>Hello, <?php echo $_GET;?></h1>This allows an attacker to write arbitrary JavaScript to the page, meaning that if they convinced somebody to simply follow a link to the site, they could get them to cause an action with a side-effect (for example, posting a comment, or submitting any other form). Replace any known-bad characters (quote marks, <, and &gt with their equivalent HTML entity before writing it to a page.
Many templating engines will do this for you automatically, and will only allow HTML characters in an outputted variable if they are explicitly declared safe. You may want to consider using one.
If you need to allow some limited HTML (for example, for allowing text formatting in comments), sanitise such HTML to only allow tags known to be safe and have minor side-effects (such as <em>), discard all others, and discard any unwanted HTML attributes. Once again, the principle should be only allow what is explicitly allowed, and strip everything else. (Following this principle could have prevented one notorious WordPress vulnerability, where it sanitized CSS within a ""style"" attribute, but left it untouched if the attribute name was in uppercase.), For example, you might have written a script to send a ping to a given host. It would take a parameter called host (for example, ping.php?host=127.0.0.1), and so you might be tempted to do this:system(""ping "" . $_GET);This is extremely dangerous, because by supplying a ""host"" parameter with a pipe symbol or a semicolon, it allows them to execute any command on your system (for example, giving a host of ""127.0.0.1 | wget https://www.wikihow.com/"").
The solution to this is to avoid using the system function where possible; invoke the external program some other way. pcntl_exec is a better idea for PHP. If you must use system, carefully sanitise any user-supplied data before passing it to the shell. (An example for our ""ping"" script would be to check each character to ensure that it was either a number, letter, or period, and discard any character which is anything else.), If the string includes a user-supplied variable, then that will allow them to execute arbitrary code. In fact, there is almost never a reason to use this; if you find yourself using it, your code is probably terrible and you should re-think it., Make sure that the referring site is your site; otherwise, it could have simply been a user that clicked a button on a form on another website. (You may or may not want to ensure that the referring site is non-blank. The referrer could be blank if the attacker-controlled web page uses secure HTTP and yours does not.). Another trick when using a form is generating a unique code, and storing it in both a session variable and in a hidden field in the form. When submitting, check if the value of the hidden field are equal to the one in the session variable., For example, never write to a database using parameters supplied in a GET request. Remember that a GET request could be a user of your site who was tricked into clicking a link., Here's an example:
1. The user requests to carry out a certain action.
2. You check to see if they have permission to carry out that action, displaying a ""permission denied"" page if they do not.
3. You display a ""Are you sure you want to do this?"" page with the action expressed in hidden form fields.
4. That page then posts to a script which carries out the action.
The trick is, if you only verify their permission to carry out those actions in step 2, but not at the script being posted to in step 4, this counts on them not being able to alter the form given to them in step 3 (which is trust greatly misplaced), or even going to step 4 directly., This is a mitigating measure in case your site is compromised. Since many users re-use passwords, it could mean that all their other online accounts get compromised. The standard counter-measure to this is to store a cryptographic hash (such as using the SHA-2 algorithm) of the sum of a few bytes of random data plus the password. This will make it possible to verify whether a supplied password is correct, without storing the password itself.
(For future-proofing, it might be a good idea to store the type of algorithm used as well, in case you need to migrate to a different hash algorithm, should severe weaknesses be found in current ones. This happened to MD5 and SHA-1, and may yet happen to today's most trusted hash algorithms.), Instead, store them in a different folder and then either 1) deny access to the folder using your web server's settings or .htaccess 2) store the file outside of the document root. Then include the file; your application is not affected by your web server's permissions. This will stop people from going to http://your-awesome-site.example.com/config.ini to find out your database login information (but it won't stop an attacker who has found a file inclusion vulnerability as in step 3, or a shell code execution exploit as in step 4)., There's sometimes good reason to do this (for example, if your entire site is sensitive and you don't want it indexed by search engines). But remember that one of the first things an attacker hell-bent on compromising your site will do is to look at your robots.txt to see what you are hiding. A better way of doing this is to use a meta tag on the pages you don't want to be indexed (for example, your administrative back-end pages). For example:<meta name=""robots"" content=""noindex, nofollow"" />

, This article isn't intended to be a comprehensive listing of every security problem that could affect your site, but it does give some real world examples of applying some important principles:


Never trust any information that can be supplied by the user. Indeed, assume that the user is an attacker, and treat any user-supplied data accordingly.
When sanitizing data, only allow that which is safe, and strip anything else. This defends against bad input that you hadn't thought of when you were writing the code. An example of this would be if you developed your software on and for a Unix-like system, and defended against file-inclusion vulnerabilities by removing any forward slashes from a provided file name. This would work OK, until someone deployed your code on a Windows box (which would allow a backslash as a path separator).

Assume that you'll make mistakes, and apply the principle of defense in depth to mitigate the effects. (The above ""only allow that which is safe"" is a special case of this.)

Assume a potential attacker knows everything that you do. Which is to say, write your code as if a potential attacker was sitting next to you reading it. This both encourages you to use good practice every step of the way, and mitigates the effects of your application getting compromised. Don't write bad code thinking that nobody will ever see it, or figure out how bad it is. And while security by obscurity has its place, don't count on secrets staying secret and think like an attacker.

Create new required fields in the “Application Designer” window.,
Create table with fields in the database.,
Record ""properties” can be set once the record is saved with unique name in the “Application Designer”.,
Open new page in the Application Designer.,
After fields are on the page, arrange them in order (make it user friendly to exchange the data).,
Some field property needs to be set as “Control Display”.,
Insert new “Edit box” object from the “Insert menu”.,
Insert the finished panel into the component (multiple pages can be inserted too, but for the simplicity of the example we will include only one page).,
Open up the either existing OR new Menu in the Application Designer.,
Allow the user to access the menu by giving proper security access.,
Hurrah…..user can start exchanging data information.",How to Develop Business Application in Peoplesoft," (use “File > New” menu) Existing fields can be modified and copied as new fields. These fields are saved into the database, so that can be used in one or more tables. This flexibility allows recycling the fields.;
, Existing fields can be used for this. Just use the menu “Insert” and select the field to be inserted. Once you double click left button of the mouse OR press “Insert” button, the field is inserted into the record automatically. When all the fields are inserted, then the final product “Record” will look like shown into the following figure.

, Properties can decide if this record is going to be table OR view in the database. Table stores data into the database while view can’t. View is the runtime SQL query to the table. In this example it will be set as table.

, Take all the required fields from the record (in Peoplesoft table is called record) and put them on the page (user interface is called page). Depending upon the type of field the drop down box OR the shape of the text box will be formed on the page automatically. It will look like figure shown below.

, The whole concept of Record to Page to User can be illustrated through following informative figure below.

, This means the current field will control the display of the other field (which is treated as relative display).

, Set the property of this field to be relative display (through menu “Properties”). This filed will display data related to the earlier field.

, The component is the nodal point while it is displayed to the user. Component must be selected as ""new"" from the Menu and saved once all the required properties are set according to the requirement. Also set the search record for the Component, so that while user accesses the Page, it will help to search the appropriate data efficiently. Figure below gives detailed picture.

, Insert the component into the menu and put appropriate Menu Label. After inserting the “Component” the Menu properties will look like shown in the figure below.

, Use the “Security Administration” menu to set the values. The whole concept of Page Security/Access to the User is base on “Roles and Permission Lists”. Role is a combination of small “Role” and/or “Permission List”. Each “Permission List” should be updated, so that the business user will view the required page.

, The user can start accessing the page after getting proper Roles assigned. The following picture shows how the page will look like in the real time, when business user will access the page. Details in the figure below.

Start off with a web page that you have added a Google javascript api map to.,
Create a text box input for the user to enter the street address.,
Create a button input for the user to click to geocode the address.,
Declare a variable outside of the initialize function so that it is available in any javascript code, this will store the geocode class object.,
Set the geocoder variable equal to an instance of the Google Maps geocoder class as new Google Maps Geocoder() inside the initialize() function.,
Add a second function to your javascript code, call it codeAddress.,
Make sure that the first line of the function uses getElementById to get the address from the text box and place it into a variable we'll call sAddress.,
Call the geocode method of the geocoder object, this will take two passed-in parameters.,
The callback function should first check the status value of the callback function.,
If the status equals OK, call the setCenter method of the map object variable.,
Next, use the same result geometry location to add a map marker to the map object variable.,
Finally we're going to add an alert message to the ELSE to let the user know that the Geocode didn't work like it should have.,
You can now give it a go!",How to Geocode an Address in Google Maps Javascript,";
,
Address: <input type=""text"" id=""inputTextAddress"" style="" width:200px"" title=""Address to Geocode"">

,
<input type=""button"" onclick=""codeAddress()"" id=""inputButtonGeocode"" style=""width:150px"" title=""Click to Geocode"" value=""Click to Geocode"">

,
var geocoder;

,
geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder();

, It will not have any values passed to it.
function codeAddress() { }

,
var sAddress = document.getElementById("" inputTextAddress"").value;

, The first is the GeocoderRequest, this says what kind of request is being made and what the request value is. The second is the callback function that will be used to process the results.
geocoder.geocode( { 'address': sAddress}, function(results, status) { });

, Use an IF statement to test the result, check to see if the status equal google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK. Also add an ELSE clause to the IF statement as well.
if (status == google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK) {
}
else{
}

, You will pass this method to get the result's first geometry location.
map.setCenter(results.geometry.location);

, Create a new variable – we'll call it oMarker – it will be created as a new google.maps.Marker. The new method takes two parameters, the first is the map object that you're adding the marker to, and the second is the position to place the marker, which is again the first results geometry location.
var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
 map: map,
 position: results.geometry.location
});

, You can use the status to give a bit more information rather than just saying that it didn't work.
alert(""Geocode was not successful for the following reason: "" + status);

, Type in an address, or simply a city and state, or even something as simple as a state name! You'll see the map move to the new location and add a marker to the map!

, The most important thing of Ajax is the XMLHttpRequest object. It is used to exchange data with the server and all modern browsers support the object.

The syntax to create an XMLHttpRequest() object is variable=new XMLHttpRequest(); but at the same time the syntax to create old versions of Internet Explorer (IE5 and IE6) that uses an ActiveX object is variable=new ActiveXObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP"");.
In order to handle all the modern browsers, it needs to check if the browsers support the XMLHttpRequest object. If it does, it creates an XMLHttpRequest object. If one does not, it will create an ActiveX object for it.
Then it will send a request to the server. The method of the XMLHttpRequest object called “open()” and “send()” will be used. xmlhttp.open(""GET"",""ajax_info.txt"",true); xmlhttp.send();.

Go to your Layers, and click and hold onto the ""text"" layer, and move it down to be below the ""circle"" layer. This will make some of the text disappear from being viewable, which is what we want at the moment.

Turn on the Progressive Invoicing preference in your QuickBooks accounting business software.,
When you create a bid or quote for a project, use the Estimate transaction.,
Once you have your Estimate transaction created and the work has begun, start to invoice for a portion of the estimate.",How to Use Progress Invoicing in Quickbooks,"


To do this, go to the Edit menu, select Preferences, then select Jobs and Estimates on the left side.
Under the Company Preferences tab, you will want to Yes to both “Do you create Estimates?” and “Do you do Progress Invoicing?”.;
, The Estimate functionality is very similar to creating an Invoice, and uses the same item list as you would if you actually created an invoice.


But, the Estimate transaction does have a few differences, which you need to take into consideration. First of all, an Estimate does not have an effect on your accounting books, which means it is a non-posting transaction. Second, the Estimate also includes columns to track your estimated cost, as well as your customer’s price. This allows you to ensure that you are making a profit on the bid or quote.

, When you click the Invoice button across the top of the estimate, you will have the option to create an invoice for the entire estimate, for a percentage of the estimate, or to select individual lines on the estimate transaction.


For example, if your milestones for the project are at 20%, 45%, 75% and 100%, you would in this case invoice for 20% of the estimate first, then 25% (45%-20% already invoiced), then 30% (70%-45% already invoiced), then finally 25% for the remaining amounts. As you create the invoices, QuickBooks accounting business software keeps track of what is left open, or non-invoiced on the estimate so you don’t have to manually remember that information.

Make sure that you have the right housing unit number for the tenant. Without this, rent billing can get confusing.;
,, The program has a variety of invoice templates that can be used for a rent bill or invoice.

,, If the tenant is not previously in the system, use the ""Add new"" command to set up a new tenant. Use all of the identifying information to input the new contact into QuickBooks.

, This extra feature on invoices allows for more advanced record-keeping.

, This is where the landlord bills for the rental amount by month, as well as any other applicable details.


Know the current monthly rental amount. The amount that must be billed needs to coincide with all current agreements with a specific kind. These can be influenced by rent controls, rent increases, deductions for property improvements or any other specific agreements.
Bill for other items separately. Items like pet costs, extra occupants or other costs should be addressed on a line item. This is also an opportunity to list separate security deposit costs if the tenant is moving out and will need to use part of the security deposit to pay damages to the housing unit.

, Using the QuickBooks message option, the landlord can communicate anything about the line items or other reminders or disclaimers as necessary directly to the recipient.

, The memo is something private that does not show up on the invoice. This can be helpful for various property management purposes.


Include any back rent information, length of time on the lease or any other details of the memo field. This can help the lender to track of how much time is left for a particular tenant, and where the particular unit may be headed if the lease is almost up.

, QuickBooks allows the user to choose print commands to mail the invoice, or email commands to send it by email. Choose according to current agreements with the tenant.

Create a 2 Accounts Receivable account in the COA called “Factor AR.” Any invoices that are to be given to the Factor have to be created out of this AR account.,
On a daily basis you will be able to get a Cash Receipts report from the Factor to see which invoices had been paid by the customer.,
Now, when lump sums of money are received from the Factor, all that needs to be done is make a deposit in QuickBooks depositing the money into the checking account and choosing “ Due from Factor ” as the From Account .",How to Track Accounts Receivable in Quickbooks when Working with a Factor,";
, Using this report, you can go to Customers -> Receive Payments in QuickBooks. You will receive the payments against the invoices in the normal fashion, but instead of having the payment go to the normal “ Undeposited Funds ” account, you will have to post it to a new Other Current Asset account called “ Due from Factor .” This process will reduce the actual receivable (because it’s paid) and increase the “ Due from Factor ” account therefor showing that money is owed to you from the Factor.

, This process will increase the bank account and decrease the “ Due from Factor ” account therefor reducing the amount of money that is owed to you from the Factor. If you then double click on the “ Due from Factor ” account, it will have a running balance just like a bank account so you can see the balance owed to you from the Factor.

Consider your needs.,
Measure your skills.,
Consider the specifications of the program.,
Weigh your needs and skills against the programs’ capabilities.,
Compare costs across programs.",How to Choose Tax Software1," How detailed do you need a tax software to be? How much are you willing to pay? The differences between all the types of software for simple returns are minimal. For simple returns, the major differences are ease of use, simplicity of the interface, and price. Decide which is most important for you.


The difference in capability for simple returns really is minimal. Multiple sources show the major programs—TurboTax, H&R Block, TaxAct, and FreeTaxUSA--all produced the same returns for state and federal taxes for a person with one job, no dependents, and a savings account as their chief asset.;
, The flip-side of determining your needs is measuring your skills. If you are a more advanced computer user, you might be more comfortable using software that’s less intuitive.


For example, TaxAct’s software is among the cheapest options, but is widely regarded as less intuitive than some of the others, like TurboTax.If you have a background in bookkeeping, business, or law, you might be more aware of deductions and tax credits, and better equipped to use software that allows you to skip around.

, A certain set of features will be used by almost everyone. Other features have more niche uses. If you’ve taken a measure of your skills and needs, you’ll have a better idea of which feature you need.


Nearly everyone will want software that allows you to file federal and state returns, uploads the information from your 1099 forms and W-2s, allows for easy navigation, and has a thorough help and support section.
Features which are less widely used include: the ability to file multiple returns, ability to import data from other financial programs (such as QuickBooks), and allowing adjustments for inheritances, divorces, or the birth of a child.

, A lot of people are going to want to find one tax software program and stick with it. Since virtually all of the programs keep records for all the years you use that program, it can be helpful to have the records all in one place.


Although not everyone will need it, two of the big storefront chains, H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt, both offer support from tax professionals in addition to technical support, which all of the major programs offer.Multiple sources rate TurboTax highly. They cite the software’s blend of advanced options, price, and ease of use. TurboTax uses an interview style format that ensures that the user hasn’t missed any deductions or obligations. In addition, TurboTax ease of use minimized liability and maximized returns for complex taxes for multiple reviewers., For most users drawing wages from an employer, the difference in price is going to be negligible—probably less than $30. In addition, many of the programs allow people who make less than $62,000 to file federal taxes completely free.


The difference in price really comes into play for the self-employed, like freelancers, contractors, and sole proprietors. Many of those users will need to use a software program that is tailored for those workers.
FreeTaxUSA allows the self employed to file federal taxes for free and state taxes for only $12.95, but it is not widely reviewed.If you are younger than twenty two, consider FreeTax USA. It’s completely free for state and federal filings.
Be sure to look out for discounts, including advertised sales and gift card bonuses.

Decide what you are willing to pay.,
Consider the ease of use.,
Make sure the software can import financial information from other programs.,
Look for software that supports multiple returns.,
Think about hiring an accountant.",How to Choose Tax Software2," Price generally isn’t the deciding factor for choosing software for filing personal income taxes, because most customers won’t pay more than $50 anyway. Tax software for businesses is considerably more expensive. The price for some brands, like TurboTax for Small Businesses, can easily top $200., Since business taxes are more complicated than personal income taxes, ease of use can be a more important factor in choosing business tax software. Due to their complexity, a lot of users will have a greater desire to be walked through filing their business taxes than personal income taxes, so an interview format such as the one found in TurboTax and H&R Block can be very helpful.There is a much wider variation in maximizing returns and minimizing liability when compared to personal income tax software. This seems to stem from ease and difficulty of use, rather than some programs having larger databases or more capabilities than others.
For example, some reviewers rated TaxAct’s business software as downright difficult to use, compared to the personal income tax version being simply un-intuitive.Help and support goes a long way toward making a program easier to use. Two of the big storefront chains, H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt, both offer support from tax professionals in addition to technical support, which all of the major programs offer., While a lot of people don’t even use software like QuickBooks for personal finances, almost all business owners will use financial software for their business. So when choosing tax software for your business, make sure it has this capability.Some programs will even import past information from other brands of tax programs. If you’re making a switch, look for this capability as well.

, Many business owners might divide what appears to be one business into several companies, which would require filing more than one state and federal return.Additionally, a lot of businesses derive income from multiple sources and do business in multiple states. Using a software program that allows the filing of multiple returns for little or no extra money would be advantageous for them as well.

, For some people, the $200 price tag and the aggravation of doing their own business taxes won't be worth it. If gathering financial information and choosing software seems like a task that's too daunting, give serious thought to choosing a competent, experienced professional to complete your taxes for you.

Open your database.,
Learn the basic data types.,
Create your table.,
Verify that your table was created properly.,
Create a table using PHP.,
Add a single entry to your table.,
Add multiple entries at once.,
Display your table.,
Enter data using an HTML form.",How to Create a Table in MySQL," In order to create a table, you must have a database to house it in. You can open your database by typing USE database at the MySQL command prompt.


If you don't remember your database's name, type SHOW DATABASES; to list the databases on the MySQL server.
If you don't have a database yet, you can create one by typing CREATE DATABASE database;. The database name cannot contain spaces.;
, Every entry in the table is stored as a certain type of data. This allows MySQL to interact with them in different ways. The data types you will use will depend on the needs of your table. There are many more types than these, but you can use these to make a basic, useful table:



INT - This data type is for whole numbers, and is often used for ID fields.

DECIMAL - This data type stores decimal values, and is defined by the total number of digits and after the number after the decimal. For example: DECIMAL(6,2) would store numbers as ""0000.00"".

CHAR - This is the basic data type for text and strings. You would normally define a limit for the number of characters stored, such as CHAR(30). You can also use VARCHAR to vary the size based on input. Phone numbers should also be stored using this data type, as they often contain symbols and do not interact with numbers (they are not added, subtracted, etc.).

DATE - This data type stores dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD. Use this if you need to store someone's age as opposed to their actual age, otherwise you will need to update the entry every year.

, To create your table in the command line, you will be creating all of your fields in one command. You create tables using the CREATE TABLE command, followed by your table's information. To create a basic employee record, you would enter the following command:




CREATE TABLE employees (id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, lastname VARCHAR(20), firstname VARCHAR(20), phone VARCHAR(20),  dateofbirth DATE)






INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT creates an ID number for each employee that is added to the record. The number increases each time automatically. This allows you to easily reference employees with other functions.
Although VARCHAR allows you to trim the size based on input, you can set a limit for it so that the user can't input strings that are too large. In the above example, both first name and last name are limited to 20 characters each.
Note that the phone number entry is stored as VARCHAR so that symbols are handled correctly.

, Once you create your table, you will receive a message that it was successfully made. You can now use the DESCRIBE command to ensure that you included all the fields you wanted to and that they have the right data types. Type DESCRIBE database; and refer to the chart that appears to check your table's structure.

, If you are using PHP to administer your MySQL database through a webserver, you can create a table using a simple PHP file. This assumes that the database already exists on your MySQL server. Enter the following code to create the same table as Step 3, replacing the connection information with your own:




<?php
$connection=mysqli_connect({{samp|server}},{{samp|user}},{{samp|password}}, {{samp|database}});
if (mysqli_connect_errno())
{
echo ""Failed to connect to MySQL: "" . mysqli_connect_error();
}
$sql = ""CREATE TABLE employees 
(
id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, 
lastname VARCHAR(20),
firstname VARCHAR(20),
phone VARCHAR(20),
dateofbirth DATE
)"";
 
if (mysqli_query($connection,$sql))
{
echo ""Table employees created successfully"";
}
else
{
echo ""Error creating table: "" . mysqli_error($connection);
}
?>





, You can enter data into your table directly from the command line. You can use one command to enter all of the related fields for an entry using INSERT INTO:




INSERT INTO employees (id, lastname, firstname, phone, dateofbirth) VALUES (NULL, 'Smith', 'John', '(555)555-5555', '1980-01-31');






By entering NULL for the ID, the value will increase by 1 from the last entry, resulting in the next ID number.
Make sure that each value you enter has single quotes (') around it.

, If you have all of the data in front of you, you can insert multiple entries with one INSERT INTO command. Simply separate the value sets with a comma:




INSERT INTO employees (id, lastname, firstname, phone, dateofbirth) VALUES (NULL, 'Smith', 'John', '(555)555-5555', '1980-01-31'), (NULL, 'Doe', 'Jane', '(555)555-5551', '1981-02-28'), (NULL, 'Baker', 'Pat', '(555)555-5554', '1970-01-31');





, Once you've inserted a few entries, you can display your table to see how everything looks. This will let you see if you've missed any information or if something is in the wrong spot. To display the table created above table, type SELECT * FROM employees.


You can perform more advanced displays by adding filters to the search. For example, to return the table sorted by date of birth, you would type SELECT lastname, firstname, dateofbirth FROM employees ORDER BY dateofbirth

Reverse the order of the results by adding DESC to the end of the command.

, There are other ways to enter data into your new table. One of the most common is through using a form on a web page. To see how to create a basic form to fill out your table, see this guide.

Create a MySQL database.,

Create a MySQL table named ""sessions"".",How to Create a Secure Session Management System in PHP and MySQL1,"
In this guide we will create a database called ""secure_sessions"".
See how to Create-a-Database-in-Phpmyadmin.
Or you can use the SQL code below will create one for you.Create Database Code:




CREATE DATABASE `secure_sessions` ;





Note: Some hosting services don't allow you to create a database through phpMyAdmin, Learn how to do it in cPanel.;
,
This means that if there was ever a breach of security in our script the hacker couldn't drop tables from our database. If you're really paranoid, create a different user for each function.

User: ""sec_user""

Password: ""eKcGZr59zAa2BEWU""

Create User Code:




CREATE USER 'sec_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'eKcGZr59zAa2BEWU';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON `secure_sessions`.* TO 'sec_user'@'localhost';





Note: It is a good idea to change the password in the code above when running on your own server. (Make sure you change your PHP code also.) Remember it doesn't need to be a password that you can remember so make is as complicated as possible. Here's a random password generator.

,
The code below creates a table with 4 fields (id, set_time, data, session_key).Create the ""sessions"" table:




CREATE TABLE `sessions` (
  `id` CHAR(128) NOT NULL,
  `set_time` CHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  `data` text NOT NULL,
  `session_key` CHAR(128) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;





We use the CHAR datatype for fields we know the length of, as the fields ""id"" and ""session_key"" will always be 128 characters long. Using CHAR here saves on processing power.

For example, to create a database of all the US states, you might enter CREATE DATABASE us_states;

Note: Commands do not have to be entered in upper-case.
Note: All MySQL commands must end with "";"". If you forgot to include the semicolon, you can enter just "";"" on the next line to process the previous command.;
, Enter the command SHOW DATABASES; to list all of the databases you have stored. Besides the database you just created, you will also see a mysql database and a test database. You can ignore these for now.

, Once the database has been created, you will need to select it in order to begin editing it. Enter the command USE us_states;. You will see the message Database changed, letting you know that your active database is now us_states.

, A table is what houses your database’s information. To create one, you will need to enter all of your table formatting in the initial command. To create a table, enter the following command: CREATE TABLE states (id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, state CHAR(25), population INT(9));. This will create a table named ""states"" with three fields: id, state, and population.


The INT command will make the id field contain only numbers (integers).
The NOT NULL command makes sure that the id field cannot be left blank.
The PRIMARY KEY designates the id field as the key field in the table. The key field should be set to a field that cannot contain any duplicates.
The AUTO_INCREMENT command will automatically assign increasing values into the id field, essentially automatically numbering each entry.
The CHAR(characters) and INT(integers) commands designate the types of data allowed in those fields. The number next to the commands indicated how many characters or integers can fit in the field.

, Now that the table has been created, it’s time to start entering your information. Use the following command to input your first entry: INSERT INTO states (id, state, population) VALUES (NULL, 'Alabama', '4822023');


This is essentially telling the database to enter the information provided into the three corresponding fields in the table.
Since the id field contains the command NOT NULL, entering NULL as the value will force it to automatically increment to 1, thanks to the AUTO_INCREMENT command.

, You can create multiple entries using a single command. To enter the next three states, use the following command:INSERT INTO states (id, state, population) VALUES (NULL, 'Alaska', '731449'), (NULL, 'Arizona', '6553255'), (NULL, 'Arkansas', '2949131');.


This will create a table that looks like the following:






, Now that the basic database has been created, you can enter queries to return specific results. First enter the command: SELECT * FROM states;. This will return your entire database, as signified by the ""*"" command, which means ""all"".


For a more advanced query, enter the following command: SELECT state, population FROM states ORDER BY population; This will return a table with the states sorted by population instead of by alphabetical listing. The id field will also not be displayed, since you only asked for the state and population entries.
To list the states by population in reverse order, enter the following command: SELECT state, population FROM states ORDER BY population DESC;. The DESC command will list them in descending order, which will sort it by high to low instead of low to high."

,
This function will be called every time we create a new instance of an object using the 'session' class. You can read up on the PHP __construct function here.
This function sets our custom session handler so it is available for use as soon as the class is instantiated (i.e., made/built/constructed).__construct function:




function __construct() {
   // set our custom session functions.
   session_set_save_handler(array($this, 'open'), array($this, 'close'), array($this, 'read'), array($this, 'write'), array($this, 'destroy'), array($this, 'gc'));
 
   // This line prevents unexpected effects when using objects as save handlers.
   register_shutdown_function('session_write_close');
}





,
This function will be called every time you want to start a new session, use it instead of session_start();. See the comments in the code to see what each line does.start_session function:




function start_session($session_name, $secure) {
   // Make sure the session cookie is not accessible via javascript.
   $httponly = true;
 
   // Hash algorithm to use for the session. (use hash_algos() to get a list of available hashes.)

   session_start();
   // This line regenerates the session and delete the old one. 
   // It also generates a new encryption key in the database. 
   session_regenerate_id(true); 
}





,
This function will be called by the PHP sessions when we start a new session, we use it to start a new database connection.open function:




function open() {
   $host = 'localhost';
   $user = 'sec_user';
   $pass = 'eKcGZr59zAa2BEWU';
   $name = 'secure_sessions';
   $mysqli = new mysqli($host, $user, $pass, $name);
   $this->db = $mysqli;
   return true;
}





,
This function will be called when the sessions want to be closed.close function:




function close() {
   $this->db->close();
   return true;
}





,
This function will be called by PHP when we try to access a session for example when we use echo $_SESSION;. Because there might be many calls to this function on a single page, we take advantage of prepared statements, not only for security but for performance also. We only prepare the statement once then we can execute it many times.
We also decrypt the session data that is encrypted in the database. We are using 256-bit AES encryption in our sessions.read function:




function read($id) {
   if(!isset($this->read_stmt)) {
      $this->read_stmt = $this->db->prepare(""SELECT data FROM sessions WHERE id = ? LIMIT 1"");
   }
   $this->read_stmt->bind_param('s', $id);
   $this->read_stmt->execute();
   $this->read_stmt->store_result();
   $this->read_stmt->bind_result($data);
   $this->read_stmt->fetch();
   $key = $this->getkey($id);
   $data = $this->decrypt($data, $key);
   return $data;
}





,
This function is used when we assign a value to a session, for example $_SESSION= 'something else';. The function encrypts all the data which gets inserted into the database.write function:




function write($id, $data) {
   // Get unique key
   $key = $this->getkey($id);
   // Encrypt the data
   $data = $this->encrypt($data, $key);
 
   $time = time();
   if(!isset($this->w_stmt)) {
      $this->w_stmt = $this->db->prepare(""REPLACE INTO sessions (id, set_time, data, session_key) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)"");
   }
 
   $this->w_stmt->bind_param('siss', $id, $time, $data, $key);
   $this->w_stmt->execute();
   return true;
}





,
This function deletes the session from the database, it is used by php when we call functions like session__destroy();.destroy function:




function destroy($id) {
   if(!isset($this->delete_stmt)) {
      $this->delete_stmt = $this->db->prepare(""DELETE FROM sessions WHERE id = ?"");
   }
   $this->delete_stmt->bind_param('s', $id);
   $this->delete_stmt->execute();
   return true;
}





,
This function is the garbage collector function it is called to delete old sessions. The frequency in which this function is called is determined by two configuration directives, session.gc_probability and session.gc_divisor.gc() function:




function gc($max) {
   if(!isset($this->gc_stmt)) {
      $this->gc_stmt = $this->db->prepare(""DELETE FROM sessions WHERE set_time < ?"");
   }
   $old = time() - $max;
   $this->gc_stmt->bind_param('s', $old);
   $this->gc_stmt->execute();
   return true;
}





,
This function is used to get the unique key for encryption from the sessions table. If there is no session it just returns a new random key for encryption.getkey() Function:




private function getkey($id) {
   if(!isset($this->key_stmt)) {
      $this->key_stmt = $this->db->prepare(""SELECT session_key FROM sessions WHERE id = ? LIMIT 1"");
   }
   $this->key_stmt->bind_param('s', $id);
   $this->key_stmt->execute();
   $this->key_stmt->store_result();
   if($this->key_stmt->num_rows == 1) { 
      $this->key_stmt->bind_result($key);
      $this->key_stmt->fetch();
      return $key;
   } else {
      $random_key = hash('sha512', uniqid(mt_rand(1, mt_getrandmax()), true));
      return $random_key;
   }
}





,
These functions encrypt the data of the sessions, they use an encryption key from the database which is different for each session. We don't directly use that key in the encryption but we use it to make the key hash even more random.encrypt() and decrypt() functions:




private function encrypt($data, $key) {
   $salt = 'cH!swe!retReGu7W6bEDRup7usuDUh9THeD2CHeGE*ewr4n39=E@rAsp7c-Ph@pH';
   $key = substr(hash('sha256', $salt.$key.$salt), 0, 32);
   $iv_size = mcrypt_get_iv_size(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB);
   $iv = mcrypt_create_iv($iv_size, MCRYPT_RAND);
   $encrypted = base64_encode(mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, $key, $data, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB, $iv));
   return $encrypted;
}
private function decrypt($data, $key) {
   $salt = 'cH!swe!retReGu7W6bEDRup7usuDUh9THeD2CHeGE*ewr4n39=E@rAsp7c-Ph@pH';
   $key = substr(hash('sha256', $salt.$key.$salt), 0, 32);
   $iv_size = mcrypt_get_iv_size(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, MCRYPT_MODE_ECB);
   $iv = mcrypt_create_iv($iv_size, MCRYPT_RAND);
   $decrypted = mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, $key, base64_decode($data), MCRYPT_MODE_ECB, $iv);
   $decrypted = rtrim($decrypted, ""\0"");
   return $decrypted;

Type this on a new line.",How to Connect to MySQL Using PHP2,"


This line is fairly simple. Before your can run any queries on a specific database, you must select which database. In PHP to do this we use the ""mysql_select_db"" function, which requires 1 argument. The first argument in the code is required, it is the name of the database to connect to. The second argument I used is not required but good practice; it defines which server connection to use to select the database.

Type this on a new line.,
Take some time to play around with these concepts.",How to Connect to MySQL Using PHP3,"


The function mysql_query works in two ways. ""For SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE, EXPLAIN and other statements returning result set, mysql_query() returns a resource on success, or FALSE on error.
For other type of SQL statements, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, etc, mysql_query() returns TRUE on success or FALSE on error."" (PHP documentation).


These lines of code do two things. First they call ""mysql_query,"" which will return true or false based on the success of the query. If the output of mysql_query is false the script will die and run the ""mysql_error"" function (which simply returns the previous MySQL error).


The mysql_query function only requires one argument, but like the mysql_select_db function, it is good practice to include a second.

The first argument is a string: a single MySQL query (multiple queries not allowed). The query above creates a new table called ""php tutorial"".
The second argument is the connection resource we are using (in our case $con).



,


The first line of code is similar to the last step's code. It is in there to give of some data to select. Below, see we are setting the output of mysql_query to a variable called $result.

Also notice how the code does not use ""or die("" instead it uses the if control statement. This can save you grief when you start getting into error handling beyond simply killing the script. You don't have to worry about it too much now, and you can use ""or die"" on MySQL queries that return a result set if you want


After the else statement we have a while statement. This part of the code can be confusing so bear with me. mysql_fetch_array will return an array of data containing a single row of the result, labeled by column; however, the next time mysql_fetch_array is run it will return an array of the next row in the result set.

The while statement will keep iterating through all the rows (assigning them as arrays to $row), until mysql_fetch_array reaches the end of the result set, then it will return false and the while statement will close. Confusing yes. But this method works well.



, These functions allow you to do so much more with PHP. I would suggest taking a look at this wikiHow page: How to Create a Basic Login Script in PHP. I would also suggest making your own project like a simple browser turn based rpg to get the hang of working with a database.

In order to make this live session possible, you will need a camera to capture the live action, a PC (Personal Computer) and a cable that will connect the two and transfer data, usually a firewire cable will be used to establish the connection, one can be purchased at any local electronics retailer.,
Be sure that you have a solid internet connection before downloading Windows Media Encoder.,
Click on the link Windows Media Encoder 9 Series.,
This action should bring you to a new page which will ask you to Download the software.,
Once clicked, there will now be an option to “run” or “save”, make sure to click the ‘save’ option and save the software your system.,
Find the camera that will capture the action, you have an option of using a microphone to record sound or getting a camera that has 2 in 1.,
Once the new software has been successfully downloaded onto your system, the Main menu will appear, locate it by going into the ‘start menu’ in the bottom left corner on your desktop taskbar.,
At this stage, you should have located Windows Media Encoder 9 Series now installed onto your system.,
Run the Window Media Encoder that your have just installed found under the ‘Wizards’ tab, and double click the “Broadcast a Live Event” icon to begin the process.

,
You can broadcast video, but you also have to make sure that you are able to project sound.,
Here you have two options too choose from: The “Push” option and the recommended “Pull” option.,
Now it is time to connect to you and making sure that your server name and settings reflect your server’s name and URL.

,
Continuing by clicking “next” Now is the time to set your speed and refresh rate to treat your viewers to a crystal clear webcast.,
Change the settings on your website so it will link to the webcast’s IP address.",How to Create a Live Webcast Using Windows Media Encoder," keeping in mind that Windows Media Encoder only supports Window platforms.

Get a scanner.,
Have appropriate software.,
Have scannable documents.",How to Scan Documents1," In order to scan documents, you will need to first purchase a scanner. You can get stand alone scanners or scanners which function as part of a combined system (with a fax machine, printer, or copy machine). These can be purchased from office supply stores, electronics stores, as well as a number of online sources.


Once you’ve purchased the scanner, you will need to plug it into your computer and install the associated software. Generally the scanner will connect to the computer via a USB cable (which should be included). It will also usually need to be plugged into a power source. Don’t forget to plug it in. The software installation will usually be very straightforward. Follow the directions provided in the user manual or by the installation disk.





;
, You will need software to run the scanner. This will generally be included with the scanner, unless you are buy one used (so be sure to ask about the software if you do). You will also need software for editing the scans, if you plan on doing anything too complex with them.


Programs like Adobe Acrobat will let you turn scanned text into readable, multipage documents. Programs like Adobe Photoshop will allow you to edit and fix scanned photographs or turn scanned text into large spreads.







, You will need the documents that you want to scan, since they will need to be placed inside the scanner (much like a copy machine). You will also need to ensure that your documents are scannable. If they are not flat, larger than the scan surface, or need to contain certain security features like the special reflective material in checks, then these items cannot be scanned.

"
"
Open the scanner.,
Place the items into the scanning tray or glass.,
Open your scanning software.,
Adjust the scan settings.,
Select “Scan”.,
Make further adjustments, if necessary.",How to Scan Documents2," Once you have your scanner and have hooked it up to your computer, you can begin scanning your documents. Open the lid of the scanner, in much the same way you’d open a copy machine, in order to reveal the glass scanning surface.

, Place the side of the document that you want scanned down onto the glass. This will allow the camera below to see the item. Place the document the appropriate place; the space for a standard-size paper, as well as several other common sizes, will be marked along the edges of the glass. Any part of the document which does not fit on the glass will not be scanned. Once you have placed the item, close the lid.

, Now that the item is place, open your scanning software on your computer. This can be accessed in a variety of ways. Try to install the software such that an icon is always readily accessible.

, Adjust the settings as necessary for the document that you plan to scan. Text documents can often be scanned in black and white, while some scanning software may make allowances for scanning photos vs scanning posters. The software varies widely across brands and devices, so you will have to experiment.


Often the settings you will want to change will be relating to the quality of the scan. Higher quality scans will produce much larger files. Scan only to the quality you need. Images may need to be high quality where text can generally be scanned at a very low quality. Some software will have preset settings for this.







, Once the settings have been adjusted, you will need to tell the software or the scanner to begin scanning the document. There may be a “Scan” button in the software or you may need to press a “Scan” button on the machine itself. Read your user manual if you become too confused.

, Once the item is scanned, your software will usually give you the option to make further adjustments, such as changing the orientation of the image. Make whatever adjustments you feel are necessary and then tell the software to save the file.


Be aware that scanned images are usually quite large, especially if you have chosen to scan at high settings. Change the settings and rescan the image if the file size is simply too large for your purposes.






Pay attention to the file format that the document saves in. You may wish to choose something other than the default.







"
"
Edit text.,
Edit images.",How to Scan Documents3," Once your document has been scanned, you may wish to use a program like Adobe Acrobat to turn the files into a PDF or stitch them together into some kind of multi-page document. You can also set Acrobat to recognize the scanned text and make it searchable or editable.


If saved as an image, you may want to up the contrast using photo software in order to make the text more legible.







, Open the image using either your computer’s basic photo software or a more complex program like Photoshop. From there you can change contrast, levels, and a variety of other aspects of the image.

Acrobat Reader, Foxit Reader, or Windows Reader App are a few free options for viewing .pdf files.
You can create a document in a word processor like Word, or Google Docs and save it as .pdf file, but further manipulation of that PDF will not be possible without Acrobat.;
, Open Adobe Acrobat and press Tools > Create PDF. This is where you start when importing files to turn into a PDF or starting a new PDF from scratch.


There are a number of import options to choose from, including importing a single or multiple files, a scanned file, a webpage, or the contents of your clipboard.

Adobe limits its file support to Microsoft Office (2007 and later) or OpenOffice filetypes, as well as basic text (.txt, .rtf), image files, or other adobe products.


Selecting a file will create a PDF copy of that file in the same location on your computer as the original file.

, With the file now opened, press “Edit PDF” and select a highlighted box of text. You can either type out the changes you want or utilize the options in the Format section.

, Press “Edit PDF” and select any highlighted image. Use the options in the Objects section to manipulate the image.

, Open a PDF file in Acrobat and press “Organize Pages” in the right-hand panel. The interface will change to display thumbnail previews of all pages. A new toolbar appears with a number of options: “Rotate”, “Delete”, “Extract”, “Insert”, “Replace”.

, Select the thumbnail of the desired page and press either the “Rotate Left” or “Rotate Right” arrow buttons to rotate the page 90 degrees.

, Select the thumbnail of the desired page and press the “Delete” (Trashcan icon) and press “OK” to confirm.


You can select multiple pages to delete at once with Ctrl + Click (⌘ Cmd + Click on Mac).

, Pressing the Insert tool reveals a menu with options similar to new PDF creation: “Insert from File”, “Webpage”, “Scanner”, “Clipboard”, or “Blank Page”. Any selection will add the new page to the end of the document.


This menu can also be accessed from the “+” button next to any of the page thumbnails. This method will insert the new page in this location.
You may insert any filetype supported by Acrobat. It will be integrated into the .pdf like importing any other file.
Free users can still merge PDF files using a variety of online services. Typically the process involves uploading each file to the site, selecting the order, and downloading the merged file.

In this case, usually all of the files must already be in the PDF format in order to be merged.



, Click the thumbnail of the page you want to replace and press the “Replace” button. Browse to the location of the desired replacement page, select it, and press ""OK"" to confirm the page replacement.


Multiple pages can be replaced with your page selection by selecting a page range from the box prior to confirmation.
Note, the replacement page must be an Acrobat supported filetype.

, Select the thumbnail(s) of the page(s) you want to move and simply drag and drop them to the preferred location in the PDF. A blue line will indicate the area that you have selected to place them before dropping them.


You can also select specific page ranges, or other options like all even/odd pages, from the “Select Page Range” menu.

, Select the desired pages to extract, Press the “Extract” toolbar button, then the “Extract” button that appears below it. This will extract the selected pages into a new separate PDF file. These pages are not removed from the original document.

Convert the PDF to another file type.",How to Print PDF Files," Adobe makes a free reader program that can be downloaded from their website. You can also download readers from a variety of other developers. If you'd rather not download a reader program, most browsers can open PDF files in a browser window.;
, Use your reader program to open the PDF, or open it in your browser by dragging the file into the browser window.

, This will open a print dialog box displaying various options. Certain readers and web browsers make a Print button available at the top or bottom of the document without having to open the File menu.

, In the Print dialog box, you will be able to choose the printer that you want to send the document to. This is especially important if you are in an environment with more than one printer.


Check that the printer you selected is either directly connected to the computer or the network you are using and is working perfectly.
A sufficient amount of paper should also be loaded in the printer.

, If your PDF file is multiple pages and you only need specific ones, use the Range or Pages section of the Print window to set which pages should be sent to the printer.

, Choose advanced printing features by clicking on ""Properties"" button. From here a number of selections can be made to the layout, finish, and other features of the PDF file. Additionally, this is where to select whether to print in color or in black and white.


The location of features will vary depending on the software you are using to open the PDF file.
In Adobe Reader, a front cover as well as a back cover can be printed from the ""Cover Mode"" tab. In addition, in order to save printer toner ""Toner Save"" can be selected under ""Quality"". This will slightly reduce the quality of the final printed file. An additional way to save paper is to print double-sided by selecting ""Two-Sided"" under Print Type from the ""Layout"" tab.

, Once you have set all of your printing options, you can send it to printer by clicking the Print button. Your document will be added to the printer queue.

, Before trying any software fixes, ensure that your printer is properly connected and has enough ink and paper to complete the print job. A paper jam could also cause a document to not print.

, Try printing something other than a PDF file, such as a Word document. If the document prints without issue, then the problem is most likely the PDF file. If the document does not print, then your printer may be malfunctioning.

, Some printers may have difficulties with PDFs until they are updated. Visit your printer's manufacturer's website and search for your printer model in the Support section. Download the latest drivers and install them.

, Try printing the PDF file to a completely different printer. This may solve the problem if the original printer is simply not compatible.

, If nothing else works, you can convert the PDF to an image file. This should allow the printer to print it without causing any problems. For details on how to convert your PDF, see this guide."

Likewise, if your content is easily copied or shared your control of the content is limited. e-Publishing gives you the ability to both widely disseminate your content as well as limit who can see your content, copy it, and even print it.;
, There are several ways to get started. If you only have a physical copy, it is best to retype it, but if you are unable to do so, it can be scanned.

If you have an update to the document or a new issue, you would conceivably want to update every copy of your PDF on the internet. This is not possible. You also will not maintain any statistics on who is reading the document. e-Publishing solves these problems. So the next step is to find an e-Publishing solution.

, There are several e-Publishing solutions available. Depending on your budget you can spend from a few dollars a month to more than a $1000. e-Publishing goes by a few names including; e-zine, online page flip book, e-magazine, etc. A few of these solutions, have a free trial, which I suggest you try first to see if your customer respond to the approach, before diving into a big monthly fee.

, Some have different capabilities on controlling your content while some are designed for mass publishing. Think what niche you are in. If you are a content creator for a group of people you may want one system and if you want to broadcast to everyone you will want another. (Note: while everyone may think they want to broadcast to everyone, it is important to note that your content will quickly be pushed down to nearly invisible on these systems if it is not deemed popular). With this said your options include docq.com, issuu.com, scribd.com, zmags.com, and epaperflip.com are popular solutions.

, Once logged in you will be brought to your ""My Docs"" page. Here you will upload the document you wish to publish. Chose the upload button on the left side and select the PDF document on your local computer.

If it's very old or in bad shape, the scanner may have difficulty capturing the text in a readable state. Scan the document in any of the major formats, including PDF, JPG, or TIFF.


Newer scanners may come with software that will automatically convert the document into an editable format.If you have Office 2003 or 2007 installed, use the Microsoft Office Document Scanning program to perform the scan. This program will convert the text as it scans. The program is not available in newer versions of Office.
The TIFF format will give you the most success when using an OCR conversion program.
Scan in black and white if possible. Scanning in black and white will make it much easier for the OCR program to convert the document. Only color scan if you absolutely need any images on the document.;
, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) programs attempt to match characters from an image with characters in their databases. They then reconstruct the document into a format that is editable in any word processor.


There are several free and paid OCR programs available online. There are also websites that perform OCR functions for small files.
Adobe Acrobat has OCR built-in, as does Evernote.
Depending on the quality of the scan, you may encounter several errors after converting.
OCR programs will often not maintain the formatting of the original document, instead only returning the test in plain-text format.

, The process varies depending on which program you are using, but generally you just need to open the file and the program will convert it for you, and then save the results as a new text file.


Most OCR programs let you choose which format to output the converted to. Choose a format that works with your preferred word processor., For instance, if the document was slightly askew when it was copied, the OCR program may have inserted numerous changes in tab settings, line spacing, and fonts. You can remove the codes by using a simple word processor such as Notepad that doesn't recognize the formatting codes, or by cutting and pasting the document without the codes.

, Once you have finished processing the scanned document with an OCR program, open it in your preferred word processor and begin making corrections. There will likely be several spots that were converted incorrectly, so you may have multiple changes to make to spelling and formatting.


Use spellcheck to quickly find errors that occurred in the conversion process. You will still need to search for formatting errors and words that are considered spelled correctly but are actually incorrect.

Check that the files are indeed there by double-clicking on the zip folder. If they are, you can then delete the original files.;

, Backups are another way of archiving, although you probably know this method by another name -- burning a disc. For example, Windows uses a Live File System and a Mastered format (better for compatibility in other devices) for copying files to CDs or DVDs.


Insert a writable CD or DVD into your computer's CD or DVD recorder for the Live File System.
When the dialog box appears, click ""Burn files to data disc.""
Name the disk, then click ""Next.""
Wait for an empty folder for the disc to appear. This means the disc is formatted and ready to copy files.
Open the folder with the documents you want to archive and drag the files into the empty disc folder.
For the Mastered format, insert a writable CD or DVD into a computer's CD or DVD recorder.
When the dialog box appears, click ""Burn files to data disc.""
Name the disc and click ""Show formatting options.""
Choose ""Mastered"" and click ""Next.""
Wait for an empty folder for the disc to appear. This means the disc is formatted and ready to copy files.

In addition to functioning as a location for archived files, secure offsite storage locations protect data from disasters such as fire and hard drive failures.
With so many companies offering this service, you must contact a company directly for specifics on how they operate and what guarantees are included in archiving documents offsite.

Extract the files.",How to Unzip Files on Windows2," There are lots of different compression formats out there, and most of them are not natively supported by Windows. These other formats became popular due to the more efficient compression that they offer over .zip (along with a variety of other factors). In order to unzip these files on a Windows computer, you'll need to install a program that supports the format. Some of the most common formats you'll come across include:



.rar - This is a proprietary compression format, and is very common for downloaded files and torrents. While you'll need the paid version of WinRAR to create .rar files, there are a variety of free programs that can open and extract .rar files.

.tar.gz - This is a form of compression most commonly used in Linux. .tar.gz is actually two formats in one: .tar is an archival format, and .gz is a compression format (gzip). Most free compression programs can create and open .tar.gz files.

.7z - This is an open-source form of compression that is gaining popularity. It allows for efficient compression and encryption. You can use the free official program to open these files or a variety of other compression programs.

.bz2 - This is another form of Linux compression. The file may be a .bz2 file, or it may be in the .tar.bz2 format. In either case, most free compression programs can open this file type.

, All of the formats listed above, along with dozens of others, can be opened by using free, open-source software. The only time you'd need to pay for archival software on Windows is if you have to create .rar files (WinRAR). To open and extract files from virtually any format, download and install one of the following programs:7-Zip (7-zip.org) - This is the official program for the .7z format, and can open any of the formats listed above, including .rar files.
PeaZip (peazip.org) - This is another free, open source archival program. It is the official program for the .pea format, a newer form of compression. Like 7-Zip, PeaZip can open and extract virtually any archival format.

, As your install your archival program, you'll be prompted to associate the program with various file types. Make sure the boxes are checked for the file types that you want to open with the archival program, such as .rar and .tar.gz.


Doing this during installation will make it easier to open these types of files in the future, as you will just need to double-click them to open them.

, If you set your new archival program to handle the type of file you're trying to open, you can just double-click the file to launch the archival program. If you didn't set your archival program to open that type of file, you'll need to right-click the file, select ""Open with"", and then select your newly-installed program.


Note: If you're using 7-Zip, select ""7-Zip File Manager"" from the list of available programs, not ""7-Zip GUI"" or ""7-Zip Console"".
If you have a multi-part .rar file, start by opening the first file in the series. Make sure all of the parts are located in the same folder before you start extracting. Multi-part .rar files have different extensions than normal. They could be labeled "".000.rar"", "".001.rar"", etc., or "".part01.rar"", "".part02.rar"", etc. Older split .rar files may have the extensions "".r00"", "".r01"", etc., Once you've opened the file in your archival program, you can begin extracting it. The process varies a little depending on the program you are using, but you can generally select the location that you want to extract the files to when you click the ""Extract"" button.

Keep it simple!,
Read the manual.,
Plug in the power cord.,
Plug in the USB cable.,
Power up the drive.,
Copy your files.",How to Transfer Data Between Two Hard Drives1," Plugging in an external drive has never been easier or more cost effective. In 1980, a 1 gigabyte hard drive—an unimaginable amount of storage weighing 500 pounds—cost $40,000. Today, you can easily find a 2 terabyte drive (2,048 gigabytes) that sits on your desktop for about $130 USD. In 1980, it would have cost $80 million dollars!;
, Normally, everything should be as simple as plug and go. To be safe, check the owner's manual of your external drive to make sure there is nothing unique about it that requires you to take additional steps to plug it in.


In some cases, you may need to install driver software. If this is the case, there will be an included CD or DVD—or you can generally download the latest versions from the manufacturer's website.

, Your external hard drive may need an AC power source, or it may run fine with USB power. If it requires AC, now's the time to plug it in.

, With your external unit powered down, plug in one end of the USB cable into the drive, and the other end into the USB input on your computer.

, Whether you're using Apple's OS X or Microsoft Windows, your drive should be recognized. Let it go through any power-up sequences or initializations required, and follow any on-screen prompts.

, This can be as simple as drag-and-drop. Click on a folder or directory you want to move, drag it to the external drive, and release the mouse.


At this point, you have a choice: if you are backing up files to a second drive (always a good idea), then continue on to the next folder, and continue copying files over until you have moved everything you plan to back up. If you are moving files to a second drive to free up space, then as soon as you are done copying, verify the copies are good, then delete the originals.
Many drives include some form of backup software that lets you move files automatically. Be aware that the more files you move—or back up—the longer it will take. Doing this process overnight is not a bad idea.

Go virtual.,
Sign up for a service such as Evernote or Dropbox (or both).,
Use a backup service.",How to Transfer Data Between Two Hard Drives2," Because of the dramatic drop in the price of storage, coupled with the dramatic increase in bandwidth, making your second hard drive virtual is an idea to consider. It's safe, secure, and perhaps best of all—it's backed up constantly, off site, in secure locations.


Cloud storage also gives you access to all your data no matter where you are, or what machine you're using.

, They are solutions that provide, for free, from 2GB of storage to unlimited storage. Not only do they provide storage and retrieval from any location, they both let you share files with other people and groups, add notes to files, and much more.



Evernote gives you unlimited storage, but you can only upload 50MB per month for free.

Dropbox gives you 2GB for free, but has no maximum upload limit.
Once signed up, simply drag your files to a folder you've created on the service.

, If your needs are simply to make sure all your files are backed up regularly and securely, consider using a cloud-based backup service. You schedule when the backups happen, and you can be confident your files are ready for you no matter what, when, or where.



Carbonite, which is designed to back up your computer only—no external hard drives—lets you access those files anywhere, and read them on any device, whether that be another computer, an iPad, or an Android. Carbonite offers unlimited storage for a few dollars a month.

Mozy has pricing plans that vary, and lets you save up to 125GB of data on up to 3 computers. For business owners and those with critical files, Mozy will send you a restore disk in the mail (for a modest fee) should the need arise.

On the rear of the hard drive, remove the jumper and fit it over the two pins that match the diagram for the ""Cable Select"" or ""Slave"" setting.

, Find the wide cable that the hard drive in the computer case is connected to. There should be a long plastic connector plug somewhere in the middle this cable.


Attach this connecter to the long connector plug in the back of the external hard drive. Connect this cable to the hard drive you have in your hand. The colored strip (usually red) should be on the side nearest the power connector.

, Find a power connector that is not hooked into anything. It will usually be black or white, with 4 female sockets.

Backup your files.",How to Save a File1," Programs crash, and often at the worst time. Protect yourself from losing hours of work by saving your files regularly. If you are making changes to a file but don't want to overwrite the original, use the ""Save as"" function to create a copy with a new file name.


Many programs have an autosave function that will automatically save your file after a set amount of time. This can save you in a pinch, but should not replace actively saving often.;
, When you first save a new file, you will be asked to create a name for the file. Make sure that the file name allows you to easily recognize the file, and contains any important information such as the date or the author of the file. This will help you find what you need when you're searching for a specific file on your computer.

, When you save a file for the first time or use the ""Save as"" command to create a new copy, many programs will give you the ability to change the format of the file. This can usually be done by clicking the dropdown menu underneath the field for the file name.Checking for the file format is especially important when transferring files to someone who may not have the same version of the program that you do.

, Most operating systems will create a Documents folder that your saved files will be automatically placed in by default. While this can be good to have a general idea of where your files are, taking the time to create a system of folders can help keep you afloat in a sea of files.


Use folders to sort by file type, project, date, or any other criteria you want.
Most modern versions of Windows use Libraries, which allow you to keep files of the same general type in one area. These libraries are not actually locations but are instead collections of files from across multiple locations.

, You can cut down a lot of time if you learn the keyboard shortcuts for saving files, especially if you find yourself saving a lot. Pressing Ctrl+S (⌘ Cmd+S on Mac) will save your file in most programs.


Many programs have shortcuts for the ""Save as"" function as well. These shortcuts will vary from program to program. For example, F12 will open the ""Save as"" dialog in Word, while ⇧ Shift+Ctrl+S will open it in Photoshop.

, To prevent data loss in the even of a computer failure, make sure that you backup your saved files often. This means copying the saved files from your Documents folders onto an external hard drive or uploading them to a cloud storage service.


See this guide for more details on backing up files.

, Using any image editor, flip your image horizontally. This will create the reverse image so that it will display properly after transferring.

, Only laser prints will work properly with this transfer. Inkjet prints will smear and will stain skin if used with regular paper. However, inkjet prints on matte photo paper will work if so desired.

Ensure that you have the space for floor speakers.,
Consider the aesthetic impact of the floor speakers.,
Listen to the floor speakers before buying.,
Research other aspects of floor speakers online.",How to Buy Floor Speakers," While floor-standing speakers have long been the cornerstone of home theater audio, they are no longer an absolute necessity. Floor speakers easily take up more room (both physically and visually) than any other type of speaker. Those looking for a more compact setup can opt for smaller bookshelf speakers or small, sleek wall-mounted speakers.


Bookshelf speakers (which is a general term for speakers that aren't meant to be stood on the floor) will not provide as much bass as floor speakers. However, if you live in a multi-unit building with shared walls, this will help keep you from disturbing your neighbors.
Smaller wall-mounted satellite speakers can also be used as the left and right channels in a home theater setup. These speakers will provide even less bass response than bookshelf speakers, and therefore should always be paired with a subwoofer.;
, Because floor speakers are so large, their visual impact on your living space is significant. In addition, they can't be tucked away into a bookshelf and hidden.


Floor speakers are available in a variety of different finishes. A common finish is matte black, but wood grained enclosures are also available and can be matched to your existing décor. Keeping the cloth grilles on your floor speakers will give them a cleaner, neater appearance.
When coordinating the aesthetics of your floor speakers, make sure to involve any other members of your household. For instance, a spouse that may not care about the quality of the sound may care a great deal about the look of the speakers.

, Of course, the sound of the speakers is generally held to be the most important quality when making a selection. Go to several stores in your area to listen to different models of floor speakers. Speakers can generally be tested at electronics stores, specialty home theater stores, and some general ""big box"" retailers.


By far the best listening experience will be offered by stores that specialize in home audio. Most of these stores have specific listening rooms that are acoustically tuned for hearing the speakers with the utmost clarity.
When listening to speakers, try to match the equipment used to the equipment you'll be using at home. For example, if you test speakers at a store using a top-of-the-line amplifier, you may be disappointed in the way they perform at home with a less expensive amp.

, A final step before taking the plunge and buying your speakers is to research them as much as possible online. Online customer reviews will allow you to compare several models side by side. This research will also help you uncover aspects of the speakers that you can't determine before purchasing them, such as how they hold up over long-term use.

Fontwork Alignment: Changes the alignment of characters. Choices are left align, center, right align, word justify, and stretch justify. The effects of the text alignment can only be seen if the text spans over two or more lines. In the stretch justify mode, all the lines are filled completely.






Fontwork Character Spacing: Changes the character spacing and kerning in the object. For custom spacing, input a percentage value: 100% is normal spacing; less than 100% is tight spacing; more than 100% is expanded spacing.







, With this tool, you can go further and customize the Fontwork object with several more attributes., The Formatting toolbar changes to show all the options for editing the object. (For example, the toolbar will appear when you use Fontwork in Writer.)

To Paragraph - The object is associated with a paragraph and moves with the paragraph. It may be placed in the margin or another location.
To Character - The object is associated with a character but is not in the text sequence. It moves with the paragraph but may be placed in the margin or another location. This method is similar to anchoring to a paragraph.

The Text dialog offers only a few options for Fontwork objects and is not discussed here.

"
When you select a Fontwork object, eight blue squares (known as handles) appear around the edge of the object, as shown in Figure 4.",How to Use Fontwork3," You can drag these handles to resize the object.


A yellow dot also appears on the object. This dot may be along an edge of the object, or it may be somewhere else. If you hover the pointer over this yellow dot, the pointer turns into a hand symbol. You can drag the dot in different directions to distort the object.
Hovering the pointer over other parts of the object turns the pointer into the usual symbol for dragging the object to another part of the page.
For precise control of the location and size of the object, use the Position and Size dialog.

Remove all your clothes or objects from the closet.,
Measure the depth of your closet.,
Devise electrical support for your office.,
Remove the doors to your office.,
Clean your closet well before turning it into an office.",How to Make a Closet Into an Office1," Although this may take a while and displace your belongings, it will be hard to get a good idea of measurements and space while the closet is full. Find other places to store the items in your house or garage.;
, This is the length from the doors to the back of the closet. Closets can be deep or shallow, and this will determine the size of your desk and chair and how much you can fit into the office space.


You do not need a walk-in closet to create an office. However, it is a good idea to choose a closet that is deeper than a hanger's width. The desk and chair will not go too far out into the room or hallway, if it is deeper.

, Count the number of electrical appliances you need to plug in, and buy a power strip or surge protector. You can provide your electricity in 1 of 2 ways:


If you want to have an overhead light, a computer, a printer, a scanner and more in your office, then you should consider hiring an electrician to rewire your existing electricity into your new office. This will allow you to feel safer about the power sources that control your many electronic devices and it will also allow you to install an overhead pendant light.
If you plan to fill your office with a few simple electronic devices, such as a desktop and a clip lamp, you can extend an extension cord from a nearby plug to your office. You should buy clips to secure the cords to the bottom of the wall so that no one will trip over the cords. You can also consider getting a hard mat or soft rug that will go over any cords that extend too far.

, If you have a walk in closet, this might not be necessary, but in most cases, you will create more space by removing the doors, so that you have more space to fit in desks, organizers and a chair.


While removing the doors creates a more accessible office, you may want privacy when you work in your office. In this case, consider buying a collapsible screen that you can put in to divide you from the room or rest of the house when you want some privacy.
You can also place a colorful curtain in front of the office to hide it when it's not in use.

, Vacuum the floors, dust the corners and clean the walls and shelves with soapy water and a sponge.

Decorate your closet.,
Place all of your supplies inside your closet.",How to Make a Closet Into an Office2," If you have a small closet, consider looking online for a Murphy desk that drops down and can be folded up when not in use. Otherwise, you can measure your area and place a desk of any kind that fits in the space, including modular designs, classic styles with plenty of drawers and plank desks that will fit plenty of electronic devices.

, The kind of shelving that you choose is mostly based on what you plan to store in the office, such as documents, books or office supplies. It is a good idea to choose shelving with dividers so that you can separate your projects, just as you do at an office.


Try to install shelving as high as you can in your office. You must maximize your storage space, if you want it to be a useful area. Many closet offices can fit 4 or 5 shelf levels from desk level to ceiling.

, This is especially important if your desk does not come with drawers. Open or file cabinets can store things that you want hidden.

, Most closet office spaces do not get the benefit of natural light. This means that you should provide overhead light. Install a pendant light, small chandelier, a touch light or expand on the current closet light with a beautiful fixture.

, You will need to measure the desk before you buy the chair so that you are sure it will fit. Most people do not choose desk chairs because the casters tend to stick out, so choose a chair with a cushion on it or add a pillow for lumbar support.

, Choose a few accent colors and make the desk into something that reflects your personality. Paint the shelves and/or desk or put up wallpaper before you move your supplies in and buy coordinating office supplies.

, You can now make last minute adjustments and use your new home office.

Design the algorithm.,
Test your algorithm.,
Consider decryption.,
Draft the pseudocode.,
Share your algorithm with other data encryption enthusiasts.,
Post a challenge on a forum.",How to Create an Encryption Algorithm," A general algorithm is the backbone of all encryption methods. RSA uses mathematical properties of large prime numbers to quickly and safely encrypt private data. Bitcoin uses a version of RSA to safely secure payments and ensure that the sender actually wants to send bitcoins to another user. You should do research on various types of encryption algorithms, like private and public key encryption. It should be noted that no encryption, if you plan on retrieving the data, is unbreakable. Encryption can only discourage casual snooping, and delay serious attacks. It is recommended that you learn what binary is, it will make creating your algorithm much easier and more relevant to data encryption.;
, Once you think you've got a good algorithm, you should try encrypting a very short message by hand. This should take more than a few minutes for good encryption algorithms. A good rule of thumb is that, if you can encrypt the message in your head, then it is not safe for serious encryption. If the final message looks similar, in any way, to the original message, then it might not be safe.

, There needs to be a way for authorized parties to access data encrypted by your algorithm. You should make sure that you can easily decode the data if you know the key, and make it hard for attackers to accidentally stumble upon the key through trial and error.


If you do not want the data to be retrievable at all, consider creating a hashing algorithm instead. A hashing algorithm takes an input and creates a one-way value based on this input. It's possible to go from source input to a hashed value, but it is ideally impossible to go back to the source input from the hashed value. This is particularly viable for password protection. When you create an account on a website with a password, ethical websites will hash your password before storing it. This has many benefits, such as delaying attackers from cracking your password. However, if you forget the password, you'll be forced to create a new one.

, This should be relatively easy once you have your algorithm created and tested to prove that it works. The pseudocode should read like simple and instructive English, being readable enough for a normal person to understand, and instructive enough for a programmer to easily implement the algorithm into a language like C, Java, etc.

, This will allow you to discover possible trapdoors in your encryption, and get feedback on the security and viability of the algorithm. If your algorithm is so complex that no one can understand it, then no one will use it. But the same goes for if the algorithm is so easy that anyone can decode a message with minimal effort.

, There are forums dedicated to solving and decoding data, try publishing a short message you encrypted along with hints about the algorithm used. If you're feeling confident, you can even give them your algorithm and see how long it takes for others to crack it through brute force.

Don't worry about tables just yet.,
Worry about entity relationships.,
Be prepared to wage a solo war, with only you dedicated to quality normalization.,
Once it's time to write tables, concentrate on lookup and type tables (zip codes, statuses, product categories, etc).,
As a rule of thumb: don't store data that can be inferred from other fields.,
No nulls.,
Contradiction NULL values are in themselves useful to identify attributes that have not yet been populated by users.,
NULL/NOT NULL Check any database forums and this is a hot topic advocates on both sides advantages / disadvantages for each.,
Get comfortable with intersect (many to many) tables.,
Use a good naming convention.,If you're going to have replication or log shipping, try to have that set up as you develop so you can see how it works.,
Inner joins are great, but there's probably a lot of LEFT OUTER JOIN statements that you'll be doing as well.,
If you have to deal with a legacy application, build your schema independent of its (don't even look at it).,
Migrating from your legacy systems into a tighter model with proper normalization is difficult, but can be made a little more manageable by using temporary tables for your imports.",How to Create a Relational Data Model," It's obvious that you're building a database, and databases (relational ones anyway) are primarily made up of tables, which are made up of rows and columns (tuples and attributes if you're really into it).
, Your first goal is to map out the relationships that different business objects have. This is the ""logical modeling"" portion. The ""physical model"" is the actual implementation. Confuse / combine the two at your peril.

The requirements are hard to get and painful. A talented business analyst at this time would be Heaven sent.

, Most databases are pieces of garbage because the people who design them are lazy and ""just want to get something out there. We can always fix it later."" Yeah, right., You'll need them for foreign key relationships on your ""real"" tables. Plus, it gives you a little warm up before you get into the core transactional tables., If you know the date of birth and some start date, then you also know the age at the start date, so don't include this age in the table, A null value represents an undefined attribute of an entity. If entities can have or not have a particular attribute, then it needs to be handled via an intersect table., This is especially useful when a user needs to select a default value in order to determine proper business rules to apply. Case 2 how would you design an address table where Address1 was populated and Address2 was not required, but if Address2 was populated it must conform to the business rules of the field. Sure you could default an empty space, is this better than knowing the user did not edit the field? Try 3rd normal form on an international address... Can it be done probably but look at the complexity of restructuring the data in a meaningful way.,

However all agree that you should never allow nulls in key variables. These are fields that are being used to identify a record uniquely, e.g. a customer identification number.
The null school say that you should use the nulls freely in all other fields. For instance customers are not obliged to have a cell phone, nor to tell you their number. Using a null and nothing but a null is the most efficient to record that cell phone is not available.
If it is really important to know why it not there it is better to introduce a new variable that states the reason, as opposed to introducing fancy codes to be stored in the placeholder for cell phone numbers. Be reluctant to add fields like these, because a) the customer is also not obliged to tell the reason why he is not giving his cell phone number, nor does this question make a nice conversation, nor is he likely to tell his reasons spontaneously, and b) nobody will ever look at them because of a). Why missing variables generally just waste time.
Be aware that yes/no variables (booleans) often can't hold a null. Therefore they often contain useless information, such as ""either he was republican, or he refused to answer"".

, You'll use them everywhere if you built things right. One example would be a high school database where one table is a list of teachers and another for students. Students have more than one teacher, and teachers have more than one student, so the intersect table, separate from 'teacher' and 'student', would have two columns : foreign keys pointing at both these two. The primary key would then be the combination of the two., For the invoices, put them in a table called ""invoice"". Products go in ""product"". The intersect would be ""invoiceProduct"", or ""productInvoice"", depending upon which table is really the center of the relationship.,, Get used to the different join statements (except UNION)., Focus on the business rules and relationships that it is trying to enforce, but you can get distracted if you look at the way that someone set it up. Refer to step #4., Also, keep tabs on the legacy IDs for people to search by."

If you are setting up git for the first time you also need to clone or import/create a repository before contributing to it.;
, Enter “cd <path_to_project_folder>” in the command line and hit ↵ Enter, where <path_to_project_folder> is the directory chain that leads to where you cloned or created your project folder.


You can drag and drop the folder into the Git command window to automatically fill out the directory path.

, Enter “git pull origin master” into the command line and hit ↵ Enter. A message will appear letting you know that repository is up to date.


Master is the default branch on a project.

, Open your web browser and enter your repository’s unique github URL.

, This is located in the upper left of the page and will open a list of other branches and a text box.

, This will create a new branch off the master branch using whatever name you entered into the text box.


You can also create a branch from the command line. Enter “git checkout branch -b <branch_name>” and hit ↵ Enter, where <branch_name> is whatever you want your branch to be called.You can now use “git commit” and “git push” to safely make changes to your branch without affecting the main project. Making a pull request will allow others to review and discuss your changes before merging them back into the main branch., Click the Pencil icon to edit a file on the repository. Once edits are made, enter a commit message and click “Commit” from the window below the editing area.


You can also make commits from the command line. This is useful when making changes to files locally rather than on the git website. Enter “git commit -m <message>” into the command line and hit ↵ Enter after making changes to a file. <Message> should be a brief description of the changes you made.
Commit message text can be anything, but something here is required.

, This is located along the top menu bar on your repository page.


A Pull Request is a Git feature used to present changes made on independent branches for review by collaborators before being merged into the main project.

, This will display the changes you made compared with the original content on the master branch.

, Once you are satisfied with the state of your changes, this is the green button in the upper left, by the branch dropdown.

, Use these fields to help identify and briefly describe the change you are making to other collaborators.

, This will create the pull request with the entered name and description.

, This button appears in the lower right once the pull request has been successfully created.


You can also use “git merge <branch_name>” in the command line to perform the same action.

, A notification will appear informing you that the pull request was successfully merged back into the master branch. Since your branch is no longer necessary, you will be prompted to delete it.If you have any merge conflicts, you will be notified and unable to proceed with the merge. You will need to go back and re-pull from the master branch to make your own branch up to date with any changes, then create a new pull request.

, This will appear in the notification next to the purple branch icon. Deleting merged and outdated branches is a good way to keep a project organized and easy to manage.

Become familiar with terminology.,
Decide what problem your language is solving.,
Think about the semantics of your language and the concepts of it.,
Think of some specific tasks that someone would want to be able to perform with your language.,
Experiment with syntax ideas (the text of the language) for the above examples.,Write out a formal grammar for the syntax.,
Decide whether the language will be interpreted or compiled.,
Write the front end scanner and parser or find a tool that helps you with this.,
Use the parser information to write the object code or an intermediate representation.,Write the executor or code generator that will bind everything together.,
Write many test programs to test the language.,Consider how the user will debug their own programs.,
If your language uses a standard library, you will want to write it.,
Publish your language, along with the specification for it and some examples of what you can do in it.",How to Create a Programming Language," Compiler writers often use unfamiliar terminology. Read up on compilers before proceeding. Be sure to know everything that you need to know.
, Is it addressing a domain-specific problem, or is it a general purpose language?,

Are you going to allow direct pointer access or not?
What are the data types of your language?
Is it a static or dynamic language?
What is your memory model? Are you going to use a garbage collector or manual memory management? (If you use a garbage collector, prepare to write one or adapt an existing one to your language.)
How are going to handle concurrency? Are you going to use a simple threading/locking model or something more complex like Linda or the actor model? (Since nowadays computers have multiple cores.)
Are there primitive functions embedded in the language or will everything come from a library?
What is the paradigm or paradigms of you language? Functional? Object-oriented? Prototype (like JavaScript)? Aspect-oriented? Template oriented? Or something entirely new?
How is your language going to interface with existing libraries and languages (mainly C)? This point is important if you're building a domain-specific language.
Finally, some of the answers to this questions are going to be answered by the second step and will help you answer the next step.

, For example, 'they may want to direct a robot to follow a line' or 'they may want to create relatively portable desktop programs in it' or 'they may want to create web applications with it'.,

Be careful to keep your language in the context-free language category or something inside it. Your parser generator and you will appreciate it later on.

,, Meaning that in the interpreted world your user will typically edit your program in an editor, and run it directly on the interpreter; while in the compile world, your user will edit your program, compile it, save the resulting executable somewhere and run it.,

Also, think about how your compiler/interpreter will warn your user about erroneous programs and syntax errors.

, Have the parser create an AST, then create your object code from the AST using three address code or its big brother SSA, then create a symbol table to define your functions, global variables, etc.

Also, depending on your language, you may also want to create virtual pointer tables or information tables for you classes (in order to support reflection or RTTI).

,,

You want to create programs that stress the burdens of your formal grammar in order to see that your compiler accepts everything that is inside your definition and rejects everything that is outside of it.

,, Along with a garbage collector or other runtime features if you need it.

Specifically, if you write a compiler, you will need the code that the operating system will execute in order to begin running the user code (for example, allocating all global variables).

,

Don't forget to document how you can integrate with existing libraries, languages and how to use the runtime features and/or standard library.

Open your HTML file.,
Place a link on your page.,
Write the link text to display.,Change the destination of the link.,
Link to a page in the same folder.,
Link to other pages on your website.",How to Create a Link With Simple HTML Programming1," Open the HTML file for the page you would like to edit. (If you're starting from scratch and need some background info, create the document before reading this article.);
, Add the following code to the body of your HTML document, where you would like the link to appear:


<a href=""https://www.wikihow.com/"">Link text</a>
This displays like this: Link text.

, Anything in between the <a> and </a> tags will appear on your page as a link. You can alter this with other html tags just as you would any other text.


You can also turn an image into a link:<a href=""https://www.wikihow.com/""><img src=""wikihow_logo.png""></a>.
The user will see the image wikihow_logo.png, and can click the image to visit https://www.wikihow.com/.

, The <a></a> tag you just created is called an ""anchor."" The href attribute inside the anchor defines the destination of the link. Replace https://www.wikihow.com/ in the example above with the URI you would like to link to.


Always surround the URI with quotation marks.
URIs are case sensitive.Copy-paste them or type them in exactly as they appear.

, You do not need to include a full URL if you are linking to a page on the same website (although it will work). It's easier to keep your website organized if you use relative links instead, without including the domain name. Here's a simple example linking from one page to another in the same folder:


Let's say you're editing the page http://example.edu/about/author.html.
To link to the page http://example.edu/about/family.html, just type the file name:<a href=""family.html"">Link text</a>


, You can also use relative links to direct the link to any other page on the same site. There are only two things you need to know:To link to a page in a subfolder, include the new file path. For example, if you're on the page http://example.edu/about/author.html and want to link to http://example.edu/about/pets/dog.jpg, you can skip everything up to ""about:""<a href=""/pets/dog.jpg"">Link text</a>

To link to a page in a different branch of the site, use ""../"" to move up to a higher folder. For example, to link from /about/author.html to http://example.edu/writing/books.html, type:<a href=""../writing/books.html"">Link text</a>


"
"
Create a destination anchor.,
Link to the destination anchor.,
Add an anchor to any HTML tag.",How to Create a Link With Simple HTML Programming2," If you're linking to a long web page, you might want to lead people to a specific point on the page instead of the top. To make this possible, open the HTML document for the destination page. Insert this anchor tag at the point you want to link to:



<a id=""anchorname"">Anchor text.</a>
This will display as normal text, since it is the destination of a link and not a link itself. You can replace ""anchorname"" with any name, as long as you don't use the same name twice on one page.

, To link to a specific point on the page, add the symbol # to the end of the URI, followed by the exact name you used for the id attribute. This is case sensitive.


For example to link to the anchor <a id=""pictures""></a> on the page http://example.edu/vacation.html, type:<a href=""http://example.edu/vacation.html#pictures"">Link text.</a>.
You can add this to absolute or relative links (see instructions in separate method).

, You can also create an anchor by inserting id=""anchorname"" into any HTML tag.Link to this in exactly the same way. Here are a couple examples:



<h1 id=""topheader"">Header Text</h1>
Link to this by adding #topheader to the URL.

<p id=""introparagraph"">Paragraph text</p>
Link to this by adding #introparagraph to the URL.

Notice the ""\"" character is called ""backslash"", and the forward slash ""/"" will not work at all in a command line.
Windows 7 has no run box, but has the ""Run..."" option instead, which is also found near the bottom of the ""Start Menu"". Click it to access the command prompt and type in c:\window\system32\cmd.exe (or instead of cmd.exe you may have to use command.com).

Pick a subject.,
Decide where your data is coming from.,
Weigh your coding skills.,
Note that this whole step may arguably be Step 1, depending on your perspective.





,
Sign-up for an API.,
Start coding


For this step, the big one, rather than describe the many variations in detail, I'll refer you to a variety of well-written and useful API-specific tutorials and introductions.",How to Create a Mashup,"



 


Answer the question: a mashup of what? Hint: Plotting markers on maps is probably the easiest place to start. It might just be the best delis in your neighborhood. While you could go for something more complex with multiple data sources: maps + photos + bookmarks + more, you may want to keep it simple to start.
This helps define what APIs and tools you'll be looking at: maps, news, auctions, products, etc. Browse this site's API Database and sort by Category to get a sense of API types. You can also browse the Mashup Listing to see which interesting applications have been built using which APIs.;
,


What is the source of your data? This can drive the APIs you'll use. For example, if you want to do something with your photos on Flickr or sale items on eBay, then those vendors APIs are the likely candidates. Or, you may be inputting the data yourself such as with simple map markers. In which case your options are more open.
(For the purposes of this Guide, I won't spend time distinguishing between a true 'mashup', thus two or more data sources, and just using an API, which may mean only one external source. The exact definition of mashup is vague so no need to fight semantics at the moment.)

,


Mashups, as of today, are mostly a programmer's affair although there are some tools such as Map Builder and Wayfaring that can help you create basic maps without coding.

How much of a coder are you?

Maps APIs are simplest but more sophisticated APIs, such as those for conducting financially-sensitive operations like auctions, are more complex.



How much time do you have?

Again, development speed is inversely proportional to complexity.



Do you have a server to run this on?

Simpler APIs can be used from JavaScript in a web page or take specially formatted XML file as input (as shown here at Engadget). While this is indeed simple, security issues limit JavaScript's suitability for true client-only mashups. Odds are that you will need to run your application from a web server which you manage or have access to.



What language will you use?

This is primarily driven by what programming languages you know. While your decision may also be influenced by vendor-provided toolkits, most web APIs aim to be language-agnostic so this is less of a vendor-dictated issue than your own choice. You can use the API reference to see if an API has a language-specific toolkit (such as Flickr which has many).



,,


Most, but not all, API providers require you to have a developer/application ID, a user account with their service, or both. Some services give you one ID for as many applications as you write while others require you to get an ID for each application that you create. While this signup may sound complicated, and for a few services it is, most of the time this takes only a minute or two to complete. As an example, take a look at the Google Sign-up Page.

, You can also check the profile for any of the APIs and refer to resources from the reference section as needed.
Note that this list is dynamic and will change over time so check back later for updates.

Learn the difference between compression formats.,
Familiarize yourself with the RAR format.",How to Open RAR Files1," There are several different file formats that offer compression. Compression is when multiple files are packaged together into one file, or archive. Compression software packs the files so that the single archive takes up less space than the individual files. This makes transferring large quantities of files much easier.


The most common compression formats are .zip and .rar. Windows has support for zip files built in natively; to extract .rar files, you will need special software.;
, A single file with a .rar extension is a compressed file (often called an ""archive"") that may contain 1 or many files. For example, a .rar file may contain hundreds of images compressed into a single archive. To view these files, you have to first extract or ""unpack"" the .rar archive.


RAR archives can be split into multiple pieces, or volumes, when the original archive is too large. Each of these pieces can be transferred individually, and then are reassembled by the compression program. RAR archives with multiple volumes typically have the extensions ""file.part1.rar,"" ""file.part2.rar,"" etc. or ""file.rar,"" ""file.r01,"" ""file.r02,"" etc.

Understand what a DLL file is.,
Know that the average user doesn't need to open or interact with DLL files.,
Register a new DLL.",How to Open DLL Files1," A DLL (dynamic link library) is a Windows file that is used by program to call upon existing functions. Essentially, they allow Windows and other programs to gain functionality without having to have that functionality built-in.


DLL files are an essential part of Windows programming, and lead to sleeker, more efficient programs.;
, For most users, DLL files will exist in the background. Programs will install and call upon them automatically, and moving them can cause serious problems with the system.


Sometimes you may be asked during the installation of community-made programs to place DLL files in specific locations. Make sure that you trust the program before following these instructions, as DLL files can be malicious.
If you're interested in learning how DLL files are constructed, see the next section.

, If you have had to manually copy a DLL file into a folder for a program to use, you may need to register it in the Windows Registry before it can be used. Refer to the program's documentation to determine if you'll need to perform this step (it is extremely uncommon for most Windows programs).Open the Command Prompt. You can find this in the Start menu or by pressing the Windows key + R and typing cmd. Navigate to the location of the new DLL file.
If you are using Windows 7 or newer, open the folder containing the new DLL file, hold the Shift key and right-click in the folder, and select ""Open command window here"". The Command Prompt will open directly to that folder.
Type regsvr32 dllname.dll and press Enter. This will add the DLL file to Windows Registry.
Type regsvr32 -u dllname.dll to remove the DLL file from the Windows Registry.

In order to see the code that makes a DLL file work, you will need to use a decompiler to revert it back into readable code. Opening a DLL file without a decompiler (such as opening it with Notepad) will result in a jumbled mess of unreadable characters.


dotPeek is one of the more popular free decompilers. It is available from jetbrains.com/decompiler/.

, If you're using dotPeek, simply click ""File"" → ""Open"" and then browse for the DLL file you want to decompile. You can explore the contents of the DLL file without affecting your system., DLL files are made of ""nodes"", or modules of code that work together to form the entire DLL file. You can expand each node to see any subnodes that it may contain.

, The code for the node you select will appear in the right frame of dotPeek. You can scroll through the code to review it. dotPeek will display the code in C#, or it can download additional libraries in order for you to view the original source code.


If the node requires additional libraries to view, dotPeek will attempt to download them automatically.

, If you've found a piece of code you don't understand, you can use the Quick Documentation feature to see what the command is doing.


Place your cursor in the piece of code that you need documentation for in the Code Viewer frame.
Press Ctrl + Q to load the Quick Documentation window.
Follow the hyperlinks to learn more about each aspect of the code you are examining.

, If you want to manipulate, edit, and build the file on your own, you can export it into Visual Studio. The exported code will be in C#, even if it was originally written in a different language originally.


Right-click on the DLL file in the Assembly Explorer.
Select ""Export to Project""
Choose your export options. You can have the project opened immediately in Visual Studio if you'd like to get started on it immediately.

, Once you have the project loaded in Visual Studio, you will have complete control over editing and building the DLL into your own creation. Click here for detailed instructions on using Visual Studio.

You must remove the DRM using the Windows computer that was originally authorized to open the files. There is no other way to remove this DRM short of taking screenshots of each page.
If your LIT files aren't protected by DRM, you can skip down to the next method.;
, This tool will convert your LIT files into an open format that works on many readers and can easily be converted into other eBook formats. ConvertLIT will remove any DRM from the file. This will allow you to transfer it to your other devices. This should only be used as fair-use to remove DRM from files that you own. It should not be used to pirate eBooks.


You can download the graphical version of ConvertLIT from dukelupus.com/convertlit.gui. You can get the Command Prompt tool from convertlit.com. This guide will cover the graphical version.
There is an unsupported version of ConvertLIT for Mac available from convertlit.com. You'll need to remove any DRM using the Windows computer that was originally authorized.

, You'll need this file to remove the DRM from the LIT files. This file is only available on the computer that was originally allowed to open the LIT files. You can retrieve the key using ConvertLIT.


Click the File menu in ConvertLIT and select ""Run Reader key recovery tool"".
Accept the license agreement and follow the prompts to load the authorization key in Convert LIT.
There is no way to remove the DRM without access to the original key. Microsoft has shut down the activation servers, so new keys cannot be generated. If you no longer have access to the original DRM key file, any DRM-protected books you have are essentially worthless.

, This will open the page that allows you to remove the DRM from the LIT files with the proper key. If the LIT file doesn't have DRM, use the ""Extract"" tab instead. The process is the same for both tabs.


You can select the folder that you want the converted files to appear.
By default, ConvertLIT will add "".downconverted"" to each file. You can uncheck this box if you don't need the converted files labeled.

, The button has a typo, and should read ""Downconvert"". You can monitor the progress in the bottom frame. The LIT file will be converted into a collection of files. These will include several HTML files, some images, and an OPF metadata file.Click the ""Extract"" button once you're satisfied with your settings if you're using the Extract tab.

, Calibre is a free eBook management program that includes a conversion tool. This tool will allow you to convert your newly-extracted LIT file into something that can be used on any reader device. You can download Calibre for free from calibre-ebook.com.


You can load DRM-free LIT files directly into Calibre and convert them to any other format. See Step 5.

, ConvertLIT will put all of the files from the LIT file into a folder with the same name. Open this folder to find all of the files.

, You should have every file that was extracted from the LIT file selected.

, This will create a new ZIP file containing all of the files you had selected.

, Open Calibre and click the ""Add books"" button. Browse for the new ZIP file to add it to your Calibre library. You can also just drag and drop the ZIP file into the Calibre window.


You can do this for any eBook format, including non-DRM LIT files. Calibre won't be able to load DRM-protected files.

, This will open the eBook conversion tool.

, You can choose from just about any eBook format. Check your reader's manual to see what file types it supports. The most common file types are EPUB and AZW3 (Kindle).

, You don't need to change anything to get a working eBook from the conversion process. Advanced users can get more control over how the final product looks by adjusting the conversion settings. Most users can just leave everything at the default settings.

, Calibre will begin converting the book. The new format will be available in your Calibre library once finished. You can use Calibre to load the new book onto your reader, or you can save it to your computer to transfer or archive.Right-click on it in your Calibre library and select ""Save to disk"" to save the converted file.

, Open Notepad and enter the following lines:

FILE ""filename.bin"" BINARY
TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
INDEX 01 00:00:00


Change filename.bin to the name of the BIN file you are trying to burn. Keep the quotation marks.
Save the file to the same folder as the BIN file. The CUE file should be named exactly the same as the BIN file, except with the .CUE extension. Click File → Save As. Click the ""Save as type"" drop-down menu and select ""All Files"". Give the file a .CUE extension.

, As BIN is an outdated format, only older programs fully support it, especially when it comes to multitrack BIN files. Popular programs include CDRWIN, Alcohol 120%, and Nero.

, Depending on the program, you may need to load the CUE file or it may ask for the BIN file. Once the image file is loaded, you should see a readout showing how much space the image will take on the disc.

, Once you've verified that the image has loaded correctly, insert a blank disc and start burning. The time it takes to burn will depend on the size of the image, your burner’s speed, and your computer’s performance.

, Once the burn is complete, test the disc by inserting it into the device you burned it for. Ensure that everything loads correctly, and that any tracks are in the right spot."

Delete your DMG file after installing.",How to Open DMG Files1," DMG files are Mac-format disk image files. They are most commonly used for installing applications. When you double-click the DMG file, a new Finder window will open showing the contents of the file.


If you are using Windows, click here.;
, Double-clicking the DMG will show all of the contents of the DMG image. These could be documents, pictures, programs, or any other type of file.

, If the DMG file contains application files, simply dragging them to your Applications folder should install them.


Some programs will have an installer that should be run instead of just dragging the files.

, Once you are done browsing the files or installing the program, you can unmount the disk image from your computer by right-clicking on it and selecting ""Eject"".


Make sure you right-click the virtual disk on your desktop, not the actual DMG file.

, As you download more and more programs, your old DMG files will begin to take up a significant amount of space. Drag your old DMG files to the Trash to get rid of them.

Install virtual drive software.,
Mount the image.,
Open the disc.",How to Open BIN Files2," A virtual drive will emulate a physical optical drive in your computer, and will allow you to ""mount"" the image file in it. This tricks your computer into thinking a disc has been inserted, and the image is loaded just as if it was running from a disc.


There are several virtual drive options available. DaemonTools is one of the most popular ones available for free. Be careful when installing it, as there are several times where it tries to install browser toolbars and extra software you probably don’t need.
Mounting the image will only work if the image is designed to run on a computer. For example, mounting an image of an old console game will not load anything, because the disc originally only works on that console.

Windows 8 and OS X have built-in virtual drive software, but the BIN file will need to be converted to an ISO file first.

, Programs such as DaemonTools will place an icon in your System Tray. Right-click on this icon, hover over one of the fake drives, and then select Mount Image.


Browse the CUE file on your hard drive. Remember that the BIN and CUE files need to be in the same folder. Once you've found the CUE file, load it to mount the image.

, Once the image is mounted, your computer will act as if a physical disc has just been inserted. This means Autoplay might open, or you might be asked what you want to do with the disc. The messages you receive depend on the contents of the disc as well as your system settings.


Use the image file just as you would a CD or DVD that you inserted in your computer."

If you're trying to install a program using the DMG file, you'll need to download the Windows installer instead. Programs from DMG files cannot be installed in Windows.

, There are several programs that can open DMG files so that you can see what's inside. The most popular free options is HFSExplorer. You can get it from catacombae.org/hfsexplorer/.


During the setup process, make sure to check the ""Register .dmg file association"" box so that DMG files open in HFSExplorer.

, If you associated DMG files with HFSExplorer during installation, HFSExplorer should open automatically when you double-click the DMG file.


If HFSExplorer doesn't open, drag the DMG file onto the HFSExplorer icon.

, After the DMG file opens in HFSExplorer, you will be shown all of the files and folders it contains. Select any file(s) that you want to extract.

, This will copy any files that you've selected from the DMG file onto your computer. You will be prompted to select the location you want to save the file(s).

, You will be prompted to choose after clicking the ""Extract"" button. Selecting Yes will preserve the file structure of the DMG file after extracting, but will lead to more space taken and the extraction process will be longer.

, This may take a while for larger files. Once the extraction is complete, you can start using the extracted files.


Since DMG files are Mac-formatted, there's a very good chance that all of the included files will also be Mac-formatted. Your options for manipulating these files may be severely limited."

,, If you plan to print your image or simply want it to retain as much of its quality as possible, consider raising the resolution.


If your image is for the web or for use in an app like Facebook, the default (72) is fine. If you start with a higher resolution, reducing it will give you a smaller file size.
If you plan to print your image in a high-quality format, such as for advertisements or other forms of business communications, set it to at least 600. Note: this will raise the size of the file significantly.
To print glossy photos, 300 will suffice. The file size will be much larger than that of a default 72 dpi image, but the final quality will be worth it.

, The larger the width and height, the larger the file size.


It may be helpful to change the unit of measurement to best visualize your image. For example, you can change it to “cm” if you want to specify the width in centimeters. Click the drop-down right next to both Width and Height to make your selection.

If you have a 1G, 2G, or Mini, you will not be able to record, though iPod Linux will install and all of the other features will be there.

, To do this, eject and unplug your iPod. It should reset automatically. If it doesn't, then reset it (flick the hold switch on, then off, and hold down ""MENU"" and ""Select"" until it resets). As soon as you see the Apple logo, flick on the hold switch. After the Apple logo goes, you should see briefly a picture of a penguin holding an iPod. Then a bunch of text should whiz past. Now you may turn off the hold switch. If you use the new boot loader it will give you a menu to chose which operating system to boot into.

, Scroll down to the bottom where it says ""Sample Rate"" and click the select button to change it. 8kHz is the default setting and produces the lowest-quality audio. Even so, the audio is perfectly legible and will sound OK, but a little fuzzy. The maximum is 96kHz, which is excellent quality, but makes enormous files and sometimes skips a lot. Instead of these, go for the 32, 44.1, or 88.2 kHz options. Try them out to see what you like best (see Tips below).

, You can use the ""Mic Record"" or the ""Line In Record"" options. ""Mic record"" functions by using a microphone or headphones plugged into the headphone jack, and ""Line in Record"" works by plugging your iPod into a dock, and then plugging headphones or microphone for recording purposes into the line out plug on your dock (normally in the middle on the back of the dock).

Use it!,
Save your .gif.",How to Create Animations Using Adobe ImageReady CS," Saving a .psd or .tif will usually also save all animation and settings. Save often to avoid losing your work. This is a 'working file' and will not be your final animation file, so feel free to experiment with different things.;
, Always plan ahead. Draw, type, or otherwise create separate layers for your design elements. Anything that will move or change should likely have a layer all of it's own. Depending on your program version, you may or may not need a new layer just to move something from the left to the right. If in doubt, plan extra layers.

, This pallet has several key uses:


Duration Under each frame, set the duration of the frame in seconds (usually).
Repetition Set how many times you would like the animation to repeat each frame - 'once' to 'forever'.
Playback Test your animation as you go along.
Motion Tweening Advanced users can create a motion tween, which is something like an automated creation of frames to produce a preset animation effect.
Frames Use the sticky-note-looking button to create a frame. One frame for each bit of animation. Use the trash-can-looking button to delete a frame.

, For each frame in your animation pallet, turn layers on and off as needed.


Example: Frame 1, turn on layers 1 and 3. Create a new frame. Turn off layer 1 and turn on layer 2. Create a new frame. Turn off layer 3 and turn on layer 1, etc.

, Depending on your program version, go to the File menu and choose either 'Save for Web', 'Save for Web and Devices' or 'Save Optimized As...' Don't forget to also save your .psd or .tif with your final adjustments - it will remember!

Place the manila folders into the hanging folders.,
Label the hanging folders with the same names as the manila folders.,
Place a supply of hanging and manila folders near the files so you can easily add a folder if you find yourself with a piece of paper that doesn't belong to an existing folder.,
At the end of the year, remove all the folders, label fresh manila folders with the same category names and place them in the files.",How to Establish an Office Filing System," Whatever it is, it must make sense, so you'll know exactly where every piece of paper is. Your options are:


Alphabetical. This system is best when most of your files are going to be names of clients, patients or customers.
Subject or category: Most file systems are organized by subject or category, which works well when set up correctly, but can also be the most confusing when it's not.
Numerical/Chronological. This best when your files consist mainly of numbered or dated material, like purchase orders or receipts.;
, The hanging folders will never be removed, acting as place holders for the manila envelopes which you will remove from the drawer.

, If a pile gets more than an inch or two tall, divide it into subcategories. If a pile is too thin, combine it with another pile and rename it. The names of the piles should make it easy to determine which pile every piece of paper goes into.

, It's best to use folders with tabs that are in the center rather than staggered because it makes the files look neater.

, For most files, regular hanging folders will work, but for thick files or files you had to divide into subcategories, use box bottom folders. You can order the folders however you want, but most people use an alphabetical system at this point.

, Place all the plastic tabs on the left of the folder unless you are using a lateral file cabinet. For lateral files, which run left to right when you open the drawer rather than front to back, place the tabs on the right side.

, Avoid folders that are too thick or too thin. You may also want to relabel folders and redistribute papers if you decide that you need to re-categorize.

, Go through the old folders to see if anything needs to be transferred to the current files, and place the rest in your archive.

Determine the types of information that must be captured in the fields of the form.,
Arrange those information types in a logical sequence.,
Apply that arrangement to the creation of a form template.,
Customize each field on your form template.,
Add drop down menus when appropriate.,
Test-drive your form.",How to Design a Form," This is governed by the intended use of the document. Identify how many different pieces of information must be captured, and relate that to the number of fields required to provide adequate space for that data.;
, The idea is to create a flow from 1 field to the next that simply makes sense to those who will make use of the document. A very simple form that is intended to capture basic contact information may follow a sequence of date, first name, last name, address, city, state or province, zip or postal code, telephone and fax numbers and a field for an email address.

, Software applications typically make it easy to create fields that can be situated by using a computer mouse to drag the field into position on a blank document. Create and place fields that correspond to the data that must be captured on the form in the same logical sequence identified earlier.

, Most software programs that aid in creating forms make it possible to adjust the length and width of each field, as well as restrict the type of characters that are allowed in each field. This makes it possible to ensure that dates and telephone numbers are entered in a uniform manner.

, If the form is to be used in an online environment or part of a template in a database, adding drag down menus will often require creating a table and associating it with the appropriate field. Specific instructions in how to accomplish this can be found in the support materials that came with the software.

, Before releasing the form for general use, take the time to enter some data and make sure the result is within your expectations. Should the data fail to capture properly, or 1 or more fields do not function as anticipated, return to the form template and make adjustments.

Recognize series of binary numbers.,
Group all the 1's and 0's in the binary number in sets of three, starting from the far right.,
Add zeros to the left of the last digit if you don't have enough digits to make a set of three.,
Add a 4, 2, and a 1 underneath each set of three numbers to note your placeholders.,
If there is a one above any of your placeholders, write that number (4, 2, or 1) to start your octal numbers.,
Add up the new numbers in each set of three.,
Place your newly converted answers together to form your final octal number.,
Add a subscript 8 (like this8) to complete the conversion.",How to Convert Binary to Octal Number1," Binary numbers are simply strings of 1's and 0's, such as 101001, 001, or even just 1. If you see this kind of string it is usually binary. However, some books and teachers further denote binary numbers through a subscript ""2"", such as 10012, which prevents confusion with the number ""one thousand and one.""

This subscript denotes the ""base"" of the number. Binary is a base-two system, octal is base-eight.
;
, There are two different binary numbers and only eight octal. Since 23=8,{\displaystyle 2^{3}=8,} you'll need three binary numbers to designate each octal number. Start from the right to make your groups. For example, the binary number 101001 would break down to 101 001.
, The binary number 10011011 has eight digits, which, though not a multiple of three, can still convert to octal. Just add extra zeros to your front group until it has three places. For example:


Original Binary: 10011011


Grouping: 10 011 011


Adding Zeros for Groups of Three: 010 011 011, Each of the three binary numbers in a set stands for a place in the octal number system. The first number is for a 4, the second a 2, and the third a 1. To keep things straight, write these numbers underneath your sets of three binary numbers. For example:

010 011 011421 421 421

001421

110 010 001421 421 421

Note, if you're looking for a shortcut, you can skip this step and just compare your sets of binary numbers to this octal conversion chart.


, If there is a one above the ""4,"" then your octal number has a 4 in it. If there is a 0 above the one's place, the octal number does not have a one in it, so leave a blank, zero, or dash. As seen in an example:


Problem:

Convert 1010100112 to octal.




Separate into threes:

 101 010 011




Add placeholders:

101 010 011421 421 421




Mark each places:

101 010 011421 421 421401 020 021, Once you know what places are in the octal number, simply add up each set of three individually. So, for 101, which turns into 4, 0, and 1, you end up with 5 (4+0+1=5{\displaystyle 4+0+1=5}). Continuing the example above:


Problem:

Convert 1010100112 to octal.




Separate, add placeholders, and mark each place:

101 010 011421 421 421401 020 021




Add up each set of three:


(4+0+1)(0+2+0)(0+2+1)=5,2,3{\displaystyle (4+0+1)(0+2+0)(0+2+1)=5,2,3}




, Splitting up the binary number was just to make solving easier -- the original number was one lone string. So, now that you've converted, put everything back together to get your final answer. That's all it takes.


Problem:

Convert 1010100112 to octal.




Separate, add placeholders, mark places, and add totals:

101 010 011    5 — 2  —  3




Put converted numbers back together:

523




, There is technically no way to know if 523 refers to a octal number or a normal base-ten number without proper notation. To ensure that your teacher knows you've been doing the work well, place a subscript 8, referring to octal as a base-8 system, on your answer.


Problem:

Convert 1010100112 to octal.




Conversion:

523.

Use a simple octal conversion chart to save time and work.,
Keep the decimal where it is and work outward if you are dealing with decimals.,
Use the octal conversion chart to convert from octal back to binary.",How to Convert Binary to Octal Number2," This won't work on a test, but is a great choice in any other setting. Since there are only 8 possible combinations of numbers, it is actually a pretty easy chart to memorize. All you have to do is separate the numbers in groups of three, then match them with the chart in the pictures.Note how numbers 8 and 9 don't have straight conversions. In octal, these numbers do not exist, since there are only 8 digits (0-7) in a base-eight system.


, Say you need to convert the binary number 10010.11 to an octal number. Normally, you work from right to left to group the numbers into sets of three. With the decimal, you work away from the point. So, for the numbers left of the decimal (10010), you start at the point at work left (010 010, or, converted fully, 115.24). For the numbers to the right (.11), you start from the point and work right (110). When adding zeros, always add them in the direction you're working. The final breakdown is 010 010 . 110.

101.1 → 101 . 100

1.01001 → 001 . 010 010

1001101.0101 → 001 001 101 . 010 100


, You'll need the chart to work backward, as a simple ""3"" doesn't give you enough information to do the math unless you already know the octal system well and want to re-think each combination. Simply use the following chart to easily convert each octal digit into a set of three binary numbers, then ram them together:

0 → 000

1 → 001

2 → 010

3 → 011

4 → 100

5 → 101

6 → 110

7 → 111"

Test connectivity.",How to Configure a Network on Cisco Packet Tracer," Once you've opened your Network Topology on Cisco Packet Tracer, access your network and identify the components of your network, for example; Servers, Routers, End Devices, etc.;
, Access the cables section and connect completely and correctly the cables between the network in order to ensure connectivity between the devices in the network using the connections table given.

, Using the address table still, correctly and completely configure the IP addresses on all end devices. This can be done by accessing the desktop platform on each device and locating the IP configuration section. The reason for doing this is to enable the devices be on the right network.

, After configuring the right IP addresses on the end devices, you will have to do the same on the routers and switches also, using the address table. But this time in a different way because there's no desktop platform on the routers and switches. You will have to access the configuration panel on both devices and this can be done in two ways:


Click on the device and open the Command Line Interface (CLI) and then type in the right commands to configure the right addresses for the router using the addressing table.
Use a console cable from an end device and connect it to the device you wish to configure and access the terminal platform on the end device and it will take you to the device's Command Line Interface and then you type in the commands in other to configure the right addresses.

, After configuring the IP addresses, you will need to configure the default gateway also. The reason for this is so the end devices would know what network they are operating on. You can find the default gateway either in the addressing table (if given) or in the network topology.

, After configuring the addresses, you will have to test connectivity by opening a command prompt window on the end devices and try pinging the address which the network operates on. If it gives you a reply, it means your network was configured correctly.

Don't worry too much about what language you pick.,
Find free resources online for the language you choose.,
Download a good text editor.,
Download any necessary compilers.,
Start your first project.,
Comment all of your code.,
Pick apart other programs or web projects.",How to Code1," Many beginning coders struggle with what language to pick when they first start learning. The actual language that you start learning on doesn't make a big difference when it comes to learning about data structures and logic. These are the skills that matter most, and they can be honed with any language.When picking a language, just focus on what kind of development you want to start with and pick an introductory language from there. For example, if you want to learn web development, start with HTML5, supplemented with CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. If you want to want to do desktop applications, start with C++ or another basic programming language.
If you make coding a career, you will find that you may never use the language that you first learned to code. Instead, you will be learning languages as you go through documentation and experimentation.;
, The internet is a treasure trove of free tutorials, classes, and videos, all tailored towards the language of your choice. You can start getting a basic grasp of just about any introductory language in a day.


Popular sites include Bento, CodeAcademy, Code.org, html.net, Khan Academy, Udacity, W3Schools, Code School and many more.
There are a variety of language-specific starter guides available right here on wikiHow.
You can find how-to guides for almost any programming scenario on YouTube.
Stack Exchange is one of the more popular Q&A sites for any programming questions you may have.

, Many programming languages allow you to use external text editors when you write your code. Find a text editor that will allow you to see indentations and code markup.


Popular programs include Notepad++ (Windows), TextWrangler (OS X), or JEdit (any system).

, Some programming languages require a compiler in order to run the code that you create. Compilers translate the code you write into a lower-level language that the machine can process. Many compilers are open-source and free to use. Languages that require compilers include:


C
C++
C#
Java
BASIC
Fortran

, Pick a good introductory project that will help you get your feet wet. There are a variety of suggestions and tutorials online, but some places to start are basic websites for HTML, basic database and form functions with PHP, or simple programs with any of the compiler languages.

, All programming languages have a comment feature that allows you to enter text that is ignored by the compiler. This allows you to add comments to your code. These comments are crucial, both for letting others know how your code works and for reminding yourself what your code does.


You can also use the comment function to quickly remove code from your program for testing purposes. Put comment tags around the code you want to exclude and then remove the comment tags to return the code.

, When you're learning as you go, don't be ashamed to look things up and see how others have tackled the same tasks. Take time to understand why the code is doing what it does.

Take classes.,
Expand your knowledge.,
Learn more languages.,
Be patient.,
Learn to work with others.,
Get a job where you can practice your coding skills.,
Connect with other programmers.,
Practice, practice, practice.",How to Code2," Community colleges, tech schools and online programs offer certifications and classes that will help you get a job as well as teaching you programming. An advanced degree like Computer Science is not always necessary, but could help to get a full time programming job.A lot can be said for having one-on-one time with a teacher or programming expert, something that isn't always available with online sources.
Classes can get expensive, so weigh the benefits. If programming is just a hobby, classes may not be worth the time and money. If you want to turn programming into a career, classes can give you a big boost (but again, it's far from necessary if you have the talent).

, Beyond simply learning programming languages, you will benefit a lot from logic and mathematics classes, as these are often required for advanced programming. You don't necessarily need to learn this at school, but classroom settings can help.


Programming involving physics calculations and other simulations requires a strong understanding of algorithms and models.
Logic is the fundamental basis of programming, so understanding logic and processes will help you problem-solve when you are coding.
Knowing advanced math isn't required for most programming, but the knowledge can lead to benefits and optimizations.

, Once you've got a good grasp on your initial language, you can start to branch out. Find another language that complements the one you know, or pick a language for a specific job that interests you. Complementary languages, such as HTML and CSS, are often the easiest to learn.



Java is one of the most popular languages, and there are often lots of opportunities for Java developers. Java can run on a huge variety of systems and has innumerable applications. Java is used for Android applications, one of the fastest growing markets.
C++ is highly recommended for budding video game developers. Learning how to code in Unity (a widely used, low-cost game engine) and UDK (the code for the popular Unreal engine) can help open some doors, though they aren't as useful outside of the video game industry.
If you want to make iPhone apps, Xcode and Objective-C are going to be your primary tools. You'll also need a Mac, since Xcode can only compile on a Mac.

Python is a server scripting language that is one of the easier languages to learn. Python is used for web services such as Pinterest and Instagram, and is simple enough to learn the basics in just a few days.

, You will often be faced with challenges while programming, especially when it comes to hunting for bugs or implementing a new idea. You'll have to learn to be satisfied with achieving small results rather than solving a whole puzzle at once. Patience leads to more effective code, which will lead to better-performing programs and happier colleagues.

, If you have multiple people working on a project, you get multiple viewpoints on how to go about it. Working on teams is virtually unavoidable in the business world, so unless you're planning to develop everything independently, be prepared to work with others.

, Work as a volunteer designing websites or writing desktop applications. A part time job with a small company can lead to opportunities to write code for websites or simple applications.

, There are countless communities and gatherings of developers that can help support and inspire you. Look up local programming conventions, participate in a hack-a-thon or game jam (timed events with a common theme), and sign up on some programming forums to start expanding your exposure and network.

, It is estimated that it takes about 15,000 hours before you can be considered an expert in computer programming.This is years of applied practice. True mastery of programming will come only after you put the time in to practice and become proficient.


Try to spend time programming every day, even when you're not working. Programming in your free time can lead to breakthroughs and new ideas.

After declaring a function starfunction, define arguments on it using function body. When defining of a function is completed. call it anywhere using its name and a semicolon. like: starfunction();.;
, Write these line of codes in your C++ IDE. This isn't totally necessary, but to help you learn, start with a program without a user defined function and run it.

, It will give you ranges of different data types. Now you can add a user defined function starfunction in it.

, Write these line of codes in you C++ IDE, compile the code, and run it.







#include<iostream>
#include<conio.h>
using namespace std;
void starfunction (); //Function Declaration
int main ()
{
        starfunction(); //Function Call
        std::cout<<""Data Type   Range""<<endl;
        starfunction(); //Function Call
        std::cout<<""Char                -128 to 127""<<endl;
        std::cout<<""Short               -32,768 to 32,767""<<endl;

        starfunction(); //Function Call
        getch();
}
void starfunction() // Function Declator
{
        for (int a=1; a<=27; a++)
        std::cout<<'*';
        std::cout<<endl;
}





At the bottom of the code, in starfunction we define a for loop and print 27 (*) stars.
When we call starfunction function anywhere else, without typing for loop it prints 27 (*) stars.

, It will give a new look to your program.

Create two String objects.,
Use boolean startsWith(String prefix) to compare the start of strings.,
Use boolean startsWith(String prefix, int offset).,
Use boolean endsWith(String prefix) to compare the end of strings.,
Use int compareTo(String anotherString) to compare two strings.",How to Compare Strings in Java," The simplest way to declare two strings in Java is to use the following code. ""String"" is the declaration of the object type. string1 and string2 are the names of each string. The words, ""hello"" and ""father,"" are essentially the values of the string objects. Whenever your compiler encounters the quotations, it will automatically create a String.






String string1 = ""hello"";
String string2 = ""father"";



;
, This String class method compares the start of a string with whatever you enter into the method. Since it is a boolean method, it will return either ""true"" or ""false."" Use the following code and one of your previously created strings. The following code will show you an example of a true case and a false case. It will also print out a message with the result. The output should be ""true"" and then ""false.""






System.out.println(string1.startsWith(""he"")); //returns true and prints true
System.out.println(string1.startsWith(""mo""));  //returns false and prints false





, This String class method will compare a string with whatever you enter in as the prefix at the point in the string specified by the value in offset. This method will ignore letters in the string that are before the value in offset. The following code will show you an example of a true case and a false case. Note that while counting letters in the string, start at 0. For example, in the word ""hello,"" 'h' is space 0 and 'e' is space 1.






System.out.println(string1.startsWith(""lo"", 3)); //returns true and prints true
System.out.println(string1.startsWith(""lo"", 1)); //returns false and prints false





, This will compare the end of the string with whatever you enter into the method. Based on the value of the length of the string prefix, the method will count backward that value in the string to be compared. Look at the following code for an example of a true case and a false case. The code will also print out the result of the comparison.






System.out.print(string2.endsWith(""her"")); //returns true and prints true
System.out.print(string1.endsWith(""he"")); //returns false and prints false





, Perform a comparison of the two strings by using string1.compareTo(string2) or string2.compareTo(string1). Since the method is of type integer, the method will return a number. If the strings are not equal to each other, the number returned will not be 0. It they are equal, the number returned will be 0. The following code will show you an example of an equal and non-equal case. The code will also print out the result to the system.






String string1 = ""hello"";
String string2 = ""hello"";
String string3 = ""father"";
System.out.println(string1.compareTo(string2)); //prints '0' because both are equal
System.out.println(string1.compareTo(string3); //prints an integer other than 0

, While it is possible to create a help file by hand, using a rich-text-format (.rtf) file, most help file authors use a software application to write their help files, such as RoboHelp, Help and Manual, Doc-To-Help, MadCap Flare or HelpLogix. Most help authoring tools include a text editor or work with a word-processing program like Microsoft Word and provide a user interface that lets the help author see how the help file will look as he or she is writing it while writing computer code behind the scenes to make the help file work. Some help authoring tools also include graphics editors for creating screenshots to include in the help file.


There are a number of help file formats: The most common is HTML Help, which is used by applications that run in Windows. (An older format, WinHelp, is no longer supported.) Apple and Unix each have their own formats, as well, as does Sun Microsystems, with its JavaHelp. Software applications designed to run under several operating systems may use a cross-platform help system that runs in the user's Web browser. Whichever help authoring tool you use should support the help format(s) you are going to create help files in.

, Your help authoring tool will create a help project file for you, based on the filename you provide and other information. The main project file contains information about the other files, which include a contents file, an index file, one or more image files and other files.


The contents file includes the text in the help file that explains how the software application you are documenting works. The text is usually broken down into topics that cover a specific screen, feature or procedure.
The index file is a list of the help file's topics. It is used to create a table of contents that users can use to select a topic to view, as well as a searchable index within the help file.
Image files are graphic files of program screens or portions of those screens displayed within the help file to enhance the users' ability to understand what the help file text is referring to.

, Unless you're writing the help file to appear in the user's Web browser, the help file will appear in its own window. Your help authoring tool will let you adjust the window's horizontal and vertical dimensions to a size that will let the end user read the help file without its getting in the way of the application itself. The main help window is often in a tri-pane format, with the table of contents on the left and the selected topic on the right.


Help files can also have, in addition to the main window, secondary windows that describe a particular feature in detail and automatically sizing pop-up windows that give short descriptions of features. Help files can also include embedded text that appears only when highlighted text or a button is clicked.

, To do this, you'll need to review the specs or the program itself to create the topics to document the program's screens and features. As you create each topic, your help authoring tool will add it to the help file's table of contents and index.


While you can build the table of contents as you go, it helps to have some plan for how to organize it. You can organize the table of contents around the program's screens, its features, ways to use it or some combination thereof.
As you write the topics, consider other information in the help file that users will want to have quick access to. You can create jumps, or hyperlinks, in the help file text that connect to the topics that have that information.

, Many program features are best explained with a combination of text and graphics. You can create screenshots with either the application that comes with your help authoring tool or with a separate application, such as Microsoft Paint, Paint Shop Pro or SnagIt.


Text and screenshots should be laid out together in a topic such that users can see the screenshot and its supporting text without undue scrolling. In many cases, you'll want to show a portion of a program screen instead of the entire screen, or show the screenshot in a smaller size than the original. Your screenshot application should be capable of resizing the screenshot without blurring or loss of detail.
If you anticipate changes to the user interface between the test and final versions of the program, you may want to hold off on creating screenshots until you have the final version of the program to work with.

, Some programs include ""Help"" buttons for a user to click and display the topic in the help file that specifically describes how that screen works. Displaying a topic this way is called context-sensitive help and requires creating a map file for the programmer to link the ""Help"" button to the specific topic in your help file. Your help authoring tool can create one for you, or the programmer can code it and give it to you to include in the help file.

, Compiling creates the actual help file that will be included with the program. For most help formats, this will incorporate all the component files that were created when you created the help file, although some uncompiled help formats also require the individual help topic files to be included with the program.

, Once you compile the help file, you need to test it to make sure that all the hyperlinks connect to the topics they're supposed to and all the graphics display correctly. The help file also needs to be tested to ensure that the content is accurate and appropriate for the users and in a consistent format. You'll want to review the help file yourself and have the people testing the application review it as well.


On larger help file projects, compiling and testing are ongoing processes. You'll want to compile the help file and check your work several times before creating the final version.

, Depending on the project nature and help file format, you may have to provide the developer with several files, including a map file if there are context-sensitive topics.

Install a Perl package.,
Download and install OpenSSL:


DownloadOpenSSL code and extract it to a folder on your hard drive.,
Download and prepare the BIND source:


Download the BIND source from ISC.,
Build BIND:


Open a Visual Studio command prompt and change the directory to the one containing BIND source.cd c:\bind-9.5.0-P2

Change current directory to win32utilscd win32utils

Issue the command:BuildSetup.bat
Make sure no errors occur.",How to Build ISC BIND DNS in Windows," Many Perl packages are available for free, such as ActivePerl , c:\openssl-0.9.8h will be assumed throughout this article.
Open a Visual Studio command prompt and change the current directory to the one you extracted OpenSSL on (issue the command: cd c:\openssl-0.9.8h)
Issue the command:perl Configure VC-WIN32 --prefix=c:/openssl
Where c:/openssl is the directory where you want OpenSSL to be installed to.
Issue the command:ms\do_ms
to build the make-files

Make sure no errors occurred while executing. This is a batch file that invokes many other commands so take extra care to the messages that show up.
If an error ensues stating that an environment variable is not defined (something like ""%OSVERSION% is not defined""), you might need to add the following line to the file c:\openssl-0.9.8h\util\pl\VC-32.pl near the top of the file before the first if statement:$FLAVOR = 'WINXP';
This is most likely to happen if building in a Windows XP SP2 or higher machine.
If you have to do the previous step, you might want to use Wordpad instead of notepad to open Perl files if you don't have notepad++ or some other editor that can interpret UNIX-style end-of-lines.


Issue the following command and make sure you do that in a Visual Studio command prompt:nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak.

If everything goes right, a new directory named out32dll will be created in the OpenSSL source directory with some executable and dll files in it.



, Make sure you download the source package not one of the binary ones.
Extract the files to your hard drive. c:\bind-9.5.0-P2 will be assumed throughout this article.
Open the folder (c:\bind-9.5.0-P2) in Windows Explorer and find the two files libdns.dsp and libdns.mak.
Open the files above in notepad (right click and choose ""open with"". Do not open the files with Visual Studio).
Replace all occurrences of openssl-0.9.8d with your version (in this case, open ssl-0.9.8h)

In future versions, BIND may change to support a newer version on OpenSSL. For best results, use the search feature of your text editor to look for all occurrences of ""openssl-"" and replace manually.



,
Open the BindBuild.dsw file in Visual Studio.

The file can be found in the win32utils directory.
You might be prompted to convert the project into current Visual Studio format if you have a VS installation higher than VS 7. In such case, choose ""yes to all"".


Configure the output platform:

In VS 7: Go to Project > Properties > C/C++ > General . Select ""Platform"" from the Drop Down Box as : Win32.
In later versions, this will mostly be set, but you can make sure by right clicking the solution icon and choosing properties. There you'll see if the platform is Win32 or not. If not, change it.


Add additional include directories:

VS 7: Go to Project > Properties > C/C++ > General, in the ""Additional Include Directories"" give the path of OpenSSL folder that has all the header files under inc32 . In the example given so far, that would be c:\openssl-0.9.8h\inc32 and click apply.
Higher versions of VS: Right click a project, choose ""Properties"" then in ""Configuration Properties"" > C/C++, add the folder to the additional include directories.


Build BIND:

In VS 7: Go to Build > Batch Build > Select All > Build/Rebuild
In VS 8 and higher: Go to Build > Build Solution


Under the build folder you'll find two directories, ""Debug"" and ""Release"" where you'll find BINDinstall.exe which you can use to install BIND.

Decide on a game.,
Learn the script.,
Learn how to use the above commands.,
Start scripting your game.,
Work on the instructions page.,
Work on the contents of the game itself.,
Create a winning screen.,
Your game should now look like the code above:


Run the program and make sure it works.

,
Touch up your file.,
Correct grammar where appropriate.,
Create graphics for the game if you would like.,
Correct any typing errors that you can find.,
Congratulations, you have just created a basic computer game with batch script!

",How to Build a Simple Computer Game Using Batch Script," Before deciding to make a shoot-em-up game or point-and-click game, know that even with MS DOS 8, batch script has serious limitations to its capabilities. You will not be able to create more of a game than a text-based game. It can be a quiz or a scenario game, but you will have only text. As to whether or not you want to have ASCII graphics is up to you, but the game will still be based entirely on text input.;
, The script is not that hard to learn, you may even learn it simply by looking at a program. To know any scripting language you may need to know some basic commands in your computer's command line. For this command line, the basic commands that you will need are:


echo
color
title
goto
if
set
labeling (not a command, but how to label)

,


The echo command is used to print out text to the console. Below, the echo command prints out ""Hello, world!"":






The color command is used to change the color of the text in the command line. This isn't very useful, and probably shouldn't be focused on until you have finished the game itself, but the results of the color change can be quite appealing. Colors in DOS command lines are numbered, there is a table of the colors at the end of this article. The following command will change the text color to black background with green text:






The title command simply changes the name of the window on the title bar and task bar, and is by no means useful, however, it can make your program look professional. Using it like so will change the title of the window to ""Fun Program"":






The goto command is used to go to a certain part of the program. You will be using it to determine what will happen when certain answers are chosen from questions. To use the goto command to go to a label called ""WRONG"":






The if command is used to determine what will happen if a certain event occurs. After the if statement (if ), a command follows. At the if statement, if a certain event is true, the command in the statement will be carried out. You will be using this statement to determine which goto command is to be used. This if statement will be true if the input is equal to 12:






The set command is actually quite complicated, since it may be used in many ways. As for now, all you need it for is to get the computer to receive input. To do this:






Finally, labeling. Labeling can name certain parts of the program so that you may use the goto command. You can name certain sections of the program anything, so long as the name isn't a command. To label a section ""main"", type the following:



:MAIN





Labeled sections include the label itself and all code that follow it until another label is present or the file reaches the end! Make sure you place the label before the section being labeled, and another label following it so that the computer understands what section is labeled! Example below:



@echo off
:LABEL1
echo THIS IS A TEST OF TEXT
set/p input=THIS IS A TEST INPUT_
if %input%==1 goto LABEL1
goto LABEL2
:LABEL2
echo TEST





The first line of the above program may have been confusing to you. This line turns off the display of the code inside the file, so it doesn't look like it was all typed out on a console. As of now that is unimportant, right now you should be determining what the above program will do(ignore the first line). The program will display text saying ""THIS IS A TEST OF TEXT"", then it will prompt for input. If the input is ""1""(meaning you typed in 1), the program will return to LABEL1 and the commands below it will repeat. If the condition in the if statement is not met, the computer will print text to the console ""TEST"". Copy the above program into two different windows running notepad. In one, save it as TEST1 in any folder and run it. Notice how the text is displayed. In the second window, erase the first line and save it as TEST2 and run it. Notice the difference?


Once you have a general understanding of how the above commands may be used, you may move on to the next step.

, It is suggested that a beginner use notepad, but if you would like to use MS DOS EDIT, that's fine, too. It is also suggested to a beginner to begin with a basic quiz game, so this is what this article will show you how to do. Remember to start by turning off the echo. Then introduce your game with some text through the echo command, then use set to allow input with the goto command. This may sound confusing, so look above (Note: the command REM creates comments, i.e. notes for the developer that won't show in the final result):

, At this point, you should save your file(save as something.bat), and put it in a folder that you created for the game. After saving it, run it and make sure it works.


From this point on you will be having multiple files per game (especially if you want to have ASCII graphics). You can get the batch script to print out the contents of any file on the screen with the type command. The below will print the contents of TEST.txt:






It's important to remember to include the file extension, or the command may not work properly.


Create an instructions page in notepad. It should say something like:






Save this as INST.txt in the folder of the batch file, then make it so that your game will print the text to the console on the instructions page:






Run the program and make sure it works.







, This is where most of your creativity/research, work, and time is spent working on the game, as well as where most of the game's scripting should be. There should be a place that you go when you get an answer wrong, and a way to advance to the next question when you get the answer right. The above will have basic questions about the exterior of a car. You may replace them with what you like.


Run the program and make sure it works.

, Creating a winning screen is as simple as the instructions screen. Create a text document with praise for winning and save it as WIN.txt in the batch folder. Add the following lines to the end of your game for the winning screen:

,, Start by going to each label and placing the cls command after it. This will clear the screen at each label so you don't have a screen full of unnecessary information.

, If you want, make all of the answers on the list complete sentences. NOTE THAT YOU SHOULD AVOID CONTRACTIONS IN THE BATCH SCRIPT ECHO COMMAND! You should also avoid slashes and greater than/less than symbols, stars, percent symbols, and any other unusual symbols. These symbols will create a syntax error that causes the program to stop, lag, or crash.

, Generate ASCII art in separate text documents and use the type command to display them in the program:

, Think of your own things to correct. Then add your color with the color command. It is suggested that you place it at the beginning of the program so that the whole program is of this color. Here is the explanation of how to use it directly from the command line:

Sets the default console foreground and background colors.

COLOR attr Specifies color attribute of console output

Color attributes are specified by TWO hex digits -- the first corresponds to the background; the second the foreground. Each digit can be any of the following values:

0 = Black 8 = Gray 1 = Blue 9 = Light Blue 2 = Green A = Light Green 3 = Aqua B = Light Aqua 4 = Red C = Light Red 5 = Purple D = Light Purple 6 = Yellow E = Light Yellow 7 = White F = Bright White

If no argument is given, this command restores the color to what it was when CMD.EXE started. This value either comes from the current console window, the /T command line switch or from the Default Color registry value.


In other words, if you wanted a bright white background and black text:



@echo off
color f0
:MAIN
cls
echo.

A new language every year?",How to Become Skilled at Learning Programming Languages," All the programming languages in the world won't do you much good if you don't know about algorithms and data structures. These are tools that transcend the language, platform, and development tools you will learn. It's useful to know about sorting, for example, even if you will likely have library routines to do the actual sorting for you in most languages.


Knowing some basic logic, mathematics and linguistics is good too, but not essential.;

Know the difference between a scripting language and a systems language. This used to be more significant than it is now: many people are using scripting languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript (ECMAScript) for larger and more complex systems, while platform APIs are becoming available in a variety of languages.
Know the difference between type systems. What To Know Before Debating Type Systems explains this well.
Know the difference between stack and heap programming.
Know the difference between pass by value and pass by reference.
Know the difference between structured, object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming. A given language will usually focus on one of these, but some mix them.
Know the difference between running compiled code, interpreted code, just-in-time compiled code and code on a virtual machine. They have different performance characteristics and allow or require different styles of programming. Knowing when to use a virtual machine and when to run code natively on the machine's architecture can mean the difference between success and failure for a project.

You'll often find that for a particular style of programming, there will be a very pure but somewhat impractical language that can be used to learn that style of programming, and then a much more practical language that you can use in everyday life. To become better at learning programming languages, it is worth learning some of these pure (research) languages as they will help when learning the practical languages more quickly.
As an example for object-oriented programming, try learning Smalltalk. You won't be able to build much in it, but it was one of the early object-oriented programming languages. Ruby keeps some of the Smalltalk heritage while being a more practical language that you can use for a wide variety of programming tasks. Java, C#, and C++ are high-level languages with object-oriented programming support.
For languages that use interfaces, try Java, C#, or C++. Python, C++, and many other languages allow multiple inheritance, while Scala uses 'traits', an interesting combination of interfaces, multiple inheritance, and abstracts.
For prototype-based object-oriented programming, learn JavaScript (ECMAScript). JavaScript doesn't have classes: instead it has prototypes. Self is the original language that started prototype-based programming, and ActionScript, Lua, and REBOL can be used for this kind of programming.
For functional programming, consider learning OCaml or Haskell. These are statically-typed functional programming languages. For slightly more practical functional languages, consider Scala (on the Java Virtual Machine) or F# (on .NET).
If you want to try a very dynamic programming language, try Ruby, Python, Perl, or Lisp. The type systems in these languages are very different from a language like Java or C. It is worth trying these kinds of languages to see the sort of things you need to do to code around not having this kind of type system – unit testing, metaprogramming techniques, duck typing, and so on.
Try domain specific languages, these are languages built for very specific purposes, or language abstraction built on top of an existing language to express some specific set of functionality. Some of these are SQL, XSLT, FreeMarker, ASP.net, C# LINQ, Shell Scripts, YACC, AWK, SED, and hundreds more. Ruby and Scala can both be used to create domain specific languages. Note that many domain specific languages are not Turing Complete.

Concurrency is a difficult problem in computing, and many new languages are providing new ways of writing concurrent routines. Some of these approaches cannot easily be built with libraries and instead requires support from the language itself.
Threading is the most widely supported way of supporting concurrency, but can be very difficult to build. Java, C++ and many other languages support threading, while some languages like Python and Ruby only support 'green threads' rather than true system-level threading. Threading becomes complicated because all the threads need access to the same set of global data, which can lead to race conditions and other similar problems. So, other approaches have been introduced...
Software transactional memory (STM) is one solution. Erlang and Clojure are two very different languages that implement this.
Message-passing actors is another solution: Scala and Erlang are worth looking at for this.
In Python and Ruby, take a look at Twisted and EventMachine which provide event loops. Alternatively, look at Node.js, a (server-side) JavaScript framework for building event loops.
Co-routines are another way of resolving concurrency issues: the Go language from Google is a new statically-typed, type-inferred systems language intended to be like C in performance but like Python in syntax and simplicity. It uses ""goroutines"", an implementation of co-routines. Another language built around co-routines is Icon.
Dispatch queues are another solution to this: on Mac OS X 10.6 and higher, ""Grand Central Dispatch"" is a queueing system Apple have created for use in C, C++ and Objective-C. The open source implementation of GCD is available as ""libdispatch"". A Java and Scala implementation called HawtDispatch is also available.

, One of the best ways of learning a new language and becoming skilled at learning languages is to read code. There is plenty of open source code available, and once you've read through the code of a few applications, you start to see good and bad code and develop a taste for what you like and don't like, as well as understanding why certain programming styles and paradigms are good for different tasks.

, Learning a new language by writing ""Hello World"" is much more difficult and will not exercise the true abilities of the language.

, There can also be confusion between ""code generators"" and the ""language"". When learning a new language that is similar to one already learned it is often the case that learning the library and its idiosyncrasies is the larger task.

, Some programming languages are designed to work well with particular tools. Many languages can be written with just a text editor like Vim or Notepad2 or TextMate, but working in the Lisp language can be made easier by using Emacs because of the built-in support for REPL environments. When working in C# or any .net language, Visual Studio or MonoDevelop are ideal. When working in Java, there's Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, and many others to choose from. Even the chosen operating system and version control system can change how code is written.


Don't let the tools define the programming, and don't let tool switching become an obsession. Learning can come from trying new tools out of pure curiosity. Often the tool being used can slow down the process and this doesn't become obvious until compared with a new tool. However, changing tools just for the sake of ""progress"" can actually slow things down because of the learning curve, bugs, or simple incompatibility with existing processes. Sometimes old, understood tools are better than shiny new tools chosen because they are in fashion.

, Coding dojos, conferences, Bar Camps, hack days, user groups, and code camps are great ways to learn. These groups can be helpful, even if attended infrequently, to introduce new ideas and identify new methods of doing things. There is a benefit to being challenged in a new environment.

, Professional programmers may find opportunities to use new programming language knowledge at work. Try not to become a crazy evangelist, but spot opportunities where other languages may solve the problem better. However, shoehorning a language into a project where it doesn't fit just for the sake of using a new language is a recipe for failure. Having more tools in the toolbox always offers more opportunity and flexibility.


For example, while working on a Java project at work, being able to use Ruby means build scripts can be written in Buildr, and existing test libraries can be used to write test code (test/ruby, shoulda, RSpec etc.) and have it run with the Java application using JRuby.
Scripting languages can always be embedded into existing applications to allow scripting for dynamic, generated, or late-bound code. Ruby, Python, JavaScript, XSLT, and Lua are all good candidates.
Editor plugins, version control hooks and so on can often be written more quickly in a lightweight, often loosely typed, language like JavaScript, Perl, or Ruby than it can in Java or C.
If you have to write a front-end for a simple application, try using a scripting language like IronPython or MacRuby.
If you need to write a complex back-end for a high performance application, pull out one of the languages that gives you better concurrency support: Erlang, Scala, Clojure and so on.
Beware: not all companies will appreciate you sneaking in unapproved programming languages. And if it all goes wrong, you are going to be the one who gets blamed!

, If you can't sneak your new programming languages into work, you can always work on open source projects. There are many fun applications to be built for any platform (Linux, Windows, Mac, etc.) as well as command line tools, libraries, language features, or even a brand new language. An open source project can be a great substitute if a custom project can't be found when trying to learn a new language.

, Learn a new database every year, or a new API. Or even better, learn some non-programming skills. Cooking, musical instruments and photography are always popular in geek circles. A sport or activity gives you time to think and let ideas about programming percolate. This is just as important.

, The Pragmatic Programmers book suggests that you should learn a new programming language every year. Every year might be too often, but try to commit to learning new languages periodically and keeping up with the latest developments. Even if you don't end up using the languages for work or open source or personal projects, knowing them still makes you both more valuable for employment, and should also give you some personal satisfaction.

Become a Windows Insider.,
Download and install VirtualBox.,
Download the most recent Windows 10 build.",How to Install Windows 10 Technical Preview with Virtualbox1," If you are already signed up as a Windows Insider, you can skip this step. If you haven’t signed up as an Insider yet, you will need to do so before continuing to the next step. Visit the Windows Insider Program main page, and click the purple “Get Started” button. Follow the prompts to sign up.


If you already have an account with Microsoft (Hotmail, Live, Outlook, etc.) you can sign in with these. If not, you will be required to set up a new email account with them before continuing.;
, If you don’t already have VirtualBox downloaded, now would be the time to do that, and get it installed. Head to it’s VirtualBox official download page. Under the “VirtualBox platform packages” click the “VirtualBox 4.3.28 for Windows hosts” option. This should all be at the top of the page. Wait for it to finish downloading and follow the on-screen prompts to finish installation.

, Windows Insiders get access to updated versions of Windows 10 before they are released to the public. These are called “builds.” Head on over to the official Windows 10 Preview download page, and scroll down the page until you see a listing of languages. Choose your language and select either a 32-bit option or 64-bit from the drop-down menu that appears. This will depend on your PC hardware and is important, so make sure ahead of time that you know what you are currently running. You will notice that, under the “Editions” subheading, and to the right of each option, it will say the build number (e.g., Build 10130). Make your choice by clicking the blue “Download” button to the right of this. Wait for it to finish before continuing.


In order to know whether your current PC is either 32- or 64-bit, simply press and hold the Windows key and hit R. Enter “cmd” in the box and hit enter. A black window pops up; here, simply enter “echo %processor_architecture%” and hit Enter. If you see the number 64 in the results, then you are running a 64-bit processor. If not, then its 32-bit.

Launch VirtualBox.,
Name your operating system.,
Choose your RAM.,
Create a virtual hard drive.,
Wait for the process to finish.,
Load the Windows 10 ISO file.",How to Install Windows 10 Technical Preview with Virtualbox2," Locate its icon on the desktop or Programs menu, and double-click on it. This will load VirtualBox on your computer.

, Once VirtualBox loads, go ahead and click the “New” button in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. A little box will pop up with 3 fields inside it. Enter a simple name for the OS, leave the Type section set to it’s default, and select Windows 10 (either 32-bit or 64-bit) from the drop-down box to the right of “Version.” Click “Next” in the lower right hand corner to continue.

, The next window will have a slider bar on it to select how much RAM to allow the operating system (OS) to use. It is suggested to run no higher than the green area of this bar. Slide the bar to the desired amount. The amount currently selected should be listed in the box to the right of the bar. Something like “2048” measured in MB. When you're finished, click “Next” to continue.

, There should be 3 options in the window in front of you. The middle one, “Create a virtual hard drive now,” should be selected by default, but you can choose not to add one by choosing the top option. Creating a virtual hard drive will take up hard drive space on the PC it is being created on; however, this data is not shared with the PC unless specific settings are changed. These settings are not enabled by default. For now, keep the middle option selected and move to the next window by clicking “Create.”


A series of different options will be on the next window. You will not need to change any of these settings unless you are running some other specific virtualization software. Just click “Next” to continue.
The next window will ask you to choose which type of hard drive you would like to create, either “Fixed size” or “Dynamically allocated.” You can choose either, but the fixed option will make sure that you don’t overwhelm your current PC hard drive and will be much faster. Click “Next” to continue.
On this, the final window, you will need to choose the exact amount of space you would like to give the VM. 32GB is pretty good for a preview OS like Windows 10, but that is up to you. Just make sure that you don’t over do it, as adding more space to your VM also takes space away from your real PC. Click the “Create” button to continue.
Please note that if you choose not to create a virtual hard drive, you will be unable to save any data when using your virtual OS. Also note that the recommended size of the virtual hard drive, for Windows 10, is 32 GB minimum.

, After finishing the final part of this step, you will notice that a little box will pop up with a green progress bar inside of it. This is creating the fixed storage with the options you selected. Please wait for this to finish and do not close this window, it will close on its own. Then continue to the next step.

, Now you should see the default VirtualBox window. Right-click the name of the Windows 10 VM you just made, and select “Settings” from the context menu. A new window will open with several different menus on the left-hand side. Click “Storage” and you should now see two different boxes to the right of the menu options: “Storage Tree” and “Attributes.”


Inside the Storage Tree box, click the item that says “Empty.” It should be under “Controller: IDE.” Once selected, click the small disk icon in the Attributes box to the right of “IDE Secondary Master.” This will drop down a menu. From this, select the one that says “Choose a virtual CD/DVD disk file…” A new file browser window will open.
Navigate to the folder containing the Windows 10 ISO you downloaded earlier. Select it, and hit the “Open” button in the lower right-hand corner of the window. Hit “Okay” to close the Settings window. You will be back at the VirtualBox main menu; click the VM you just made, and click the green arrow to start your new Windows 10 Technical Preview. Make sure to follow the on-screen prompts for installing Windows, and enjoy!

Become a lifelong learner.,
Understand your future role.,
Start with pseudocode.,
Tweak the pseudocode.,
Try writing algorithms for all sorts of things.,
After you've learned how to write algorithms, programming should come naturally to you.,
Programming is only the translation of pseudocode into a programming language.,
Read up on RAM (the random access machine).,
Learn about the limiting behavior of functions.,
Read about how worst case inputs can break your algorithm or cost you heavily in CPU processing time.",How to Become a Computer Scientist," Being a computer scientist is all about learning to be a student, not just during training, but for all time throughout your career. Technology changes, new languages develop, new algorithms are devised: you need to be able to learn new things to stay current.;
, As a computer scientist, it is your job to solve problems. It is also about solving problems in a way which can leave everyone happy in the end. This means learning good communication skills as well as coding skills because you are more likely to match the needs of your client with the apt solution if you listen well and relay back your understandings clearly, as well as keep the client informed during the project.

, Pseudocode isn't really a programming language, but it is a way to represent a program in a very English-like way. The most familiar algorithm to you is probably on your shampoo bottle: Lather, rinse, repeat. This is an algorithm. It is understandable by you (the ""Computing Agent"") and has a finite number of steps. Or does it ...

, The shampoo example isn't a very good algorithm for two reasons: it doesn't have a condition to end on, and it doesn't really tell you what to repeat. Repeat lathering? Or just the rinsing. A better example would be ""Step 1 - Lather. Step 2 - Rinse. Step 3 - Repeat steps 1 and 2(2 or 3 times for better results) and then finish(exit)."" This is understandable by you, has an end condition (a finite number of steps), and is very explicit.

, For example, how to get from one building to another on campus, or how to make a casserole. Soon, you'll be seeing algorithms all over the place!

, Buy a book, and read it entirely to learn the language. Avoid online tutorials as they're often written by hobbyists, not professionals.


However, feel free to look for help on the internet. Object-oriented languages like Java and C++ are ""in"" right now, but Procedural languages like C are easier to start with because they deal solely in algorithms.

, The more time before programming you spend planning in pseudocode, the less time you'll spend typing and scratching your head.

, One of the best places to start is by reading Steven Skiena's book The algorithm design manual.

, Read up on Big O notation.

, It is important to learn what ways can efficiently counteract them.

Boot up your virtual machine.,
Shut down your virtual machine.,
Take snapshots of your virtual machine.",How to Install VirtualBox," VirtualBox from Oracle is available for free from the developer's website. Make sure that you download the correct version for your operating system.


There are multiple choices for Linux versions. Choose the package that matches your Linux distribution, or use the ""All distributions"" option if your Linux distribution is not listed.;
, If you are using Windows, double-click the setup file and follow the prompts to install. If you are using a Mac, open the DMG file that you downloaded and drag the VirtualBox file to your Applications folder.


During the Windows installation, keep all of the options set to their default.

, VirtualBox allows you to manage your various virtual machines, and easily create new ones. You can run VirtualBox directly from the installation program, or you can start it from the desktop icon.

, When creating a virtual machine, you will need to install the operating system just like you would on a regular computer. This means that you will need the installation discs for the operating system you want to install on the virtual machine.


If you download the ISO file for the installation disc, you can burn it to a blank DVD, or install it directly from the ISO file.

, This will open the wizard that will guide you through the process to create your first virtual machine.

, On the first screen of the wizard, you will be asked to give the new virtual machine a name as well as choose what operating system you will be installing. Choose the type of operating system from the Type menu, and then choose which version you are installing from the Version menu.


For example, if you are installing Windows 7, choose ""Microsoft Windows"" from the Type menu, and then ""Windows 7"" from the Version menu.
If you are installing the 64-bit version of the operating system, make sure to choose the 64-bit version from the Version menu.

, You will need to designate how much of your computer's RAM will be allocated to your virtual machine. VirtualBox will automatically choose the recommended minimum amount for the operating system you selected, but you can increase or decrease this if you'd like.


You can only go as high as the amount of RAM physically installed in your system.
It is not recommended that you set it to the max amount, as there won't be any left for your regular operating system to use when the virtual machine is running.

, Your virtual machine will need a virtual hard drive in order to install the operating system and any programs. This virtual hard drive is carved out of the free space available on your computer. VirtualBox will set a recommended size based on the operating system, but you can set it to whatever you'd like.


Make sure that the virtual hard drive has at least enough space to install the operating system. Check the specifications for your operating system to see how much space you should allocate at minimum.
Remember that any programs you install will also take up space on your virtual hard drive, so plan accordingly.
The most common format for virtual hard drives is VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image).

, Once the virtual machine has been configured, the wizard will close and you will be taken back to the VirtualBox main window. Double-click your new machine in the left menu to start it up for the first time.


A new wizard will appear to help start the operating system installation.
If you are installing from a disc, insert it into your computer and select ""Host drive"" and the right drive letter from the drop-down menu.
If you are installing from an image file, click the folder icon to browse through your computer for the installation image file.

, After selecting the installation media, the operating system installation will begin. Installation proceeds the same way it would as if you were installing the operating system on a regular computer. See the following guides for instructions on installing the operating system of your choice:


Windows 8
Windows 7
Windows Vista
Windows XP
Install OS X
Linux Mint
Ubuntu Linux

, Once the operating system is installed, your virtual machine is ready to go. Simply double-click the machine in the left menu of the VirtualBox main page to start the virtual machine. The virtual computer will boot and load into the operating system that you installed.


Your virtual machine will run in a window. Whenever the virtual machine window has focus, any keystrokes or mouse clicks will affect the virtual machine and not your physical computer.
You can create a desktop shortcut for your virtual machine by right-clicking on the machine in the VirtualBox window and selecting ""Create Shortcut on Desktop"".

, You have a couple of different options when closing your virtual machine, and each will affect the machine slightly differently. When you click the ""X"" in the upper-right corner of the window, you will be presented with several options:


Save the machine state - This will save the virtual machine in exactly the state that it's in when you close it. Any programs you are running will be saved in their current state, and everything will be restored when you start the machine again.
Send the shutdown signal - This will send a power-down signal to the virtual machine, and it will shut down as if the power button was pressed on a physical computer.
Power off the machine - This will power down the machine as if power was cut to the computer. Nothing will be saved.

, VirtualBox allows you to copy your virtual machine's exact state, allowing you to return to that state at any time. This is incredibly useful for testing software or other configurations.You can take a snapshot by clicking the Machine menu and selecting ""Take snapshot"". The snapshot will be added to the list of your virtual machines on the left side of the VirtualBox menu.
You can restore a snapshot by right-clicking the snapshot and selecting ""Restore"". Any changes to your virtual hard drive since the time the snapshot was created will be lost when the snapshot is restored.

Ask questions that will help make your program better.,
Approach each task knowing there is more than one solution.,
Master the skills you attain through your learning process.,
Take as much time as you need.,
Develop your critical thinking skills in order to improve your creative thinking skills.,
Effectively research when you can't figure out a solution.,
Think outside the box.,
Step outside your comfort zone.,
Be positive and stay motivated!",How to Be a Creative Thinker While Computer Programming," Asking questions is very important when it comes to developing a thorough program. “How can I turn this idea into a program?” “How will this program help better my community?” “Is this the most effective way to execute my program?” These are some ideal examples of questions you should be asking yourself when coming up with an idea that you want to turn into a project.


These questions are also helpful when it comes to executing the task. Asking questions will always challenge you to think more and this will help you improve your creative thinking skills because you will come up with more solutions to your questions and problems.;
, One of the most advantageous things about computer programming is that there are many ways to code a single task. Knowing that you can approach each task with multiple perspectives will be useful when developing creative thinking skills while programming. If you are stuck on a problem while executing a program, having the ability to figure another way out will be very useful. This will help you develop critical skills used to creatively solve problems.

, Remembering the skills that you have learned throughout your previous coding experience will be very useful when trying to solve a new problem. The knowledge you attain as a coder will be recurring and will come to use in many different settings. Drilling this information into your brain will help you approach tasks in different ways enabling your creativity.

, A big step in becoming a creative thinker is to not pressure yourself to develop an idea. Doing so might hinder you from coming to a near-optimal solution. Whatever your creative idea will be, it will emerge naturally in its own time.

, Critical thinking helps with problem solving and creativity. The fundamentals of critical thinking are very useful in software engineering. These skills help you assess and further understand code than what is merely printing on your computer screen. Critical thinking skills will help you distinguish pieces information and also help you develop ideas. Being able to analyze information is also very important and this will help further develop your creative thinking skills.

, When you are just stuck on a problem while facing your code and think of a solution, the best go-to method is to research your problem. Being an effective researcher will help you attain new knowledge that can improve your creative thinking skills. Researching can help expand your knowledge on important concepts used in computer programming and the research you gain can help you develop better ideas.

, A very critical step in being able to develop creative thinking skills is to be able to think outside of the box. In today’s technological world, the most successful inventions have been induced because somebody decided to think outside of the box and come up with something that has never been thought of before. Expanding your knowledge and focusing on what has not been developed yet and creating those ideas is rooted from thinking outside of the box.

, Stepping outside of your comfort zone is important when developing creative thinking skills while coding because you will get more comfortable with tackling problems you haven’t encountered before. This will help you come to terms with ideas you have never seen before and it will help you be comfortable in altering your mindset to think in a different way.

, Being positive and staying motivated are very important when pursuing a field like computer science. This is because you will encounter many instances where you feel like there is no solution to a problem because you think you have done everything you possibly could, but never give up. If you stay positive and motivated then you will always achieve whatever you want to achieve, and you will eventually come to a solution using creative thinking skills. This is not only a step you can apply to programming, but a step you can apply to every aspect of your life.

",How to Install Ubuntu on VirtualBox,";
,,, Go the VirtualBox website and go to the download section. There are versions available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. If you’re not sure what operating system you’re running, download the Windows version at the top by clicking “x86/amd64”.

, Read and accept the license agreement. Newer version of installers i.e. 4.3.16 released on ""09 September 2014"" does not show license agreement option while installing.

,, Do this by clicking the grey icon near each option and selecting the red X or “Entire feature will be unavailable”. Then click “Next” to continue. If this is your first time dealing with virtual machines, this will eliminate the need to install custom drivers, which makes installing and uninstalling VirtualBox easier. If you’ve worked with virtual machines before, you can choose to keep these options selected.

,,,,, Click “Next”. For this example, you’ll be installing Ubuntu.


Type any name in the Name field (such as Ubuntu or Linux). For “Operating System,” choose “Linux.” The version will automatically default to “Ubuntu.” Click “Next” when you’re done.

, If you feel this amount isn’t correct, you can move the slider or type a new amount in the box. Click “Next” when you’re done.

, This opens a second wizard to create a new virtual hard disk.

, A fixed size storage is going to be the size of the virtual hard disk on the host OS (e.g.: a virtual disk 8 GB will be 8 GB on the host OS's hard disk). A dynamically expanding storage will be only the size of Ubuntu on your hard disk, but will grow in size as files are added to it until it reaches its limit (e.g.: virtual disk is created and has a 1 megabyte file on it. The size of the virtual disk is 1 megabyte. Then, another 1 megabyte file is added. The size of the virtual disk is 2 megabytes. This goes on until it reaches the specified size of the disk).

, Again, VirtualBox recommends the proper size of your virtual hard disk. If you feel this amount isn’t correct, you can move the slider or type a new amount in the box. Click “Next” when you’re done.

, You will see your new virtual machine in list.

, Once you've done this, click the “Settings” button.

,,,, Choose boot order and keep CD/DVD on the top as first priority.

, You ubuntu machine is ready to boot now.

, Then click the “Start” button

,, Choose your preferred language and press Enter.

Modify two properties files within the extracted directory structure.,
Create a jar and use your new classifier from within the Weka gui.",How to Add Your Own Custom Classifier to Weka,"


Download and install Weka from http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html

Download and install Java Development Kit from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Download Apache Ant from http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi in zip format. Extract this zip using some extractor software such as WinRAR into some drive other than the main disk partition.(eg:any other drive than C drive);
, In Windows 7, these can be edited from Control Panel > System And Security > System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables > System variables.


Add/Edit variable %JAVA_HOME% as your Java directory. For example: %JAVA_HOME%=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23
Add/Edit variable %ANT_HOME% as your Ant directory. eg: %ANT_HOME%=D:\ant\apache-ant-1.9.4
Add/Edit variable %PATH% to point to the binaries of Ant and Java. eg:%PATH%=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin;D:\ant\apache-ant-1.9.4\bin

, This can be done by first copying weka-src.jar into a new folder. Then navigate to this location using windows command prompt. Now type the command ""jar xf weka-src.jar"" without the quotes in the command prompt.

, eg: Navigate to src/main/java/weka/classifiers/rules/ and add your custom classifier (say SampleClassifier.java) to this directory. For simplicity you can start off by copying and existing classifier in that directory such as ZeroR.java and then renaming the file name as SampleClassifier.java. Make sure you replace all occurrences of the word ""ZeroR"" with ""SampleClassifier"" within the copied java file. Now you can modify the new classifier. Make sure to read weka.wikispaces.com/Writing+your+own+Classifier for more information regarding the protocols a new classifier must follow.

, The first modification allows your classifier to appear in the Weka graphical user interface. The second modification is optional and is used to allow dynamic detection of custom classifiers not present in the first properties file.


Make a new entry in src/main/java/weka/gui/GenericObjectEditor.props for the new classifier. eg:just above the line for ZeroR classifier enter the line "" weka.classifiers.rules.SampleClassifier,\"" without the quotes.
Make sure that src/java/weka/gui/GenericPropertiesCreator.props has the entry ""UseDynamic=true"" already set. If not set it.

, For that, navigate to the location of previously extracted file with command prompt and enter the command ""ant"". Wait until you get ""build successful"" message. Now give the command ""ant exe jar"". Note that all these commands should be given without the quotes. If the build is again successful you can copy the newly created weka.jar from the ""dist"" folder into directory where Weka was installed (replacing the existing copy of weka.jar in that location

Continue programming and trying new things!",How to Start Learning Computer Programming," Computer programming is done as essentially a set of written instructions that the computer follows (also known as binary coding). These instructions can be written in a number of different ""languages"", or which are simply different ways of organizing the instructions and text. Different languages tend to be used to create different types of programs, however, so choose a language that you feel is relevant to what you want to do. If you decide that a language does not suit your needs, you can always move on to a new language.;
, These languages are mainly used for creating standalone computer applications such as games. C and C++ are difficult languages to learn for a beginner, but not impossible. Learning them will give you an in depth understanding of not only programming (most programming languages inherit some concept or the other from C and C++), but also of how a computer works. They are popular and widely used, though C#, a language very similar to Java, is starting to become much more common.

, These are good languages to learn if you want to work on making web plugins (JavaScript) or mobile apps (Java). These languages are very much in demand right now, so they are handy to know. Keep in mind that Java and JavaScript are completely different languages, despite the similarity in names.

, Python is a very versatile language used widely across several platforms. Despite being extremely powerful, it is an easy language for a beginner to pick up, so give it a try!

, PHP stands for PHP: Hypertext Processor. It is a web programming language and relatively easy to learn due to its weak typing and popularity (popularity means there will be several useful tutorials on the language). It is a great language for server side programming.

, There are tons of programming languages, all with varying uses. If you want to work as programmer, you will definitely need to know more than one, so learn as many as you can.


Your best bet will be to look at ads for the sort of jobs you want to get and look for the common languages that they ask for.

, While most companies hiring a programmer will care more about your skills than the college you went to or your grades, it greatly helps to have a college degree to point to. You will learn more efficiently than if you teach yourself, all while getting expert guidance from your teachers (and maybe your friends).


There are often scholarships and grants available to those doing degrees in this field. Don't feel intimidated by the price tag of a degree: it is possible!

, Whether you do an online degree with fees and an actual degree at the end or you're attending a free program like MIT's wonderful Coursera, you can learn a lot about programming from these structured courses.

, Use free services like Google’s University Consortium or Mozilla’s Developer Network to learn more about programming. These companies want more developers to help their platforms flourish and their resources can be some of the best on the web.

, There are loads of programmers with websites where they will teach you the individual basics, as well as a few tricks. Look up tutorials on the language you want to learn to find these.


Many free online classes are available to learn coding from. The Khan Academy teaches computer coding, with easy tutorials and videos. Code Academy is another free site to learn from, with step-by-step tutorials.

, There are several programs designed to teach kids to program. Programs like MIT's Scratch are very helpful and the younger you are, the easier it will be to pick up (like any language).


Avoid kits, as these rarely teach anything useful.

, Get a good, current book on the programming language you want to learn. Reviews on Amazon or similar sites will usually help you identify helpful books from unhelpful ones.

, An interpreter is just another computer program but it will convert ideas you've written in a programming language into ""machine code"" so you can see things work. Lots of programs are available and you will need to choose one that is appropriate for you.

, Take examples of the programming language from the book and put them into your interpreter. Try changing the examples and making the program do different things.

, Start with simple things, like a program to convert currencies, and work your way up to more complex things as you continue reading and learning about your programming language.

, Once you start actively programming in your first language, you may want to learn a second one. You'll get the most out of learning a second programming language if you pick one that uses a radically different paradigm than the one you started with. For instance, if you started in Scheme, you might try learning C or Java next. If you started in Java, you could learn Perl or Python.

, To be a good programmer you, at the very least, have to keep up with changing technology. It's a constant learning process, and you should always be learning new languages, new paradigms, and most importantly: programming new things!

Load the data from tables which were extracted using FastReader into the target (destination) database.,
Recreate indexes (if removed) on the large loaded tables, this is a major, computationally intensive step, comparable to the unload/load phase, Care should be invested in improving the performance of this step by increasing the sort area or PGA memory sizes, performing several builds simultaneously under the available constraints (for instance you cannot effectively build two indexes on the same table at the same time), possible creating partitioned indexes in an unusable state and the rebuilding several partitions simultaneously, etc.

",How to Extract and Load Data From an Oracle Database," During this stage all the objects which are non data, such as PL/SQL, Sequences, Views, Table definitions, Object privileges etc. will be exported. There will be one such exp file per each schema exported. FastReader allows exporting of the schema definitions such as tables, constraints, sequences, triggers and generating scripts. The data from the large tables (fact tables and the large dimensions) should be exported using FastReader.;
, Native exp should be used with the TABLES parameter specifying only the small tables to be extracted. There will be one exp file per each schema exported.

, all the settings which are not exported using exp). If there is a need for a different tablespace/storage configuration then this should be taken into account in the latter stages.

, FastReader allows exporting of the schema definitions such as tables, constraints, sequences, triggers, etc. to be created on destination database

, These definitions are not exported during the schema export by exp.

, FastReader is utilizing the existing high-speed loaders for each supported database vendor (for instance, when data to be loaded into Oracle, then sqlldr will be utilized). FastReader creates automatically the control files for every supported target database vendor that reflect what tables/columns/data to be loaded and the scripts for actually executing the load. Before the load all the constraints and triggers on the large tables which can prevent “direct load” mode or hurt load performance should be disabled. Constraints on target database can be disabled / enabled also from FastReader GUI (Configurator). If materialized views are used with “refresh on commit” option, these should be disabled and refreshed completely at a later phase. For better control of the process the indexes maybe be dropped and recreated after the load. If the indexes remain then during the direct load, Oracle will build them using an efficient method similar in performance to creating an index on a full table. It is possible to load several tables and/or partitions simultaneously, by running several SQL loaders at once. This can improve load performance significantly on a multi-processor machine with good I/O.

,,, It is also possible that materialized views can be moved with their data intact and then their status changed to TRUSTED or created as if from pre-built tables but this step is more complex in terms of correct execution and setup

Overall, OneNote for Mac is very similar to OneNote for Windows; the OCR functionality works basically the same in both., You can find the icon on OneNote's Insert tab (the icon says ""Picture"" on Mac). The OneNote interface has a large ribbon across the top by default and the ""Pictures"" (or ""Picture"" on Mac) icon is on the Insert tab towards the left. On Mac, you can also choose ""Picture"" from the ""Insert"" menu at the top of the screen. When you click the icon, the Insert Picture window appears (or the ""Choose a picture"" window on Mac).If you don't see the tabs or icons click the Ribbon Display Options button to the immediate left of the Minimize button in the top right of the application window and choose ""Show Tabs and Commands."" On Mac you can just use the menus at the top of the screen, so the tabs aren't necessary.
Hover your mouse cursor over the buttons to see what they're called.

, After you do, click Open (""Insert"" on Mac). The image file appears in OneNote at the place where the cursor is.You can also choose File Printout rather than Image to extract text from the printout of a document.As an alternative, press the ⎙ PrtScr button on your keyboard to capture an image of your current screen, then paste it into your document using Ctrl+V (or ⌘ Cmd+V on a Mac).Text in the image that you are extracting from needs to be typeset for good OCR recognition.,


On Windows, if instead of an image you choose File Printout in Step 2, right-clicking on one page of the printout will result in two alternate choices here: “Copy Text From This Page of the Printout” or “Copy Text From All Pages of the Printout” – select the one you want.

, You can also choose to paste the image into another program.


You can select the text using your mouse cursor and then pressing Ctrl+C (or ⌘ Cmd+C on a Mac). Alternatively, you can right-click (or Ctrl+click on a Mac) the text and choose ""Copy.""
If you have saved the extracted text and are accessing it from a non-desktop version of OneNote, Instructions will vary significantly for copying and pasting. On Android, for example, you need to press and hold on part of the text you're wanting, use the resulting ""handles"" on either side to select all the text, and press the Copy or Cut button (the icons are of two pages on top of one another and of a pair of scissors, respectively).

, Microsoft Word or Google Docs are popular applications; simply open a new or existing document in that app and press Ctrl+V (or ⌘ Cmd+V on a Mac). The text will likely look pretty ugly when you paste it in.


You may want to save the document immediately before editing so you can go back to the original, unedited text.

Different types of applications or services abound:


Scanner-included software: If you have a scanner and still have the software that came with it, it probably includes OCR text extraction capabilities. Instructions should have come with the scanner or you should be able to look them up online for a relatively modern scanner.
Free Websites: These ad-driven but functional Websites typically take TIF, GIF, PDF, JPG, BMP, PNG or some combination. They often have limits (such as 5MB) to the size of files you can upload. Some sites will email you a Word document or other file containing the text of your image for free, others will simply provide the text for you to copy. A few include:

Free-ocr.comOnlineocr.netHigh-cost OCR software: Some OCR software costs up to $500 to purchase; consider these only if you need extremely highly accurate OCR results. Some of the more popular can be found at TopTenReviews.com or similar sites; several of the top currently include:OmniPage Standard
Adobe Acrobat
ABBYY FineReader

FreeOCRSimpleOCRFree OCR To Word, You can usually save your text as either plain text, Word .doc format, or in Rich Text Format (RTF). RTF format was a precursor to .doc and (like .doc) allows for saving text formatting, margins, images, and so forth into a single, portable and shareable file. RTF files are much larger than .doc files, and since .doc is viewable by just about anyone (MS Word has a free viewer available), .doc is probably your best bet., It will likely look a formatting mess when you paste it in, so you will have to remove a lot of spaces or break up words that have been crammed together. The level of formatting messiness depends largely on how clean the image that you extracted the text from was.

Know where your files are.,
Separate users and groups.,
Keep work and personal files separate.,
Use lots of sub-folders.,
Set a backup schedule.,
Use descriptive file names.,
Stick with it.",How to Create a Flawless Filing System on Your Computer," Keeping all of your files in one place is the best thing you can do to make sure no data is ever lost. Thus, the first step of creating a filing system is to choose a central location to keep all of your personal data. On Windows machines, the My Documents folder is often a good choice, although the operating system does add some extra junk along with your data (like My Pictures and My Music folders). Another good option is to install a separate hard disk or external drive to keep your data on. Resist the temptation to put everything on the desktop of your PC. The folder is buried in the operating system, making backups difficult. Never save files in the directories where their programs reside (i.e. never save a word document into the c:\program files\officeXP\word folder). These folders are often automatically deleted or moved.;
, Figure out the best way to keep user's data separate (and, in some cases, private). Windows has a good system for separating user data in the ""Documents and Settings"" folder. Other suggestions are to make a folder with a user's name on it. If you are organizing files in a business setting, creating separate folders for groups or projects is also a good idea. The important thing is that one user should be able to find all of his or her data in one single folder, making backups much easier.

, Keep work in one folder, schoolwork in another, photos and personal files in another, and downloads in another folder. Music should have its own folder, too (of course). That way, you can easily keep your personal and professional information separate, and can easily jump into what you need to work on. Tax returns? Open up your ""personal"" folder. Last minute business report? It's all in ""work"". Files that relate to the same thing are kept in the same place. Another method some people use is chronological sorting. While this is sometimes useful (keeping each semester of schoolwork in different folders), remember that the file system on your computer already keeps track of the date things were created and modified, so in some ways it is a waste of time to do this over again. Also, there are some great tools such as Google Desktop or Copernic Desktop search to quickly bring up files from a particular set of dates.

, Layers are good, they help keep things specific. Under work, keep a separate folder for timesheets, and another for web projects. Under each semester of schoolwork, keep one folder for Math, one for English, one for Chemistry, you get the idea. Just don't go overboard; a good rule of thumb is if you have more than 50 files in a folder, you might want to consider organizing those into sub folders.

, Once it's all under one big folder, it's easy to back up. If you only want to back up Work, just grab that folder instead. Invest in some CD or DVD-RW's and a good backup program. A backup program will then burn only the changed files each time you run it, saving time and money. Just keep the backup discs in a safe place.

, There's nothing worse than browsing for a file in a pile of other files with names like ""word.doc"" or ""presentation.pdf."" Make sure you describe the file properly while saving it so that your future self can find it while drunk and/or asleep. Make it searchable, make it sortable. The ultra-geek can use a file naming convention that adds the date of creation to the file name for easy file viewer sorting. i.e. 20140514MyWikiHowUpdate.bs then when you're in an alphabetically sorted list, the older files with the same name will be ordered in a logical manner.

, You have this system for a reason! Don't just throw all of your files in the same old spot, put them in the correct folder as soon as you create or obtain them. If things get out of hand, take an hour out of your day to re-organize everything. It's worth the time.

, Many of the available download sites will include product details that will help users plan for how they will utilize Pivot for projects.


Make sure that Pivot matches the operating system of your computer and that the workstation that will download the software meets all of the other requirements for the program's operation. A majority of computers will accommodate the relatively small demands of the Pivot freeware, but some older machines may not be able to run this program.

Ask yourself if you would benefit from the following file compression program uses:


Save money.,
Search for file compression program reviews online.,
Read over the program features, including cost and ease of use.

,
Determine if the cost of the program is worth the benefit you would get from using it, and if you are willing to put the necessary effort into learning how to use a program to create and unzip ZIP files.

",How to Decide if You Need a File Compression Program," Instead of spending money on flash drives, disks and extra computer memory in order to store all of your data, you can compress files and store information in much less space.
Transmit files faster over a slower Internet connection. If you have a slow Internet connection and you've ever tried to download a video or image from the Internet, you know that it can take a considerable amount of time and can sometimes even freeze your operating system up, making it impossible to use your computer during the download.
Manage and organize archives. If you have a lot of data that you want to store, but that you know you won't be using for a long time, creating ZIP files and storing and/or transferring them all to one place is a great way to manage your data and your space.
Preserve hard disk space. If you must download and store a bulk of information, it will take up your computer's memory and eventually result in a slow-moving, inefficient operating system. Using a file compression program frees up your computer's memory by preserving much-needed hard disk space.
Send large amounts of information via email. Email programs often have limits regarding the amount of data you can attach and send in 1 email message. Attaching ZIP files allows you to send much more data via email, and at a faster rate.;
, There are several websites that provide a side-by-side comparison of the numerous programs available.

Removing the copy protection from DVDs that you do not own is illegal in most countries.

, Run MakeMKV. Select your DVD drive from the Source pulldown menu in MakeMKV.

, DVDs are often broken down into several “titles”. These titles include things like previews, menus, bonus features, and the actual movie. Uncheck the boxes for any content that you don’t wish to copy.


Titles less than 2 minutes will be automatically unselected. This will remove most previews from your finished rip.

, This is where the finished file will appear after it is done being ripped.

, Once you have selected all of the settings that you want, click the Make MKV button. This will begin the ripping process. The time that it takes is dependent on the speed of your DVD drive. The average time to rip a DVD movie is about 15-30 minutes., MakeMKV creates an MKV file that contains all of the video and audio information. This file will be as large as the DVD was. MKV files do not work in iTunes or Windows Media Player, but can be played using the free VLC Player.


MKV files are lossless files. This means that the image and audio quality is retained from the original source.

, If you want to add the video to your iTunes library, or play it on your iDevice, you will need to convert and compress it to MP4 format. You can do this using HandBrake, a free conversion program. Converting the video will also reduce the size, allowing you to store more videos on your hard drive. Converting will result in a loss of quality.

, Once the file has been converted to MP4, you can burn it to a DVD to watch anywhere. There are programs available online that will allow you to burn the MKV file to DVD as well.

Find the correct software.,
Upload your image files.,
Follow the instructions.",How to Convert Pictures to JPEG or Other Picture File Extensions2," For the most common file conversions, default image editors can usually do the job. If not you can search the internet to find the correct software to help you with your conversion. Try searching ""extensionA to extensionB"" with your specific file extensions inserted in the search query.


For instance, a search of ""doc to pdf"" or ""jpg to gif"" brings up several free online converter options.

, Most conversion services are offered free of charge and without the need for a software download. Look first for an option that instructs you to upload your image file for the conversion.

, Sometimes a conversion site will ask for your email and then email the finished file to you after the conversion is complete. Other times you may be able to wait a few moments and then download the file directly.


Be wary of websites asking for payment or for an excess of personal details in order to convert your files - remember that many free resources exist and you shouldn't have to give more than your email address in the majority of cases.

This is typically a good idea if the current file extension is preventing you from accessing the file's contents (indicated by an error message like ""invalid file format"").


Your computer uses file extensions as shorthand to understand what software to use when opening files. Be cautious about changing these extensions manually and always back up your file before attempting.This method can reduce image quality. Using the image editing software ""Save As"" method is generally preferable., Depending on your settings, file extensions (the 3 letters following the dot in your filename) may not be visible within your standard file view. In Windows, you need to adjust the ""View"" tab under ""Folder options"". This is located under ""Appearance and Personalization settings"". On a Mac look for ""Advanced Finder Preferences"" to make extensions appear.

Download an alternative compression program for files larger than 4 GB.,
Adjust your compression settings.,
Split a large compressed file into multiple smaller files.",How to Compress Large Files2," The built-in compression software on most operating systems will cap out at 4 GB of data in a single ZIP file. If you need to compress a file that's larger than that, you'll need to download and install a third-party compression program.


Keep in mind that if you're sharing your compressed files, the recipient will need a program that can open the type of file you create.
7-Zip is one of the most popular open-source options for Windows. You can download it for free from 7-zip.org/download.html.
WinRAR is a powerful paid program for Windows and Mac that can perform very efficient compression.
Archiver is one of the most popular Mac compression programs that allows you to create archives in 7-Zip and RAR format, as well as its own proprietary format.;
, With their default settings, 7-Zip and WinRAR will typically compress more efficiently than your operating system's built-in compression software. You can increase the compression even more by adjusting some settings.



7-Zip - Right-click on the file or folder you want to compress and select ""7-Zip"" → ""Add to archive"". In the ""Add to Archive"" menu, you can set your compression options. Note that increasing compression levels can significantly increase the time it takes to compress. For maximum compression, set ""Compression level"" to ""Ultra"". Set the ""Dictionary size"" to a value ten times lower than your available memory. A larger dictionary means better compression, but the memory requirements are ten times the dictionary size. Set ""Solid Block size"" to ""Solid"" for the best compression.WinRAR - Right-click on the file or folder you want to compress and select ""Add to archive"" with the WinRAR logo. Note that increasing compression levels can significantly increase the time it takes to compress. In the General tab, select ""Best"" from the ""Compression method"" drop-down menu. Ensure ""Dictionary size"" is set to ""5096 KB"". Check the ""Create solid archive"" box. Click the Advanced tab and then the Compression button. Set ""Text compression"" to ""Auto"".

Archiver - Archiver doesn't have as many settings as its Windows counterparts, but you can set the compression level when creating an archive. Note that increasing compression levels can significantly increase the time it takes to compress.

, One of the benefits of using a third-party compression program is the ability to create a multi-part archive. For example, you could take a 12 GB folder and split it into three smaller files that could each fit onto a DVD. You'll need all of the parts to extract the original files, so make sure you don't lose any of them.



7-Zip - When in the ""Add to Archive"" menu, you can use the ""Split to volume"" drop-down menu to select from a variety of preset sizes. You can also type in a custom size. Each part will be the size you designated, with the last part being whatever is left over.

WinRAR - In the General tab of the ""Archive name and parameters"" menu, use the ""Split to volumes, size"" drop-down menu to select the size you want each part to be. You can also type in custom sizes, and use the second drop-down menu to designate the unit (byte, kilobyte, megabyte, etc.). Each part will be the size you designated, with the last part being whatever is left over.

Archiver - Click the ""Split"" button in the Archiver menu after adding a file. Set the size that you want each part to be. You can then set the compression settings for the file.

Understand what can be compressed.,
Understand the difference between ""lossless"" and ""lossy"" compression.,
Open the image in the editor of your choice.,
Click ""File"" → ""Export As"".,
Select your desired format from the ""Type"" menu.,
Set your quality options (if possible).",How to Compress Large Files4," Most images that you download online are already compressed. The file formats .jpg, .gif, and .png are all forms of compression, and further compression will lead to a sharp decrease in quality. Compression for images is most useful if you are working with images directly from a digital camera or .bmp files.


It is not possible to uncompress a compressed image. You should always save the compressed version as a separate file so that you don't lose the original.

, There are essentially two types of compression for images: ""lossless"" and ""lossy"". Lossless compression is for cases where you need an exact replication of the original, and is typically used for drawings, diagrams, and medical imaging. Lossy compression is for cases where a drop in quality won't be noticed as much, and is most commonly used for photographs.


.gif, .tiff, and .png are all lossless formats.
.jpg is the most common lossy format for images.

, Nearly all image editors support compression by allowing you to save the image as a different file format. When you choose a compressed format, you'll be given options to determine how much compression to use.


Photoshop, GIMP, and even Paint allow you to save image files as compressed formats. Virtually any image editing program will work, though some will give you more quality options than others.

, This will allow you to save a copy of the original image using a new format.


If you're using Paint or another basic image editor, you will need to use the ""Save As"" option instead.

, The format you choose has a lot to do with the nature of the image.If you're compressing a photograph, select .jpg as your format.
If you're compressing an image with less than 256 colors, select .gif as your format.
If you're compressing a screenshot, a drawing or comic, or any other non-natural image, select .png.
If you're compressing an image with layers that you want to preserve, select the .tiff format (note that .tiff format isn't necessarily considered compression)., Image editors like Photoshop and GIMP will ask you to select your quality and compression settings after clicking the Export button. You can typically use a slider to adjust the compression or quality.


Increasing compression (decreasing quality) will result in a much smaller file size, but will add a lot of artifacts and change the color of the image. You may need to play with the options to find a good tradeoff between quality and size.

Norton Ghost will convert the remaining free space on the new drive into the same partition as the cloned disk. This means that any extra space left over after copying the disk will be available for the operating system to use without having to create a new partition.







, From the main menu, select Ghost Advanced, and then click the Clone button.


Set your source drive. This is the drive that you are copying FROM. Double check to make sure that you have the right drive selected, otherwise you may copy the blank hard drive to your old one, overwriting all of your data.






Set your destination drive. This is the drive you are copying TO. This is the drive that you just installed. You can see the model and size of each selection below the frame.






Click Next to get to the summary. This will be your last chance to ensure that your settings are correct before the cloning process starts. When you are ready, click Run Now. Your system will reboot and Ghost will load in DOS.






Wait for the cloning process to finish. Depending on how much data you are copying, this could take quite some time. After the cloning is complete, your system will reboot again and Windows will load. You can verify that the drive was cloned by opening My Computer and checking the new drive.






At this point you are still running off of your old drive. To start running off of your new drive, proceed to Step 6, Burn the HDClone image file to a CD so that you can boot from it. When you boot from the CD, a DOS interface will load.


Use the arrow keys/mouse click to set your Source disk. The Source disk is the hard drive that you are copying FROM.






Use the arrow keys/mouse click to set your Destination disk. The Destination disk is the hard drive you are copying TO. Double check that you have the correct drives selected so that you don’t accidentally copy over your old data with the blank disk.






Confirm options. Use advanced options for safer copying/cloning.






Click on start to start cloning process and wait for the cloning process to complete. This can take a significant amount of time, especially if your hard drives are large. Once the process is complete, your new drive will have an exact copy of the old drive, and the rest of the space will be unallocated.






If you want to append that unallocated space onto the partition that Windows XP is on, use Partition Magic. Otherwise you can create a new partition with it to use as storage.
Note that you can copy entire disk to disk including all partitions and you can also copy single partition to new disk. Your new disk should be of larger size than your current disk/partition. Extra space will be left UN-partitioned and you can partition that later according to your requirements.



, Once you’ve verified that the cloning process has been successful, power down your computer and remove your old hard drive entirely. Make sure that your jumper settings are set correctly on the new drive.

, Ensure that everything boots normally and functions as it should. If your hard disk is not detected, make sure that your jumper settings are set to Master on the hard drive. Once you know that everything is working OK, you can put the old drive back in and format it.


You may be asked to reactivate your copy of Windows. This will not always happen, but if it does, simply call the number provided and Microsoft will provide you with a reactivation code over the phone.






If you are cloning the drive to put it into a new computer, you will have to perform a repair install of Windows XP in order for everything to function correctly. When doing this, you will have to call Microsoft to obtain a reactivation key.

Export the file.",How to Compress Large Files5," Most audio files that you download from the internet, such as .mp3 or .aac files, are already compressed. Further compression of these types of files will typically result in a poor-sounding file. Compression is best suited for uncompressed formats such as .wav or .aiff.

, This is a free, open-source audio editing program that is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can download it from audacity.sourceforge.net/.

, You may be prompted to copy the file into your Audacity project; this will help prevent you from saving over the original.

, This isn't recommended for music or anything with essential stereo effects, but for spoken voice or other recordings that don't require high-fidelity, switching to mono (single-track) can make the file significantly smaller.


Click the ▼ next to the file's name in the project area. Select ""Split to Mono"" from the menu.

, This will open a window allowing you to set where you want the file to be saved, as well as the format you want to use.

, All of the formats listed in the ""Save as type"" menu are a form of compression, except .wav and .aiff. The format you choose depends on your requirements.


.mp3 is the most common format for music, as it allows for good compression without too much noticeable quality loss. it is also compatible with virtually any device.
.flac is a lossless form of compression. It is good if you intend to playback the audio through a high-quality sound system, but it is not compatible with many devices. .flac will also not lead to a drastic reduction in file size.

, After you've chosen your format, click the Options... button. The options available will vary depending on the format you selected.


For .mp3, a lower bitrate will result in a smaller file but will reduce the quality of the audio. 128 Kbps is about equivalent to the audio quality of FM radio, while 320 Kbps is about equivalent to a CD.

, If you made the file mono, you will be asked to confirm that you want to proceed. Audacity will convert and compress the audio, and the new file will appear at the location you specified.If you are making an /mp3 file and don't have the Lame codec, you'll be prompted to download it. Follow the instructions on the page to download and install the Lame codec. You may need to restart the Export process.

Understand the difference between online storage and online backup services.,
Check the security of the service.,
Set up a schedule.",How to Back up a Computer6," Online storage is a growing field, allowing users to back up their data to remote servers. Incorporating online backups into your backup routine can help make sure your backups are redundant, and will allow you to access your backed up files from anywhere you have an internet connection. There are a variety of services, both free and paid, that offer a wide range of features:


BackBlaze - Offers unlimited storage for a small fee per month.
Carbonite - One of the more established online backup services, Carbonite offers unlimited storage for a monthly fee. Carbonite is known for their automated backup solutions.
SOS Online Backup - Another older player in the backup game, SOS offers unlimited storage for all accounts.

, Services like Google Drive, SkyDrive (OneDrive), and DropBox all offer online storage, but they require you to manually keep them updated. Files are synced between all devices running that account, which means that if the file is deleted on the backup server, it is deleted on all your connected devices! These services also do not offer robust file versioning, which means retrieving an older version of a file can be difficult or impossible.


You can certainly use these services as a means of free storage, but they are not powerful enough to truly be called ""backup services"". You will have to maintain your backup manually.

, Any online backup service worth their salt should encrypt all files that are transmitted to and from their servers. They may have access to metadata, such as folder names and file sizes, but the actual content of your data should be unreadable to anyone but you.


Many services use private keys to encrypt your data. This means that it is highly secure, but you will lose access to it if you forget your password. In cases such as this, passwords are irretrievable and the data is lost.

, Nearly all online backup solutions come with software or a browser interface that allows you to set what is being backed up and how often. Set a schedule that works for you. If you are frequently making changes to files, you may want to backup every night. If you don't use your computer that often, a weekly or monthly schedule might work better.


Try to schedule your backup for a time that you are not using your computer. Backups can take up a significant amount of bandwidth and computer resources.

iPhone (aka iOS) is known for its ease of use, security, and clean integration with other Apple products.
Android is associated with its integration of Google services, its ability to be customized, and a lower cost.
Windows Phones are less common, but emphasize integration with Microsoft products and offer high end camera software on certain models.
If you can, try demoing a device at a store. That will give you a good sense of the interface and feel of each operating system.;
, iOS phones (iPhones) are typically more expensive than their Android counterparts. Among phone manufacturers, Apple and Samsung are typically among the most expensive (with models ranging from $400-$700 retail), while HTC, LG, and Motorola tend to produce lower cost options (some low end smartphones can be acquired for under $100).


Phones are subsidized when purchased along with a phone carrier contract or sometime even ""free"" upon signing. This usually commits you to a 2-year billing plan for the carrier and includes penalties for early cancellation.
Some carriers also charge a monthly ‘device fee’ to make up for little or no upfront cost on your smartphone.

, If you already own a tablet or computer, you will experience the best level of integration with its services and software by getting a phone with matching developer support (for example, Apple computers and iPads are often cross-compatible with iPhone apps). Nevertheless, note that any phone can connect to, and function with, almost any computer operating system.


If you are a heavy MS Office or Google user, you will have the best integration and support using an Android phone (although note that both Microsoft and Google produce their most popular apps for the competing operating system as well).

, Each operating system has some proprietary features, while basic features like email, web browsing, and maps will be available on all systems.


iOS/iPhone has exclusive features like Siri, fingerprint scanning, FaceTime chat, and iCloud support.
Android has Google Now, homescreen widgets for customization, and allows third party app installation (meaning you can download programs from the internet and install them outside of the Play Store ecosystem). Most Android phones today also have fingerprint sensors, cloud storage for pictures, and support the use of Google Drive for documents and cloud storage.
Windows Phone uses Cortana for voice activation, has “Live Tiles” homescreen customization, and incorporates Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF options.

, Many popular applications (e.g. Google Maps, MS Office, and Apple Music) are offered across all operating systems, however there are some apps (e.g. iMessage, Facetime, and Google Now) that are exclusive to their respective platform. Check the app store associated with each option to make sure the apps you want are accessible (Apple, Google Play, Windows).


In general, if a popular app is not offered on a competitor's operating system, there is a strong chance that an alternate app exists which is functionally quite similar.
iOS and Android historically have much broader app support than Windows.
Your app purchases are linked with your store account. You will be able to transfer your purchases to any future phones as long as they use the same operating system., For most people, the deciding factor will be personal preference. Those looking for a simple interface and a secure system will tend to like iOS-backed iPhones, while those looking for more custom options and lower cost in general will likely prefer Android or Windows phones.

, Most carriers will offer a range of phone options across operating systems (no OS is specific to a carrier). Major carriers often subsidize phones or offer different payment plans and contract combinations to reduce the up-front cost of smartphones.


Some carriers, like T-Mobile, allow you to forego a contract while paying off the phone as part of your monthly costs. Cancelling your service early will force you to pay the remainder of the phone’s costs at once.
Unlocked phones are phones purchased outside of a carrier and thus not linked with a phone service contract. They are more expensive but allow you much more flexibility if you ever need to switch phone carriers.
If buying an unlocked phone, make sure to doublecheck that the model is compatible with your specific carrier’s network. Most carriers have a webpage where you can check compatibility with your phone model's ID information, (for instance Verizon, or AT&T).

, Phone service carriers will usually offer a wide range of prepaid monthly plan options for phone minutes, texts, and data over the cellular network.


You may be able to cut monthly costs by not purchasing a data plan at all, but this means you won't be able to access the internet from your phone if not on wifi.

, Screen size is measured corner to corner diagonally. Ultimately, screen size is a matter of preference. Smaller screen phones may fit better in your pocket and are often cheaper. Larger displays may be preferable if you plan to watch a lot of videos.


iPhone offers the “SE” series for compact phones and the “Plus” series for an extra large screen.
Android phones come in a wide range of sizes: there are smaller budget models such as Moto G or Galaxy S Mini, higher end models like the Galaxy S or the HTC One series, and oversized models like Galaxy Note or Nexus 6P.
Nokia offers Windows phone models ranging from 4-6 inch screens.

, Newer phones are typically faster and more powerful than their respective older versions but will come at a higher cost. In particular, older model phones will have a more difficult time running modern applications.


For the budget-conscious, a good compromise is to wait for a new model of your desired smartphone to become available and to then take advantage of a drop in price of the other models. When a new phone model premieres interest in older models will immediately go down and the price will often change to reflect that.
Regardless of your choice, understand that technology moves very quickly and that newer phone models will continue to appear. Eventually every smartphone will seem old or obsolete.

, A phone's storage (usually listed in gigabytes or GB) is a measure of how many files (photos, videos, apps) it can store at any one time. Storage space strongly affects the price of the smartphone so consider how much you're likely to need before settling on a phone model.


For example, storage space is the only difference between a 16GB iPhone 6 and 32GB iPhone 6,
16GB is estimated to hold about 10,000 pictures or 4000 songs -- but keep in mind that your phone storage must also accommodate all your downloaded apps.Some Android phones (but not all) support storage expansion with the purchase of a microSD card. iPhones do not support storage expansion after purchase.

, Although smartphones are known for taking high-quality photos in general, actual picture quality will vary quite a bit between brands and models. The best way to measure camera quality in a phone is to search for sample pictures online taken with that smartphone model or to demo the camera yourself.


While manufacturers often advertise a camera's megapixel count, features like ISO, low-light performance, brightness, and noise reduction are equally if not more important to consider.
Most modern smartphones come equipped with front and rear-facing cameras and flash, and will support third party add-ons (such as lens attachments).
iPhones are well known for their high quality camera hardware/software.
The Lumia 1020 Windows Phone is designed specifically for heavy camera use.

, Battery technology is improving steadily so newer phones tend to have longer battery life, however your usage habits are what really dictate how long the battery lasts. Talking on the phone, gaming, and using phones outside of wifi range will all drain a battery more quickly.


Average smartphone battery life can range anywhere from 8-18 hours.Most flagship Android models will not support replaceable batteries. iPhones do not support replaceable batteries on any model.
Some newer Android phones utilize a quick charge technology to help recharge their large batteries faster (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S series or Motorola Droid Turbo series). Manufacturers claim phones with quick charge can achieve 50% charge in about 30 minutes."

Get a new battery.",How to Increase Your Battery Life on Your Smartphone," If your device is 4G capable, it will use it if you're not on Wi-Fi. Turning 4G off while on Wi-Fi will save loads of battery and even data if that's a concern for you.


For Android, go to settings, find mobile data, and slide the switch to off.
For iOS, you can turn off any network connection by going to your control Centre and turning on Airplane Mode.;
, Bluetooth and GPS are two of the bigger battery hogs, and should be off if you're not using them. If you are, be sure to have your phone charging otherwise your battery life will sink like a stone.

, If you have a Super AMOLED display (found on most Samsung and Motorola devices) be sure to keep the brightness down or on auto.


Setting your wallpaper to black will also help. (If a color is true black on a Super AMOLED display, those pixels will turn off, saving that much battery.)
Simply keeping your phone off will help loads, you don't need to check Facebook every 5 seconds.

, Task managing is important, it keeps the processor from having to work overtime for no reason and drain your battery even more.


iOS: Double-click the home button, then press and hold on any app and click the minus button in the corner to clear that app from memory.
Android 4.0+: If you have a task managing app on Android 4.0+, get rid of it! Android 4.0 has evolved into a great task manager all by itself and third party task managing apps will actually drain more battery than they will save. Press the ""Recent apps"" button then slide each task to the left or right until it disappears. If you don't have a recent apps button, press an hold the home button. Repeat often, like before locking your phone.
Android 2.3+: Download and install a third party task managing app, then follow the instructions given.

, Keep your phone charging as much as you possibly can while you're at home, so whenever you leave the house, you'll always leave with full battery. All phones now have a Lithium-Ion battery, so they won't ""overcharge"" and cause the battery to explode or catch on fire.

, Overheating is usually a sign of the processor working hard. If your phone is hot in a particular area, sandwich that area between the palms of your hands for a moment, or put it in the fridge to cool for a few minutes.

, If you followed all the steps above and your battery still doesn't last very long, it may be time for a new battery. You can usually find one for your phone on Amazon, Radio Shack, Best Buy, or your local battery store.

The Start Screen of Windows Phone

Windows Phone 8.1 is one of the most stylish operating systems for smartphones.
It stands out unique with its ""vertical-scrolling"" interface of Live Tiles, each of which acts like a widget.
The Start Screen is colorful and absolutely has lesser empty space when compared to Android.
Each of the tiles is arranged properly in the form of grids, that makes it less cluttered and more organized.


The Home Screen of Android OS

Android on the other hand has a ""horizontal-scrolling"" approach.
It has more empty space when compared to Windows Phone.
Though the shortcuts and widgets are arranged in the form of grids, they seem to be more cluttered due to a large space between the rows of tiles.
There is a ""bar"" at the bottom, no matter in which tile you are.
There are customizable widgets such as a running clock, a news feed or a calendar.
In fact almost everything in Android can be changed and altered.


You may alter the shortcuts and widgets as you want, both in Android and Windows Phone, yet Android is much less stylish when compared to Windows Phone.;
, User Interfaces stand to be a good reason for the success or the failure of a project. User Interfaces ought to be user friendly and easy to access. Let us now compare the interface design between Windows Phone and Android.


Look of UI in Windows.

Windows Phone 8.1 is designed to fit the outer look of the smartphone which the user is using and the interface as a whole.
The user can choose between a ""Dark"" theme and a ""Light"" Theme.
Thus Windows Phone has a minimalistic look in the area of ""Interface"".


Conventional Interface of Android.

In Android, the look of the UI can be modified by different theme-based apps called ""LAUNCHERS"".
The traditional interface offers a black background with White and Grey lettering over it.
In case of Android smartphones, each manufacturer can put their own overlay on the manufactured phone.
Yet the stock applications seem to provide a fair, unified look.


Both Android and Windows Phone offers a similar look and feel, but the look of the Android phone depends on the manufacturer of the smartphone.

, The number of applications supported by a device matters to most people. The more the number of apps supported, the more easier the device rolls out.


Lesser availability of apps in Windows Phone

Yes! Windows Phone OS has app issues.
The number of available apps for Windows Phone 8.1 is rising day by day and includes popular ones like Facebook, Whatsapp, Instagram,etc.
Whatsapp lacks the ""voice-call"" feature when running on Windows Phone.
Windows Phone provides a native support to the Microsoft Products such as Office along with Xbox Support.


Wider range of Apps in Android

Android offers approximately 1,300,000 apps whereas Windows Phone offers only 400,000 apps.


There is a wide selection of apps in the Android Platform. So Android just has a sharp advantage of the wide range of apps.

,


Windows Phone does not bear the necessity of an Antivirus app.

The Windows Phone operating system can only be changed by OTA (over-the-air) updates released from Microsoft.
Downloads are released direct from the servers to the phone and hence there is no way that a piece of code from other source can get into the phone's core operating system.
Moreover the Windows Phone devices have a secure memory known as the ""sandbox"" memory, that is inaccessible by the third party apps which the users install.
Windows Phone is well protected from the threat of viruses.


Android has no antivirus, then you have absolutely no protection.

There are reports and statistics that malware is frighteningly common in Android devices.
Any Android Device without proper protection is sure to get infected.
To stay secure, the user must only install software from trustworthy market places (such as Google Play).
The user must also, not use very often for web-surfing and emailing for protection.


Thus if you are looking for a well reliable, well protected smartphone, then you definitely have to say hello to Windows Phone!

, The first thing that flashes in our mind when we picture a smartphone is the notification jingle that pops up. Microsoft has its ""Action Center"" and Android has its ""Notification Area""

The Action Center is similar to the notification area in Android.
It provides quick access to the notifications.
It also brings up commonly used settings under a small swipe.
The user gets a chance to choose his frequently accessed settings that can be arranged in his own order in the Action Center.


Android on the other hand had introduced the feature of ""Notification Area""ages ago.

Android has now has incorporated ""two"" notification trays on Android running tablets.
Android lacks a feature of User Customized Notification Area.


Windows Phone has a customizable action center, and so the user gets a chance to pin the frequently used settings in the area, whereas in Android all factory set settings are pinned.

, A keyboard is really difficult if you have to tap letter by letter. So the feature of auto entry was introduced. Yet users had to tap a minimum of three or four letters. The feature of gliding through the keyboard was primarily for the touch based smartphones.


Word Flow Keyboard of Windows Phone.

The Word Flow Keyboard helps the user to glide their fingers through the keys rather than tapping them.
This keyboard is a pre-built app and requires no third party apps.
Most of the languages of Windows Phone support the word flow keyboard.


The Flow keyboard on Android

Android requires third party apps such as Swype or Google Keyboard to incorporate the gliding feature.
Only selected languages are available as a third party app have the gliding feature.


Windows Phone has a stock feature of Word Flow. Hence if you are not ready to install third party apps for this feature, Windows Phone has a beat.

, Battery is the lifeline of a gadget and most users prefer a good battery, so that they don't have to attend to save the battery again and again. Moreover hard core users feel irritated to charge their gadgets once in every minute.


The battery discharge and battery saver in Windows Phone.

By statistics, when compared to Android, Windows Phone has a longer withstand capacity battery and the discharge rate is comparatively lesser.
There is a stock Battery Saver app in Windows Phone which helps the user to save battery on a larger extent.
Battery Saver can be scheduled to run, always or until next charge or when the battery is on the verge of exhaustion.


Android has a lower capacitance of batter.

The discharge rate of Android is relatively higher especially when one connects with an Internet or do high-end gaming or watch lengthy videos.
There are no stock battery saver apps in Android.
There is a battery monitor app that helps the user to tuck in the apps that is not used much frequently.


The battery life of a phone depends on the manufacturer too.Battery Saver in Windows Phone has a feature over the one in Android as it does not require the user to manually tuck in the apps. Thus for a longer battery Windows Phone has a chance.

, Its been in recent times that users tend to use multiple apps at the same time since all is under one hood. Multitasking is an effective feature in both Android and Windows, but in Windows the memory is cleared out on a time basis.

, Social networking is one of the widest oceans in which one can swim throughout.


One-Stop Windows:

Windows Phone is a beat ahead because it integrates Facebook, Outlook, and other social networking apps.
It does more than providing a contact picture and phone numbers.
Windows phone automatically updates, the user contact's latest updates making the contact list, social.


So if you are an untiring social networking person, then Windows Phone helps you a lot.

, Contact storage is a factor for those people who have a large range of contacts. Contacts are generally stored in either SIM card or on a local storage in the smartphone.


Infinite Storage from Microsoft.

Contacts, their numbers and other information which users store on the""People"" app in Windows Phone gets integrated with a Microsoft Account.
Thereby it is easy to retrieve your contacts, and their information by accessing the account through the Microsoft website.
All that a person requires is a working internet connection and a Windows Phone in hand.
Infinite Storage of contacts is offered by Microsoft to those with a Microsoft Account.

, You can send email messages to cell phones using most email clients, including Outlook and Thunderbird, as well as using nearly all web-based email services, such as Gmail and Yahoo!.

, If you are sending the message to an SMS number, make sure that you don't include any images. Try to keep the message under 140 characters.

, Don't include the country code or any punctuation.


For example, to email (123)456-7890 using T-Mobile, the address would be 1234567890@tmomail.net.

, Your recipient should receive your email message after a few moments. If they are using a smartphone, the email will appear in their SMS app as opposed to their email app.

The process for this varies depending on the email program you are using. For Gmail, click the Down arrow at the bottom-right corner of the Compose window and select ""Plain Text"". If you are suing the Outlook email client, click the Message Options tab and select the ""Plain Text"" format.

, Most cell phones can only receive messages that are 140 characters or shorter. If the message is longer, it may be broken up or may not send at all. Try keeping your messages under the 140 character limit to ensure that they are sent correctly.

The type of port will help you to determine the kind of adapter you will need, if any. Older Macs may have Mini-DVI, DVI, or Micro-DVI, which require different adapters.


Look on the back and sides of your Mac to locate and examine all the existing video ports. You can also refer to your computer user's manual to determine the names and locations of video ports.;
, If you cannot locate the video port on your TV, consult with your TV manual or with its manufacturer for further assistance. They are typically located on the back of the TV, though they may also be found on the side of the TV.


For HDTVs, the most common port is HDMI. You may also find DVI on newer TVs, as well as legacy support for VGA connections.
Older TVs may only have composite (3 plugs) connections, S-Video, or VGA.

, You will need to buy an adapter that supports the video ports on both your Mac and TV.


To connect your Mac to an HDMI port on the TV, you will need a Mini-DisplayPort-to-HDMI or a Thunderbolt-to-HDMI adapter.
If your Mac has a Mini-DisplayPort and your TV has VGA, you will need a Mini-DisplayPort-to-VGA adapter.
If your Mac and TV both have HDMI ports, you will not need any adapters, just a HDMI cable.
If you have a cable not mentioned above, or just can't seem to find one, go to your local Apple Store for assistance, as your Mac may be personalized.

, Make sure that they are long enough to reach from your adapter to the TV. You will need both the adapter and the cable in order to make the connection (unless you are connecting straight from HDMI to HDMI, in which case only the cable is necessary).

, Most adapters do not support audio signals, so you will need to get a separate audio cable. The exceptions to this are straight HDMI connects, or Mini-DisplayPorts that support audio (check your Mac’s documentation). The audio cable required will depend on the inputs on your TV.For best quality, use the optical sound port.
Not all TVs support audio coming from a different source than the HDMI signal, so you may run into audio issues if you are using an HDMI adapter and trying to use a separate audio cable.

, Each video connector on your TV is attached to an input setting on your TV. They are typically labeled so that you can easily switch to the correct one. Make sure that your TV is turned to the input connected to your Mac.

, This isn’t really required anymore, especially for HDMI connections, but it can make configuring your display a little more automatic.

, Insert your adapter into the appropriate display port on your Mac. Plug one end of your video cable into the adapter, and the other end into the correct port on the TV.


Connect the audio cable from your Mac’s headset jack to the audio input on your TV that matches your video input. This is not required for straight HDMI connections.

, In some cases, your screen will automatically appear on the TV. In other cases you may have to adjust some settings in order for it to appear. There are three main settings for displays: you can have the display span both screens, duplicated (mirrored) across both screens, or have only one screen active (either the laptop or the TV).To adjust the settings, open System Preferences by clicking on the Apple menu, and then select Displays.
Select the Arrangement tab. In the arrangement section, you can choose the way you want your display configured.

, Oftentimes, your computer's resolution and your TV’s resolution will be different. This is especially true with older TVs. Open System Preferences and then select Display. Select the display that you want to change the resolution for.


Most HDTVs can display up to 1920 x 1080, though some are limited to 1280 x 720. Both of these resolutions have a 16:9 (widescreen) aspect ratio.
If you don't see a recognizable image, you may have to disconnect your laptop temporarily and adjust your resolution before reconnecting your laptop to your TV. If you are switching between one active display, your laptop will need to have the same resolution as your TV.

, Some TVs will attempt to compensate for different aspect ratios by zooming the image. If you find that your screen is cut off around the edges when you are viewing on the TV, check your TVs settings to make sure that it is not zoomed in.

Talk to your mom when she is in a good mood.,
Tell your mother when it's just you and her.,
Practice telling by writing down what you plan on saying.,
Stress the positives.,
Have a photo or social media profile handy.,
Avoid keeping it a secret.",How to Tell Your Mom About Your Boyfriend1," Choose the best time to break the news. Don’t have the talk when she has just gotten home from work or is preoccupied with something else. You want to have her whole attention, and you want her to be receptive. At the same time, find a balance between telling her promptly without springing it on her.You don’t want to go weeks or months without telling her you have your first boyfriend, but you shouldn’t just show up with him saying, “Hey mom, meet my new boyfriend!” Have a one-on-one conversation first.
It’s wise to tell her when she’s not already bothered by something you did. If you’ve just done something irresponsible or immature, or just got in trouble for something, she might conclude that you’re not mature enough for a relationship.;
, If you live with both of your parents, but you’ve decided you’re most comfortable talking only to mom at first, choose a time when your father is out of the house. Go with a time that he’s at work, or out for a few hours running errands. Alternatively, go out with your mom to grab a coffee or lunch outside of the house.


It’s usually a good idea to tell both your parents at once, but there are plenty of situations where telling your mom first is more comfortable.Sometimes, fathers can be more protective when it comes to first boyfriends, some can be more resistant if you’re coming out as gay, and some can be less tolerant if your boyfriend is of another race or religion.

, Think about what you want to say, and how to say it in a mature way. Your goal should be to be clear, direct, and honest, and you don’t want to get flustered or whine. Consider writing down your main points, especially if you think you might lose track or get tongue-tied.While it’s great to plan and practice by writing down your thoughts, you should definitely break the news face-to-face.
Try writing the main points, like: ""Mom, I feel like we have a close relationship and I don't want to keep things from you. My friend Jerry asked me to be his girlfriend a couple weeks ago and I said yes. We're in the same grade and he's a really nice and smart guy.""
Jot down some points to bring up if her response isn't the one you want. Say, ""I thought you might not think I'm ready, but I wanted to mention that I'm become a really mature person. I'm active at school, I keep my grades up, and I get all my chores done before you have to tell me. I don't think I'm going to marry him or anything, but I think I'm ready for my first boyfriend and definitely want to talk about your ground rules and ask your advice.""

, When you have the conversation, don’t begin with all the negatives, especially if your family wants you to date a certain type of person or has any sort of strict expectations. Don’t start off by saying, “Well he’s really hot but he gets detention all the time and his grades are terrible!” Focus on both your positive attributes and those of your boyfriend.Do you have good grades? Are you a leader at school or in after-school activities? How else are you mature or responsible?
These are traits that your parents will want to see in you before you get a boyfriend, so be sure to work hard in school, do your chores, and show your parents how responsible you are.
Similarly, try to say as many positive things about him as possible. Show your mom that she can trust your judgment. Try telling her nice things he does for you, how he well he treats you, how sweet he is, what his talents are, and other good things about him.
Considering his positive attributes can also help you decide if he’s worthy of your time. If you can’t honestly list lots of positive things about him to your mom, he’s probably not the best for you.

, Unless she’s completely resistant to the idea of you having a boyfriend, she’ll probably want to know more about him. Be ready to share a picture of him so she knows what he looks like, or show her his social media profile so she can learn a little bit about him.


Remember, don’t just assume that she’ll freak out, especially if you’re well into your teenage years or on the verge of becoming a young adult. She might be overjoyed and want to gush about him with you!While it’s natural to be shy, and want to keep your personal life private, in most cases you do have to share information about your boyfriend with your parents., Remember that your mom was young once, and you shouldn’t just assume that she’ll react negatively. Your parents will always find out something that you’re hiding from them, so keeping it a secret is not the best idea. Be sure to answer any questions about him truthfully.If you want to show your mom that you’re mature enough for a boyfriend, you have to earn her trust. Keeping secrets will just harm the trust you have in one another.Don’t lie about when you first started dating. Try to be honest about as many details as possible. You don’t want to get caught in a lie, such as when your anniversary is, later on down the line!

Tell your mom that you’re gay.,
Consider when coming out isn’t a good idea.,
Tell your mom that your boyfriend is a different race or religion.,
Consider holding off if you foresee bad consequences.,
Tell your mom your boyfriend has a checkered past but has changed.",How to Tell Your Mom About Your Boyfriend2," If you are gay, have a boyfriend, and would like to tell your mom about him, do it when you’re ready. No one should force you to come out if you’re not ready to do so. While it a can be a great experience and take lots of pressure off, it’s okay to be nervous, especially if you’re not sure how your mom will react.Don’t allow your boyfriend to pressure you into coming out. The most important aspect of coming out is doing it when you’re ready.
If you’re ready, do it calmly and be direct, honest, and clear. Tell her that you have a boyfriend and care very much about him, and that you understand that sexuality can change but right now you are definitely attracted to him.
Be patient as she processes the news, especially if she didn’t expect to hear that you have a boyfriend. Say, “I know this is a big adjustment and takes some time to think about. Believe me, it’s taken me a lot of time to process, I get it!”

, Sometimes, coming out of the closet isn’t the best idea. Consider how your parents react to homosexuality in the news, such as when issues like same-sex marriage or bullying come up in conversation. You might want to hold off if they both have very negative reactions, or if you are financially dependent on them and think there’s a chance they might kick you out of the house or stop paying your school tuition. If you find that your mom is generally more accepting and want to tell her, ask her for advice on how and when to come out to your father or other family members.

, With the world becoming smaller and more interconnected, dating more frequently crosses past boundaries of race, religion, and customs. Try to explain this fact if your mom or both parents expect your boyfriend to be of a particular race, religion, or culture.Try not to keep your cross-cultural relationship a secret, whether you’re a teenager or a grown adult. What if years pass and you and your boyfriend get engaged? Further, you don’t want to create any more negative feelings by making your mom feel like she can’t trust you or your boyfriend.Don’t use your boyfriend as a means of rebelling against your own culture. That’s not fair to him, and ends up covering over the tensions that you might have with your traditions.
When telling your mother about a cross-cultural relationship, be compassionate and patient. Give your mom time to process, and give her the benefit of the doubt rather than forcing her to give her approval.

, Like coming out of the closet, consider times when breaking the news about your cross-cultural relationship might not be appropriate. While it's often best to be honest, if you have serious concerns about your safety, your boyfriend’s safety, or think you’ll be disowned, consider holding off on breaking the news.Try to balance your concerns with having faith in your mom. Try to gauge her reactions to friends or family members in similar relationships.
If you believe your mom would be accepting but your father would not, ask her for advice about how to break the news to him.
If you’re with someone who treats you well and makes you happy, don’t let your mother, or your father, force you to take sides. State clearly to her that this is a more interconnected world, and that people date across boundaries now.

, It can be delicate if you're getting back with an ex, or there are things in your boyfriend's past you'd rather not tell your mom. If you're trying to convince her that your boyfriend has changed his ways, try to be objective and share facts with her. Don't match her criticisms of your boyfriend by criticizing her, but just explain how his actions show that he's making real changes.Try saying, ""I know that you thought Jerry was a loser, but since we broke up he's really been making some positive changes. He got a good job and he's held it down for over six months now, and he has an apartment and is saving up for a new car. He told me he wants to get his act together so that I might think about getting back together with him.""
If you're a young adult and know there are things about your boyfriend your mom wouldn't like at all, consider all aspects of the situation. If you're just dating a guy for a few weeks and know it's not going anywhere, you might not want to tell mom about the guy you're casually dating who has 8 piercings and full sleeve tattoos.Remember that your mom is looking out for your best interests. If she doesn't approve of your boyfriend, consider if she has good reasons. You might be better off not getting back with that ex, or ditching the guy who has too much baggage. Trusting mom's instincts could end up saving you heartache in the future.

Give her time to process the news.,
Tell her that you value her opinion and experience.,
Try to avoid having an argument about it.,
Accept her response, even if she says no.,
Try to understand her perspective if she says no.",How to Tell Your Mom About Your Boyfriend3," Be patient after you tell her the news, whether you’re telling her about your first boyfriend, are coming out, or are telling her about a boyfriend who might not meet her expectations. Don’t just break the news then get up and walk away: wait for her to reply and give feedback.


If she tells you that she needs a minute to think, by all means give her some time alone if necessary.
Show her that you want to compromise and help her become comfortable with your relationship, such as by hearing her ground rules. If she’s uneasy or on the fence, ask her what her rules would be as far as when you see him or whether you can be alone together., Show her that her experience and wisdom is important to you. Explain that you want her to trust you with these sort of things and value her advice, which is why you're telling her about him. Explain that you are growing up and it is only natural to want a boyfriend.Ask her about her own experiences with dating, sex, health, and other relationship matters.
Don’t save all the details about your personal life for one momentous conversation.
Do you best to open up communications between you and your mom, both before and after you have a talk about the boyfriend.
Explain to her that honesty and being able to trust each other is vital to you. Try to break the ice and work on having open, non-judgmental conversations on a regular basis.

, If she gets angry, don’t turn it into a screaming match. Do your best to stay cool, even if she gets upset and starts yelling. Remember that you she is there to protect you and only wants the best for you. If her reaction isn’t the one you were hoping for, you have to keep your cool and think before you speak.She might have a good reason for disapproving. You might actually be too young for a relationship, or he might not be the best guy for you. Remember that she has more life experience than you.
If you’re a teenager or young adult and truly believe that you are ready for a relationship, your goal should be to prove to her that you are becoming mature enough to make some of your own decisions.

, Taking a tantrum if she says you can’t have a boyfriend will only prove to your mom that you’re not ready for a relationship. Respect the way that she wants to raise you. Remember, she's only here to protect you.Reacting in an understanding and calm way will show her your maturity level. If she can see that you’re growing up and becoming more mature, she'll come around eventually.

, Show your mom that you value her point of view and want to know more about it. Try not to ask questions just to get your way, but to demonstrate that you want to understand her and get on the same page.If she says you’re not old enough, try asking, “How old do you think is the right age? How old were you? Do you think the differences between now and when you were growing up affect the age someone should start having relationships?”
If she just doesn’t approve of the boy, ask why. Remember that your mom is usually the one person in the world who is completely devoted to your best interests. Ask, “Why don’t you think he’s the right guy for me? Did you date someone like him and have a bad experience?”

Realize that other people probably mean well.,
Tell the gossipers that they have no basis for their rumors.,
Go along with their teasing.,
Be circumspect and considerate of your friend.,
Plan the response with your friend.,
Smile and move on.",How to Respond When Asked About Dating a Friend1," Everyone loves a romantic ending and some people are inclined to place pressure on others to achieve this. As such, don't see these comments as insults. Just think of it as you two having so much in common, it's why you guys are best friends and it's probably why other people think you would also make great romantic buddies too.;
, Explain that you're not about to ruin a really good friendship for a romantic entanglement. Tell them you're just not interested. Then drop the subject.


Tell the truth. Say you aren't dating, and there are no plans for that in the near future. Don't go into excessive details, just say the bare facts.
Turn attention away from you. If you've tried everything else and this rumor just won't die out, try to focus the public's attention on something else. A new couple was started in your grade/department? Your sports team had a huge victory or loss? Draw attention to that.

, Turn the whole thing back on them as if you're treating it as a joke and let them wonder but confirm nothing. For instance, you could say something like, ""of course we look good together, best buds always do!"", or something along those lines.


Keep a sense of humor! If you are really upset about the rumors, everyone will think they are true. If you laugh them off, (without also making fun of your friend) then people will see the rumor is silly and won't believe it anymore.

, Don't let loose a secret reason why the two of you can't date in order to turn away the uncomfortable focus. For example, if your guy friend is gay or likes someone else, it is not your place to say that. It might turn away the uncomfortable situation, but the broken friendship will hurt you a lot more.

, If your ""dating"" has turned into a widespread rumor, talk about your battle plan with your friend. It will make you closer in a sticky time when you may be tempted to separate for the sake of avoiding uncomfortable situations.

, If people refuse to leave you alone, despite telling them that you don't like your friend romantically, then just smile and move on. They keep talking about you because you are both obviously amazing people who stand out from the crowd!

Don't make assumptions.,
Talk to supportive family first.,
Talk to your parents or other closed-minded family members.,
Try framing it as advice-seeking.,
Stay calm.,
Prepare responses to common objections.,
Be prepared to explain.,
Prepare yourself for consequences.",How to Tell Your Family You Are Dating Outside Your Race1," You may know from experience that your family will not be supportive, but more often this is a ""gray area"" in families because it is not frequently discussed. Jumping to conclusions about their reactions might set you up to be overly defensive for no reason, or to be blindsided by a negative reaction.Your family may surprise you by accepting the relationship. On the other hand, some families can harbor secret biases and prejudices, and you may not realize it until you happen to be dating interracially, giving their true colors a chance to show through.
Give them the benefit of the doubt while steeling yourself for the worst. Think about how you will react in all possible scenarios, including if they ask you to end the relationship, but try not to worry too much beforehand.;
, For example, if your parents are closed-minded, talk to your siblings first. If they agree with you, they can be supportive when you break it to the parents.


If possible, recruit the support of older, well-trusted family members that your closed-minded family members respect. Maybe you have an older aunt or uncle that everyone reveres who is likely to support your relationship.
Tell your supportive family members that you are in a relationship and you would like some advice or support in telling the rest of the family. Then, tell them your new partner is another race and you're not sure how the rest of your family will react to the news.

, You can choose if you want to make a big deal out of the conversation by telling them you need to talk about something important in advance, or if you would rather just bring it up more casually in conversation.


Generally, making a big deal out of any topic puts people on the defensive by making them assume the worst beforehand. Since you want your parents to be open and accepting, casually bringing it up might yield better results.
Try saying over dinner, ""Hey, did you know I have a new boyfriend?"" They are likely to ask questions about him, and you can find a way to drop in ""He's the first Asian guy I have dated.""

, Instead of dropping the news, frame it as you seeking advice from them, which flatters them and makes them feel that you value their opinion and is thus more likely to get them on your team.Try saying, ""I was wondering if you could give me some advice. I have this new girlfriend, and I like her a lot. But I think sometimes people treat us differently because she's white and I'm not. Have you ever dated someone outside our race?""

, If your parents challenge you or question why you are dating outside your race, your goal is to show them that you are mature and can handle whatever negativity they might dish out. After all, if you pursue this relationship, you are likely to encounter bias out there in the world, since many people have issues with interracial dating and marriage.Show your family you are mature enough to deal with the difficulties of a real relationship.


If a family member reacts in anger, starts yelling, or becomes overly emotional, stay calm, but don't continue the conversation. People are incapable of thinking rationally or really hearing you out if they become too emotional.
Let them know you will revisit the topic when they are not upset and you can talk about it calmly., There are several typical objections that some people have to interracial relationships, but fortunately there are also great responses. Some examples include:


""His/her family's culture is too different from ours."" You can respond to this by saying that it's possible that the cultural divide might be too great, but you will cross that bridge when you get there. You want to get to know him and his family as individuals before judging his family for their race.
""I don't like people of that race."" This objection is hard to deal with because it isn't rational. Or, your parents might have their viewpoints because of their experience with people of that race. Offer to listen while your parents explain their point of view. After you have listened to your parents reasons, you could point out that it is not fair to generalize all people of that race based on a few negative experiences. Do your best to have a reasonable discussion with your parents and avoid judging them before you have heard the whole story.
""I don't mind interracial relationships in principle, but people will treat you differently."" In truth, this objection is not wrong; many people do frown on interracial relationships and might treat you badly because of it. Tell your family member you are aware that it might be harder to have an interracial relationship, but that you and your partner are prepared to deal with social consequences for your choice.
""It's wrong to date that person because any children you might have will be treated differently."" Tell your family member that you are aware that interracial children might be treated differently, but that you would provide a supportive home and do everything you could to educate and love your child to be prepared to live in this world. You can also say that you don't intend to have children any time soon, and that you feel that you have enough time to prepare for that situation if it ever occurs.

, It’s a good idea to mentally rehearse all the things you like about your partner, so that you're prepared when your parents ask why you are dating him or her. Emphasize qualities and characteristics that you know your family would want in a partner for you, regardless of race.


For example, talk up your partner's work ethic, academic achievements, or athletic ability, or mention that he or she has great manners, makes you feel special, and treats people with kindness.

, If your parents are dead-set against letting you date outside your race, and if you are living at home and are a minor, you may have to follow your family's rules until you move out of the home. Otherwise, your family may punish you by grounding you or taking away privileges.


If your parents forbid you from dating this person, you have to decide if you will obey their wishes.

"
"
Realize that you do not need your family's approval.,
Choose your approach.,
Talk to your closest family members first.,
Be positive.,
Let your family member react.",How to Tell Your Family You Are Dating Outside Your Race2," When you've moved out of the house and are supporting yourself as an adult, you can make relationship choices that your family disapproves of with less concern for their feelings on the matter.


However, even though you don’t live at home, there can still be negative consequences if your family is not accepting. For example, they may make comments about you behind your back, treat your partner unkindly at family get-togethers, or in more extreme cases, cut you off entirely or disinherit any potential children of the relationship.
On the other hand, they may need some time to adjust to the news, but eventually come around and treat your partner with love and respect.

, Because you are not living at home, you have the luxury of putting off telling your family if you want to. You can choose to make a point to tell your family sooner rather than later, or you can let them find out when it comes up naturally (for example, on Facebook or during the holidays).


If you think they are likely to overreact in a negative way, telling them upfront can spare your partner some embarrassment if they say or do something unkind.
Otherwise, letting them find out on their own has a lot of benefits: if your relationship is not serious, it prevents unneeded drama. It also sends the message that the racial issue is not a big deal to you, and thus not worth mentioning.

, As with any important news about your life, your closest family members (like your parents or siblings) might be hurt if they find out from someone more distant like your second-cousin-once-removed.


Depending on the type of relationship you have, how often you see each other, and their anticipated reaction, it is probably best not to make a big deal of your news. Don't email and say ""We need to talk,"" which will cause them to expect something negative and prepare for the worst. Instead, drop the news in casually when you are having a normal catching-up conversation on the phone or over lunch.

, When you are discussing what's new in your life, mention your relationship. Be upbeat, and let your happiness come through. Your family members love you and want you to be happy, so when they see how happy you are with your partner, they will hopefully be happy for you too.


Say something happy but upfront, and try to include the racial element in a way that is casual but matter-of-fact: ""I'm dating Mark. He's such an amazing guy and we have so much in common. We met at the gym, and we've gone out a few times, and I really like him. I want you to meet him sometime soon. He's the first Asian guy I've dated and he's so handsome!""

, Give your family member time to respond if they want, but don't force them to comment on the racial issue.


Truly they may not care at all, and forcing them to talk about it might feel uncomfortable and unnecessary.
If they do respond, be prepared to react. Don't let your family member get away with saying anything racist or uncalled for. If they start to say something rude or racist, stop them and say, ""Listen, I realize you may have mixed feelings, but I don't want to hear anything like that about Mark.""
They may also respond with ambivalence, not knowing what to say or feel, if they did not expect that news and aren't sure how they feel about it. Their ambivalence might come from unrecognized prejudices or a worry that there will be a significant cultural divide. Unless you know for sure, don't assume the worst.

Educate yourself about racism, prejudice, and bias.,
Educate your family.,
Be direct but kind.,
Cut off a persistent racist.",How to Tell Your Family You Are Dating Outside Your Race3," It is important to know why your family members might have racially biased ideas, and how those ideas might affect their views of your relationships.


Your family members may have racial prejudices they are not even aware of, and if you accuse them of racism, they may become defensive. Often racial prejudice and bias is something we are taught from the time we are children, and it becomes such a natural part of life that we don't realize when we are acting or thinking in unfair ways.
Whether your family is a member of the racial minority or majority might make a difference in how they respond to news that you are dating interracially. Keep in mind the historic relationships between your own race and your partner's to help you understand why your family might react the way they do.
Check out this wikiHow article for more pointers on how to recognize racism and prejudice and how to deal with it.

, Older family members or those who have had little education or contact with diverse groups of people are often rather old fashioned in their mindsets, and sometimes this manifests in prejudices and biases against other races. You can help educate these family members so that they are more tolerant and loving toward people who are different from them.


Talk about race at home. The first step in educating others is to talk about race, disparities, and injustices when you see them. A lot of people have been raised to believe in a ""color-blind"" society where race is not a factor in what happens in people's lives. But in reality race matters, and people are still treated unfairly based on the color of their skin. Talking openly about race is the first step to helping other people, especially members of the racial majority, understand when racial disparities are taking place.Share news articles, books, web articles, or anecdotes about everyday occurrences. If you read an article that teaches you something, share it. If your partner faces discrimination because of race, tell your family. Post about it on Facebook. Talk about it over dinner. Don't be afraid to get involved in conversations.

, Speak up if your family members make racist remarks or jokes. You don’t have to yell or call your family member names to let them know that they have done or said something that is offensive.


Talk to the person in private if possible, and let them know why you found the joke or comment offensive.

, If a family member is unkind to your partner because of racial issues or persists in making offensive comments or jokes even if you have asked them to stop, you might have to consider whether you want to continue your relationship with that family member. Let the family member know their behavior is unacceptable and you will not tolerate it.


Especially if you have children by your interracial relationship, you must consider their emotional and mental well-being and not allow racist family members to antagonize them.

Create a new file that’s 256 x 256 pixels large.,
Show gridlines.,
Draw your icon.,
Reduce the size of your icon.,
Save your icon as an .ico file.",How to Create a Windows Icon1," An .ico file is a Windows icon file. Your Windows computer comes with Windows Paint, which will do the job. More advanced software like Photoshop and Gimp also allow you to draw icons.


If Photoshop is your drawing software of choice, you’ll need a safe, free plugin called ICO (Windows Icon Format) by Telegraphics. The plugin is available directly from the developer at http://www.telegraphics.com.au/sw/. Scroll down to ICO (Windows Icon Format), select your operating system, and choose a location to save the installer. For help installing Photoshop plugins, see How to Install Plugins in Adobe Photoshop.
You may have different drawing software than any of the above. Search the web to see if it can save .ico files. If so, you can still follow the steps, as most drawing applications are somewhat similar when it comes to these basic functions.
You can use a Mac to create Windows icons, but you’ll need to use Photoshop, Gimp, or another piece of software that works on MacOS (not Paint).;
, To open Paint, open the Start menu and select the search box. Type the word “Paint” and once the program appears in the search results, click the link. This method will work with Gimp and Photoshop as well.

, Your .ico file should be a perfect square, and It’s a good idea to start with at least a 256 x 256 pixel canvas so you can see what you’re doing. You can go larger, as long as both numbers are the same.


In Paint, click “Resize,” then select the radio button next to the word “Pixels.” Type 256 into both the Horizontal and Vertical boxes, then select “OK.”
In Photoshop, open the File menu and select “New.” Type 256 in both the Width and Height boxes and click “OK.” Select “Pixels” (not inches). You’ll see an option to set a background color—you can choose one if you wish, or select “Transparent” if you don’t want your icon to have a solid color background.In Gimp, open the File menu and select “New.” Type 256 in both the Width and Height boxes (make sure Pixels is selected). Click “Advanced Options” to see options for a background fill. If you want to set a background color, click “Fill With” and either select a color or chose “Transparency” to have no background behind your design. Click OK. , To keep your drawing symmetrical, set your image program to show a grid in the background. This grid will not show up on your icon.


Paint: Click the “View” tab and put a check next to “Gridlines.” Photoshop: Open the View menu and select “Show,” then “Grid.”Gimp: Open the View menu and select “Show Grid.”

, Choose a tool like the pen, pencil or paintbrush (in any drawing software) to begin. Each software option has a color palette with plenty of colors to choose from. You can even add text to your new icon in any of the software options by selecting the text tool from the toolbar.


Design experts recommend making icons simple, vibrant and easy to read. Remember that your icon will be much smaller when it’s on your desktop, so try not to add too many tiny words or details. It’s tough to draw a dynamic image with a mouse. For intensive drawing on a computer, you may want to try using a drawing tablet.

, First, save a copy of your icon at its current size so you can work on it again in the future. Open the file menu, click “Save as,” and choose a location for your file. Make sure you save it as a .bmp file. Now, to reduce the size on each of the three software options:


Paint: On the Home tab, click “Resize” and click the radio button next to Pixels. Set the icon size to 32 x 32 by typing 32 into both the Height and Width boxes. Click “OK.”
Photoshop and Gimp: Open the Image menu and click “Image Size” (or “Scale Image” in Gimp). Make sure “Pixels”(“px” in The Gimp) is selected in both the Height and Width dropdowns and type 32 into both boxes. Click “OK.”

, Now that you’ve finished drawing, you’re ready to save. Make sure to save to a location you’ll remember.


Paint: Open the File menu and click “Save As.” Before typing a file name, click the dropdown menu next to “Save as Type” and choose “256-color bitmap.” Next, select a folder where you’d like to save your new icon. Now, type in the name of your icon next to “file name,” giving it the file extension .ico. For example, you could call it mozillaalternate.ico.
Photoshop: Open the File menu and choose “Save as.” Select “Windows Icon File (.ico)” from the list of save options. If you don’t see it listed, make sure you installed the Telegraphics plugin. Gimp: Open the File menu and select “Save As.” Select the “Microsoft Windows Icon (.ico)” file type. Now navigate to the location where you’d like to save your icon, and then type a name for it in the “file name” box. For example, you could call it mozillaalternate.ico.

It’s a good idea to choose the largest size (such as “original size”) so your icon is of the highest quality. Windows will scale the icon to a smaller size on your desktop so there’s no need to save a tiny version of a .ico file.

, Decide on an image (any image type, as long as its supported by the program you use) to convert into an icon. Remember, icons are actually small squares, so try to pick something that will look good in a small square box. Click “File” then “Open” in any image editing software and select the image you want to work with.

, In order to display correctly, you’ll want your image to be a perfect square. We’ll also need to shrink it to a size that will work as an icon file (we’ll do 32 x 32).


Crop: If you opened a large image that’s rectangular, try using your editing software’s cropping tool to identify a square area for your icon. Crop is on the Home tab of Pant, and in the Image menu on Photoshop and Gimp.
Resize the image: In Paint, go to the Home tag and select “Resize,” uncheck “Maintain aspect ratio” and type 32 into both the “Horizontal” and “Vertical” boxes. In Photoshop and Gimp, open the Image menu and select “Image Size” in Photoshop, “Image Scaling” in Gimp. Take the check out of “Constrain proportions” and set both “Width” and “Height” to 32. Note: this may warp the image. If so, try cropping it to a more square shape first.

Follow the golden rule.,
Be kind and generous.,
Act supportive.,
Show loyalty.",How to Treat Your Friends1," Treat your friends as you would like to be treated. Don’t do or say something to a friend that you wouldn’t want a friend to do or say to you. Reflect on the situation. Friends aren’t perfect, and sometimes they bother or provoke you. It is important that you take a moment to think of how you would want to be treated in any situation.
For example, your friend may say something silly or embarrassing. Instead of giggling right away, think about how you would feel if someone laughed at you in that situation.;
, Good friends are nice to each other! Say positive things about your friends whether you are together or not. Treat them with love and respect.


Show your kindness by sharing something once in awhile. Offer to share your snack or let a friend borrow your T-shirt for the week. Generosity shows that you are willing think of your friend's needs before your own.

, Your friends will go through ups and downs in life. Sometimes a friend only needs a shoulder to cry on or some company. It can be difficult to know what to say to someone who is going through hard times. Remember that everyone reacts differently to challenges, so don’t make assumptions about what should or should not occur.


Acknowledge what happened and show concern. Try saying, “I heard about your cat dying. I’m so sorry.”
Offer to help. Ask how your friend is doing and see if you can be helpful. For example, “How are you feeling today? What can I do to help?”, Friends support each other during good times and difficult times. Show your friends that you are there for them by being upfront and positive.


Don’t gossip. Don’t make mean comments about a friend, even if you are upset with her. This will only cause more harm than good. Gossiping will only hurt your friend’s feelings and make it look like you don’t care about her."
"
Make time for your friends.,
Have fun.,
Try new things.,
Take turns choosing activities.",How to Treat Your Friends2," Friendships grow stronger when you create memories. The more time you spend together, the more you get to know the other person. Go to a friend’s house after school or have lunch together.


If your friend asks you to hang out several times, make an effort to agree to see each other. People will stop asking if you never accept invitations.
If you want to see a friend, try saying, “Hey, are you free this week? Do you want to hang out after school?”

, Remember to do something that you both enjoy. Maybe you both want to see the same movie, or maybe your friend wants to try out your new video game. Whatever it is, relax and have a good time! The more experiences you have, the stronger your bond.


Go to a concert, cook a meal, or watch a television show that you both enjoy. Fill your time with laughter.

, Take a class on the weekend or try out a new restaurant together. Trying new things will help you bond with your friends. Whether you have a good time or not, you are creating memories to talk about in the future. Even if something is a disaster, it will likey be something you laugh about together later on.


Don’t be afraid to step out of your comfort zone. You and your friend can support each other when you try something new together.
For example, you and a friend might feel nervous about joining a new club. Try saying, “I’m afraid I won’t be any good at soccer, too. But let’s try it out. At least we’ll be together if things go badly.”

, Remember that your time spent together should be fun for both you and your friends. Make sure that everyone has a chance to choose an activity.


For example, your friend might get to choose where you go for lunch and you get to choose the movie. Find a compromise that works for both of you. You might say, “Since I chose the movie, why don’t you decide on lunch? I’m open to anything.”
Be aware of your friends' schedules. Don't expect them to always work around your availability — remember that they have lives, too. Be willing to make some sacrifices or rearrange some things to accommodate your friends' schedules, too.

"
"
Actively listen.,
Resolve conflicts.,
Show empathy.,
Be honest.,
Keep the lines of communication open.,
Maintain friendships.",How to Treat Your Friends3," Friendship means spending time together. Even if you are doing a specific activity, conversation is in the mix. Actively listen to what your friends have to say about the topics you discuss.


Focus on what your friend is saying and how it makes her feel. Reiterate what was said and add your interpretation if you feel comfortable doing so. For example, you might say, “Your mom yelled at you. It seems like that made you feel really sad.” Use your body to show you are listening. Look your friend in the eye, turn toward her, and mirror her facial expressions. These are all physical signs that you are truly listening. , If you get into an argument, try to stay calm. Take some time apart so that you don’t retaliate out of anger or frustration. Give yourself some time to think about what went wrong. Take the necessary steps to resolve the conflict. Avoid social media. It is tempting to turn to the internet when you are upset with someone. Remember that your anger will eventually go away, but what you post online is much harder to remove.If you need to get out your frustration over what happened, try writing it in a notebook or journal instead, where no one will see it and you can say whatever you want.
Have a conversation. Take time to reflect on what happened. Find a good time to talk to your friend once you have both had some time to think. Make sure that you are free of distractions and feeling calm when you do meet up.Try saying, “Hey, I’m sorry things are tense between us. I really want work past this. When is a good time for you?”
Acknowledge feelings. Acknowledge both your own feelings and your friend’s feelings. Maybe one or both of you felt hurt or offended. This will help you understand why the conflict happened in the first place. For example, you might say, “I felt angry when you brought up my dad because we’ve been having a lot of fights. Now I see how I made you upset when I made fun of your sister.” , It’s usually easy to understand your friends when you agree on the same topic. You probably became friends because of the things you have in common. In any relationship, however, there are disagreements. Get past disagreements by showing that you understand your friend’s perspective.


Put yourself in your friend’s shoes. Both you and your friend should attempt to see the situation from the other person’s perspective. To do this, you both have to communicate your honest feelings about the situation.Maybe you were feeling down because of a fight you had with your parents. Maybe your friend is sensitive about his sister’s disability. Try to see the situation from his perspective.

, Maybe your friend invited you to an event, but it’s not really your cup of tea. It is okay to put your needs first, and graciously decline the offer. After all, it won’t be fun for either of you if you really don’t want to be there.


Try saying something positive before and after you decline. For example, “It’s so nice of you to invite me on the hiking trip. Unfortunately, I won’t make it. My allergies are bad and I’m not a huge fan of camping. But let’s plan another trip for next month!” , Confront the little things right away. Friendships can get complicated, especially if you have a large group of friends, or if you are simply a part of a big community at school or work. Even the small things, like feeling left out, can put friendships to the test.


Express yourself without adding drama. If a friend posts pictures that make you feel left out, try letting her know without resentment. For example, “Oh man, I wish I had gone to that party. It looked like you guys had so much fun.” , Everyone gets busy, and sometimes schedules, distance, or other obstacles mean you can't see your friends as often as you'd like. Let your friends know you are thinking of them by checking in occasionally — send a text to say hello, that you were thinking of the person, or even just a funny gif you think your friend would like.

Don't always rely on your friend to invite you places or make plans. Be sure you are also initiating hanging out.

Understand how a diode functions.,
Learn what the diode schematic symbol means.,
Look for the large band.,
Identify the positive end of an LED.",How to Tell Which Way Round a Diode Should Be1," A diode is composed of an N-type semiconductor joined with a P-type semiconductor. The N-type semiconductor is the negative end of the diode, and is called the ""cathode"". The P-type semiconductor is the positive end of the diode, and is called the ""anode"".


If the positive side of a voltage source is connected to the positive end of the diode (the anode), and the negative side is connected to the negative end of the diode (the cathode), the diode will conduct current.
If the diode is reversed, the current is blocked (up to a limit).;
, Diodes are indicated on schematics by a symbol (—▷|—) that shows how the diode should be installed. An arrow points at a vertical bar, which has a line continuing out of it.The arrow indicates the positive side of the diode, while the vertical bar indicates the negative side. You can think of it as the positive side flowing into the negative side, with the arrow indicating the direction of the flow.

, If the diode doesn't have the schematic symbol printed on it, look for the ring, band, or line printed on the diode. Most diodes will have a large colored band printed near the negative side (cathode) of the diode. The band will go all the way around the diode.

, An LED is a light-emitting diode, and you can usually tell which side is positive by examining the legs. The longer leg is the positive, anode pin.If the pins have been trimmed, examine the the outer casing of the LED. The pin nearest to the flat edge is the negative, cathode pin.

Test an LED.",How to Tell Which Way Round a Diode Should Be2," This is usually indicated by the diode schematic symbol (—▷|—). This mode will allow the multimeter to send some current through the diode, making it easier to test.


You can still test the diode without the Diode setting. Set the meter to the the resistance (Ω) function.

, Connect the positive lead to the one end of the diode, and the negative end to the other. You should see a reading on the meter's display.If your meter has a Diode mode, you will see voltage displayed on the meter if the meter is connected positive-to-positive and negative-to-negative. If its the wrong way, nothing will be displayed.
If you meter does not have a Diode mode, you will see very low resistance if the meter is connected positive-to-positive and negative-to-negative. If its the wrong way, you will see very high resistance, sometimes express as ""OL"".

, An LED is a light-emitting diode. Turn the multimeter to the Diode setting. Place the positive lead on one of the pins, and the negative lead on the other. If the LED lights up, the positive lead is touching the positive pin (the anode), and the negative lead is touching the negative pin (the cathode). If it doesn't light up, the leads are touching the opposite pins.

, The cartridges should slide to the center of the printing area. You may need to press the Ink button, which may have a “drop” icon, in order for the cartridges to slide out.


Do not pull the print head out of its housing. It should move out automatically, either when the lid is opened or a button is pressed.

, The numbering and labeling systems vary by printer manufacturers.

, Use the numbers you wrote down to buy either at an office store or online, or take your cartridges to an ink refiller. If you are unsure, take the cartridge to the store and ask an employee to help you find the right match.


Make sure you get cartridges from the correct manufacturer. They are not compatible between different brands, and often within the same brand.

, Depending on the model printer you have, there may be multiple cartridges to choose from. The cartridge’s ink color should be displayed on its label.


Grip the cartridge. Some cartridges have clips that can be pressed in to release them from the ink tray.
Pull it at an angle away from point of attachment.
Do not remove your cartridges unless you have replacements ready. Leaving a print head empty for too long can dry it out, making it unusable., Shaking will help the first few print jobs come out looking better. Be sure to shake before opening the bag to prevent leakage.

, These differ by brand, but almost all cartridges will have a protective sticker or piece of plastic over the dispenser that needs to be removed before installation.

, Insert it in the reverse way that you remove them. Keep the correct angle, and it should fit in with little effort. Most newer cartridges will lock into place automatically with a little pressure.

, This will make sure that the cartridges have been installed correctly, and will get the ink flowing before your first real document.

, If you are noticing streaks, lines, or smudges, your print heads may be out of alignment or in need of cleaning. Check your printer’s documentation on how to do this for your model.

Unless you have significant electronics repair experience, take your monitor to a professional repair service.


Other signs of a blown capacitor include a loud humming noise, lines across the screen, and multiple images.
The power supply unit is one of the most expensive components in the monitor. If the problem is more serious than a blown capacitor, the price of repair could be considerable. A replacement may be a better idea if your monitor is getting old.

, Try this if your monitor just displays a black screen, but the power indicator light does come on. If you can see the image when you point a light at the screen, the monitor's backlight is at fault. Follow these instructions to replace it.

, If most of the screen works but a few pixels are ""stuck"" at one color, the fix is usually easy. Keep the monitor on and try the following:


Wrap a pencil tip (or other blunt, narrow object) in a damp, non-abrasive cloth. Rub very gently over the stuck pixel. Rubbing too hard can cause further damage.Search for stuck pixel repair software online. These conduct rapid color changes to jolt the pixel into working again.
Purchase hardware designed to plug into your monitor and repair dead pixels.
If none of the above works, you may need to replace your screen.

, These are signs of physical damage. A monitor at this stage is often beyond repair, and attempts to fix it can end up causing more harm. However, if the screen is not usable in its current state, there's no harm in trying a repair before you look for a replacement:


Run a soft cloth or other object over the screen. If you feel any broken glass, do not attempt repair. Replace the monitor instead.
Rub the scratch with a clean eraser, as gently as you can. Wipe off the eraser whenever residue builds up.
Purchase an LCD scratch repair kit.

Read this article for more homemade solutions.

, If you're using a standalone LCD monitor, consider purchasing a replacement. This may be more cost-effective than having new components installed in an old monitor with a shorter lifespan. However, if you have a laptop or a relatively new device, purchase a replacement LCD display panel. Hire a professional to install it.


The panel serial number should be displayed somewhere on the device, usually on the back. Use this to order a new panel from the manufacturer.
While you can attempt to replace the panel yourself, the process is difficult and can expose you to dangerously high voltages. Follow a guide devoted to your specific model, to maximize safety and success rates.

, There are many ways an LCD monitor can go wrong, but the diagnostics above cover the most common problems. Try the suggested fix that matches your problem first. If your problem is not described above, or if the monitor still won't work after the attempted fix, consider these issues as well:


If the picture responds to input but displays a messy image, such as jumbled multicolored squares, the AV (audio visual) board may be damaged. This is usually a rectangular circuit board located near the audio and visual cables. Replace obviously damaged parts using a soldering iron, or order a replacement board and carefully install it to the same screws and ribbon cables.
The main control buttons may be faulty. Clean them with a metal cleaner, or jostle to attach a loose connection. If necessary, locate the circuit board they are attached to and re-solder any broken connections.
Check input cables for damage, or try other cables of the same type. If necessary, inspect the circuit board they are attached to and re-solder damaged connections.

Take your broken Asus and a pry tool.,
(This is an optional step).,
If you are still attempting DIY repair, at this point remove all screws from the bottom panel, and keep them in a safe location.,
The digitizer is attached to this silver cover for the screen hinges.,
Unscrew the ribbon connector piece from the silver casing.,
Screw the ribbon connector back in to the casing.,
Test your machine.",How to Replace a Q200e /X202e Digitizer," Carefully slide the edge of the tool under the plastic cover of the screen so that you are lifting it out. Then carefully work the tip around the bezel ""popping"" the cover out of the case. It should be loose except for the bottom which will require a gentle but firm pull backwards to release from the case. Keep in mind that the ribbon cable is still holding the two pieces together.;
, With the digitizer pulled back, you may now access the ten screws holding the screen in place.Using an extremely small screwdriver, such as Phillips similar size to Torx 6 (watch repair sized even), to remove the four screws around the LCD, and will remove the cable connecting the LCD to the machine for easier access. #*Recommended professional repair for the standard user.

, Remove the bottom panel by gently pulling it up from the case.This gives you access to the screen hinge cover.

, the cover houses the digitizer ribbon cable that connects to the motherboard. The casing is mold fitted to plastic nubs on the inside of the digitizer that you have to carefully pry apart, so that you can replace the digitizer. This is an important step and very easy to mess up.

, This makes it easier to remove the cables for the broken digitizer and the attach the new digitizer.


Make sure you are familiar with ribbon cable connectors and how they work so that there are no issues.

, Slide the casing under the screen and snap it in to place. If you have removed the LCD for better access, snap the connector in and screw it in to place. Then carefully snap the digitizer into place, insuring that all of the steps have been followed to get it plugged in. Snap in and screw the bottom plate of the computer.

, If it does not work, try to go through the steps and make sure all cables are connected tightly. It may be possible that connectors break during a fall or drop and could cause issues. Faulty third party manufactured components like LCDs and digitizers may also be to blame.

If you handle them improperly, you can receive a dangerous or even lethal electric shock. Take the following steps to protect yourself and your monitor's components:Be honest about your abilities. If you have never replaced a circuit board or handled electronic equipment before, hire a professional. This is not a good repair for beginners.
Wear static-free clothing and work in a static-free environment. Keep the area clear of wool, metal, paper, lint, dust, children, and pets.
Avoid working in dry or wet conditions. A humidity level between 35 and 50% is ideal.
Ground yourself before you begin. You can do this by touching the metal chassis of the monitor, while the monitor is off but plugged into a grounded outlet.
Stand on a low-friction surface. Before working on carpet, treat it with an anti-static spray.
Wear tight rubber gloves if you are still able to manipulate the components involved.

, Unplug the monitor. If the monitor is attached to a laptop or other battery-powered device, remove the battery. These steps will reduce the chance of an electric shock.


Even if your laptop has a ""non-removable"" battery, you can usually remove it after opening up the device. Follow an online guide for your laptop model.
Some components inside the laptop will continue to hold charge. Use caution and do not touch any component until you have identified it.

, Work on a large, flat surface cleared of all other objects. Use small containers to hold each screw and other removable components. Label each container with the name of the component the screw held down, or with the step number from this guide.









Consider photographing the monitor before you separate any connections. This will help you fit the monitor back together again.

, Unscrew the plastic case at each corner, or wherever you see screws holding the back and front frames together. Pry it apart using a thin, flexible tool. A plastic putty knife works well.









Prying apart components with a metal object risks destroying them with chipping or an electrical short. A metal object is relatively safe for this initial step, but do not use it for any further steps.

, This circuit board usually sits near the power socket. You may need to unscrew additional panels to find it. This circuit board is the one with several cylindrical capacitors, including one large one. However, these capacitors are usually located on the other side, and are not visible until you finish disconnecting the board.


If you are not sure which board is the power supply, search online for an image of your specific model.
Do not touch any of the metal pins on this board. They may deliver an electric shock.

, Remove all screws and ribbon cables holding the circuit board in place. Always disconnect a cable by pulling directly out of the socket. If you pull a ribbon cable vertically when it is in a horizontal socket, you can easily break it.









Some ribbon cables have a small tab you can pull to disconnect them.

, Carefully lift the board by the edges, without touching any metal pins or attached components. On the other side of the board, locate the cylindrical capacitors. Each one is attached to the board with two pins. Discharge the stored electricity to reduce the risk of harm, as follows:Purchase a resistor in the range of 1.8–2.2kΩ and 5–10 watts. This is much safer than using a screwdriver, which may create sparks or destroy the board.
Put on rubber gloves.
Locate the pins attached to the largest capacitor. Touch the two resistor leads to the pins for several seconds.
For best results, test the voltage between the pins with a multimeter. Use resistor again if significant voltage remains.
Repeat with each of the largest capacitors. The smaller cylinders cannot typically cause serious harm.

, Look for a capacitor with a domed or bulging top, instead of a flat one. Check each capacitor for leaking fluid, or a crusty buildup of dried fluid. Before removal, photograph or record the position of each capacitor and the markings on its side. It's very important that you know which pin attaches to the negative side of the capacitor, and which to the positive. If you are removing more than one type of capacitor, make sure you know where each one goes.


If none of the capacitors look damaged, test each one with a multimeter set to resistance.
Some capacitors are shaped like small discs instead of cylinders. These rarely break, but check to make sure none are bulging outward.

, As described in the linked article, use a soldering iron and desoldering pump to remove the pins connecting faulty capacitors. Set aside the broken capacitors.








, Any electronics supply store should sell capacitors at very low prices. Look for a capacitor with the following attributes:


Size — identical to the old capacitor
Voltage (V, WV, or WVDC) — equal to the old capacitor, or slightly higher
Capacitance (F or µF) — equal to the old capacitor

, Use your soldering iron to attach the new capacitors to the circuit board. Make sure to connect the negative (striped) side of each capacitor to the same pin that was attached to the negative side of the old capacitor. Check that all new connections are solidly connected.









Use soldering wire suitable for electronics.
If you've lost track of where the capacitors were located, look online for a diagram of your model's power supply board.

, Reattach all cables, panels, and components exactly as they were before. You may test the monitor before screwing in the final plastic panel, as long as all other parts are connected. If it still doesn't work, you may need to hire a professional or buy a replacement.

, Unscrew the plastic case at each corner. Carefully pry apart the case with a plastic putty knife. Detach all components attached to the display panel, noting where each one goes.

, These glass lights should be just behind the glass display. You may need to unscrew additional panels or gently pull back flexible covers in order to find them.


Some components can deliver a dangerous electric shock. Do not touch any circuit boards during your search, unless you are wearing rubber gloves.

, If you're not sure what types of light they are, take a photograph and show it to the store employee. Measure the size of the lights as well, or note the size and model of your monitor.

, Use caution if the backlight is a cold cathode fluorescent light (CCFL). These contain mercury and may require special disposal according to local laws.

, If the monitor still won't light up, the problem may be with the circuit board powering the backlight. This is called an ""inverter"" board, and is usually located near the backlight, with one ""cap"" for each strip of lights. Order a replacement and carefully replace this component. For best results and minimum risk, follow a guide dedicated to your specific model.


Before you try this, confirm that the monitor still produces a visible image when you shine a light on the screen. If it has stopped displaying an image entirely, you may have not connected it correctly after the light replacement. Check thoroughly for loose connections.

,I will get back to this after I check if there is already an article describing this.",How to Create Separate Volumes for a MS Windows System,", Decide how to group files - not just into directories, but on a larger scale. When you received you computer, the disk was most likely allocated (almost) entirely with one partition or volume. It's a bad idea for many reasons, including security, reliability, and fragmentation., Get the utility to collect all the data together at the beginning of the partition. Actually get all the free space together at the end of the volume so you can have an area to make your new volumes., Now might be the time to try another defrag utility. There are several available free for non-commercial use. This may be necessary if the defrag utility you normally use leaves used space at the far end of the partition., You will be prompted to do this on the next boot. Agree and restart the system. The boot process will take a very long time depending on the size of the disk (not on the amount of data on it since the /r makes chkdsk read every sector on the disk!). Adding the /r option is a safety feature. You do not want to discover that there is an unreadable sector on the disk in the later on. If chkdsk finds and corrects errors, well better now than later. Correct any remaining errors that occur before continuing which can usually be done by copying the bad file from elsewhere., Like they always tell you: ""backup your disk"". At least your address book, browser bookmarks and that project that you'll need next week. Back up to CD or DVD or another system (laptop or cloud), gparted. download the live CD and write it to a bootable CD or order one., Did you backup your address book?

You can easily install Windows Vista, 7, and 8 from a USB drive.


If you download an ISO file for your version of Windows, you can skip down to the next section.;
, There are a number of free burning utilities available online. You need one that can create ISO files. ImgBurn is one of the more popular free choices.

, Open your new burning program. Look for an option such as “Copy to Image” or “Create Image.” If prompted, select your DVD drive as the source.

, Choose an easy to remember name and location for the file. The ISO you make will be equal in size to the disc you are copying. This means it can take up several gigabytes of space on your hard drive. Be sure you have enough storage available.


The ISO file is essentially an exact copy of the installation DVD.

, Your flash drive will need to be at least 4 GB in size in order to successfully copy the ISO file onto it. All of the data on your flash drive will be lost when you turn it into an installation drive, so be sure to back up any important files before continuing.

, This is available for free from Microsoft. Despite its name, this tool works with Windows 8 and Vista ISO files as well. You can install and run this tool on virtually any version of Windows.


If you would prefer to get your hands a little dirtier and create a bootable USB drive from the command line, check out this guide.

, This is the ISO that you created or downloaded in the first section. Click Next.

, You are given the option to either burn to a DVD or create a USB device. Click the USB Device option. Select your flash drive from the list of available devices.

, The program will format the USB drive to boot correctly, and then copy the ISO file onto the drive. Depending on the speed of your machine, the copying process can take up to 15 minutes to complete., Boot or reboot the computer. When the computer reboots, you will need to press the Setup key in order to enter your BIOS to change the boot order. This will allow you to boot from the USB drive instead of your hard drive.The Setup key must be pressed when the manufacturer’s logo is displayed on the screen. This is typically a very short window of time, so if you miss it you will have to reboot and try again.
The key varies from computer to computer, but will be displayed on the screen when you can press it. Typical keys include F2, F10, and Del.

, While each BIOS layout is different, they will all typically have a Boot menu, though it may be worded slightly different. This menu will display the order in which the computer will look for a bootable operating system. Typically, computers are set to boot from the hard drive first so that the installed operating system loads automatically.

, Once you have found the Boot menu, you will need to switch the order so that your USB drive is listed at the top. Again, this will vary from computer to computer. Some BIOS setups will list the USB drive by its name, while others will simply say “Removable Device” or “USB”.


You will typically use the “+” and “-” keys on your keyboard to swap around the boot order.

, Once you have changed the boot order, save your changes and exit the BIOS. The key for this is typically F10. The computer will reboot, this time booting from the USB drive first.

, You will see a message after the manufacturer’s logo telling you to press a key to start Setup. Press any key on your keyboard to continue.


If you do not press a key, your computer will move on to the next device in your boot order, and you will need to restart your computer again.

, Once you press a key, setup will begin loading the files required to install Windows. This may take several minutes on slower computers.

, Once the files have been loaded, Windows installation will begin normally, just as if you were installing from an installation DVD. Check out the following guides for specific instructions for the version you are installing:

Restart your computer.",How to Identify Unknown Devices in Windows," Device Manager is used to control attached hardware to your computer. If the operating system does not have a driver for your hardware installed the device will not function. You can find the Device Manager control panel by right-clicking My Computer and selecting properties. Select the Hardware tab and click Device Manager.;
, Select the device which is not identified. Windows places all unknown devices in a group labeled other devices. Do not try to configure a device that is properly installed. A solid yellow question mark icon indicates the device is unknown to Windows.

, In the properties of the unknown device there is a tab labeled details. In this tab you will find a drop down list with Hardware IDs. VEN_XXXX is the vendor ID and DEV_XXXX is the device ID. The four characters after VEN and DEV are unique identifiers. These identifiers will help you identify your unknown device.

, There are many websites you can use to find out the name and model of your unknown device. You can do an online search for hardware ID databases to find this information.

, Use a search engine to find the drivers for your device. There are many harmful websites trying to charge you money or make you download malicious software for drivers. This can be avoided by searching for drivers on your manufacturer’s website. If you cannot find your driver online, email the manufacturer for help with drivers.

, If you are using Windows XP, use a Windows XP driver. Do not attempt to install a Linux or Mac driver on your Windows machine. There are specific drivers for each operating system. Although some drivers may be universal, check with the manufacturer to see compatibility.

, This is a critical step. When prompted to restart your computer, select yes. This is highly recommended to avoid problems with your driver's installation. Check in Device Manager to see if your device is installed and working properly after you restart.

Download the latest version of TortoiseSVN - http://www.wandisco.com/subversion/download#tortoise



 


It comes in 32-bit and 64-bit flavours, get the one that matches your system.,
Double click the installer file.

,
Click the Run button.

,
You'll see the welcome screen, which will confirm the version of Tortoise that you're about to install.,
Read the End-User License Agreement.,
The Custom Setup screen lets you deselect various elements of the install.,
Click Install.

,
Hey presto!,
To work with a Subversion repository we first need to download a local copy (called a working copy) of either the full or part of the repository.,
Open Windows explorer, go to the new directory and right click within the folder space.,
You'll now see the progress of the checkout.,
Next, it's time to make a change.,
We'll now make a change to a file.,
You'll notice that once saved, 'system.txt' now has a different icon overlaid, showing an exclamation mark in a red circle to denote that it has been changed.





,
Having tested the change, it's time to add it to the repository.,
You'll be prompted for a message to associate with the changes you've made.,
The outcome of the commit will appear in a dialog window.,
Next we'll add something new to the repository.,
The added elements should now appear in Explorer with the 'added' overlay icon.,
It's always good practice to leave a note, whenever you do a commit.,You'll get a log of the commit, confirming that your new files are now part of the new repository revision.,
That's all there is to using Subversion with the TortoiseSVN client.",How to Install and TortoiseSVN and Make Your First Repository Change,";
,,, Click Next >

, If you're happy to proceed, click the 'I accept the terms...' radio button and then click Next >.

, Unless you are really low on disk space, it isn't worth worrying about this. When you're ready to continue, click Next >

,, Tortoise is now installed. Click Finish.

, We start by creating a directory in which we'll store the the working copy.

, The Explorer context menu appears, along with Subversion commands that are added with TortoiseSVN. Click on the option 'SVN Checkout....



URL Repository: This is the URL of the repository on which you want to work. This is the address of the repository, or portion of a repository for which you want to make a working copy. You can get the repository URL from the repository's screen in uberSVN:

Checkout directory: This is the location on your local file system where the checkout will occur. By default it will be the location that you're currently focused on in Explorer, however you can change it here.

Checkout Depth: The Checkout Depth drop-down allows you to limit what you checkout. Useful if you only want to make a change in one directory of a very large repository.

Revision: You can get the latest version of the repository, called 'HEAD' (most up-to-date version), or select a specific revision to go back to a version before particular changes.
When you've finished with these options and you're ready to do the checkout, click OK.

, All files and folders that are included in the checkout will be logged.

, The working copy is now in place on your computer, ready to edit and change to your heart's desire. One of the benefits of Tortoise as a shell replacement is the fact that it can overlay repository files with status icons that tell you the current state of each file.





, In this example the file 'system.txt' will be modified and saved.





,, To apply changes to the repository that you've made in your local copy you need to use the SVN Commit command. You can select individual files or their directories, then right click to get the context menu. On the menu, click SVN Commit....

, It's human nature to try to leave this blank because you're in a hurry and can't be bothered, but simple log messages can really help with troubleshooting problems at a later date.


, If the commit was successful the repository's revision number will increase. Click OK. That's it, you're working with version control.

, You see, it's not possible to commit something unless Subversion already has a record of the file you are adding. So first, right click the file and choose Add... from the Subversion commands., Although Subversion now knows about the file, you still need to perform a commit. So again, right click the file and choose SVN Commit... from the menu.

, While Subversion gives you lots of tools for scrutinizing file changes, it's nice to have a quick summary to look back on. To complete the commit, click OK.

,, Probably 90% of the work you need to do is covered here. If you get stuck though, don't forget that you can read the user guide by clicking on the Help link in the TortoiseSVN commands menu."

, Click the “Download” button to begin downloading the tool.

, Get the memory card to format. This can be your SD, MMC, or CF card.

This will only work for the listed memory cards.

, Connect the memory card to your computer. Use a memory card reader, if necessary., Go to My Computer and verify if the memory card has been recognized and detected by your computer. It should appear under external devices or removable storage section.

, The file you’ve downloaded from Part 1 is a zipped file. Locate this file from your computer. The zipped file is named RecoveRx vX.X, where X.X is the version number. Double-click this file and extract its contents to another folder.

Try Win4Lin.,

TransGaming's Cedega product is a subscription service where you pay a monthly fee for access to the latest versions of the app in binary and vote on the games that you want to see ported over.",How to Play Windows Games in Linux1," Win4Lin is purchased software that allows you to install Windows 2000 or XP inside a Linux system. Essentially, it lets you run a virtual Windows machine inside a Linux machine. Although this product is meant primarily as a business tool, if you already have it, then you should try using it to run games. Because this is a commercial tool with plenty of documentation, we can leave the details of installation instructions and starting Win4Lin to the manuals. On older machines under 1.5 GHz and less than a 1G RAM, don't even bother. The virtual Windows runs at a snail's pace. Playing anything except untimed games is basically impossible due to performance lag, but you only get this slowdown inside the Win4Lin session. You will likely need to copy files from the CD-ROM to the hard drive for games.;
, It runs very similarly but way better than W4L, but the cost will keep most people away. The documentation is far better than W4L's and online support is acceptable. But consider a test drive before you sink this kind of money into your game addiction, since it may not work on your machine as well as it does elsewhere.

, WoW and several other newer games run on this service.

The WINE Project is freeware that allows people to run MS-DOS and 32-bit Windows applications under Linux and the free BSDs.",How to Play Windows Games in Linux2," Whether WINE will run your particular game is heavily dependent on a lot of factors you have no control over. Your best bet is simply to give it a try. Depending on which Linux distribution you're using, WINE may be easy or complex to install. WINE is often bundled in distros. If you didn't get it, go to the WINE site and click the Download button. You may find a ready made package for your specific distribution. If not, you will have to follow the WINE Source Download link and then follow the instructions in the README for how to build the program.


Once you have WINE installed, attempting to run a Windows program using this tool isn't difficult. You will need to get it onto your system, either by mounting the disk, or by downloading/copying the software onto your machine. Then, if there is software you need to install, you need to determine which program launches the installation — this is typically INSTALL.EXE or SETUP.EXE. From inside its' directory, type wine program. For example, wine INSTALL.EXE.






More often than not, the installation program will launch properly, so you may be able to install the software using WINE. Even if it does, don't get excited. Installer programs are very basic and the actual game software is something else. Programs installed inside of WINE are placed in ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/. You may get an icon on the desktop. If you start the program by hand, go to the directory containing the game, and type wine program just as you did before. So, if you were trying to get the game Bejeweled running, you might change to ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/PopCap Games/Bejeweled, and type wine WinBiz.exe. It either works or doesn't. If it does, great! If not, you can search for tips on how to tweak the game in WINE, or try a different virtual tool. I've seen some impressive results with WINE, including a beautiful HARPOON port and a shaky but functional Flight Simulator. The key is your willingness to pursue tweaks for your installation and the specific game you are trying to run.

The following scanners are general-purpose rootkit scanners, and you should download all of them on a non-infected computer and copy them to a USB drive:RKill - bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/ (This program will stop most malicious process from running, allowing you to proceed with the removal. Select the ""iExplore.exe"" version when downloading.)

Malwarebytes Antimalware Free Version - malwarebytes.org

RogueKiller - adlice.com/softwares/roguekiller/
;
, Safe Mode only allows essential processes to run, making it an essential tool for removing rootkits. There are several methods for booting into Safe Mode, depending on your version of Windows:


Any version of Windows - Press ⊞ Win+R and type msconfig. Click the Boot tab, and check the ""Safe boot"" box in the ""Boot options"" section. Reboot your computer and it will automatically boot into Safe Mode. This is the easiest way to get to Safe Mode in Windows 8/8.1.
Windows 7 and older - Reboot your computer and rapidly strike the F8 key. This will load the Advanced Boot Options menu, where you can select ""Safe Mode with Networking"". This method is not possible on newer Windows 8 and 8.1 computers, as the boot too fast.

, This tool will scan for rootkits and trojans. There are a few settings changes that you will need to make in order to perform the scan.Click the ""Change Parameters"" link on the main TDSSKiller screen.
Check the ""Detect TDLFS file system"" box and click ""OK"".
Click ""Start scan"" to begin scanning with TDSSKiller. The scan is usually fairly quick.
Click ""Continue"" to remove the detected infections. You will be prompted to reboot your computer after the removal is complete.

, After running TDSSKiller, reboot your computer into Safe Mode again. If you used the msconfig method of starting in Safe Mode, you will automatically boot back into it.


Run the iExplore.exe file to start RKill. This version is usually necessary because many rootkits prevent rkill.exe from running.
Wait for RKill to finish finding and terminating processes. This may take a few minutes.

Do not reboot your computer after Rkill finishes. All of the programs that RKill stopped will restart when the computer reboots. Once you see the RKill log, move on to the next step to continue the cleaning process.

, Malwarebytes Antimalware is designed to detect a wide variety of malware that your virus scanner may have missed, including rootkits.


During installation, keep the ""Enable free trial..."" box checked.
Run Malwarebytes Antimalware and click the ""Update Now"" button to download the latest rootkits databases.
Click the ""Fix Now"" button to begin performing a scan. The scanning process will likely take around 30 minutes to complete.
Click ""Quarantine All"" and then ""Apply Actions"" to quarantine any infected files.

, This is a powerful registry and boot record scanning program that can find things that slipped through the cracks of the other scanners.If you aren't able to start RogueKiller, rename the program to winlogon.exe and try again.
Click ""More info"" and then ""Run anyway"" if prompted by Windows.
Wait for the pre-scan to complete as RogueKiller starts. This may take a few moments. Update the program if prompted.
Click the Scan button to begin the scanning process. This will take several minutes to complete.
Click the Delete button to remove checked entries. RogueKiller will automatically check what it considers the most dangerous results. You can also click through each of the results tab and check anything else that you feel is suspicious. If you aren't sure about something, look it up using your favorite search engine before deleting it.

, If your rootkit scanners are finding rootkits but are unable to remove them, you may need to download an anti-rootkit program that specifically targets that rootkit. These are often available for free from various security companies, and are too numerous to list here. Use the results from your rootkit scans to search the web for tools designed to combat your specific infections.

, The BitDefender RescueDisk is a free utility designed to find and detect rootkits by booting into a special operating system before Windows loads. This is one of the most effective ways to identify rootkits that scanners miss, as many mask themselves once Windows has started. The RescueDisk ISO file will allow you to create a bootable CD that you can use to load the RescueDisk operating system


You can download the ISO file from download.bitdefender.com/rescue_cd/. Download the file labeled BitDefenderRescueCD_v2.0.0_5_10_2010.iso. The file is fairly large, and may take a while to download depending on your connection speed.

, The ISO file will fit onto either a blank DVD or CD. Insert the blank disc into your burner drive and burn the ISO file to the disk. The process for burning ISO files varies depending on your version of Windows:Windows 7 and 8 - Right-click on the ISO file and select ""Burn to disc"". If you have another disc burning program installed, select ""Open with"" and then ""Windows Disc Image Burner"". Select the correct drive from the drop-down menu in Windows Disc Image Burner and then click Burn to burn the disc.
Windows Vista and older. Download and install a free disc burning program such as ImgBurn. If installing ImgBurn, read each installation screen carefully so that you don't install any extra unwanted software. Once you've installed ImgBurn, start the program and select ""Write image file to disc"". Browse for the RescueDisk ISO file and then click the Burn button to begin burning the disc.

, Once you've finished burning the disc, make sure the disc is still inserted and reboot the computer. For many computers, the RescueDisk boot menu will load automatically. If your computer loads Windows as it normally would, you'll need to switch your boot order in the BIOS menu.


Reboot your computer and hit the BIOS key when the manufacturer's logo appears. This is usually F2, F10, or Del, though your computer may be different. Some computers allow you to open directly to the boot menu with a special key. Open the Boot menu and select your disc drive as the primary boot device. Save your changes and reboot your computer.
Windows 8 - Entering the BIOS is different for computers that came installed with Windows 8 or 8.1. Open the Charms bar (⊞ Win+C) and click ""Settings"". Click the ""Change PC settings"" button and then select ""Update and recovery"". Click ""Recovery"", and then click the ""Restart Now"" button at the bottom of the screen. Once the special boot menu appears, select ""Troubleshoot"", and then ""Advanced options"". Click the ""UEFI Firmware Settings"" button and then click ""Restart"". This will load your UEFI (new version of BIOS) menu, where you can select the ""Boot"" option and then change your boot order.

, It's highly recommended that you download any updates, as this will help ensure that RescueDisk can detect the most rootkits possible. The update process may take a few minutes to complete.

, This will usually take around 15-20 minutes, more if you have very large drives.

, Once the scan is complete, a summary of any infections found will be displayed. Click the drop-down menu next to each one and select ""Disinfect"". Click the ""Fix Issues"" button, and the infections will be removed.

, Click the small power button at the bottom of the desktop and then select ""Restart"". Remove your burned disc from the computer to boot normally, or change your boot order back sot hat the hard drive is the primary boot device., If you can't remove the rootkits with your scanners or with RescueDisk, your best is to wipe your drive clean and reinstall Windows. For some rootkits, this is really the only way to get rid of them without hours of tedious and technical work. Generally speaking, if you've already spent a couple hours trying scanners and manual removal methods, you're probably better off just wiping it clean and starting over.

, You'll be wiping the hard drive clean with no possibility of recovery, so make sure that you have all of your important files securely backed up. You can use an external hard drive, blank DVDs, or a cloud storage service to backup your data. Click here for detailed instructions on quickly backing up your most important files.

, DBAN is a utility that will completely wipe your drive. This is an important tool when reformatting due to rootkits, as they may survive a simple reformat during Windows installation. You can download DBAN for free from dban.org. Follow Step 2 from the previous section for instructions on burning your downloaded ISO file to a blank disc.DBAN will remove any recovery partitions from your hard drive, so you'll need an actual Windows installation disc for your version to reinstall after wiping. Contact your computer manufacturer for an installation disc if your computer did not come with one.

, It is very easy to accidentally erase the wrong disk in DBAN, so make sure that all of the disks and drives you don't want erased are detached from your computer.

, Most computers will start DBAN automatically, but you may have to adjust your boot order if you switched it back after the last section. Follow Step 3 of the previous section for instructions on booting from your burned DBAN disc.

, This will start DBAN in Interactive Mode, which will allow you to adjust settings.

, Ideally you'll only have one drive to select from since you've detached any drives you don't want to erase. Pressing Space will select the drive.

, There is no coming back from this, so make absolutely sure that you have the correct drive selected and that you have all of the files you need backed up.

, This will take multiple hours to complete, so you can probably leave and come back the next day. The reason it takes so long is that DBAN overwrites every sector of your hard drive multiple times with random data, which overwrites everything that was stored on it originally. This prevents any of the data from being recovered, and should help eliminate all traces of any rootkits.

, Once you've wiped your computer, you can begin re-installing Windows on your computer. The process is a little different for each version of Windows. Refer to the following guides for the different installation processes:


Windows 8
Windows 7
Windows Vista
Windows XP

, Most routers have a firewall function that prevents ports from being accessed by unknown processes. This is an essential element of online security, and if you're connected directly to your modem you should consider a software firewall or purchasing a router.

, Your antivirus program is your first line of defense against rootkits and other infections. You don't need to pay big money for an antivirus program; some of the most powerful and effective programs are free. Popular antivirus programs include:


Windows Defender
BitDefender
avast!
AVG

, This is an extra layer of security in newer versions of Windows that adds an extra prompt before unknown programs are installed. This gives you one last chance to deny permission to a potential rootkit installer before it has access to your system kernel.


Many people disable UAC as it can be a bit of a nuisance if you're constantly making changes to your system. Regardless, it's a good idea to keep it enabled to help prevent accidental rootkit installation. Click here for instructions on accessing UAC and changing the settings.

, When you download free programs from the internet, they will often come packaged with additional software. This additional software isn't always dangerous, but this is one of the most popular methods for installing rootkits and other malware. Carefully read each screen when installing unknown programs, and never select the ""Express"" installation option.

, Another common rootkit attack vector are malicious hardware drivers. For example, an infected keyboard driver may install a hidden keylogger rootkit. Only download drivers directly through Windows Update or from the manufacturer's website. Click here for instructions on properly finding and updating your drivers.

Most newer peripherals may not be compatible with Windows 98 either.
, For best results, boot the installer by restarting the computer from the hard disk. You may also need the Windows 98 boot disk if your computer doesn't support booting directly from the CD/DVD drive.


If you haven't done so already, pick up a copy of the Windows 98 Second Edition setup disc. They usually sell on eBay for between $5 to $20 USD. It's strongly recommended that you use the second edition (98SE) as most updates rely on it than the original Windows 98.

Open the System Restore tool.,
Select your restore point.,
Perform the restore.,
Check that DirectX was rolled back.",How to Uninstall Directx1," Performing a System Restore is the easiest way to uninstall a DirectX update, since there is no official way to uninstall DirectX. You will need to have a restore point from before DirectX is installed, which is typically created during the installation process. Using System Restore will uninstall and revert ANY changes that were made since the restore point was created, so it should be used very soon after installing the DirectX update.


Windows 8 – Open the Start screen and type “recovery”. Select “Recovery” from the list of search results. This will open the Recovery window. From there, click the “Open System Restore” link.
Windows 7 and Vista – Click Start and type “restore” into the Search box. Select “System Restore” from the top of the search results list.
Windows XP – Click Start and then select All Programs → Accessories → System Tools. Click on System Restore.;
, You will be presented with a list of available restore points. Compare dates to find one that was created before DirectX was updated. Click the “Scan for affected programs” to ensure that DirectX will be rolled back.


Remember, anything that was installed or updated between the point and now will be removed. Any programs that were installed then but are gone now will be reinstalled.

, Once you’ve chosen your restore point, wait for the restore to be completed. The restore process can take a significant amount of time. The computer will restart during the restore process, and then Windows will load with a message confirming that the restore was successful.

, Once Windows starts again, open the Run window by pressing Windows key + R, type in “dxdiag”, and press Enter. This will open the DXDiag tool, which will check your system and report the version of DirectX that is installed.


The DirectX version will be listed at the bottom of the System Information section on the first tab.
You must have some version of DirectX installed with Windows. Windows 7 and later cannot have anything less than DirectX 11 installed."
"

It will display an overview of your system. You can click each tab to see information on your display, sound, and inputs. A text box at the bottom of each tab will tell you if there are issues detected with that particular system.

, If you’re having difficulties running programs and are receiving DirectX errors, you may have corrupt or missing DirectX files. The best way to try to fix this is by reinstalling the latest version of DirectX. The installer is available for free from Microsoft.


If you are having issues, upgrading to the latest version may help much more than uninstalling.

, The installer will scan your system and then install the necessary files to update your copy of DirectX to the latest version. Restart your computer after it’s finished and check to see if you receive the same errors.

, Many times, updating your video card drivers will help fix DirectX errors for games and other video-centric programs. To update your driver, you’ll need to determine which video card you have, and then download the appropriate file from the manufacturer.


To find your video card information, open the Run dialog (Windows key + R) and enter “dxdiag”. Click the Display tab, and note the Chip Type and Manufacturer from the Device section.
Visit that manufacturer’s website. This will typically be NVidia or AMD. Search for your Chip Type on the website and download the latest driver files.
Run the driver installer. Your old video card files will be overwritten with the latest version. You may notice your screen flickering during the installation process.

, If nothing you do seems to be fixing your problem, it may be time to reinstall Windows. This will replace all of your DirectX files with the built-in files with your Windows installation. Reinstalling Windows will take an hour or so, not counting the time it takes to backup and restore your files and reinstall your programs. Follow one of the following guides for your version of Windows:

",How to Speed up Your Computer (Windows XP or Vista)," Viruses are one of the many factors that can make your computer considerably slower. The first thing you should do is to check if your computer has any viruses. You can do this by using an anti virus program. If you already have one, great, but for those who don’t, you should get a free version of AVG. Link: http://free.avg.com/ This program will walk you through the process of getting rid of those pesky viruses.;
, A bigger issue than viruses is in general, malware. All kinds of malware can infect your computer but AVG will only delete the virus. In order to fix infected objects download MalwareBytes from download.com and update and run scans weekly.

, A strange thing about computers is that, as you add more and more software to your hard drive, the data is scattered all over your hard drive. This can cause potential problems, as your computer may have to look in several places rather than one to launch a program. Defragmenting your hard drive will rearrange your hard drive so that it is easier for your computer to find certain things. Luckily for you, your computer should already come with a defragmenter program. Click start, then programs, then accessories, then system tools, and then finally launch the program entitled, Disk Defragmenter. All you have to do when the program has opened is click defragment.

, The next thing you should do is to stop any of the things that run in the background of your computer that you don’t need. Do this by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete at the same time. This then brings up the list of processes that are running at the moment. You can also use a program called ProcessScanner.

, If you run a lot of programs at the same time, then it eats up more RAM. You can figure out how much RAM you have by clicking Start, then Control Panel, then System. Then you will have to look at how much slots your motherboard has available. A good place to find a step-by-step guide on how to install RAM is http://www.ehow.com/how_895_install-ram.html.

, Another thing you can do to speed up your computer is to free up some space. One way to do this is to run Disk Cleanup, and luckily for you, it already comes preinstalled on your PC. Click Start, select All Programs, click Accessories, then select System Tools, and finally click Disk Cleanup. If several drives are available, you might be prompted to specify which drive you want to clean.

, To do this, first click Start, then My Computer. Next, you will have to right-click the hard drive you will want to scan and select Properties. When the Properties window opens, select the Tools tab and click the Check Now button. In the Check Disk window, select the Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors box, and finally click Start.

, A quick way to see these programs and eliminate them is to click Start, then Run, and then type in MSCONFIG. That should get you started

, Click “Get Started” to continue. You should be taken to a sign-in screen. Simply enter your email address and password into the given fields and hit the blue “Sign in” button underneath to move on.


If you don’t have a Microsoft account (Hotmail, Live, Outlook, etc.), you will need to have one before continuing. However, all that is require to sign up as Windows Insider is an existing MS account. Under the “Sign in” button you should see a blue “Sign up now” option. Click this to begin the signup process. A new page will load, and you will be asked to enter basic information like email, password, what country you live in, birthday, and gender. Click the blue “Create account” button when you are finished.

, The first screen that you will come to should be updating you on the changes being made to your user agreement and other policies. As you are going to be a part of the Windows Insider team, you will want to read over what your input on the OS may require, as well as how your feedback will affect the project. Click the blue “Continue” button, and you will be taken to a page with a dark gray box on it. Inside is the user agreement and terms. Once you are ready, check the box to the left of “I accept the terms of this agreement (required).” After that, you will need to chose from among the different reasons given for your use of the Windows Insider program. Check the boxes next to the options that best fit your reason for participating, and then click the purple “Submit” button to continue to the next step.

, You should now come to a page that will have a few different purple buttons on it. The top two are the ones you are going to be the most interested in. One should be marked “PC” and the other “Phone.” If you would like to run the PC version of the OS, and would like instructions for continuing on with it, go ahead and click the “PC” button. If you are more interested in the Windows Phone version of the OS at the moment, click the “Phone” button to continue.

, Regardless of the option you have chosen, there is going to be a page full of information. Please take a moment to read through it. As an Insider, you are going to be downloading a piece of unfinished software that can cause unexpected shutdowns of your PC, as well as loss of personal information. When you are done reading through the information, click the “Get the preview” button at the bottom of the page to continue.

, There are a few different ways to run the Windows 10 OS. You can run it on an older PC, as long as it meets the system requirements that you just read, by downloading what is called an ISO image. You can download the upgrade for the device you are currently running by clicking the “Start upgrade now” button. A download will begin. Simply follow the installation prompts as they are given. You can also run Windows 10 on what is called a virtual machine. This is basically running a new OS in a sandbox environment and not as a replacement OS. Think of it as running an OS inside another OS (e.g., Windows 10 inside XP). This may require you to download a few different pieces of software in order to effectively run the virtual machine (like VirtualBox, VMware, etc.)


If you are upgrading instead of using the ISO file, your PC will be scanned ahead of time to figure out if your system is compatible. However, if you are using the ISO to install, you will need to confirm that the system you will install it on will be able to handle it. Microsoft has said directly that if the system can run Windows 8.1, it will run Windows 10, as the requirements are nearly identical.
If you are trying to check if your system is compatible with Windows 10, you can try checking out the MS Upgrade Assistance website. Click the purple button that says “Download Windows 8.1 Upgrade Assistant.” Once it finishes, go ahead and double-click it and let it finish running. It will let you know in clear terms if your system is able to handle the upgrade to Windows 10.

, Scroll down once the page loads and choose your language from the given list. Chose either a 32-bit or 64-bit ISO, depending on your current system configuration, or the system you are planning to run the ISO on.


If you are running a virtual machine, like Virtualbox or VMware, go ahead and open it up. Start a new machine and select the Windows 10 ISO you just downloaded and begin creating your new virtual machine with Windows 10.

, Once you are finished installing Windows 10, make sure to look through the things you are most interested in as a user, even small things like graphics, icons, colors, or features that you would like to see added. Microsoft has, so far, shown themselves to be willing to listen to user feedback and make some pretty good changes. When you are ready to give your feedback, click Start, type “feedback” in the search field, and click the top result, which should be the Windows Feedback app. Once it loads, click the blue “Add new feedback button at the bottom of the page. Enter your feedback in the given fields and follow any further instructions.
