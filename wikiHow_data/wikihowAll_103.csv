Back up your work before troubleshooting.,
Create a new user account to use.,
Use System Restore if available.,
Perform a reinstall from a Microsoft retail or OEM Windows disc.,
Use an OEM recovery partition of a Windows installation.,
Boot with Linux to to correct major issues with a Windows installation such as a corrupted partition or boot table.,
Use a third party boot disk to perform maintenance and clean-up a Windows installation.,
Remove the hard drive and troubleshoot it on another PC.",How to Recover a Dead Windows Machine," The first step in any restore is to back up your data from the hard drive. If your machine runs well enough attempt recovery, then you may be able to plug a USB2 hard disk and back up your files. You'll have peace of mind and a safety net if the a process below fails, leaving your PC in a state of limbo. A failing hard drive may work intermittently enough to copy data from it, but is at continually at risk of a critical failure.;
, Sometimes a system that partially boots and/or misbehaves badly, or has a 'dead' application that can't be run anymore can be 'recovered' simply by creating a new user account and logging in as that new user. A corrupted registry is the most common culprit for 'dead' Windows machines, and a large subset of these potentially corrupt entries are in your user profile.
Click on the ""Start"" button and go to the ""Control Panel"" (""Settings"" -> ""Control Panel""), then select ""User Accounts"".
Create a New Account and give it a name.
Give it 'Administrator' privileges.
Reboot or log out and login as the 'new' user.
Verify that the system is stable. If the system is stable, you will still have to restore all of the settings you had on the old account, and move the 'My Documents' contents from the old account to the new one.
Back up your work.
Avoid using the old account. Windows will just try to re-use the same corrupted data again.

, Windows Me, XP, and later have a System Restore feature that will recover your system configuration (drivers, settings, and shared files) from the last configuration that worked. This feature must be enabled prior to encountering a configuration problem in order to use it. To enable it, right click on ""My Computer"", select ""Properties"", and click on the ""System Restore"" tab.

If you're unable to boot into Windows:





Boot your PC. If Window recognized that it was unable to load and if System Restore has a valid restore point, you'll have a chance of recovery.






Press the key prompted by Windows when you receive the message ""Boot to last known, good configuration"".






Follow the advice given, and Windows will restore your Windows to a last known, good configuration, then automatically reboot your PC.






Try booting to ""Safe Mode"", then following the steps below. Do this by repeatedly pressing F8 immediately before Windows will start to load (after your hardware information is displayed). When you see a boot menu for Windows XP, select either Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking for network and Internet access.






If you're able to boot to the Windows desktop:





Click on the ""Start"" button and go to ""Programs"" or ""All Programs"", ""Accessories"", ""System Tools"", then select ""System Restore"".






Leave the radio button on 'Restore my computer to an earlier time'.






Click on 'Next'.






Pick a date before the bad system behaviors began.






Reboot and see if it works better.






If it does not, try again with an earlier restore point.






Go through your documents and files. You'll discover 'versioned' file names of various files that were modified between now and your restore point. Delete or remove the 'old' files and make sure the 'newest' or most correct versions of files exist. Windows XP does not come with a tool to browse the old restore point files to individually recover them, even though that would be super handy. The Windows XP boot disk does not have a 'System Restore' tool to restore Windows to earlier states like this, so your computer must boot to use this method. If the machine does not boot, try one of the methods below to recover your data and your machine.







, This is only possible if your computer came with a shiny Windows CD or DVD that has a hologram-like surface. Also, this will not work for CDs create using nLite. A Windows reinstall will only replace system files. Your data, settings, and installed applications should remain untouched.
Verify that your PC attempts boots to the optical drive by default. Enter your BIOS and look under a ""Boot"" menu or ""Advanced Settings"" section to find the system's boot order. Set the first device to ""ATAPI CD"", ""Optical"", or similar selection. Exit the BIOS and save your settings.
Insert the Windows disc into your optical drive.
Press any key if prompted to do so when your PC prompts you to boot from a disc. Some will boot to an optical disc without any user interaction.
When prompted by the Windows installer, select ""Reinstall"". Make sure you don't accidentally select ""Recover Console"" prior to this menu.
Perform Windows updates once you've completed the reinstall. You may also need to update your hardware drivers as well.

,
Many manufacturers don't give you a Windows boot disc anymore instead you get a 'Recovery Disc' or a 'Recovery Partition' that contains an image of the boot partition in the state hey shipped the machine.
Put the disc in (or boot off the 'recovery partition'), follow the prompts, and the version of Windows with all the right drivers and all of the default unlicensed bundleware that came with the PC will be restored and ready to go and need licensing (or deletion) again. These restores will not restore other applications, licenses, or drivers that were installed since the system was initially used. This restore will most likely wipe any data on the Windows partition, including including personal information, documents, and settings, which includes your 'My Documents' and anyone else's 'My Documents' on the computer.

,
Download and burn a Linux boot disk from your favorite Linux distribution. You may need to use another computer if you have not done this already. As an alternative, use a GParted LiveCD image which includes a very basic copy of the Gentoo Linux distribution.
Boot from the Linux CD.
Mount the Windows partition.
Using Linux, back up your data from the damaged partition onto a USB drive, or the network, or burn a CD.

,
Try 'UBCD' (see link below), a free ISO of a self-booting CD image accompanied by a big pile of tools and utilities.
Various hard disk tools like 'Partition Magic' or 'Norton Utilities' come on a bootable CD that will let you tinker with 'bad' drives. It is best to back up any intact data before attempting to 'recover' lost data.

,
Pull the hard drive out of the dead PC if the computer can't be made to boot, restore or install its operating system.
Install the drive in an external hard drive enclosure (USB, Firewire, and/or eSATA), then attaching in to anther computer. Nearly every external hard drive enclosure can be used temporarily if needed. Otherwise, purchase or find an unused external hard drive enclosure.
Try installing the drive into another computer. Make sure to change any settings in the BIOS to avoid booting to this drive.
Backup the data from the mounted drive. If the drive won't mount, then try data recovery software or professional data recovery services. If that doesn't help, the data on the drive may be permanently lost.

Lock the toolbars to the top of the window.,
Open the options window.,
Require Variable Declaration.,
Create a new module.,
Your environment is set up!",How to Set Up the Environment in Windows Excel 2013 to Write a Macro," The first step to setting up the environment is to open up Excel to a blank workbook. Once the blank workbook is open, click on the “FILE” tab in the menu bar on the upper left hand side of the workbook. (The “FILE” tab will be the only tab highlighted dark green.);
, On the left hand side of the page, there are different options like “Info”, “New”, “Open”, etc. Since we are interested in customizing the workbook format, click on the last button, “Options”.

, A new window will open with a header that says “Excel Options”. On the left hand side of the window there is a menu, find and click the option that says “Customize Ribbon”.

, The window will have two columns, one on the left with a header that reads “Choose commands from:” and the other on the right that says “Customize the Ribbon:”.


Since you are interested in adding the developer tab (which includes all of the tools necessary for coding in VBA) to the ribbon of the workbook, go to the “Customize the Ribbon” column.
Select the option “Developer” and ensure that the box to the left of the word “Developer” has a checkmark. After you have checked the box, press “OK” on the “Excel Options” window so that the changes are implemented.

, The workbook will look almost exactly the same as it did before, but now the “DEVELOPER” tab has been added. Since we need to access different buttons in the developer tab to continue setting up the coding environment, go to the “DEVELOPER” tab and select it.

, Directly under the menu bar, there will be three important buttons to use when writing and running your first macro. The first is the “Visual Basic” button, which is the left most button.


This is the environment that you need in order to write your code. The second is the “Macros” button, which is the button to the right of the “Visual Basic” button. This button opens up a new window that lists all the different macros associated with this workbook and allows you to run any of the macros that you select. The smaller button next to the “Macros” button that says “Record Macro” can be utilized if you do not want or know how to write VBA code but still want to develop a macro. Since you are interested in setting up the environment, select the “Visual Basic” button.

, A new window will open up; this is the Visual Basic environment. In order to write, format and troubleshoot a macro, you must enable a few toolbars. To do so go to the menu bar and select “View”. From there a drop down menu will show, and since we want to add toolbars select the “Toolbars” option.


From here a smaller menu will open to the side and there will be three different options. At this point the “Standard” toolbar will be the only option selected. Since we want the other two toolbars to appear, select both the “Debug” and “Edit” options. Each toolbar will show up on the window as two separate smaller windows.

, Since the toolbars will pop up as little separate windows, it is useful to pin these toolbars near the top of the window so that they stay out of the way. To do this click and hold down on the top portion of one of the toolbar windows where the title of the window is located.


While still holding down on this part of the window, drag the toolbar up towards the top of the page so that it locks onto the top portion of the window. Repeat this process for the other toolbar, keeping in mind that it does not matter exactly where you decide to pin the toolbar. The location of the different toolbars is just a personal preference and you can always move the toolbar once it’s locked by pressing and holding down on the little three vertical dots on the left of the toolbar.
Note: The toolbar windows may disappear when moving between this tutorial and the Excel window. To get the toolbar windows to appear again, select the last button of the standard toolbar that has a line and down pointing arrow.* From here click on the option, “Add or Remove Buttons” and the toolbar windows will appear again.
To find out what each of the buttons do in these new toolbars, you can hover over each button and a small descriptive title for each button will appear.

, An important requirement to enable when writing a macro is to require variable declaration. By enabling this feature, the header of every module will read “Option Explicit”. This requires that all of the variables used in the program are declared and helps avoid errors due to typos. To enable this, go to “Tools” in the menu bar and select “Options…”


By requiring variable declaration, you ensure that if a typo is made when typing a variable name in your VBA code, that the code will not set this typo as a new variable. Otherwise, if a new variable is unintentionally created, then when you run the code you may get either an incorrect output or an error.

, When the “Options” window opens, select and check mark “Require Variable Declaration”. Make sure to press “OK” to save your changes. (20)

, In a VBA programming environment, the area where you physically type in your code is called a Module. Whenever you wish to write a new macro in a workbook, you will need to create a new module. To create a new module, go to the Standard Toolbar and go to the second icon from the left. When hovering over this icon, a small message should appear that says “Insert UserForm”. However, instead of clicking on the icon, click on the small down pointing arrow to the right of this icon. A small drop down menu will appear and select the option that says “Module”.

, A new blank window will appear and this is where your code goes. Your Excel environment is now set up so that you can begin to code in VBA! A good place to start to learn how to code is on Microsoft’s Developer Network.

Close the spreadsheet editor.,
Move and resize the table.,
Double-click the table to make edits.",How to Quickly Make a Table for WordPad2," If you need a little more control over the table, you can use a spreadsheet program. You'll essentially be inserting a spreadsheet into your WordPad document. This requires a compatible spreadsheet editor. WordPad supports Excel and and OpenDocument formats.


OpenOffice and LibreOffice are both free office suites that support the OpenDocument format. See How to Install Open Office for detailed instructions on installing OpenOffice for free.

, In newer versions, this can be found in the Insert section of the Home tab. In older versions of WordPad, click the ""Insert"" menu and select ""Object"".

, A list of objects that you can insert will appear. If you have Excel installed, you can select ""Excel Worksheet"". If you have OpenOffice or LibreOffice installed, you can select ""OpenDocument Spreadsheet"". Selecting one of these objects will insert a blank spreadsheet in your WordPad document, and your spreadsheet program will open in another window.

, After inserting the table, Excel or your OpenDocument spreadsheet editor will open. Anything you enter into the cells in your spreadsheet editor will appear in the table that you inserted into the WordPad document. Go through each cell and fill out the table with the important information.


Even though only a small range of cells is shown in WordPad, the range will expand as you add data outside of the displayed range. If the table is smaller than the initial range, the table will shrink to fit your data.

, You can use the text formatting tools in your spreadsheet program to change the look for the text in the cells. You can change the font, size, color, and emphasis. Formatting text in Excel or your other spreadsheet program is very similar to formatting text in a word processor. The changes you make to the formatting will be displayed immediately in the WordPad table.


You can create headers by bolding the contents of the first row in the spreadsheet program.

, Changes in the size of the rows and columns in your spreadsheet editor will be reflected in the table in your WordPad document immediately. Change the cell size to make your information easy to read.

, This will finalize the data and you'll see your finished table in WordPad.

, You can drag the boxes around the edge of the table to resize it. The content of the table will grow or shrink to match the new size. You can click and drag the table around your document as well.

, This will open your spreadsheet editor, allowing you to change the table data. If you've resized the table, it will be reverted to the original size when you edit it. You'll have to resize it again after editing.

Add your content.,
Save the file as a Rich Text Format (.rtf) file.",How to Quickly Make a Table for WordPad3," Creating a table using your keyboard is only supported in Windows 8 or newer versions of WordPad. If you are running Windows 7 or earlier, you'll need to try one of the other methods in this article.

, When you're using your keyboard to insert automatic tables, the table will start on the line you are currently working on. You can start a table anywhere in your document.

, Use + and - to create the measurements for the first row of cells. Start and end each cell with a +, and use - to indicated how many characters wide the cell is. Don't worry too much about the actual measurements, as you can make adjustments later. See below for an example first row:


+----------+-----+---------------+

, Your characters will turn into the first row of the table, with the + signs becoming the borders of the cells. You can start typing text into each of the cells. The cells will resize automatically if the amount of text is too much to fit.

, Move the cursor to the very end of the first row, so that it is flashing right on the outside of the table border. Press ↵ Enter to create a second row for the table. Repeat this process to continue adding rows to the table.


Pressing Tab ↹ while in the last cell will create a new row. Continuing to press Tab ↹ will move to the next available cell, creating a new row when you reach the end of the last row of the table.

, Once you've added a few rows, you can use your mouse to resize them. Find the border that you want to move and click and drag it.

, Now that the table has been created, you can start adding your information to it. Simply move from cell to cell and enter the information that you want to add to the table. You can highlight and format the text however you'd like., This format will keep your newly-created table. If you save it as a text (.txt) file, your table formatting will be lost. Rich Text Format files can be opened in most word processors.


You can also save it as a OpenOffice XML Document (.docx), which can be opened in Word.

The name of each program should be on the far right-hand side of the box below, labeled “Startup Item.” The next row over to the right should be “Manufacturer.” These are important because before you disable a program, you need to know what it does for your computer. For example, it is not a good idea to disable your antivirus, which usually starts with the computer. Here are the basic rules to go by:



Look at the Manufacturer: If you are looking down the Manufacturer row and you see “Unknown,” you may be looking at a suspicious programs. Any program that is worth its salt, and is safe, will show its name off as much as possible (e.g., Apple Inc., Piriform Ltd, Google Inc., etc.).

Look at the Software Updaters: These programs are important to update specific programs on your PC. For example, Google Update should appear in your startup if you have Chrome, Google Drive, or other Google products. Of course, it is up to you if you want to keep these running at startup, but they can slow things down a bit.

When in doubt, Google it. If you are not sure about a company name or program name, and you would like to see what it does or other details regarding the program just go to Google and enter the company or program name. You might type in something like “What is BlueStacks Agent?”, for example.

, Each program should have a small checkbox to its left. Once you have figured out exactly what the program you would like to disable does, just uncheck the box. When you are finished choosing which programs to remove from your startup, hit the “Apply” then “OK” buttons at the bottom.

, A small little box should pop up that has two different buttons in it.

For example, it is not a good idea to disable your anti-virus, which usually starts with the computer. Here are the basic rules to go by:



Look at the Publisher: If you are looking down the Publisher row and you see “Unknown,” it might indicate the program is suspicious. Any program that is worth its salt, and is safe, will show its name there (e.g., Apple Inc., Piriform Ltd, Google Inc. etc.).

Search online: If you are not sure about a company name or program name, and you would like to see what it does or other details regarding the program, search online. On Windows 8, there is a little bit more flexibility here. Right-click on any program name and select “Search online” from the drop-down list. This will open a Google search for that program automatically. Look through the different results until you are sure what you are dealing with.

Review the Startup Impact: On the far right of the startup list, near the top, there should be an option that says “Startup impact.” Basically, there are 3 different levels of impact: low, medium, and high. The higher the impact a program has, the more time the PC will take to boot. This is just another way of deciding which startup items to remove.

, Right-clicking the item you want to remove should open a drop-down menu. If the item you right-click is currently enabled, the top result on the menu should be disable; vice versa for disabled items. Click “Disable” on this menu to disable the startup program.


When a program is enabled, it should move to the top of the startup program list. The disabled items should be under them.

Choose a Linux Distro.,
Try the ""Live CD"" versions first, assuming your computer will boot from the CD drive; most will.,
Use Linux applications that have been ported over to Windows or cross platform applications.,
Back up your important data before you do anything else.,
Get hold of a Linux install CD - when you boot from this, it will take you through the steps required to install Linux.,
Choose which operating system to boot into when once the Linux installation has finished.,
Get comfortable with Linux.,
Wipe your Windows partition (devote your entire hard disk to Linux) once you're comfortable with Linux.",How to Move from Windows to Linux," Research is key. Look into what distribution of GNU/Linux would be best for you. Everyone is different, and all Linux distributions are different, but there will probably be one (or two) that appeals to the most. If you're new to the operating system, it's probably best to go for something like Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, OpenSuse, Mandriva, PCLinuxOS or Linux Mint -- these distributions of Linux are aimed at inexperienced users and will help you along the way. The Ubuntu distribution will no longer send you a CD free of charge, but there are sites on the internet which charge a small fee for postage. The quickest, and probably cheapest way to get Linux is to download an .iso image from the distribution website and burn it to a cd or make a bootable flash drive using a tool like Pendrivelinux. Ubuntu is currently the most popular distribution for users new to Linux and has active support forums.;
, Most distributions offer Live CD ISOs on their website, which you can burn to CD. A Live CD means that Linux will run entirely from a CD and will not touch your Windows installation - this allows you to test out some of the functionality Linux offers without wiping your existing Windows install. If your computer will not boot to a Live CD on the first attempt, try looking at the Boot Order in your computer's BIOS, and setting CD-ROM to a higher priority than your Master Drive.

, Good examples are Firefox, Audacity, VLC, Inkscape and the GIMP. Using these will get you used to the kind of applications available on Linux. Using open source applications will be a real boost when you actually switch over, as it will be relatively painless for, say, an XChat user to use XChat on his new system, rather than a mIRC (Or other Windows-only IRC client) user having to learn an entirely new program.

, If you make a mistake while installing Linux, it's possible you'll have to format your hard drive to put things right. In which case, you will lose all data on it. It is very important you back up if you need to.

, Some distributions, like Ubuntu, actually install from the Live CD, so you do not need to download an additional CD image.

, This is called dual-booting. It is wise to do this before completely converting to Linux to give you something to fall back on if something goes wrong.

, As time goes on you will find you need to boot into Windows less and less. Using Linux is a learning experience, make sure you make the most of the ""community"" help which is available from most distributions of Linux. There is usually a wide community which you can ask questions and there will be people more than willing to help you out with any problems you've got. Make sure you use Google and the ""search"" functions on community websites because people may get irate at answering the same questions all the time in forums and on irc. Visit your distribution's support page or FAQ.

, You'll probably never look back!

Download and install Rainmeter.,

Install a .rmskin format skin.,
Install a compressed format (.zip, .rar) skin.,
Load a skin into your environment after installation is complete.,
Configure your skin.,
Experiment with creating your own skins.",How to Make an Interactive Desktop Background1," Search the web for Rainmeter - the software can be downloaded from their website. The page also has links to helpful documentation and sites to download prefabricated background designs (called ""skins"").


Skins are often functionally interactive. Many utilize plugins that can interact directly with applications or the operating system (e.g. browser searches or volume control). Others may function just as eye candy.
Rainmeter is configured to run automatically after installation and comes preconfigured with the default “Illustro” skin, with helpful hints and tutorials.
Other similar software options include Deskscapes, Windowblinds, or SysAuto, which will work in a similar fashion.;
, Navigate back to the Rainmeter website in your web browser to acquire new skins.

, Press ""Discover"" on the Rainmeter website. Here there are links to various locations (such as Reddit, deviantArt, and the Rainmeter forums) where people show off and share their Rainmeter creations. Skin creations can vary widely in complexity and functionality.


You are also not limited to a single skin; multiple skins can be loaded simultaneously. For example, you may load two separate skins for a media player controller and a custom weather display.
Common skins include designs for browser bars, custom clocks, CPU usage displays, or music player overlays.

, Double-click a .rmskin file, press ""Install"" and Rainmeter will run the self-extractor.


Skin downloads can come in two formats depending on how the creator decided to package them: .rmskin, a format specified for Rainmeter, or an archived folder (.zip, .rar).
Not every feature from a .rmskin installer has to be used. The .rmskin installer will open a window to confirm which features of the skin you want included. You can deselect checkboxes of features you do not want prior to installing.

, If the skin creator compressed their file in this way then you will need to extract the files manually. Right-click and select “Extract Here” to extract them. Now open your Rainmeter ""Skins"" folder (the path will look something like C:\Users\\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins). Drag the recently extracted folder over into the ""Skins"" folder.

, Right-click the Rainmeter tray icon. Load a skin by selecting its name from the menu and the selecting the .ini file from the submenu.


To apply newly installed skins right click the Rainmeter tray icon and select “Refresh All”.
If there are multiple versions of a skin, they will be listed in the “Variants” menu. You can switch between variants at any time if you want a change in design.
Skins can also be unloaded from the right-click menu.

, Click the Rainmeter tray icon in the lower right corner and then select “Manage” to see an overview of your skins and to make changes to their settings. Settings for each skin will vary depending on the way it was designed. You can also access an individual skin’s settings by right-clicking any of its elements on the desktop.

, In order to get started, you will need a text editor to write in Rainmeter’s custom code (functionally similar to HTML, although loading and executing scripts will utilize Lua), and an image editor if you plan to make custom art. There is a lot of tutorial information on the Rainmeter website, but a few core concepts to know are:


A skin is a .ini file. This the most basic level to start with.
Folder structure matters, since skins can have variants, .ini files can be grouped into config folders to identify them (e.g. 2 variant skins for a custom clock)
Multiple skins combine to make a skin suite. The combined package is known as a ""Root"" folder. Roots are what get placed in the ""Skins"" folder when installed.

Normally, people ask “Antivirus soft wares are supposed to be in-built for an OS if they promise security, right?,
Well the answer is, improved security is one of the promises offered by any OS from its previous versions.,
Make sure you're a user with administrative rights.

,
Go on to Control Panel -> System -> Advanced Tab, and under Startup and Recovery click Settings.

,
A new window pops up, in which you must click the ‘Edit’ button.

,
You should see a text file opening up.,
In the last line you should see something like this “/NoExecute=OptIn”.,
Now save the file and close it, for those who want to know where the actual DEP is, under Advanced Tab click on Settings which is under Performance, you should find DEP in the popped up window.

,
Now restart the system, and feel the first speed boost to your XP system.

,Since Vista doesn’t allow you to directly edit the bootloader settings, here is how you do it in Vista.,
Be sure to be a user with administrative rights.

,
Click Start -> Run and then type in “command.com” without quotes and then you should have the command prompt.

,
In there, just type in the following and it doesn't matter which directory you're in.

,” bcdedit.exe /set {currentuser} nx AlwaysOff ” (without quotes)

,
If you did it correctly, it will say “The Command Completed Successfully”.,
For Vista users who do not own Vista Service Pack 1, I would recommend you order it, and get it installed in your system as soon as you can.,
If DEP is disabled, doesn't that make my system more vulnerable to attacks though it improves my speed?”


3rd party Antivirus softwares will rescue you from that trouble, That's what they were built for!",How to Maintain the Speed of a Freshly Installed Windows OS2," So why is it that I can’t find it in my OS?”
, As in Windows, there are two things which can be obviously seen. One is the Windows Firewall, the other is Windows Defender. Both took a giant leap from XP to Vista. But there is a silent warrior performing security measures in Windows apart from the above two. Anyway, I am talking about the Data Execution Prevention(DEP for short) module in Windows systems. By default, it is started up both in XP and Vista when the system boots up, their capabilities are widespread, but in a nutshell what they do, is they monitor every file in your OS, when they are MODIFIED, even in the most slightest way. Although DEP is a really great thing, it does the most to slow down your system. Initially in a freshly installed OS, you won’t even notice DEP’s influence, but as you install and add more files for your OS to monitor, that's when all hell breaks loose. Consider copying a file about the size of 500MB or more, when the OS is fresh, this should be nearly a piece of cake, but when your hard drive is filled up, you can take two cups of coffee before the process gets done, Phew! that's what happened when I had DEP enabled in Vista sometime ago. You can’t really blame DEP, it's doing good to you at the cost of speed, so I think I gave you enough info on this, let's get to the point of disabling them, oh and don't PANIC!! It's no big deal. Here is what you need to do.,,,, This is your system’s bootloader settings, don’t touch anything in their which you don’t know about.

, Bingo!! You found the roots of DEP, all you have to do is change the value “OptIn” to ” AlwaysOff ” (without quotes, ‘A’ and ‘O’ should be in capitals).

,,,,,,,, Now restart the system.

, Personally I felt a great speed boost in Vista SP1 compared to the normal Vista installation. I would recommend you to disable DEP after you install Vista SP1 if you really have the need for speed .

, I wrote this post, because, DEP is somewhat old school to hackers and viruses. They learned to get past them, so DEP is just slowing things down for you, if you think keeping them enabled will save you from malicious codes. As for antivirus softies unlike DEP, they are not embedded to your OS, you can always turn them off with a simple click later, so they don’t pick on your operating system’s speed while your working.

Virtual Memory is very important if your running applications which require large memory space to run.,
Go to the Control panel -> System.,

Under it, there is the Virtual Memory caption.,
Uncheck the box which says “Automatically manage page file sizes for all drives”.

,
If you're having some trouble in picking a virtual memory size for a partition, consider your physical memory space to help.",How to Maintain the Speed of a Freshly Installed Windows OS5," It acts as a standby to load memory-hungry applications until actual physical memory becomes available. It works on the concept of swapping. You're going to use a predefined hard-disk space which is going to emulate the actual physical memory. So let's see how to access your Virtual Memory settings from Windows and modify it to favor speed.,(In case of Vista, look at the left hand side for Advanced System Settings. Click on it).

,, There is another Advanced tab there. Click on it.

, Click on the ‘Change’ button.

,, Now click on custom size, and set the initial and maximum size to be the same value. This is very important because, when you set both the sizes to the same value, it helps to assure Windows that, at any given time, this specified space will be readily available for it to use, if done otherwise, causes some delay for Windows to move from initial value to the mark in the maximum value.

,,


For example, if you have 512MB physical memory in your computer, it's wiser to set the initial and maximum value to the double of 512 in other words set it to 1024MB. Whatever your memory size be, just double it and set it for the virtual memory.

",How to Maintain the Speed of a Freshly Installed Windows OS6," If you're not a big fan of Windows Searching capabilities like in the start menu or when you open a window, you might want to disable the Indexing capabilities of Windows as well.

You should still use extreme caution even when using an automatic registry-cleaning program. Many programs will give you the option of approving the deletions that they want to make; it is recommended that you use one of these programs, rather than one that deletes automatically. Only delete those files that the program thinks are absolutely safe to delete; if you delete recklessly, you could remove files that impair the ability of your other programs to function. Make sure that you follow all directions provided by the program, and if you are unsure whether a file is OK to be deleted, it is best to leave it.

Test your RAM.,
Test your hard drive.,
Strip your computer down to the essentials.",How to Fix the Blue Screen of Death on Windows1," The most common cause of the Blue Screen is a recent change in your computer’s settings or hardware. This is often related to new drivers getting installed or updated. Drivers are software that allow your hardware to communicate with Windows. If you have a restore point, try to load it and see if it helps, it may or may not.Because there are essentially an infinite number of hardware configurations possible, drivers can’t be tested for every possible setup. This means that sometimes a driver will be installed that causes a critical error when communicating with the hardware.;
, Sometimes, a poor connection inside the computer can cause a Blue Screen. Open your case and check to make sure that all the cables are firmly connected and that any cards are seated firmly in their sockets.


This is more difficult for laptops. You can check the hard drive and the RAM to make sure that they are connected properly. Remove the panels in the back that cover the hard drive and RAM with a small Phillips-head screwdriver. Press the components firmly into their connections.

, Overheating can lead to your hardware malfunctioning. One of the most common components to overheat is the graphics card. The second most likely culprit is the CPU.


You can check temperatures in most BIOS menus, or through software in Windows.

, A common culprit in system crashes is a bad stick of RAM. When RAM fails, it causes the system to become unstable. You can test your RAM by using a program called “memtest86”. This program is available for free online, and is run by burning it to a bootable CD.


Reboot your computer and run the program. The memtest software will automatically begin running tests on your computer’s RAM. This may take several minutes to complete. For best results, allow several passes of the test to be completed. Memtest will run indefinitely until you stop it yourself.

, Run the “chkdsk” function on your hard drive to scan for errors and fix potential problems. A failing hard drive can cause Blue Screens due to corrupted files. To run chkdsk, open Computer/My Computer and right-click the disk that you want to scan. Select Properties.


From the Properties screen, select the Tools tab.
Click Check Now in the Error Checking section. Your computer will prompt you to restart in order to scan the disk.

, One way to narrow down what is causing the problem is to remove everything that is not essential for the PC to run. This way, if the error goes away, you know that it was one of the pieces that you disconnected.


A desktop computer needs the motherboard, CPU, a hard disk, power supply, RAM, and a keyboard. Plug your monitor into your motherboard’s monitor port (if it has one) so that you can disconnect the graphics card. Everything else can be removed during the diagnostic process.
If the computer runs fine after stripping it down, add one part back at a time until the error message appears again. This will let you know which device is causing the computer to crash.
This method does not apply to laptops, as you cannot strip it down.

As the computer is booting, repeatedly hit the F8 key until the Windows boot menu appears. Select Safe Mode with Networking to boot into a stripped down version of Windows. This will allow you to access your Device Manager, the internet, and other system tools.

, Sometimes viruses and malware are at the root of a Blue Screen problem. Make sure that you have the latest antivirus software installed, and perform a full system scan to find anything that could be causing problems.

, This is a quick alternative to completely reinstalling Windows, as it only copies system files to your computer. This is useful if an essential file has become corrupt and is causing your computer to fail.


To perform a repair installation, insert your Windows disc and boot from it. In the setup menu, select Repair Installation. Windows will delete old Windows files and copy new ones. You will not lose any personal data.

, If the cause of the problem is hardware, the first thing you should try is rolling back drivers. This process will install an older version of the driver software, potentially getting rid of the conflict.


Open the Device Manager. You can access this by opening the Start Menu and right-clicking on Computer/My Computer. Select Properties, then Device Manager. In Windows 8, press Windows+X and select Device Manager from the list.
Select the hardware that you want to roll back. You may have to expand categories to find it. Right-click on the icon and select Properties.
Click the Driver tab. Select Roll Back Driver and confirm that you want to roll it back.
Continue using your computer as normal. Once your driver has been rolled back, continue to use your computer to verify that the error does not occur again. Do 'not' update the driver again until a newer version is released.

, If rolling back the driver did not fix the problem, consider restoring to an older, working installation of Windows. This will let you determine if the Windows updates are responsible for your Blue Screen.Open System Restore. You can find System Restore by searching for it in the search bar in the Start menu. Open the program, and select a date from the calendar before you started experiencing errors.
This will reset all of the updates and settings to that date, effectively removing any updates added afterwards. Use this to determine if a specific Windows update is what caused your malfunction.

, If Windows does not have enough space on the disk it is installed on, it can cause system failures. Remove unnecessary files and programs if you have less than 15% of your hard disk free.

, If rolling back drivers and updates didn’t work, installing the newest versions and updates (if they weren’t installed already) may fix your problem. Check your Windows Update program to see if there are any new system and hardware updates available.


Click Start and search for “Windows Update”. In Windows 8, tap the Windows key and then start typing “Windows Update”.

, If you cannot track down the error, you can try a full reinstallation of Windows as a way to reset your computer. Make sure that you have all of your important files backed up before doing so, as your hard drive will be formatted for the install process.


If the Blue Screen is being caused by a failing piece of hardware, reinstalling Windows will not fix the problem. You will need to find and replace the piece of hardware that is causing problems.

, If driver and update rollbacks do not solve your problem, you may need to remove and replace your hardware. Replacing anything other than the RAM or hard drive on a laptop can be difficult and expensive.


If the RAM test shows that you have faulty memory, you will want to replace the failing stick as soon as possible.
If the hard disk scanner is returning disk errors, you should back up your data and install a new drive. This will require reinstalling Windows if the drive has your Windows installation on it.
If your graphics card is failing, replacing it could get expensive. This is almost impossible to fix in most laptops. For a desktop, open your case and swap out the old card for a new one.

If your cable looks like two cables glued together, each one will contain an insulated wire (the signal) and a bare wire (the ground).
Apple headphones and other headphones with single cables have two insulated wires (the left and right signal) and a single bare ground wire.

, Cut the cord in half. If the wire inside is shredded, cut on either side of it to remove the problem. If you do this, remove the same amount from the left and right cords. Uneven lengths of cord can cause electrical damage to your headphones.If only one of your wires is broken, you might want to skip to soldering the wire, without cutting or splicing.This will save time, but the repair will be less sturdy.

, This is a rubber tubing that looks just like the rest of your headphone cable. Slide it onto the cable for later. After your repair, you'll slide this back over the open area to protect it.


If you had to cut the wire several times to find the problem, slip on a tube over each cut.

, This means you'll be joining the wires together. Make sure to connect wires with the same color insulation (or no insulation). You have two options: a pigtail splice and an in-line splice.For a pigtail splice, hold the two exposed sections of wire that you want to join parallel to each other, then twist them together to create a join. This is quick and easy, but the repair will be bulkier.
For an in-line splice, hold the wires so that they overlap end to end. Twist the wires in opposite directions. This is more difficult but the repair is easier to hide.


, Use a soldering iron to melt a small dab of solder over the wires. Repeat for each splice. Let cool.


Bare wires without insulation usually have a thin coat of protection. Sand this off or burn it off with the soldering iron before you solder. Avoid breathing in the fumes.Once cooled, wrap the two pairs of joins in electrical tape to ensure the red and white ends are kept separate from the ground wire.

, Warm with a heat gun to shrink it. Aren't you glad you slid it over before your soldered?


The tube should shrink down to a quarter of its original size, fitting snugly to protect and strengthen your newly repaired section of cable.

, You can find these for cheap online or at an electronics store. Select a metal plug with stereo connection and a spring. Make sure it's the same size as your old plug, typically 3.5mm., Some plugs can be unscrewed from the cable. If your plug is molded on to the plastic, you'll need to cut it off instead, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the plug.









If your plug unscrews, look at the wires. If they all seem connected and unbroken, cut the cable off anyway. The problem is probably in the cable right next to the plug.

, There will normally be one ""loose"" wire (unshielded) and two insulated, or shielded, wires. The bare one will be the earth or ground wire, the others are left signal and right signal.









Side-by-side cables have an additional bare wire, but are otherwise the same as single cables.

, Unscrew the new plug. Slip the cover and spring over the end of the cable. Slip on a piece of shrink tubing as well.









The plug base should have two pins sticking out of the end. If it only has one, then you have got a mono, not stereo, plug.

, Separate each of the three wires in your cable. Twist any frayed ends together so each wire has a thin tip. Tie these firmly to the jack plug as follows:Bare copper wire connects to the sleeve probe, the longest piece of metal. If there is no bare wire, connect the wire with striped insulation.
The remaining two (insulated) wires connect to the other two pins (the tip and ring probes). There's no universal color code for these. If you connect them the wrong way round, the left and right audio will be switched. The headphones will otherwise work fine.

, Use a small clip or vise to keep them firmly in place. None of the three wires should touch the other two.

, Use sandpaper to roughen the edges to make it easier to solder to metal. Apply solder to a pin. Heat the pin to melt the solder. Repeat for the other two wires.








, Screw on the cap over the spring and plug. Test your headphones again. If you still have problems, most likely the wires are touching. Unscrew the cap and tug the wires apart.








, This process is different for each model. Look online for specific directions, or try the following:Look for screws on the earpiece. You may need a size 0 crosshead screwdriver.
Tug the padding gently. If it comes off, look for screws underneath it.
Insert a spudger or other flat tool into the crack at the base of the earpiece dome. Lever it apart. This may cause damage to some models, so finding directions first is recommended.
Earbuds can be tugged apart, but you may need a new rubber seal afterward.The problem is usually in the cable for earbuds.

, If you're lucky, the problem will be obvious. Any wires loose inside the earpiece need to be reattached to the headphone driver. Look for small metal pins, hopefully with other wires attached to some of them. Solder the wire back into position over the bare pin.


If more than one wire is loose, you may need to find a manual to see which wire goes where.
Make sure none of the wires touch each other.

, You can buy a new headphone driver online, but this may be quite expensive. If you decide replacement is worth the cost, take your headphones and new driver to a repair shop. You can try it yourself, but there's a high risk of damage:Cut the rubber seal around the central cone with a sharp knife.
Remove the conical driver.
Place the new driver back in the same slot. Be very careful not to touch the thin diaphragm.
If it doesn't feel secure, use a small amount of glue around the edge.

Tape over their mouse's sensor.,
Coat their soap or deodorant with clear nail polish.,
Use a ""Febreze grenade"".,
Plant a whoopie cushion under a friend's seat.,
Hide an air horn behind a door.,
Freak them out with spooky late-night noises.,
Replace their desktop with a convincing screenshot.",How to Trick Your Friends1," This simple computer prank can leave your friend struggling with an unresponsive mouse for minutes before figuring out what's going on. When your friend is using a computer, wait until s/he leaves for a moment, then quickly slip a piece of tape on the bottom of the mouse so that it blocks the sensor (usually, on modern mouses, this is the part shining a red light). Rearrange the mouse and wait for your friend to return. Take a seat with a good view and watch your results!


Many older mouses use a rubber trackball, rather than a light-based sensor. In this case, you may want to steal the ball to have the same effect as taping the sensor. However, since removing the ball can make these types of mouse feel noticeably lighter, an even better bet is to quickly remove the ball, tape over the small rollers inside the ball compartment, and replace the ball before your friend gets back.;
, If your victim is a clean freak, this prank will drive her mad! When you go to your friend's house, bring a bottle of clear nail polish (which should be available for quite cheap at your local grocery or department store). Excuse yourself to go to the bathroom, then, when you're there, snoop around for a bar of your friend's soap or a stick of her deodorant. Carefully paint the surface of the soap or deodorant until it has a thorough (but invisible) layer of nail polish. The next time your friend tries to wash her hands with the soap or apply her deodorant, she won't be able to figure out why it isn't working!


Obviously, this trick only works for bar soap and stick deodorant. Liquid soap and spray-on or roll-on deodorant can't be sabotaged this way.

, A little air freshener can be a good thing, but too much can make a room smell like a chemical spill. For this quick but highly effective prank, all you'll need is an aerosol can of air freshener with a trigger-style spray mechanism and a strong plastic zip tie. When your friend is in a confined area, like his bedroom, sneak up on him and subtly slip the loop of the zip tie around the air freshener's trigger, but don't tighten it yet. Get ready to run, then strike quickly and without warning — pull the zip tie tight around the trigger, throw the grenade into the room, shut the door, and run!

, Another old classic, this trick relies on the fact that flatulence is almost never not funny, especially when it's unexpected. This trick is tantalizingly easy — simply wait until your friend leaves her seat, then sneak a fully inflated whoopie cushion onto it, and let your friend do the rest of the work for you!


To make the whoopie cushion harder to see, try slipping it under the seat's cushion. Just be sure to give the air a path to excuse or you may get a loud bang rather than the intended ""noise"".

, This prank is the louder, more shocking cousin to the classic whoopie cushion prank. To perform this prank, you'll need a loud, aerosol can-style air horn (usually available at hardware or department stores for $10-20 and under) and some strong duct tape. Remove any protective caps from the air horn's button, then tape the base of the horn to the wall behind a door so that the doorknob will knock into the air horn button when opened. Next, just wait for your victim to open the door and get a shock they won't forget!


Obviously, you'll want to pick a door that this person is likely to walk through. You'll also want to tell other people who may walk through the door about your prank ahead of time. If someone else triggers the air horn, it may ruin the prank for your friend.

, This one's great for sleepovers. Wait until it's dark out, it's fairly quiet, and people are getting ready for bed. Excuse yourself from your group of friends by pretending you have to run home to get something you've forgotten. Then, when you're gone, silently sneak into a spot where your friends will be able to hear you, but can't see you. Start to make creepy noises ever-so-quietly. For instance, you might scratch at the wall and make whispered breathing sounds. Start out very quiet, but gradually get louder and more frequent until your friends are shaking in their beds!


Top your trick off by suddenly stopping and sneaking away from your hiding spot. Walk back into the room a few minutes later as if nothing has happened.

, This computer prank is even more effective than the mouse prank above, but it needs a little more time. When your friend is away from his computer, take a screenshot of the desktop with no programs or windows open. If you're on a Windows PC, you should then open a simple image-editing program, like Paint, paste the image into the program, and crop out the taskbar at the bottom of the screen. Save the image and set it as the desktop background. Finally, remove all of the icons currently on the desktop. When your friend returns, his desktop should look exactly how he left it, but he won't be able to click on any of the icons! Depending on the person, this one can take hours to figure out!


On a Windows PC, the default keyboard shortcut for taking a screenshot is the ""Print Screen"" button (often shortened to ""prt sc"" or something similar). On a Mac, the shortcut is Command-Shift-3."

Creatively replace an ingredient in their favorite food.,
""Get lost"" and surprise them when in the wilderness.,
""Paper"" a friend's room or car.,
Rearrange the keys on their keyboard.,
Trick them into holding a bowl of water on the ceiling.,
Put their things in jello.,
Bake them a balloon cake.This prank is great if your friend's birthday is coming up.",How to Trick Your Friends2," One of the worst things to experience (and funniest things to watch) is biting into your favorite food, only to discover that something is very, very wrong. If your friend absolutely loves a certain snack or dish, try replacing one of the ingredients in this food with an ingredient that looks the same, but tastes very different. Be warned — your friend will not be happy with you after this prank! Below are just a few ideas to get you started:


Replace the cream in Oreos with mayonnaise or toothpaste.
Replace cake frosting with plain cream cheese.
Replace the sugar on snickerdoodles with salt.
Replace the apples in caramel apples with onions or radishes.
Replace cola with clear soda and soy sauce.

, This may be (quite literally) the oldest trick in the book. It's probably a safe bet that people were pulling this prank on each other before the rise of civilization itself. However, if done well, it's still just as simple, easy, and effective today as it was back then. When you and some friends are walking outside (preferably in a forest, but anywhere with places to hide will do), let the group walk ahead of you. Slowly and quietly fall back and hide behind a tree or rock. They'll soon notice you're missing and, with luck, will start to look for you. When they get near, pop out and shout to startle them. That's all there is to it!


For added effect, try imitating animal noises while you're hiding to freak your friends out. If you're sneaky enough, you may even be able to sneak out of your hiding place and into another without them noticing.

, This classic trick can take a lot of time, but the effects are almost always unforgettable. When your friend is away, take wrapping paper or sticky notes and completely cover her room or car (or both)! The more you can cover, the better. Ideally, her room or car should be completely unrecognizable by the time you're done. Don't use strong glues or tapes, as these can damage your friend's property. Instead, stick to the weak glue on the back of sticky notes or delicate masking tape.


If you're using sticky notes, you may want to consider spelling out a snarky message by arranging the notes in the shape of letters. For instance, if your victim is going to discover this prank after being away for a long period of time, you might want to spell out ""Welcome home!""
Be sure to get permission from your friend's parents, roommates, or coworkers before sneaking into her room or tampering with her car. To someone who doesn't know what's going on, it can look like you're trying to break in or vandalize her property. Getting arrested can really derail your prank, so always play things safe.

, This computer prank requires a little more work than simply taping over your friend's mouse sensor, but the reaction when she figures out what's going on is absolutely priceless! First, get a hold of your friend's laptop or computer keyboard. Then, to be safe, ensure the laptop or keyboard is off and is not connected to any power source. Use a flat, skinny object like a screwdriver or a butter knife to gently pry the keys up and pop them out of their spaces. Finally, press each key back into its new spot until it ""clicks"" into place.


While you may want to simply re-arrange the keys randomly, you can also spell out a taunting message (e.g., ""Dorkus"", ""Umadbro?"", ""Watsup"", etc.) with the new arrangement of the keys. If you do this, don't forget that you can only use each letter once!
Keep in mind that not all keyboards have removable keys. If you're unsure whether removing your friend's keyboard keys will damage his keyboard, try looking up cleaning instructions for the model of keyboard online.
Avoid removing the space bar, as, in some setups, this key can be very difficult to replace., This prank is absolutely devilish if it's pulled off well, but it can result in a big watery mess, so you'll want to do it somewhere where the floor can't be damaged by water, like in a kitchen with linoleum floors. Fill a plastic (not glass or ceramic) bowl with water almost to its rim, then set up a small ladder or stepping stool and grab a broom. Call your friend over. Tell him that you want to show him a magic trick — you'll make the water disappear from the bowl without touching it, but you need his help. Climb your stepping stool with the bowl of water and press it against the ceiling of the room. Then, ever so carefully, have your friend use the end of the broom handle to hold the bowl in place against the ceiling. When he is supporting the bowl, move the stepping stool away from him while explaining that you need room to perform your trick. Then, run away laughing!


Your friend will be stuck in a tricky situation — he can't get the bowl of water down because it won't balance on the tip of the broom stick and he can't reach it with his hands, so eventually he'll have to let it come crashing down, soaking himself. This is why it's important to use a sturdy, non-breakable plastic bowl.

, This prank, popularized by the TV show The Office, is a big hit simply for its ridiculousness. To start, you'll need to steal some small but important possession of your friend's. Don't pick something which can be damaged by moisture, like a phone or tablet. Pens and, of course, small metal tools like staplers work well. Next, you'll want to make half a bowl of jello. Allow it to set, then and add your friend's possession on top of the solid jello. Add more liquid jello above and wait for this to set. When your jello is nice and firm, the stolen object should be suspended in the middle of the mold. Leave it in the place your friend normally keeps the object and wait for him to stumble across it.


Keep in mind that gelatin will slowly melt if exposed to heat, so don't leave the jello'd item in a spot that's warm or near sensitive materials that can be damaged by moisture.

, First, inflate an ordinary balloon with air (don't use helium). Then, set your balloon on a cake platter and cover it with frosting. Add thin strips of actual birthday cake around the balloon to make your cake look more realistic. Spread frosting over the gaps between the cake and the balloon until, from the outside, your creation looks like a normal birthday cake (or as close as you can get it). Decorate the cake as you normally would. When the time comes, present it to your friend and ask him to cut it. When the knife hits the balloon, he'll get a surprise present he wasn't expecting!

Flood a room with balloons.,
Arrange for a mock disciplinary hearing.,
Disguise yourself as a piece of furniture.,
Make your friend think everyone has forgotten his birthday.,
Put all of their furniture on the ceiling.",How to Trick Your Friends3," This prank is a favorite of graduating seniors, but there's no reason you can't use it on one of your friends outside of school. When your friend is away, get permission from her parents or roommates to sneak into her room. Inflate as many balloons as you can and pack them into her room. You really want to fill her room here — the fuller, the better. Ideally, when she returns, she'll open her door, only for a floor-to-ceiling wave of balloons to come crashing down on her!


This prank can take quite some time to set up, but one of the best things about it is that it's pretty quick (and entertaining) to clean up. All you need is something sharp, like a pointed stick or a pair of scissors, and you can start cutting through the sea of balloons like butter!

, If you're not squeamish about making your friend sweat, this is the trick for you. However, this prank requires your friend's boss, teacher, or principal to be willing to do a little acting. Talk this person about setting up a fake disciplinary hearing for your friend. Your friend's boss or teacher should call your friend away from his class or work and act as though he's in serious trouble. The boss or teacher should present fake evidence that your friend has done something against the rules (like cheating or stealing) and should recommend some sort of serious punishment (like detention or a pay cut). At the last second, reveal the joke and watch the look on your friend's face!


For example, if your friend is in school, you might arrange for his principal to pull him out of class one day and bring him to the office. Here, he might present a note (which you've written and signed with your friend's name) about how he thinks the principal looks like a fat, disgusting pig. Let the principal make your friend squirm for a while, then burst through the door laughing.
Be careful with this prank — it's not for the faint of heart. If you pull this prank on the wrong person, it can easily lead to tears and seriously hurt feelings, so only use it on people that you know will be able to take the joke.

, No one ever expects their furniture to come to life while they're using it, so this prank is great for catching even the most paranoid friends by surprise. However, it requires a lot of work and some knowledge of sewing and carpentry. The basic idea is that you'll want to modify a chair so that you can sit inside it — that is, your feet should touch the floor, your arms should be in the armrests, and your upper body should be in the upholstery in the back of the chair. When your friend sits down in the chair, wait a few minutes, then start moving. You will get an amazing reaction of confusion mixed with pure terror every time!

, It's everyone's secret worst nightmare — the people they care about the most have all forgotten their special day. This prank requires a lot of work on your part. You'll need to contact your friend's parents, her friends, close acquaintances, coworkers, teachers, and so on to ensure than none acknowledge her birthday. Luckily, if you can manage to get everyone to agree to it, it's not terribly hard to pull off — all everyone has to do is simply say nothing out of the ordinary.


Don't let your friend become depressed! For the best results, follow this prank up with a surprise party to let your friend know that you do care.

, This prank is a serious undertaking, but the results can (quite literally) turn your friend's world upside down. Using nails, screws, glue, and any other tools necessary, attach all of your friend's furniture to the ceiling in exactly the same arrangement as it is in normally. For extra attention to detail, try taping or gluing his personal possessions in place exactly as they normally are, only upside down.


Obviously, you'll want the permission of your friend's parents, roommates, and/or landlord before performing this trick. You'll also need plenty of time to work, so this trick is often best if the friend is out of town for some time.

Make sure it's been at least a couple of months before deciding to become friends.,
Discard anything that reminds you of the relationship.,
Make sure you're not Facebook stalking them.,
Try to make your run-ins as least awkward as possible.,
Make sure to make eye contact.,
Don't look at your phone all the time.,
Smile.,
Be confident.,
Don't call or text them 24/7.,
Understand what the whole point of becoming friends after a relationship is about.,
Make yourself some boundaries about talking about them too often or your friends talking about them.",How to Tolerate an Ex for the Sake of Mutual Friends," This will help make sure you're probably over him or her.;
, Either throw it out, or pack it in a box and store it away.

, It's already unhealthy enough as it is to Facebook or Instagram or whatever you use to stalk them, before or during a relationship. Yes, many people do this but tracking their moves still proves you're not over them, no matter how much you tell yourself you're not. It's like taking a step back instead of forward.

, Avoid awkward handshakes or hugs. Depending on how the relationship ended, try to be the bigger person.

, If you don't they will suspect that you're trying to avoid a conversation of some type.

, Your ex is still a person and it's still considered rude to check your phone.

, That is the number one thing to do. Show them you're the bigger person. You're happy without them. You're not sobbing your eyes out (regardless of the fact that you might have been doing that for months) and eating through hundreds of ice cream tubs.

, Confidence is key. Make a conversation. Engage with them, just as if you're making a new friend even though you've probably kissed them and slept with them.

, Honestly, try to avoid doing it most of the time unless you guys are in a really good place. Even if you guys are on a good level, still try not to text them a lot. It will drag you right back into the relationship.

, Basically, it's to forget the former intimate relationship and to be basic friends and nothing else. Don't get all awkward when someone brings them up in a conversation.

, You might get a little obsessed."

Decide whether you really like the person you would like to tell your friends about.,
Choose which friends you would like to tell.,
Find somewhere private to tell your friends.,
Tell your friend quickly, quietly, and get to the point fast.,
Stay relaxed about it.",How to Tell Your Friends Who You Like," If you don't have real feelings for them, there's no point in telling anyone.


Talk to the person you like and think about how you feel. If you've liked other people before, are the feelings you're experiencing similar?
Consider what it is that has made you like this person. Have you always liked them? Are you just feeling lonely? These are some important questions to think about.;
, This can be the crucial step that affects the outcome of telling your friends who you like.


Make a list of your closest friends, and then eliminate the one who are most likely to gossip. Leave only the people you trust the most on your list.
Who have you told secrets to before? Use past experiences to judge who you can tell things, and who you can't.
Don't make anyone mad, or announce to everyone that you like someone. Some people might get offended if you don't tell them or constantly hound you with questions, so only actually tell the people that you want to.
Who would tell you who they like? These people can be trustworthy.

, You don't want to tell them who you like in front of other people, as they might hear or try to join in with your conversation.


You could invite your friends over to your house, or go to their houses, as they are the most private places you can find without being disturbed.
Do not tell anyone who you like through technology or social media unless absolutely necessary. You should always tell them in person, since screenshots can easily be taken and posted anywhere, or could be shown to anyone (including the person you like).
Try to avoid telling people at school, since once again, people will expect to know what you're talking about.

, If you act like it's not a big deal, they will make less of a fuss about it.


Don't let what anyone thinks affect your feelings. It's your life, and they can't control it.
If your friends ask you questions, give them simple, short answers. Don't reveal too much information as you might seem desperate. Always make sure you don't lie to your friends, though.
Stay calm and collected. When you see the person you like, make a point to talk to them or smile at them in front of your friends. That way, they won't feel the need to talk to the person themselves, which can be embarrassing.

, If your friends continually ask you questions, answer them politely and don't get angry.


Sometimes, people can become annoying when they're constantly asking you things. Ask them to stop, and they probably will, considering they are your trusted friend.
If anyone teases you about your crush, just laugh it off. They will most likely laugh with you, which can help you to bond within your relationship.

Decide that it's time to tell your friends.,
Figure out who needs to be told.,
Choose good places to meet up and discuss the move.,
Be honest and say exactly what is happening.,
Expect a range of reactions.,
Explore the options for staying in touch with your friends.,
Realize that many of your current friends will fade away over time.",How to Tell Your Friends That You Are Moving," It's not a good idea to say anything until you are absolutely certain that you're moving. Sometimes your family may just make noises about moving or perhaps a job offer has happened but then last minute changes mean you don't have to move after all. It can be confusing to tell people you're leaving only to have it not happen, so be certain first. Also, don't keep the moving away a secret–this isn't fair to your friends and it'll be awful when you suddenly just ""disappear"". Keeping it a secret won't make it any easier to leave; in fact, without your friends' support, it can be a whole lot harder.;
, Naturally, your best friend(s) and all your other close friends need to know. However, you may also wish to tell more distant friends, if you've connected well with them over time, rather than letting them learn from someone else. It will also be a good idea to work out whether you want to tell some friends individually or tell everyone at the same time.


Sometimes it might be easier to tell one friend and let that friend tell other friends. It will depend on the context of your friendships.

, If you know that a friend is likely to cry or react badly, find somewhere private to talk. It isn't fair to subject them to the glare of onlookers. Suggested places include seating away from other people, outside in a yard or under trees, a place where nobody is likely to know you such as a cafe, etc. For really special friends, it can be nice to go somewhere to have a drink and something to eat together (cafe, bar, restaurant), so that you can spend a lot of time together, feeling relaxed and talking about the future possibilities.


Have some tissues to offer in case.
If you're telling a group of friends, have them gather somewhere easy like around a lunch table or sitting on the ground outside.

, Once you know you're moving, come out with the fact and make it clear where you're moving to and when this will likely happen. Most of your friends will want to know why you're moving, so make that clear if you can. If you can't, talk to your family about what you can say to other people. You may want to include some of the following things:


How much you will miss everyone/your friend. If you don't want to leave, express this.
How you expect your friends to come and visit you.
How you've already checked out the things that are fun to do in the new place and you can't wait for them to come and try. Tell them they're welcome to stay with you.

, It is likely that your good friends will be upset. Some friends may react in a way that covers up their sadness or shock, such as pretending it's ""whatever"" or reacting as if you don't care about them. For any friend who reacts negatively, realize that this is likely because your friend has had a sudden shock and is hurting at the news you're about to go. Try to be understanding and give this person some space. You can come back to this person later and talk again.


Feel free to ask your friends how they feel about you leaving. Let them talk openly and listen.

, If you don't already have their contact details, now is the time to start gathering!


Connect on social media networking sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.
Share cell phone details for plenty of texts–texts don't cost a lot, are easy to use and will keep you in touch quickly.
Open and share Skype or Google Hangout accounts so that you can see each other face to face now and then. Book the first catch-up for the first week of your arrival!
Share snail mail addresses. You never know when you might want to send a parcel of good cheer.

, Initially, it's possible that lots of your friends will try to stay in touch. But people's lives change, and just as things would change when you're around each other, they'll also change when you're apart. Do your best to stay in touch but be realistic; whittle it down to the friends you really do care most about and focus most on staying in touch with them.

Consider what it is about the guy that makes you think you're also falling for him.,
Consider your friendship.,
If you've decided this guy is worth the struggle, discuss your feelings with your friend.,
Explain that you fancy the same fellow that she does but that you realize that your friendship comes first.,
Explain why this guy matters to you without laying it on thick.,
Finish up by saying that you don't want to fight about him.,
Give her plenty of time and space to talk.,
Try to keep the friendship at the heart of the solution.,
If she starts dating him, or before, make a pact that boyfriends won't get in the way of you two being close friends.

,
If she does let you have, him wait!,
Leave this guy alone.,
Get over him.,
Bear in mind that no matter how new, how odd or how serious the relationship is, it isn't your place to be the wedge in it.",How to Tell Your Best Friend That You Are in Love With the Same Guy," Maybe he's cute, hunky, sweet or smart. Or is it because he hangs around the two of you a lot and you feel a connection? Or maybe, just maybe, there is a little competitiveness between you and your friend for his attentions? Whatever the reason, it is really important to think about your feelings objectively. Are these feelings so strong that it is worth rocking a friendship over? Or is this just a fleeting impression that a bit of distraction doing something else of focusing elsewhere will help you to overcome?;
, Your friendship came first, and friendship is complex. It comes with layers of having spent time together, sharing secrets, having each other's back. Are you going to let a guy come between all of that now? There are certainly plenty of other possible love matches out there in the world; why this particular one right now?

, Tell her how you're feeling but don't just blurt out ""I'm in love with X. I saw him first."" Approach the matter with great tact and a whole lot of love.


For example, let your friend know that you need to talk to her about something that is difficult for you. Ask for her understanding and a willingness to hear you out.







, This alerts her immediately to the fact that you are willing to put the friendship before all else. You had better be genuine about this intent too or she will see through you.

, Don't give her any guilt tripping, such as suggesting that you'll die if you can't have him. Instead, tell her the exact factual things about him that attracted you to him. If he has given any indication of liking you back, again, give brief factual details of this impression but don't turn it into something it isn't. A mere wink might just have been his wish to join in the fun and get along with you while a hug and a whisper of ""I really like you"" is definitely something more substantial to pass along.


Tell her that you don't want to like him - sometimes your best mate will say"" just stop liking him"". This may seem hard but agree to the statement so it won't cause conflict between you.







, Re-emphasize that the friendship comes first and that you simply wanted to place your feelings out in the open and talk freely about where both of you think things should go next. Even if your BFF reacts angrily or wants to start a fight, do not allow this to escalate; do not respond aggressively.

, Really listen to what she has to say; fight any tendency to argue with her or to suggest that her feelings aren't as real as yours. Both of you will need to be respectful of the feelings while trying to reach a realistic compromise on what is best for both of you from this point on.

, You have several possibilities from here: 1. She says ""go for it"" to you and bows out gracefully; 2. You say ""go for it"" to her and bow out gracefully; 3. You both agree the guy isn't worth the friendship and agree to keep him as a friend but neither of you pursue him romantically. 4. You argue, fall out and the friendship ends in a flurry of competitiveness over him. It is to be hoped that number 4 isn't the outcome, so acknowledge it's a possibility and do your best to steer clear of it. With these four possibilities in mind, discuss between the two of you how to move forward from here.

,, Don't rush into the relationship because that's kind of snappish. She might be testing you to see if you accept the offer to see how much you like him. Never take the first offer.

, Let your friend have him and let their story unfold as it is intended. None of you know the end story but meddling with it won't do you any good, and you'll lose a friend.

, Do not tell your BFF that you have or had feelings for this guy. Let it rest and be prepared to move on. Keep calm and act normally around the two of them together and him alone.

, Consider whether you really want to break someone's heart. Consider how comfortable you'd feel with a guy who would readily start seeing you in place of your best friend.

Keep track of how many times he starts conversations.,
Note if he asks you about other men.,
Consider how often you hang out alone.","How to Tell if Your Guy Friend Sees You As Just ""One of the Guys""1"," If he refers to you gives you a boyish nickname, it means he is comfortable around you. Furthermore, if he calls you by the same names he calls his other male friends, it could be a sign that you are close friends but nothing more. Flirty or unique nicknames—such as honey, babe, or cutie— can indicate that he is interested in you romantically. Platonic names could include dude, man, bro, and guy.
Flirty nicknames could include babe, sweetie, honey, cutie, and doll.;
, If the topics of your conversations only revolve around sports, raunchy jokes, vehicles, or video games, he is keeping your interactions platonic. If he confides in you his deepest insecurities and secrets, he may be opening up to you in a way that he does not with his male friends.


If he's interested, he may make specific comments about your sexuality and body. If his sexual comments are about other women or women in general, it may mean that he just sees you as one of the guys.

, If he doesn’t initiate texts or conversations, he likely just sees you as a friend. But if he is constantly texting, calling, and asking to meet up, it could be a sign that he wants to become closer to you.

If he texts you first thing in the morning and last thing at night, it could mean that he is thinking about you when he is alone. Similarly, if he texts you back immediately, it could signal interest.
If he does not respond to your texts for long periods of time, it may mean that he considers you a friend only.

, If he keeps asking you about your relationships with other men, he may be trying to determine if you are single or not. If you both have mutual male friends, he may be concerned that you are seeing one of them instead of him.


If a man demands to know what you are doing with other men, it is a sign of a jealous or controlling personality. If your male friend tries to prevent you from hanging out with other men, take it as a red flag and establish boundaries. , If you only ever see each other in group settings, you may struggle with determining if he likes you or not. Try asking him to hang out alone. If he’s up for it, he may still see you as a friend, but if he doesn’t want to hang out alone, he is signaling that he is uninterested. If you hang out alone often, it may indicate that he cares deeply for you.


When you're alone together, he may touch you more than he does in public, or he may bring up deep conversations. These conversations may be about past relationships or insecurities about his future. This can be read as a sign that he trusts you. Such trust may be an indicator of a deeper relationship.
If he acts the same way alone with you as he does in public, it still means you're good friends, but it may signal that he is uninterested in a romantic relationship.

Pay more attention to her body language.,
Look for any changes in how she behaves towards you.,
Take notes on her eye contact.,
Pick up specific clues that she may be interested in a relationship with you.",How to Tell if a Female Friend Wants a Romantic Relationship1," This can be your biggest clue that she may have romantic intentions. When you hang out with her in a group of friends, does her body face yours more often? Does she tend to sit closer to you than anyone else? Does she touch you more often than her other friends? If the answer to these questions is yes, she may have more than platonic feelings.Some other examples of body language that may indicate interest when she’s talking to you:


She touches her hair a lot.
She smiles more frequently.
She fiddles with random objects.
She sits or stands with her shoulders slightly back, accentuating her cleavage.;
, If she has developed romantic feelings towards you, she may be a little more awkward around you. Conversely, she may also start hanging out with you more. She may start responding to your texts quicker or initiating contact more often. If you find she’s bringing up her family and background more often, she may be trying to get you to reciprocate. This may mean she’s feeling out issues of long-term compatibility and a possible future romantic relationship.This is the easiest sign to misread and can mean a number of things. If she wants to spend more time with you, don’t jump to conclusions! While this may mean she’s romantically interested, it’s just as likely that she simply wants to strengthen your friendship.

, If she’s reluctant to share her feelings, she may start to avoid eye contact with you. Conversely, you may catch her staring a bit too long at you. If you notice her eyes are consistently dilated when she looks at you, there is a good chance attraction is there., If she constantly compliments you or mentions wanting a serious relationship with “someone,” she may feel the same way you do and is just as nervous about making that first move. If she’s including you in important life events that she isn’t bringing her other guy friends to, this may be a big hint. These can be anything from a vacation to an office Christmas party to meeting members of her family.

Sit beside him, touching your leg and shoulder to his, and see how he reacts. You can also try putting your arm across his shoulders or touch his arm.


If he shows no acknowledgment, it means he's comfortable with you and considers you a good friend.
If he leans into you or puts his arm around you, it could be a sign of romantic interest.
If he draws away, he doesn’t want to encourage any further physical contact. This can be a sign that he is uninterested.

, If you are hanging out—either alone or with a group—try to see how close he sits to you. If he keeps you closer than arm’s length, he enjoys proximity to you, and he may want more physical contact. Similarly, if he always sits next to you at a restaurant, bar, or movie, he is establishing your value to him above everyone else. On the other hand, if he doesn’t seem to care where you stand or sit, he most likely considers you a friend.

, If he leans towards you or sits with his body open (legs spread and shoulders rolled back), he could be indicating his attraction to you. Fiddling with objects, showing his hands and palms to you, and nodding at what you say may also indicate interest.

Alternatively, if his body is turned away from you or he is closed off (crossing his arms and legs), he might consider you a purely platonic friend., If he makes excessive eye contact with you, especially if you are in a group of people, it means that he is more interested in you than he is anyone else in the room. Watch to see if he makes eye contact, then shyly darts his gaze away. This is a common sign of attraction. , If he actively gestures when he’s speaking to you, it means that he is interested in what you are saying.

Ask him if he’s free one weekend and invite him over to your place. If he doesn’t agree or tries to avoid coming over, it might be a sign that he’s not interested.

, Don’t ambush him right away with the big question. Do something fun that you two have always enjoyed together. Play a video game, watch a movie, or discuss sports.

, When you feel the time is right, pause the video game or movie. You can even wait until just before he goes home. Ask him if you can have a few minutes to talk. Reassure him that you don’t want to make things awkward, but that you want to clear up some confusion about your relationship. You don’t have to reveal if you like him or not yet.


You can try saying, “Hey, do you mind if we have a quick chat? I want to discuss something with you. I’m confused about the state of our relationship, and I want to clarify what we are.”

, A conversation like this can be awkward, and you want your friend to be as comfortable as possible. Tell him how much you value your friendship.

Flirt with her a little and see how she responds.,
Talk to some mutual friends.,
Ask her directly.",How to Tell if a Female Friend Wants a Romantic Relationship2," If she flirts back, especially if she escalates the flirtation, she may be interested in you. However, try to gauge if this is just an aspect of her personality. Some people are naturally playful and flirtatious. She may just respond that way to everyone! If she doesn’t flirt back at all, this is usually a good sign that she doesn’t feel that way about you and it’s best to back off., Be sure that, while they may be candid with you, they aren’t normally a gossip. Ask them if your female friend has expressed any romantic interest in you. This approach may take a lot of courage, but it’s often the best way to gather enough information before doing something serious.

, This is the only way to really know how she feels. However, if she doesn’t reciprocate those feelings, things can get awkward for a while. Your platonic relationship could be severely damaged, so take this step either fairly early on in your friendship or if you’re reasonably sure she feels the same way. No matter what, it’s better to find out for sure rather than spending years wondering. Some approaches that you may take are:


Open the conversation by confessing that you need to get something off your chest. Tell her that you have developed romantic feelings for her and ask if she feels the same way. Apologize for the likely awkward moment and listen for her answer. A way of phrasing this could be: “Something has been bothering me lately. There’s no easy way to say this, but I’ve started having feelings for you. I’m sorry if I’ve put you on the spot, but I need to know. Do you feel the same way?”
Talk to her someplace where other people are nearby but unlikely to overhear your conversation. She will feel safer and less pressured to give you a positive answer that may not reflect her true feelings. Some examples include a park, a pier, or a cafe that is not too crowded.
Emphasize how much you value your friendship. If she broaches the subject, explain that your feelings began platonically but grew to something more. You want to reassure her that the platonic aspects of your relationship are genuine and not a manipulation tactic.

Have toothpaste at the ready.,
Dab the toothpaste with an applicator.Because this is a home-based remedy, there aren't any set rules of applicator you need to use.,
Apply toothpaste to the scratch.,
Clean your phone.",How to Remove Scratches from a Phone Screen1," Toothpaste should already be a standard part of your medicine cabinet and morning routine. Designed to be abrasive, toothpaste can fix a plastic scratch the same way it cleans teeth. Because it is home-based and shouldn't require additional purchases, toothpaste is the recommended remedy for fixing plastic scratches. It's important to make sure the toothpaste is an actual paste, as opposed to a gel-based toothpaste.In order for the scratch to work, the toothpaste needs to be abrasive. Check your toothpaste box if you're unsure about the kind of toothpaste you are using.


A baking soda mixture has the same abrasive qualities as toothpaste. If you'd rather use baking soda, you can stir up a paste and use it in the same manner.;
, A soft cloth, paper towel, cotton swab or toothbrush can all suit your purposes in this instance. When you dab the toothpaste, you should only use a pea-sized amount. Any more will create an unwieldy mess on your phone.








, Once you've got your dab of toothpaste, rub it around in a gentle, circular motion. Continue doing this until the scratch is barely noticeable. Due to the fact that the toothpaste is abrasive on its own, you won't need to apply too much pressure. Keep at the scrubbing until you start to see progress. Even if the scratch is too significant to be done away with entirely, the abrasion should reduce the scratch.








If your scratch is significant enough, toothpaste won't be enough to fix it. Even so, it should at least reduce the look of most scratches.

, Once the scratch is reduced to your liking, it's a simple process of cleaning off the toothpaste. Taking a soft, slightly damp cloth and wiping away the excess toothpaste is a good start.From there, you should take a polishing cloth and wipe away any dirt or oils that have otherwise built up on your screen. By doing this, you'll renew the look of your phone, and hopefully make your phone look better than even before the scratch.

Distract yourself.",How to Stop Being Possessive About a Friend," Look for the root cause of the problem by reviewing instances in which you behaved or felt possessively about your friendship. Try to make connections between the situations to see if you can find some kind of common ground that might be acting as a trigger for your possessive behavior.


Consider ways you might avoid these triggers and try to move forward.
For example, you may discover that most of your possessive feelings arise when you are hanging out in a group of three because you often feel excluded when there are only two other people. If this is the case, you should just try to avoid hanging out in threes. Try to organize one-on-one hangout time or events for a larger group of people.;
, Try to explain your possessive behavior to your friend. Talk to your friend in an open manner and tell them about your feelings. If they understand what you mean, they may very well try to spend more time with you and help you to feel reassured of their support for you. It may be possible for you guys to work through it together.Try saying something like, “I have really been struggling with feelings of possessiveness about our friendship lately. I think it might be related to how I felt about my dad when I was younger, but I know that it’s not a healthy way for me to interact with you. I am trying to work on this and I would really like it if we could get through this together as friends.”

, Think about any past incident you might have had relating to cheating or losing a best friend. Realize that it was just a one-time incident and that this experience cannot be generalized. Remember that each person is different and each relationship is different. Let the past go as you cannot change what had happened. Focus on the present friendship and forget the past.Realize that this friend didn’t do this thing in your past and, therefore, should not be punished for it.

, Exhibiting possessive behavior will probably not do anything to make your friendship closer. If you feel like you are acting possessively toward your friend, you should back off and give them some space. Let your friend make their own plans and don’t be so obsessed with being involved.Try letting your friend call you first or wait for them to make plans with you. Some people need more space than others, so you might be crowding the friendship without realizing it.

, Create your own life outside of the friend you feel possessive over. Evaluate what your likes and dislikes are and become involved with hobbies or other worthwhile pursuits. Focus on your own daily tasks at home and work, and develop a social life that doesn’t always depend upon your friend. The more time you spend on yourself, and developing your own unique identity, the more interesting you will become to others and your friend. While it is nice for you to have a good relationship with your friend and to spend time with her, it is also beneficial to spend time apart.

Possessive behaviors will be perceived as increasingly overbearing as they continue and will end up pushing your friend away. Learn to trust your friend and realize she is choosing to be in a friendship with you. Allow her to have other friendships outside of yours.

, You are an interesting person in your own right and people will be attracted to you, especially if they don’t feel like you are desperate for their attention. People don’t generally like feeling the pressure of a possessive friendship, so let someone else do the work of worrying for a change.


Wait for other people to initiate contact with you on occasion and see what happens. You might be surprised.

, A large part of possessive behavior is the need to feel in control. Do you often ask yourself where your friend was when she wasn't with you, whom she spoke with, and the content of every conversation she had when she was not with you? Do you see yourself beginning to dread her ability to make personal decisions about things without your influence? Having concerns and interest in your friend's life is normal to a point, but trying to control their every move is not. Realize that the only person you will be able to change in your life is yourself.

Let go of the underlying tension you may feel if you are not in control. It does not matter how good your intentions are, if your friend feels suffocated by your interventions into their life your controlling behavior is already destroying the relationship. Let go of your need to control, and you will see great improvements in your relationships and life.

, It can be all too easy to keep up with people today – mostly because of modern technological advances in social media-related fields. Take action to remove the temptation to internet creep from your life.Try hiding them from your social media accounts if you just can’t help yourself.
Or you could even take a break from social media in general for a while to see how that makes you feel.

, If you are having trouble controlling your possessive behavior, it might be time for you to get some professional help. Going to a counselor or therapist could be very beneficial for you in this situation. They can help you figure out the underlying causes of your possessive feelings. A professional could also help you understand how to cope with these feelings in the future.Talking to a professional who is not invested in the situation might help you see it in a new light as well. This could help you realize how your possessive behavior is affecting your relationship and what you might be able to do to improve the situation.

, Put yourself into a variety of activities and get yourself busy. This way, you have less time to think about what your friend is up to and you'll also be making your life more interesting to others so you can attract more friends in the future. Start playing a musical instrument, start going to church, start doing anything that is good for you and will help you move forward from this point.Work on becoming a more well-rounded person by investing in different activities and experiences. Don’t rely on one person to make you feel good about yourself.

, Be active, socialize and network in your friend's circles so that you might be able to spend more time with them. Do not spy around; instead, respect your friend's space and give a lot of trust to your friendship. Ultimately, this respectful hands-off approach will work out for your own good.If you become friends with more of their other friends, you’re bound to spend more time with your friend by default. However, this could be seen as another possessive behavior if you’re not careful.

, Part of the reason you feel so possessive of your friend is probably because you have been limiting yourself to that one friend for a while. If you have other friends that you hang out with and invest in, you won’t need so much emotional support from that one friend. Spread your needs out over a group of people.Try meeting new people (at places like school, church, or in your neighborhood) as well as cultivating friendships with people you already know casually.

, Feelings of possessiveness tend to get worse when we just sit and focus on them. As long as you allow yourself to obsess over this one friend, you will not get over it. Try distracting yourself with anything possible to get your mind off of it. You could even enlist the help of another friend if you trust them enough not to tell other people about it.Try reading a book, watching a movie, going for a walk, calling a friend, talking to your mom, or even creating something artistic.

Accept that it may be difficult to stay as close as you were due to busy schedules.,
Don't be jealous if your best friend is making new friends.,
Go out to different places with your best friend.,
If you both are busy or can't think of things to do, then talk to each other on the phone or text each other.,
Make sure to at least see each other once a month.,
Talk to them.,
Remember to always take an interest in their new life.,
Do something big and eventful together.","How to Stay Close to an Old Friend when at Different Schools, Universities or Jobs"," For example, if you were best friends in high school and you are going off to different universities, then it will be hard to spend as much time together as you did before. You won't see them for the seven hours you once spent together in school as well as an extra four hours doing extracurricular activities and homework together.;
, You will eventually form close friendships with people that you wouldn't expect, and you both will have different friend groups that may not have a single mutual friend between them. It's all about meeting new people and developing friendships outside your comfort zone.

, This can be very helpful as you will always have something to talk about, even if you haven't spoke in a while and don't know if they have the same interests as before.


Go to a new restaurant for lunch or dinner. You can talk about the different foods, the decor, the scenery, etc.
Go shopping together; go into town and make a day out of it. Try on everything and have your friend give their opinion.
Go see a movie together.
Or even a cafe just for coffee if you are short on money or don't have a lot of time.
Even visit places like local museums, tourist attractions, the zoo, sea life, etc. This may be costly, but whatever interests you share, go to a place that is related.
If you are both sporty, then go to a football game or a hockey game.
Also going to the gym together or walking/running outside is a great way to spend time with your friend.
Even just going out to a café to get ice cream or milkshakes is fun and gives you both something to do that isn't too expensive.
Even just visiting each other's house or driving around having no destination can be really fun and doesn't cost (except for petrol/gas).

, You could also message each other on Facebook, or Skype each other.


If you don't have anything to talk about, then discuss recent news events;
Or, how your new college course is going;
Or, how you recently started a new TV programme that you would recommend.

, It may be difficult to fit in, but try anyway, even if it is just for half an hour. Also ask about their new friends they have made and the new hobbies they have. Take an interest in them if they have changed their interests.

, If you feel you aren't as close or if your friend is distancing themselves, there may be a reason. Just remember that it may be hard for them to accept that they are losing you and that you two aren't close anymore.


They may feel that they have a new life now and there isn't enough room for everyone.
Or they don't want to lose you so they are doing it slowly over time.

, Whether that be their new relationship, new interests, their new job, new friends etc. If you meet their new friends, talk to them as well, as it is who your bestie is spending time with when they aren't with you. It's all about sharing a close bond, sharing information and being there for each other.

, If you both have money spare the why not go to a festival together? Or why not go on a holiday/vacation together? If you do, make some memories and take lots of photos so that you can look back on it later!


Spending time at the beach together in Spain or Turkey.
Go to big cities like New York or Paris.
Or even just camping 45 minutes up north together (or south).

Purchase a cerium oxide polish.,
Mix your powder into a slurry.If you bought powdered cerium oxide, you'll first need to prep the mix yourself.,
Block off all vulnerable spots with tape.A cerium oxide polish will do a number on your device if it seeps into any of the phone's holes, including the speaker, headphone jack or charger input.,
Apply the polish to the scratched area.,
Give your phone a follow-up clean.",How to Remove Scratches from a Phone Screen2," If your phone has a glass screen (instead of a plastic one) you'll have to use a more heavy-duty solution than toothpaste or baking soda to get scratches off your phone. In this case, a cerium oxide polish is recommended.This type of polish can be bought as a soluble powder, or in a pre-mixed form. While the pre-mixed polish is obviously the more convenient option, you'll get much better value if you buy it in its powdered form.









100g of cerium oxide powder should be more than enough when it comes to polishing your phone screen.You may want to buy a larger amount in the event of future scratching however.

, Luckily, this is very easy, and likely worth the money you'll be saving. Pour some powder (approx. 50-100g) into a small container. Slowly add water until the solution has the consistency of dairy cream. Mix regularly as you add the water in order to make sure your measurements are correct.









Measurements don't have to be perfect in the case of this polish, so long as you make sure there's enough water for the polish to soak into an applicator.
This step can be disregarded completely if you buy a pre-mixed polish.

, It can also potentially endanger your phone's cam lens. With that in mind, you should first cordon off the area you'd like to have polished with tape. Cover up whatever parts of your phone that might have problems if they're touched by the polish.









Taping up your phone before cleaning may seem overzealous, but it's highly recommended you follow through with this step before proceeding forward. In the case of a foul-up, your phone can be quickly wrecked otherwise.

, Dab a smooth polishing cloth in your cerium oxide mix, and rub the scratched area in a vigorous, circular motion.Regularly check to see how the scratch is looking as you tend the area. Every 30 seconds or so, it's a good idea to wipe away the mix with the opposite end of your cloth, dab the cloth in new polish, and repeat the process for maximum effectiveness.









When applying an abrasive polish, you'll want to go harder with the application than if you were simply cleaning it. Make sure not to go too hard, however. There would be nothing worse than causing new cracks in the screen while you're trying to fix old ones.

, Once you've applied and cleaned off the polish, it won't hurt to give your phone a quick once-over with a polishing cloth. This will wipe away any excess debris caused by the polish process. Remove the tape you added before polishing and wipe your phone. It doesn't need to take more than a minute or two to do thoroughly, but you may be impressed how much nicer your phone looks once you've wiped away the excess muck.









You should wipe your screen regularly. Twice a day may sound like a lot, but it only takes a second, and will ensure your screen stays healthy.

Purchase a screen protector.,
Wipe your screen regularly.,
Stow your phone somewhere safe.",How to Remove Scratches from a Phone Screen3," Cellphones have never been so fragile and prone to scratching as they are today. Screen protectors are commonplace, and you should invest in one if you're the slightest bit worried about damaging your phone. Common phone protectors aren't generally too expensive, and they'll be much more affordable than replacing your screen or phone if the damage is bad enough. Higher-end protectors are virtually unbreakable, while affordable brands will at least take damage so your phone proper won't have to.









Between a plastic screen protector and tempered glass protector, you are better off investing in the latter. Tempered glass protectors offer better durability, visibility, and comfortable feel., Small scratches can occur on your screen if you leave excess debris on your screen. Wiping your screen clean with a microfiber or silk cloth a couple times per day will keep your phone screen looking its best.Wiping your screen is especially useful if your phone is a touchscreen, as built-up oils and fingerprints can smudge the screen and blur it up.









Using clothes fabric like a shirt sleeve or even a dishcloth can also work as screen wipers, although ideally you'll want the smoothness of silk or microfiber when it comes to maintaining your screen.

, Most of the time your phone is scratched or damaged, you'll be on the go somewhere. It's important to consider where scratches come from and how they're most likely to be made. Put your phone in a separate pocket than your keys or coins. If possible, place your phone in a zip-up pocket to prevent it falling out accidentally.









Don't put your phone in your back pocket. On top of risking cracking if you sit down on it, there have been reports of it causing nerve problems due to the pressure it creates on your backside."

Get your game on.",How to Overclock a Graphics Card," Before you start overclocking, you'll want to make sure you are running the latest drivers on your video card. You can download the latest drivers from the Nvidia or AMD site, depending on which manufacturer you have. Having the latest drivers will ensure that your card is running as stably as possible. Newer drivers often increase overclocking performance as well., To overclock, you will need a few different programs, all of which are available for free. These programs will give you performance benchmarks, allow you to adjust your card timing and voltage, and monitor temperature performance.


Download a benchmark program - There are several available, but one of the quickest and most intuitive is Heaven. It is available for free from Unigine, the developers. Another popular program is 3DMark.
Download an overclocking program. While both Nvidia and AMD have overclocking utilities of their own, MSI Afterburner is one of the most popular and widely-used programs. Despite it's name, it will work with virtually every graphics card from both Nvidia and AMD.Download a monitoring program. Although benchmark and overclocking programs will report temperatures and speeds, sometimes it's good to have another monitor to make sure that all of your settings take. GPU-Z is a lightweight program that will monitor the temperature, clock speed, memory speed, and every other aspect of your graphics card.

, Going into your overclocking process without being informed can cost you a lot of time and cause you a lot of headaches later on. You want to find the clock speeds that other users who have your exact same card are getting. You also need to find what is generally considered to be your card's highest safe voltage.


Do not immediately apply these numbers to your card. Since every card is different, there's no telling what could happen if you enter the wrong numbers. Instead, use them as a guide during the overclocking process to judge how effective your numbers are.
Try forums such as Overclock.net to find other overclockers who have the same card that you do.
Overclocking a laptop's GPU is not recommended. Laptops have a much harder time dissipating heat, and overclocking can quickly lead to dangerous temperatures.

, You will need to install it after downloading it. Most users will be able to leave the settings at their default during installation. Once your program is installed, open it to start the benchmarking process.

, Before you start the benchmarking, you will be able to adjust the graphics settings. Adjust them to whatever you would like, and make sure that Resolution is set to ""Desktop"". If the benchmark program does not perform well with the settings you pick, you can change them later.

, The benchmark program will begin, and after a few moments of loading scenes will begin playing on your monitor. If the performance is poor, you can exit and lower your settings, but this isn't necessary. During the overclocking process, you should see performance improve without having to adjust the settings.

, Once the scenes start playing, you will see a row of buttons at the top of the screen. Click the Benchmark button to start the benchmark process. In Heaven, this will run through 26 different scenes, and will take several minutes to complete. After the benchmark is over, you will be given a score based on your graphics card's performance.

, Write down the score that you get. This will help you easily compare results as you increase the speed of your card.

, You will see a list of sliders on the left side of the program and a hardware monitor on the right. You can also run GPU-Z now to have an additional monitor to verify readings.

, This slider controls the core clock speed of your GPU. If your card has a Shader Clock slider, make sure that it is linked to the Core Clock slider. You will see a link icon between the two if they are linked.

, When making adjustments to the speed of your clock for the first time, it is always advisable to go by small amounts, such as 10MHz. This amount allows you to see improvements, but not accidentally go overboard.

, The changes should take effect immediately. Look at your readings in GPU-Z to ensure that the new speed is showing.

, Once you've made your first adjustment and verified it, it's time to run the benchmark program again and get your new score. When the benchmark program is running, pay attention to see if image quality or frame rate improves noticeably from the first time.


If the benchmark program runs without any issue, then your overclock is stable so far and you can continue.

, Continue raising your speed in 10MHz intervals, checking the results in the benchmark program each time. Sooner or later, you'll start running into instabilities.


Instabilities will manifest as black screens, graphical glitches, artifacts, bad colors, blotches, and more.

, Once you hit an instability, you can either revert your settings to the last speed that was working well, or you can try increasing your voltage. If you've seen noticeable improvements, or you don't want to risk damaging your card due to increasing the power flow, revert to the last working speed and skip down to Part Five. If you want to keep pushing your card, leave the speed as it is and move on to the next section.

, The Core Voltage sliders is locked by default to prevent accidental damage to your card. This alone should tell you how potentially serious doing this is. Check the ""Unlock voltage control"" box in the General tab and click OK.

, You will unlikely be able to select exactly 10mV, as voltages can only be increased by set amounts. Click Apply.

, Once you've increased your voltage, run your benchmarking program to see if your overclock is stable now. Remember, you left your settings at a speed that was unstable, so if it is stable now after raising your voltage you can go back to increasing your clock speed.

, If your overclock is stable now, start raising the Core Clock speed in 10MHz intervals again, running benchmarks each time. Repeat this until you reach the next instability.

, As voltage increases, the temperature of your GPU will start to go up. As you continue the process of increasing your voltage, keep an eye on your temperature readings in GPU-Z. It's recommended to keep temperatures below 90 °C (194 °F), but many enthusiasts prefer to keep it even cooler, such as 80° and below.


Improving your case's and card's cooling can help you increase your overclocking capabilities, but can be expensive and time-consuming.

, Once you reach your next plateau, raise the Core Voltage by 10mV again. Benchmark, and then repeat the Core Clock process. Remember to keep watching your temperature, as this will be one of the big limiting factors in how far you can take the overclock.

, Remember the notes you took about your card earlier? Make sure that you don't exceed the safe voltage limit for your card when you are making your adjustments.

, At a certain point, your overclock will stop being effective. You may reach your temperature threshold, your maximum voltage, or your clock speeds may just not be stable no matter how much your voltage increases. If that's the case then you can move on to the next step.

, Once you've hit the limit with your Core Clock, it's time to do the same with your Memory Clock. Repeat the process by raising the Memory Clock in 10MHz intervals, raising the voltage when you hit instabilities (if you haven't maxed out your safe voltage or temperature yet).


Make sure to keep running the benchmark after each adjustment. Raising the Memory Clock can lead to increases, but at a certain point it will actually start hurting performance. Pay attention to your benchmark scores to get it just right.

, The process for overclocking SLI cards is pretty much the same as a single card. Each card needs to be overclocked individually, and the slower card will always dictate the overall speed. Since no two cards are the same, one of your cards will be held back a little by the other. Follow the above steps to overclock each individual card.

, Performing your stress test is going to take a significant amount of time, so make sure you aren't going to need your computer for the next few hours. It's a fairly hands-off process, but you'll want to be able to check in and evaluate performance.

, Instead of starting the ""Benchmark"" process in Heaven, click Run and just let it go. Heaven will continue to cycle through the scenes until you tell it otherwise.

, As the scenes continue to play, keep your eyes open for any glitches, artifacts, or full-on crashes. These indicate an unstable overclock, and you'll need to go back and lower your settings. If you make it through the stress test without issue (4-5 hours), then it's game time.

, Benchmark programs are great, but they aren't the reason you're overclocking; the games are. Open up your favorite game and test out the performance. Your old settings should work much better, and you may be able to crank them up to something higher!"

,
In addition to black, there are three colors of ink: magenta, cyan, and yellow.,
Insert the long needle of the refill ink bottle deeply into the correct hole penetrating the foam down into the bottom of the cartridge.,
Slowly, add the ink.,
Stop quickly as soon as you see a bit of ink oozing out of the hole.,
Carefully daub the cartridge contacts on the paper towel, you should see a splotch of the ink leaking out onto the paper towel.

,, Work over the paper towel to catch any leaking ink.

,, (The following instructions are just a general guide).

, The depressions can be felt by rubbing your finger across the label. Some cartridges have more than one hole, but only one leads to the ink reservoir that you will refill. This hole will have a sponge in it.

,, Follow the kit instructions on which hole to insert each color OR push a toothpick into the holes to identify the colors as markings on the printer cartridge are sometimes there to fool you into putting the wrong colors into the cartridge ink chambers.

, It is important not to push air into the cartridge foam while refilling. (An air pocket will keep the ink from reaching the print head causing the cartridge not to print.)

, Carefully watch to be sure that you do not over-fill.

, Without letting go of the bottle, slowly release the air, sucking a little ink back out of the ink cartridge, before you remove the needle completely.

,, (This works better than the seal dots included in the kit.) Make sure that no ink is leaking out of the top holes. (That's where the clear tape comes in handy.) Be careful not to cross contaminate the colors.

,, You may need to do this several times. Do this until it stops bleeding and you see an even stripe of three colors showing up on the towel.

,, Never, ever install a leaking print cartridge.

, Print several test pages, preferable photos with a lot of different colors.

The line can appear next to or over the letter.The setting for testing voltage in an AC circuit is typically marked V~, ACV, or VAC.
To test voltage on a DC circuit, set the multimeter to V–, V---, DCV, or VDC.;
, Because current is measured in amperes, it is abbreviated A. Choose direct current or alternating current, whichever the circuit you are testing is made for. Analog multimeters typically do not have the ability to test current.



A~, ACA, and AAC are for alternating current.

A–, A---, DCA, and ADC are for direct current.

, This is marked by the Greek letter omega: Ω. This is the symbol used to denote ohms, the unit used to measure resistance. On older multimeters, this is sometimes labeled R for resistance instead.

, If your multimeter has this setting, keep it on DC+ when testing a direct current. If you aren't getting a reading and suspect you've got the positive and negative terminals attached to the wrong ends, switch to DC- to correct this without having to adjust the wires., If you're not sure why there are multiple settings for voltage, current, or resistance, read the troubleshooting section for information on ranges. Besides these basic settings, most multimeters have a couple additional settings. If more than one of these marks is next to the same setting, it may do both simultaneously, or you may need to refer to the manual.



))) or a similar series of parallel arcs indicates the ""continuity test."" At this setting, the multimeter will beep if the two probes are electrically connected.A right-pointing arrow with a cross through it marks the ""diode test,"" for testing whether one-way electrical circuits are connected.Hz stands for Hertz, the unit for measuring the frequency of AC circuits.–|(– symbol indicates the capacitance setting.

, Most multimeters have three ports or holes. Sometimes, the ports will be labeled with symbols that match the symbols described above. If these symbols are unclear, refer to this guide:


The black probe always goes into the port labeled COM for common (also called the ground. (The other end of the black lead always connects to the negative terminal.)
When measuring voltage or resistance, the red probe goes into the port with the smallest current label (often mA for milliamps).When measuring current, the red probe goes into the port labeled to withstand the amount of expected current. Typically, the port for low-current circuits has a fuse rated to 200mA while the high-current port is rated to 10A., Analog multimeters have a needle behind a glass window, which moves to indicate the result. Typically, there are three arcs printed behind the needle. These are three different scales, each of which is used for a different purpose:The Ω scale is for reading resistance. This is typically the largest scale, at the top. Unlike the other scales, the 0 (zero) value is on the far right instead of the left.
The ""DC"" scale is for reading DC voltage.
The ""AC"" scale is for reading AC voltage.
The ""dB"" scale is the least used option. See the end of this section for a brief explanation.

, Look carefully at the voltage scales, either DC or AC. There should be several rows of numbers beneath the scale. Check which range you have selected on the dial (for example, 10V), and look for a corresponding label next to one of these rows. This is the row you should read the result from.

, Voltage scales on an analog multimeter work just like an ordinary ruler. The resistance scale, however, is logarithmic, meaning that the same distance represents a different change in value depending on where you are on the scale. The lines between two numbers still represent even divisions. For example, if there are three lines between ""50"" and 70,"" these represent 55, 60, and 65, even if the gaps between them look different sizes.

, Look at the range setting that the dial of your multimeter is set to. This should give you a number to multiply the reading by. For example, if the multimeter is set to R x 100 and the needle points to 50 ohms, the actual resistance of the circuit is 100 x 50 = 5,000.

, The ""dB"" (decibel) scale, typically the lowest, smallest one on an analog meter, requires some additional training to use. It is a logarithmic scale measuring the voltage ratio (also called gain or loss).The standard dBv scale in the US defines 0dbv as 0.775 volts measured over 600 ohms of resistance, but there are competing dBu, dBm, and even dBV (with a capital V) scales., Unless you have an auto-ranging multimeter, each of the basic modes (voltage, resistance, and current) has several settings to choose from. This is the range, which you should set before you attach the leads to the circuit. Start out with your best guess for the value which is just above the closest result. For example, if you expect to measure around 12 volts, set the meter to 25V, not 10V, assuming those are the two closest options.If you have no idea what current to expect, set it to the highest range for your first try to avoid damaging the meter.
Other modes are less likely to damage the meter, but consider the lowest resistance setting and the 10V setting your default., On a digital meter, ""OL,"" ""OVER,"" or ""overload"" means you need to select a higher range, while a result very close to zero means a lower range will give more accuracy. On an analog meter, a needle that stays still usually means you need to select a lower range. A needle that shoots to the maximum means you need to select a higher range.

, Turn off the power switch or remove the batteries powering the circuit in order to get an accurate resistance reading.The multimeter sends out a current to measure the resistance, and if additional current is already flowing, this will disrupt the result.

, To measure current, you'll need to form one circuit that includes the multimeter ""in series"" with the other components. For example, disconnect one wire from a battery terminal, then connect one probe to the wire and one to the battery to close the circuit again.

, Voltage is the change in electrical energy across some part of the circuit. The circuit should already be closed with current flowing, then the meter should have the two probes placed at different points on the circuit to connect it ""in parallel"" with the circuit. This must be done carefully to avoid discrepancy.

, Analog meters have an additional dial, used to adjust the resistance scale and typically marked with an Ω. Before making a resistance measurement, connect the two probe ends to each other. Turn the dial until the ohm scale reads zero, to calibrate it, then conduct your actual test."

Power down your iPhone.,
Remove the SIM card.,
Before opening the iPhone, make sure that you are properly grounded so that you don’t damage the components with a static charge.,
Remove the screws.,
Pry open the case.,
Detach the ribbon cables.,
Remove the screen.,
Access the motherboard.,
Remove the battery.,
Reassemble the iPhone.",How to Open an iPhone," Before you open the case, make sure your iPhone is completely turned off. Simply turning the screen off will not suffice. Press and hold the Power button until the power slider appears. Slide the slider with your finger and your phone will turn off after a few moments.


Opening the iPhone without shutting it down can cause the iPhone to completely malfunction.;
, To avoid damaging your SIM card during the disassembly, remove it first. The method varies depending on your iPhone model, but generally you will need a paperclip to press the SIM release button.

, You can ground yourself by touching exposed metal.

, There are two tiny screws at the bottom of the iPhone that need to be removed before you can open the phone. These screws are located on either side of the connection port.


The Original iPhone and 3GS need a Phillips #00 screwdriver to remove the screws. The iPhone 4 through the iPhone 6 models require a pentalobe (five point) screwdriver.
The screws are very small, so be sure not to lose them after you have removed them from the iPhone.

, Once the screws are removed, you can pry the case open using a small flathead screwdriver. Insert the screwdriver directly above the connection port where you removed the screws. Gently push until the screen pops out of the casing.


Alternatively, you can attach a large suction cup to the bottom of the screen and slowly pull it up until the screen separates from the casing. This may cause less damage than trying to force a screwdriver into the casing.Open the case slowly. The screen is attached to the phone components with several ribbon cables. If you separate the screen too quickly, you may damage the cables.

, There are three small ribbon cables located at the top of the iPhone that connect the screen to the iPhone motherboard. In order to complete remove the screen, you will need to detach these cable.


You must remove two ribbon connectors first before you can access the third connector.
Be especially careful when removing these ribbons, as damaging them will render your iPhone useless.

, Once you have removed the ribbons, you can set the screen assembly aside. Be sure that you do not damage the screen while you are not using it.

, If you need to access the motherboard, remove the screws around the metal plate. Some screws may be covered by stickers. Once you remove all the screws, you can lift out the motherboard from the case.

, In older iPhones, the battery is glued to the back plate of the iPhone. Use a small flathead and work your way around the battery, gently prying it off of the back plate. Be very careful not to puncture the battery during removal.


Newer iPhones have removable batteries that you can lift directly out of the housing after your remove the screw holding it in place., When you are done with your repair work, you can reassemble the iPhone by reversing the steps above. Make sure that all of your ribbon connections are plugged back in to the correct sockets.

Unplug any other external cables from the computer as well. When you are ready to begin working, touch a piece of metal to discharge any static electricity from your body.
, Place a clean cloth on top of a clean, flat work surface. The cloth will help prevent any scratches to the computer's body. Make sure that you are working in a relatively dust-free environment, as even small amounts of dust can damage the computer's delicate electronic components., Place the blade of a thin, flexible putty knife into the gap between the metal shell and plastic base of the computer. Do this on a side of the computer that is adjacent to the back side (the side with the ports). Once the blade has been partially inserted, apply light outward pressure to the putty knife to pry the shell away from the base. You will hear some clicking sounds as the plastic latches disengage., Once the plastic latches have disengaged on the first side, repeat the process above on the other side of the computer, applying gentle pressure with the putty knife to remove the shell. You may need to repeat the process a third time on the edge opposite the ports., Once the base has been loosened from the shell, place your thumbs on the side of the computer with the ports. Apply gentle upward pressure to disengage the last latches, and carefully lift the entire interior assembly out of the metal shell. Set the shell aside, and place the interior gently onto the cloth., The interior of the Mac Mini consist of 2 main pieces, which are connected in 3 places.

First, remove the Airport wireless antenna. This is a pentagonal-shaped plastic piece that sits against the corner of the optical drive. To remove it, place your pointer finger on top of it to steady it, and pinch the tubular base between your thumb and middle finger. Apply gentle pressure to the base and lift the antenna up and out of the assembly.
Next, remove the hard drive sensor cable. This cable is made from 2 small black wires, and is located on the same side of the assembly as the optical drive opening. To disconnect it, grab the small gray plug at the end of the wires and pull it gently from its port. Do not attempt to remove the plug by pulling the wires themselves.
Finally, disconnect the flexible cable running between the audio board and the interconnect board. This cable is located on the side of the computer with the external ports, and looks like a wide, thin orange band. To disconnect it, pinch it between your fingers on the side nearest to the optical drive, and pull it out.

, In each corner of the internal frame, there is a small screw attaching the 2 pieces together. Use a #0 Phillips-head screwdriver to remove these screws. Note that 1 screw is longer than the others., Once the cables and screws have been removed, lift the 2 pieces of the internal assembly apart. Your Mac Mini's internal components are now fully exposed. Make the necessary changes and reassemble the computer by retracing the process above."

For best results, follow the instructions above to find the subnet mask on your computer. The same number should work well for your device as well.


If your device still won't connect, leave the information open on your computer. Refer to it while changing settings on the device.
If you can't find the information on a computer, try entering 255.255.255.0. This is the most common subnet mask for home networks.

, If the device still won't go online, check the IP address. This should be in the same screen where you can set the subnet mask.

Choose any higher number instead, as long as it is 254 or below. Add at least 10, since nearby numbers are more likely to be used by additional devices on your network.


For example, if your computer's IP address is 192.168.1.3, set your device's IP address to 192.168.1.100.
If you can't find your computer's IP address, check your router for a printed label, or search online for your router's brand and ""IP address."" Change the final group of numbers.
If you can't find any information, try 192.168.1.100, or 192.168.0.100, or 192.168.10.100, or 192.168.2.100.

, This should be set to the same Gateway value as your computer, which is also your router's IP address. This will almost always be the same as the device's IP address, except with a 1 instead of the final group of numbers.


For example, if any device on your network has an IP address of 192.168.1.3, set the Gateway to 192.168.1.1.
In any internet browser, type http:// followed by this value. If you have the correct gateway, you should reach information about your router.

, Use the same DNS setting as your computer, or the same value as you entered under Gateway. Alternatively, search online for ""public DNS"" for more options.

,
If you give up, call your phone company or an electrician.

",How to Install an Extra Phone Jack," Clear it out and make sure you have room.

, The best choice is a ""home run"" straight to the phone company's box, because any wire problems will only affect the one jack. However, if this will be difficult, you can run wire from the closest/easiest phone jack.

, You can run the wire along the walls or baseboard, but this can be messy. You can fish the wire through the walls, but this can range from time-consuming to nearly impossible. Or you can run the wire through an exterior wall and out along the roof. This is a decision for you to make. When you've figured it out, measure how much wire you need.

, The easiest is simply a surface-mount type, no drilling required. Most allow you to use screws, or even just stick it there with an included piece of double-sided tape. If you want something a little more professional looking, you can open up the wall a bit and install an electrical box to have a jack flush to the wall. This allows you to get a jack with posts for a wall-phone to hang from.

, You need wire and a jack. Also get a pair of small-gauge wire strippers, and a Phillips and flat-head screwdriver if you don't already have them. Be sure to get extra wire! You do not want to end up short. By the time this is all done, you want to end up with at least 10 extra feet of wire. But you need more spare wire the longer the distance, since small deviations from your estimate will magnify with distance. For a 50' run, get 65', and for a 100' run get 125', and so on.


If you're surface-mounting the wire (running it along the baseboard, for example) be sure to get fasteners. For rougher work, they sell nails with clips that you can push a wire into. For finish work, like in a bedroom for example, they sell small finish staples. Whatever you get, make sure it's not likely to cut into the wire.

, Start at your starting point (the demarcation or terminal point, or the nearest phone jack), run the wire through or along the wall to the location of your new jack. Leave 5 extra feet at the start, and there should be plenty of cable at the other end. Affix the cable as necessary.

, Start at the new jack. Cut the wire to length (measure twice) and strip off the last 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm), taking care not to nick the wires. You probably have two pairs of wire. Separate out the blue/white stripe and white/blue stripe wires (or, if you don't have them, the red and green wires) from the rest and strip off the last inch or so of insulation. Be careful! Then wrap these two wires around the screw terminals corresponding to the first line (refer to the jack's documentation) and tighten the screws. Don't close up the box or affix it to the wall yet!

, If you're feeding off an existing jack, open it up, unscrew the two wires, twist them around the new wires, and re-tighten back to the terminals (and confirm the jack still works).

, If it is, attach the new jack securely with screws or adhesive, and close it up.

, Use the documentation to make sure you've attached your two wires to the right terminals. You may be able to unscrew the wires and hold them against different terminals with the phone off-hook to see if you hear a dial tone.;
, You're looking for voltage between the two wires you've been using, which should be about 48 volts DC.

After making it, save the episode in a format that is supported by ITunes, such as "".m4a,” “.mp3,” “.mov,” “.mp4,” “.m4v,” “.pdf,” or “.epub” format.
Then, you will need to upload your file to a web server. If you are going to be doing more than one episode for your podcast, then create a new folder in the web server.
Next, you will need to generate a RSS feed for your podcast. You can use an online RSS creation service or create one yourself using a text editor.
Refer to the RSS template provided on the Apple’s “Making a Podcast” website for more tags that specify to iTunes. Some of the tags that are required are things such as the “<itunes:category>,” “<language>,” and “<itunes:explicit>” tags. If these tags are not present then iTunes will prompt you for these when submitting the feed.
After that, you will need to save your file as a "".rss"" file and submit it to the web server.;
, Then open iTunes.
If you don't already have an account for iTunes, you will need to create one by clicking the ""Sign In"" button in the top right corner, and then click on ""Create New Account"". All you need to do for this is to follow the online instructions.
Then, you will need to click the iTunes store in the top of the iTunes window. Then, click ""Podcasts"" at the top. Then click ""Submit a Podcast"" at the right menu of the Podcasts page.
In the field text, you will need to type or paste the web address for your podcast RSS feed. Then, click continue. You will need to wait to make sure that iTunes has received your podcast validly. And if you are missing required tags for the RSS feed, iTunes will need the values of those tags.

First thing you need to do is decide on a ""path"" that you want the wiring to take throughout your home.,
Keep in mind that less work is better.,
For the sake of this article we're going to imagine that we are running one length of Cat5 Ethernet cable from a router on the first floor to an office on the second floor of our home.,
Make sure that you know where you want your entry point into the office upstairs.,
Use the stud finder to locate a stud in the wall so we know were to locate the wall box.

,
Mark the location of the wall stud with a pencil.,
Take down any mouldings that are in danger of damage.,
WEAR EYE PROTECTION AT ALL TIMES!,
SHUT OFF the breakers to the room you'll be working in.,
Use your utility knife to cut a hole the size of the wall box.,
Look into the hole for plumbing or anything else that would cause a problem.,
Use the tape measure to plot out a clean line across the ceiling.,
Cut a hole in the corner of the ceiling where we want to start the cable running.,
We will have to repeat these steps for any ceiling area that needs to have cable run across the joists.,
Now we should have open access to run our cable to the second floor.

,
Go to the office and cut a box hole where you want it, following the steps above.,
Use the spade bit again to drill from the first floor to the second.,
Start at the top so we can use gravity as much as possible.,
If you need to use the Fish tape and never have before, it's easy.,
Now all we have to do is run the cable ends through their respective wall boxes, attach any connectors etc., and test the cable before closing everything up.

,
Since we did a great job, and everything works, now it's time to replace the drywall etc.

,
Screw or glue the drywall back into place (liquid nails or other construction grade glue).,
That's how you cable an existing structure.",How to Install Cabling in a Pre Built Home," Remember that in most cases the wall studs will be placed vertically, floor to ceiling. Ceiling joist positions vary from builder, house, code etc. Go into the attic and look around, or cut a small hole somewhere in the ceiling and take a look.;
, So try to arrange your path so you can minimize drywall cutting and drilling. Enclosed ceilings (like in a two story home) are more challenging because you will need to cut out a lot of drywall if you need to run the cable across the joists rather than along them.

, Substitute ""Ethernet"" cable for any cable you are running. The only thing that changes are the connections at the end.


Our router is located at the farthest corner of the home from our office (just to make things exciting). AND, our ceiling joists are running against our proposed path. (more excitement) Many times it's best to find an area with existing wiring like an outlet or cable TV jack. Then you can just run the line through the cabling holes that the contractor has already cut. In this case, we would want to place our wall box close to that

,


Note:

You can take the easy way out if you have crown moulding on the ceiling. Just pop off the moulding with a small moulding prybar. Be sure to have help with this step and take care. Especially with older moulding. All mouldings can break easily if you're too hasty, but older moulding is especially easy to crack or break. Then just run the cable behind the moulding and then into the walls, which is described below.


Explanation of wall boxes:

There are a couple of types that we're going to look at. First is called a ""New Work"" box. New Work doesn't mean the new work you're doing. It means new construction where there is no drywall yet. These are typically hammered into place where there is no drywall or other obstructions in the way.
The second is called an ""Old Work"" box. This means that the home is finished and you don't have the luxury of an open area. Usually these boxes have little fins that flip out behind the drywall and pulls the box tight into place when screwed down. We're using an Old Work box, today.



,,


Studs are typically 16in apart to the center of each stud. Sometimes they are farther apart depending on building codes, non-load bearing walls, and to keep costs down.

, Lay down a drop cloth.

,!

, This is to keep us safe in case we happen to touch or cut wiring in the wall. Also, it's just good practice anytime you're poking around inside of a wall.

, Remember, the outer lip of the wall box is needed to “clamp” the box against the drywall with the fins behind it. So don't cut the hole too big. Smaller is better; we can trim it later.

,


This is where it gets ugly. Since our cable is running across the joists, the only option is to cut out the drywall on the ceiling. Remember, this is an enclosed ceiling between floors. However, in your home you might find an easier way to run the cable. This is a worst case scenario.

, Preferably close to a wall (maybe 8-10 in away) to hide any imperfections when we replace the drywall later.

, Look inside to make sure there aren't any obstructions. Once we determine that it's all clear we make the long cuts across the ceiling. Make sure these lengths of drywall are manageable for easy installation later. Also when you cut the lengths to size, try to cut in the middle of a joist so we have something to attach the drywall to later.


Now we have a nice opening to work in. Take your spade bit and drill a straight series of holes through the joists, for the cable. Keep the holes high enough on the boards so if we decide to screw the drywall into place we don't damage our cable.

, When we need to run with the joists, we can just cut one hole at the start, then one at the end and use our fish tape to run through the ceiling. Since we already figured out what path we were going to take, you already know where to stop the cutting.

,, Make sure to look inside for obstructions.


Your friend (we'll call him Bob) stays on the first floor to help us find the perfect spot to drill down. Use your hammer or whatever to tap on the floor in the hole until you both zero in on the right spot.

, We'll have Bob do it so we can watch and make sure that the hole comes through in the right spot. This will be a thicker set of boards since it's load bearing.


If everything went to plan, we should have everything ready to run the cable. If it didn't, adjust to make it right.

, Drop the cable through the holes and draw it through gently. Anytime that you need to make a turn, draw out as much cable as you need before turning, to reduce stress on the cable.

, Anytime that you need it, unroll it, push it through the opening until it arrives at its destination, attach the cable to it using the electrical tape. Then gently pull the tape back through. That's all there is to it.

,,, Tape and spackle it. Sand and paint it. Then replace any mouldings that you have.

, Your application may vary considerably to this “how to”. Make adjustments as needed, but now you have the foundation to get it done.

,
Wait for final proof of transmission.",How to Send an International Fax," Not all fax machines or public fax kiosks can send documents abroad. When you see a fax machine with international sending options, look at the prices to be sure that you're comfortable paying the international rate, which can be a lot more than a local rate for faxes.;
, Each country has its own code composed of several digits. You'll need this piece of information in order to dial the number that you use to send the fax.


Get access to a list of country codes through phone books, informational lists or other resources like phone cards. The web sites or promotional materials of phone card vendors usually have the relevant country code information. Having a list of country codes helps if you need to send international faxes on a frequent basis.

, Different fax machines and services are set up in different ways. Some require you to dial extra numbers to get an ""outside line."" Many machines may require an additional code with the country code in order to route the documents correctly. This code changes depending on from where you are sending the fax.

, Pay attention to what recipients abroad will be seeing. Your documents might go through, but the transaction may be delayed if the people who receive your fax can't understand what's in it. Take care to label your fax cover sheet with specific instructions for recipients, and consider adding foreign language descriptions if those in the destination country may not speak your language. Clearly identify yourself as the sender and include your phone number in case there are any issues with comprehension or receiving.

, Most fax machines take paper face down in order to correctly scan it.

,, Most fax machines will generate a result for a fax when the machine has either sent it successfully, or encounters problems that eventually stops the transmission. Getting the paper document that shows successful transmission will help you out if there are problems later. You can also keep the receipt for tax records.

If necessary drill at least a 1” diameter hole in the top of the wall directly above where your Ethernet outlet will be located.

,
Run a fish tape from the top of the wall to the hole for the Ethernet outlet.

,
Attach a very durable, but small in diameter, rope to the end of the fish tape and pull the fish tape out of the wall while pulling the rope into and out of the top of the wall.,
Attach the rope above the wall to the Ethernet cable coming from the main panel box.,
Once the cable has been pulled through the outlet opening with about a foot of extra cable, use a wire stripper to remove approximately 2” of the cable jacket at the end of the cable.,
Untwist the wires just enough so that the wires can be installed on the RJ45 female jack.,
Place the wires by hand into the color coded notches on the jack.,
Using a punch down tool fully seat the wires to the RJ45 jack.,
Install the jack into the wall plate and screw the wall plate to the wall plate mounting bracket.,
Test the connection using a cable tester.

",How to Install an Ethernet Jack in a Wall,";
, A popular place for this to be located is on the opposite side of a stud from where an electrical socket is located.

,,, Be sure not to cut too big of a hole. If you cut the hole too small you can always go back and cut a little more out using a drywall saw.

,,,, Ensure that the rope is long enough to have a foot of extra rope above the top of the wall and at least a foot of rope out of the Ethernet outlet hole.

, Ensure that the cable is the correct one for this particular outlet. It is recommended that a combination of a good knot and electrical tape is used to attach the rope to the cable. Pulling the cable down to the outlet opening can be especially difficult if there is insulation in the wall where you are pulling the cable.

, Do not nick any of the small wires that are part of the cable when using the wire strippers to remove the cable jacket.

, Do not twist the wires any more than necessary due to the potential for interference on the wires if the cables are untwisted too far.

, The wires should be installed into the jack with the ends of the wires going out towards the sides of the jack. The wires will be installed using an A or B type color code. Both color codes are sufficient but should be used uniformly throughout the building.

, Trim off any excess wire from the jack

, Push any excess cable back in the wall.

The modem you need will depend on the type of your internet connection. If you are using DSL, you will need a DSL modem. If you are using cable, you will need a cable modem. Fiber optic connections do not typically require modems.;
, Do you have a Windows PC? A Mac? Both? Well, then you're going to need to make sure that whatever modem you buy will work your operating system(s). Most modems work with virtually all operating systems. If you are using a router, then you don’t need to worry about operating system compatibility.

, There are many brands of modems available, but not all of them have a great shelf-life. Read consumer reviews and try to find modems that have the best cost-to-performance ratio. Below are some popular brands.

Motorola






Cisco-Linksys






Lucent






Speedstream






Zoom







, Remember to uninstall any drivers associated with your old modem and reset your computer after doing so. Also, keep the cables since you might need them for your new modem.

, While this article can give you the basic steps for setting up your modem, every modem is different. Be sure to carefully read your instructions and follow the steps exactly to reduce headaches later.

, Place the modem in a location with good air circulation and away from other devices that may interfere with signals. Follow the instructions provided to connect the modem to the Cable or DSL line in your house.


If you are using DSL, you will need to install filters first into a phone line.

, Once you’ve connected the modem to the service source, power it on by plugging it on and pressing the power button (if applicable). Wait a minute or two for the modem to boot up completely. The power light should be solid, while your connection light may be blinking because the modem hasn’t been activated yet.

, Using an Ethernet cable, connect your computer to the internet or WAN port on the back of the modem. This will connect your computer directly to the internet. You can set up your wireless network after the modem has been activated.

, Depending on your modem and service provider, you may need to run a setup program before you use the modem. In other cases, you may need to open a web browser and then follow the on-screen prompts to activate your service. Refer to the directions provided by your service provider to be sure.Some internet service providers may need you to call with the MAC address of the modem. The MAC address is found on a sticker that's either on the back or the side of the modem. It looks something like “00-00-00-00-00-00”, but with a mixture of letters and numbers.

, Make sure the power supply is plugged in properly to both the modem and the power outlet. If the modem is plugged into a power strip, make sure that the strip is still functioning. If everything looks like it should be working k, there may be an issue with the power cable or the modem itself.

, The simplest way to fix any connection issues with your modem is to power cycle it. This means unplugging it from the power source, waiting about 30 seconds, and then plugging it back in. This will reset the modem’s settings, hopefully restoring the connection. If the problem persists, contact your service provider; there could be an outage in your area.

, This could be caused by many variables. There could be a problem with your computer or the modem was installed incorrectly. Sometimes there are problems with the service provider that will have to be fixed on their end. Make sure that all of the cables are connected properly and, if need be, try reinstalling the modem.

, Troubleshooting on your own may not work. Think in terms of time and effort. If you spend more than 30 minutes on the issue, it is best to have an expert help out. Contact the support line for the modem manufacturer, your ISP and any tech-savvy friends you have. These should be free resources that get your modem working, meaning you get back online in a hurry without unnecessarily spending money.


There are a variety of communities online dedicated to technical support for a variety of products. Perform a web search for the problem you are having and see if someone else has come up with a solution.

Make sure that the length of the wires isn't too long.,
Crimp the wires.,
Push the socket head into the crimping device.,
Plug in your cable where you need it!",How to Wire an Ethernet Cable," This task will require: Ethernet cable, an Ethernet socket head and an Ethernet socket head crimper. Before you start cutting and crimping the wire, make sure that it’s the correct length! You don't want to successfully wire your Ethernet cable and discover it’s not long enough for its desired purpose! It's best to make sure that there is a little bit of extra length as well, just to be safe.;
, Make sure that you don't damage any of the smaller wires found inside it, as this can cause problems in regards to the life of the wire, and whether or not the wire will even work at all!

, This is will make your life a lot easier when you have to put them in order.

, This part can be particularly frustrating as the wires have a tendency to move around from the positions you put them in. Be patient and eventually they'll remain in position. When you've straightened the wires out put them in this order:


Orange/White
Orange
Green/White
Blue
Blue/White
Green
Brown/White
Brown

, When you insert the wires into the Ethernet socket head, you want to make sure that the wires aren't crushed by the plastic clip. Make sure the wires are roughly half an inch in length and slowly push them into the socket head. Make sure that when you do this the ""clip"" is facing away from you. If you do it the opposite way around, the wires will be backwards!

, If you haven't already checked the order of the wires check it now, and if you have checked, check again! There’s no way to go back once it’s crimped other than to cut it off and start again. When your satisfied the wires are in the correct order, make sure they are push as far as they can go, and are seated nicely next to the gold pins at the end. Also make sure there is plenty of sleeving to make sure you don't cut into the wires during crimping.

, Push down extremely hard and the cable will be correctly crimped (Note that you won't feel or hear any ""clicks"" or ""pop"" letting you know when it's been correctly crimped).

, If you followed the steps correctly you should have a perfectly working Ethernet cable.

Virtualization has a greater benefit in a networked environment by taking advantage of shared storage in conjunction with security functions that can protect files, detect viruses and provide access to users that require specific tasks to be assigned to them., Generally you start with one server, but that server needs to be able to last a long time. Choose a CPU (Central Processing Unit), RAM (Random Access Memory), storage and networking solutions that fulfill the needs of the business. You can also purchase pre-built servers from manufacturers such as Dell, HP and more that also provide software and customer service.

, Be aware that some programs may face difficulties if running in a virtual environment, if they can at all. Some programs are only designed to work directly with the OS or (operating system,) such as Microsoft applications for Windows and may face more difficulty performing optimally on a virtualized machine.

, A Linux-based OS is a potential solution, but may require assistance from a paid technician. A Windows-based OS may have a higher initial cost, but comes with a suite of programs from the Microsoft Windows family which not only comes with the operating system, but has the added benefit of customer support in case you run into complications with their applications., The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, allows processes to be performed on the server. With virtual machines they can make use of different cores, even a CPU with a higher clock speed will not be able to perform as many tasks if there are fewer cores to work with.

, RAM (Random Access Memory) stores information for running programs. You will be able to run more virtual machines with additional RAM as they require a fixed amount that is dedicated for that one machine.

, You will need a hard drive to be able to store the information for the server as well as the virtual machines running on the server . Going for hard drives with high storage, or using a RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) device allows you to combine hard drives to treat it as one huge storage device.

, This will be the main operating system for the server where you will be able to manage all applications and virtual machines for your server.

, This software is designed to maintain several instances of an operating system on one server. For smaller processes, you can make use of a virtual machine. There are several options available to use such as VMWare's Workstation software which works on Windows and Linux as well as Oracle's VirtualBox that runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux.There are free options that are designed for personal use as well as licenses available for business and commercial purposes. Prices for business and commercial purposes will vary depending on licenses purchased for individual users which is cheaper or for each server which can cover multiple users but is more expensive.

, Determine the resources that you want to use on your server. Be sure that you do not take too many resources away from the host OS as this may cause problems for all the processes on your server.

, This process is similar to running an install for an operating system on the host machine. You can use either an installer disk or a disk image archive also known as an ISO file.


You can create a virtual machine without an operating system, however without one you will not be able to run any software on the virtual machine until the OS is installed.

, Remember that tasks that require high performance may not be suitable for a virtual machine environment and may need to be handled by the server hardware natively.

, If your host machine has enough available resources for your specified virtual machine, you are able to transfer virtual machines using storage devices such as USB devices. You will be able to make room for other machines that can run different tasks.

, It is entirely possible for hardware to fail. Purchase redundant hardware such as additional power supplies or hard drives in the potential case the hardware no longer works.

, Use conversion software to convert physical hardware onto a virtual machine format with programs such as vCenter.If you have processes running on the server and do not require high resource usage, they are likely able to run on a virtual machine instead. Servers will run idly for a portion of time and not make use of resources and will be able to share them with other processes on both host and virtual machines. If a server runs a program that requires a high amount of resources, it is very likely that their resources cannot be converted., Run a script process or other backup methods to preserve your resources on another storage solution. If you do not perform a daily or at least a weekly backup, you run the risk of losing all data due to hardware failure or from an unforeseen security compromise.

, Technology is always advancing, and each curve might leave you at a disadvantage if you over-invested on hardware. If there is a situation where you have unused hardware, you can either leave it turned off, or sell it off for extra money to be spent on newer hardware in the future.

",How to Upgrade Your Network to Gigabit Ethernet,"


If you, and possibly also members of your household, regularly download large files, stream media, or perform other network-intensive tasks, such as hosting files on a server, or playing online games, you would likely benefit from the upgrade to Gigabit Ethernet.
Medium to large enterprises which require multiple users to be connected to the network simultaneously would also notice an improvement in productivity.
Individuals who use the internet solely for non-resource-intensive tasks such as e-mail, instant messaging, or surfing the web, may not see enough benefit to warrant the effort of upgrading to Gigabit Ethernet.;
,


If you purchased your computer, gaming console, or other network-capable device within the last two to three years, they may already be equipped with Gigabit-ready network ports.

In Windows: Click on the start menu, click inside the search box (or click 'Run...' in older versions of Windows), type ncpa.cpl and press enter. Right-click the icon for your network adapter, and left-click 'properties'. In the dialog box that opens, click the 'Configure' button. In this new dialog box, scroll in the main window until you find an entry similar to 'Connection Type' or 'Speed', and select it. Click on the 'Value' drop-down menu. If you see '1.0 Gbps Full Duplex' or similar, your computer is Gigabit-ready. If not, you may need to upgrade your hardware, as described in step 6, below.

In Ubuntu 12.04: Right-click the networking icon in the top panel of the desktop, and left-click 'Connection Information'. In the dialog box that appears, look at the 'Speed' value. A value of 1000 Mb/s indicates Gigabit-readiness.
For other devices, check the instruction manual for the device's technical specifications. Look at the network adapter specifications for the keywords 'gigabit' or '1000 Mbps.'

,


If you use a networked printer very frequently, you might consider checking it for Gigabit readiness, as well. Check the instruction manual, just as in the step above.

,


Look at the side of your network cables, and notice the cable type printed on them. If they are all labeled 'Cat5e', you are ready to go. If not, you can purchase new cables relatively inexpensively.
In most cases, Cat6 cables do not provide a significant performance increase over Cat5e cables. However, if you wish to future-proof your network, you may consider using Cat6 cables.

,


Even if every other part of your network is upgraded to Gigabit standard, if your router and switch are still Fast Ethernet, they will bottleneck your network.
For home use, many people already use a combination switch and router in a single device. A home-use Gigabit router/switch is very similar.

,


Step 2 described how to check if your networking hardware was compliant with the Gigabit Ethernet standard. If you found that it was not, you have a couple of options.
An economical choice would be to purchase a PCI Gigabit network expansion card. This card is to be installed in the rear of your PC, alongside your existing hardware. Disadvantages to this configuration include less-than-optimum speeds, and the need to remember which Ethernet port is attached to the Gigabit network card, and which is your old Fast Ethernet port. Accidentally connecting a Cat5e cable to a FastEthernet port would result in no performance gain at all.
A somewhat more expensive, but more effective solution is to replace your computer's motherboard. Ensure that the motherboard includes an on-board Gigabit adapter. For maximum speed, purchase a 64-bit motherboard, making sure that you have, or can obtain, a compatible 64-bit processor chip. Most larger computer stores can help you select the right products and install them for you, to ensure that all of your hardware components are compatible with each other.

,


Now that you have upgraded your hardware, or even if you did not require any upgrades, now is an excellent time to make sure that all of your devices' firmware and device drivers are up to date, for maximum speed, performance and reliability. The updates included in Windows updates may not be sufficient; visit the websites of your devices' manufacturers and download the latest updates direct from the source.

, hard disk drive, it is saved on.
Make sure your hard drive(s) mention a speed of 7200 RPM, and also consider a RAID 1 array, for improved access speed.
Alternatively, consider using solid state drives. While more expensive than traditional hard disk drives, solid state drives allow you to read and write almost instantaneously, vastly decreasing the speed bottleneck of a traditional hard disk drive.
Adding additional RAM to your system will also increase overall performance. A good minimum is 8GB total, but you probably won't notice a significant improvement after 12GB of RAM, unless you intend to use multiple resource-intensive software programs, such as 3D rendering or simulation programs, simultaneously.

,


If you frequently download large files, stream high-quality media, or otherwise use the internet heavily, it can be easy to unwittingly exceed your monthly download limit, leading to costly overage fees.
Check with your internet service provider to review your current download limit, and upgrade to a new plan if necessary. Choose the highest limit you can afford.
If you are unable to switch to a new plan or if you are still concerned about possibly exceeding your monthly limit, make sure you monitor your internet usage. Most ISPs will allow you to sign up for an account on their website in order to monitor your activity, make payments online, and possibly even modify your existing plan.

,


Once you have completed your upgrade to Gigabit Ethernet, visit a website such as http://www.speedtest.net which will check your current network speeds. If you are still not satisfied with your network speeds, you may want to go back and review some of the steps of this article.

Understand OSI Layer Services.",How to Understand Computer Networking," It is a set of hardware devices connected together, either physically or logically to allow them to exchange information. The first networks were time-sharing networks that used mainframes and attached terminals. Such environments were implemented by both IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA) and Digital network architecture.;
,


Local-area networks (LANs) evolved around the PC revolution. LANs enabled multiple users in a relatively small geographical area to exchange files and messages, as well as access shared resources such as file servers and printers.
Wide-area networks (WANs) interconnect LANs with geographically dispersed users to create connectivity. Some of the technologies used for connecting LANs include T1, T3, ATM, ISDN, ADSL, Frame Relay, radio links, and others. New methods of connecting dispersed LANs are appearing everyday.
High-speed LANs and switched inter-networks are becoming widely used, largely because they operate at very high speeds and support such high-bandwidth applications as multimedia and videoconferencing.

, These can be classified as connectivity and sharing of resources. Connectivity allows users to communicate with each other more effectively. Sharing of hardware and software resources enable better utilization of those resources, like say a color printer.

, Just like any other tool, networks have their own set of disadvantages like virus attacks and spam, added to the hardware, software and management expenses to create and maintain the network.

,


The OSI model - Network models help us to understand various functions of the components that provide us the networking service. The Open System Interconnection Reference Model is one of such models. OSI model describes how information from a software application in one computer moves through a network medium to a software application in another computer. The OSI reference model is a conceptual model composed of seven layers, each specifying particular network functions.
Layer 7 — Application Layer: The application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means that both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with the software application. This layer interacts with software applications that implement a communicating component. Such application programs fall outside the scope of the OSI model. Application layer functions typically include identifying communication partners, determining resource availability, and synchronizing communication. Examples of application layer implementations include Telnet, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), NFS and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
Layer 6 — Presentation Layer: The presentation layer provides a variety of coding and conversion functions that are applied to application layer data. These functions ensure that information sent from the application layer of one system would be readable by the application layer of another system. Some examples of presentation layer coding and conversion schemes include common data representation formats, conversion of character representation formats, common data compression schemes, and common data encryption schemes, for example, eXternal Data Representation (XDR) used by Network File System (NFS).
Layer 5 — Session Layer: The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions. Communication sessions consist of service requests and service responses that occur between applications located in different network devices. These requests and responses are coordinated by protocols implemented at the session layer. Examples of session layer protocols include NetBIOS, PPTP, RPC and SSH etc.
Layer 4 — Transport Layer: The transport layer accepts data from the session layer and segments the data for transport across the network. Generally, the transport layer is responsible for making sure that the data is delivered error-free and in the proper sequence. Flow control generally occurs at the transport layer. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are popular transport layer protocols.
Layer 3 — Network Layer: The network layer defines the network address, which differs from the MAC address. Some network layer implementations, such as the Internet Protocol (IP), define network addresses in a way that route selection can be determined systematically by comparing the source network address with the destination network address and applying the subnet mask. Because this layer defines the logical network layout, routers can use this layer to determine how to forward packets. Because of this, much of the design and configuration work for inter-networks happens at Layer 3, the network layer. The Internet Protocol (IP) and related protocols like ICMP, BGP etc are commonly used layer 3 protocols.
Layer 2 — Data link Layer: The data link layer provides reliable transit of data across a physical network link. Different data link layer specifications define different network and protocol characteristics, including physical addressing, network topology, error notification, sequencing of frames, and flow control. Physical addressing (as opposed to network addressing) defines how devices are addressed at the data link layer. Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) are common examples of layer 2 protocols.
Layer1 — Physical Layer: The physical layer defines the electrical, mechanical, procedural, and functional specifications for activating, maintaining, and deactivating the physical link between communicating network systems. Physical layer specifications define characteristics such as voltage levels, timing of voltage changes, physical data rates, maximum transmission distances, and physical connectors. Popular physical layer protocols include RS232, X.21, Firewire and SONET.

, The seven layers of the OSI reference model can be divided into two categories: upper layers and lower layers.


The upper layers of the OSI model deal with application issues and generally are implemented only in software. The highest layer, the application layer, is closest to the end user. Both users and application layer processes interact with software applications that contain a communications component. The term upper layer is sometimes used to refer to any layer above another layer in the OSI model.
The lower layers of the OSI model handle data transport issues. The physical layer and the data link layer are implemented partly in hardware and software. The lowest layer, the physical layer, is closest to the physical network medium (the network cabling, for example) and is responsible for actually placing information on the medium.

, A given layer in the OSI model generally communicates with three other OSI layers: the layer directly above it, the layer directly below it, and its peer layer in other networked computer systems. The data link layer in System A, for example, communicates with the network layer of System A, the physical layer of System A, and the data link layer in System B.

, One OSI layer communicates with another layer to make use of the services provided by the second layer. The services provided by adjacent layers help a given OSI layer communicate with its peer layer in other computer systems. Three basic elements are involved in layer services: the service user, the service provider, and the service access point (SAP). In this context, the service user is the OSI layer that requests services from an adjacent OSI layer. The service provider is the OSI layer that provides services to service users. OSI layers can provide services to multiple service users. The SAP is a conceptual location at which one OSI layer can request the services of another OSI layer."

Take a look at your modem, that's the box that was provided by your internet provider, there are usually 4 lights on that box.,
If any of those lights are not in the ""usual"" pattern of on and flashing, remove the power plug from the back of the modem and wait about 45 to 60 seconds then plug it back in.

,, Do you see an amber-yellow color light? That is most likely your standby light, that generally means that you pressed the on/off or 'standby' button and you need to press it again.

, Check to see if your online, if not remove the Ethernet cable from the modem and plug your computer directly into the modem with the Ethernet cable from the router, or use a cable to directly connect the computer to the modem.

, Then check to see if you can get online. If not, then call your internet service provider and be prepared to have to do many of these steps all over again. Most, if not all, technicians have software that they can use to gather information from the modem. And they need to establish a baseline signal level to see if the modem is getting good signal to determine if a field technician is required.

Strip the cable of its protective outside jacket about 3–6 inches (7.6–15.2 cm) from the end.,
Expose the wire a little further.,
If your cable has the small string, make a small cut in the jacket of the cable, making sure not to touch any wires, and then use the string to pull towards the fresh end of the cable exposing about 6 inches (15.2 cm) of cable.,
If your cable does not have the small string, make a small cut in the jacket described above and GENTLY pull all of the wires together in one hand and pull the jacket in the opposite direction.,
Untwist the wires completely to the jacket.,
Terminate each wire.,
Use a cable tester to assure that you correctly terminated all the wires.",How to Terminate an 8P8C (Rj45) Jack," This can be done with the cabling scissors by applying pressure from the scissors to the cable and rotating the scissors around the cable. After you have punctured the cables jacket, you should be able pull the jacket off easily leaving exposed wires.;
, Stripping the cable can cut and damage the wires at the area that we cut the cable so we want to expose about 6 more inches of fresh wires. Most twisted pair Cat5, Cat5e and Cat6 cables have a small string inside the cable to assist with this.

, Cut the string after you have enough exposed cable.

,


All Cat5,Cat5e and Cat6 cables follow a standard color pattern for the individual wires. Blue, Orange, Green and Brown. There are two wires per color. White/Blue and Blue, White/Orange and Orange, White/Green and Green, White/Brown and Brown. If you look at the back side of your jack, you will see the corresponding colors where you will terminate the cable to.
**IMPORTANT** There are two color patterns, T568A and T568B. Make sure to terminate both sides of the cable on the same pattern. If you have already terminated one side of the cable, look to see what pattern was used! If you have not already terminated, choose a standard that you will always use. Both patterns will produce the same results. **IMPORTANT**

, Place the wires into the appropriate color slot on the jack. Make sure to place the wires as tightly as possible in the slots in regards to the jacket. There should be as little exposed and untwisted wire as possible to keep the signal strength as high as possible. Make sure to place the White/Blue in the White/Blue spot and not the solid Blue spot. The White/Color wire is not the same as the solid color.

, After all the wires are in the correct spot and double checked to make sure as little amount of exposed wires will be left as possible, use the punch down tool with the 110 blade and terminate each wire individually. The 110 blade will fully cover the wire connector on the jack. Push down until the tool clicks and cuts the end of the wire off. Repeat this step if the wire was not fully cut.

, You will need to have terminated both sides of the cable to be able to test. Cable testers function differently depending on make and model so be sure to read the instructions of the tester you are going to use.

The basic layout is as follows:Connect the computer that is sharing the connection (the ""host"") to the broadband modem via Ethernet or 4G hotspot via USB. If you are connecting a modem to the host computer via Ethernet, it will need two Ethernet ports (one to connect to the modem, and the other to connect to the hub or router).
Connect the host computer to the WAN port of a wired hub or wireless router using an Ethernet cable.
Connect the other computers to the hub or router using Ethernet or a wireless signal. Note that the connecting computers don't need any special settings, and can be running any operating system.
If you're just connecting two computers, connect them directly via Ethernet.;
, You can quickly open this window by pressing the Windows key + R and typing ncpa.cpl.

, This could be your modem or your USB hotspot. Make sure that you are only performing these steps on the adapter that is actually connected to the internet, not the adapter that will be connecting the host to the rest of the network.

,, Click Apply to save your changes.

First, you'll need to enable internet connection sharing on the host computer by following Steps 1-5 of the first section.


The host computer will need to have a wireless adapter that isn't being used in order to broadcast a signal for other computers and devices to connect to. If the host computer doesn't have a wireless card installed, you can use a USB wireless adapter.
Make sure you only enable internet connection sharing on the adapter that's connected to the internet. Don't enable internet sharing on the wireless adapter that you'll be using to create the wireless network.

Connect your other computers and devices to the router or hub.,
My other devices are not able to get an internet connection.",How to Share an Internet Connection3," OS X's Sharing menu allows you to easily share your Mac's internet connection using any of your installed network adapters. The computer sharing the network is called the ""host"" computer. You will need at least two network adapters installed in the host to share your connection; one to connect to the internet, and one to connect to the rest of your network.If you have an unused wireless adapter (for example, your host is connected to the modem via Ethernet), you can use it to create a wireless network that other devices can connect to in order to access the internet.
If you have two Ethernet adapters, you can connect one to the modem, and the other to a network switch or router. Your other computers and devices can then connect to this network.

, For the best results, it's recommended that you connect the host computer directly to your broadband modem via Ethernet, or use a USB hotspot. If your Mac doesn't have an Ethernet port, you can use a USB or Thunderbolt adapter., Click the Apple menu and select ""System Preferences"".

, This will open the Sharing window.

, This will enable sharing for the host computer's internet connection.

, If you're connected to your modem via Ethernet, select it from the menu. If you're connected to a USB hotspot, select it instead.


Click Start to confirm that you want to enable internet sharing. Note that turning internet connection sharing on will likely disrupt any existing network you have set up.

, The method you choose depends on the way you want other computers to connect.


If you want to turn your Mac into a wireless hotspot, check the ""Wi-Fi"" box.
If you want to connect your Mac to a network hub or wireless router, select ""Ethernet"".

, If you opted to share your host's internet connection with a hub or router which the other computers will connect to, use an Ethernet cable and connect your host to the hub's WAN port., If you decided to turn your Mac into a wireless access point, click the Wi-Fi Options... to set a name and security key for the network. Make sure to select ""WPA2 Personal"" as the ""Security"" type, and create a password that won't be easily guessed.If you're in a crowded living area such as an apartment complex, change the ""Channel"" to something other than 6 or 11, as these are the two most common ones. Doing so will help reduce interference.

, Your host Mac is now ready to share its internet connection, and you can connect the other computers and devices as if it was a typical network.

If connecting via Ethernet, connect each additional computer to the LAN ports on the router or hub. They should automatically get IP addressed and be able to connect to the internet.
If connecting wirelessly, connect to the router as if you were connecting to any wireless network.

, This will often occur if you've made changes to the sharing settings after enabling the wireless network. The quickest way to try to fix this problem is by disabling Internet Sharing, restarting the Mac, and then re-enabling it and creating a new wireless network."

Check the IP address and the host’s subnet mask.,
Find out what the broadcast address is.,
Obtain the quantity of subnets.,
Acquire the number of hosts.,
Assess the mask you will need for the network.,
Refer to the Class C mask to create subnetworks.,
Decide which Class C mask to use for your sub-networks.",How to Subnet a Class C Network," When you check these, you’ll be able to get the following information:


The location of the host’s subnet.
The subnet’s broadcast address.
The subnet valid host’s range that is used to set up hosts.;
, After you’ve gotten the subnet, it’s important to understand that the broadcast address is not a valid host address. Therefore, you cannot assign it to a host configuration. When you learn what the subnet and broadcast addresses are, it’ll be easier for you to find out the host address. That’s because the real host range consists of numbers between the broadcast address and the subnet address.

, Find out the number of subnets by using the following formula: 2ⁿ. The n component is the number of subnet bits in the mask. A bit is the smallest entity of data in a computer. It has a single binary value, which is either 0 or 1. In computer terminology, 0 means off while 1 means on. For subnets, the bit is 1, which also means it on.

, Find out the amount of hosts by using the following formula: 2ⁿ - 2. The n component is the number of host bits in the mask. For host, the bit is 0, which means it’s off.

, You will need to find the number of sub-networks as well as the hosts for each network. After you get this information, you will need to use the same formula, which is 2ⁿ - 2.

, The best way to create sub-networks is to memorize Class C masks. The default subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. There are other subnet masks that make up Class C. You will find these masks not only on the Internet, but in computer networking books.

, Perform this step after you’ve determined your networks and hosts. For example, if you want to create eight sub-networks. Each of them demands ten hosts. The Class C mask you would use is 255.255.255.240. This is because the binary for 240 is 11110000. Remember, the subnet bit is 1, while the host bit is 0. Therefore, in 240, there are four bits for the subnet and four bits for the host. Using the formula, 2ⁿ - 2, you will get 14 subnets and 14 hosts.

Draw any routers you may be using to separate major portions of your network first. Smaller private networks do not require routers, but may still use them for administrative reasons. Routers are only required if you are planning to a) Divide your network into multiple smaller networks, or b) Allow indirect internet access using NAT. Next, add any switches and hubs. For small networks, only one switch or hub may be necessary.
Draw boxes to represent the computers and lines connecting the devices together. This drawing will serve as your network diagram.
Although diagrams intended only for your own use may use any symbols you desire, use of industry standard symbols make this task simpler and eliminates confusion for others. Typical industry standard symbols are:


Routers: Circle with four arrows arranged in a cross. Or just a cross if drawing a quick draft.
Switches: Square or rectangle, with four staggered arrows, two in each direction. Represents the concept of signals being ""switched"" - relayed only out the port which leads to the intended user based on address.
Hubs: Same as switch, with a single double-headed arrow. Represents the concept of all signals being blindly repeated out all ports without concern for which port leads to the intended recipient.
Lines and squares can be used to represent connections leading to computers.;
, 4) addresses are written like this: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (four numbers separated by three dots), in all RFC-1166 compliant countries. Each number ranges from 0 to 255. This is known as ""Dotted Decimal Notation"" or ""Dot Notation"" for short. The address is divided into two portions: the network portion and the host portion.
For ""Classful"" networks, the network and host portions are as follows:
(""n"" represents the network portion, ""x"" represents the host portion)
When the first number is 0 to 126 - nnn.xxx.xxx.xxx (ex. 10.xxx.xxx.xxx)
These are known as ""Class A"" networks.
When the first number is 128 to 191 - nnn.nnn.xxx.xxx (ex. 172.16.xxx.xxx)
These are known as ""Class B"" networks.
When the first number is 192 to 223 - nnn.nnn.nnn.xxx (ex. 192.168.1.xxx)
These are known as ""Class C"" networks.
When the first number is 224 to 239 - The address is used for multi-casting.
When the first number is 240 to 255 - The address is ""experimental"".
Multicast & Experimental addresses are beyond the scope of this article. However, do note that because IPv4 does not treat them the same way as other addresses they should not be used.
For simplicity ""non-classful networks"", sub-netting, and CIDR will not be discussed in this article.
The network portion specifies a network; the host portion specifies an individual device on a network.
For any given network:

The range of all possible host portion numbers gives the Address Range.
(ex. 172.16.xxx.xxx the range is 172.16.0.0 to 172.16.255.255)
The lowest possible address is the Network Address.
(ex. 172.16.xxx.xxx the network address is 172.16.0.0)
This address is used by devices to specify the network itself, and cannot be assigned to any device.

The highest possible address is the Broadcast Address.
(ex. 172.16.xxx.xxx the broadcast address is 172.16.255.255)
This address is used when a packet is meant for all devices on a specific network, and cannot be assigned to any device.

The remaining numbers in the range are the Host Range.
(ex. 172.16.xxx.xxx the host range is 172.16.0.1 to 172.16.255.254)
These are the numbers you can assign to computers, printers, and other devices.Host Addresses are individual addresses within this range.


Assign network(s). A network, for this purpose, is any group of connections separated by a router.
Your network may not have routers or, if accessing the Internet with NAT, have only one router between your private network and the public internet. If this is your only router, or if you have no routers, your entire private network is considered one network.
Choose a network with a host range large enough to provide an address to each device. Class C networks (ex. 192.168.0.x) allow for 254 host addresses (192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254), which is fine if you have no more than 254 devices. But if you have 255 or more devices, you will either need to use a Class B network (ex. 172.16.x.x) or divide your private network into smaller networks with routers.
If additional routers are used, they become ""internal routers"", the private network becomes a ""private intranet"", and each group of connections is a separate network requiring its own network address and range. This includes connections between routers, and connections directly from a router to a single device.
For simplicity, the remainder of these steps will assume you have only one network, of 254 or less devices, and uses 192.168.2.x as an example. We will also assume you are not using DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) to assign host addresses automatically.

, If you have more than one network it's best to write each address near the network it belongs to.

, Write the host addresses next to the devices they belong to on the diagram. At first you may wish to write the entire address (ex. 192.168.2.5) next to each device. However, as you become more proficient simply writing the host portion (ex. .5) may help save time.
Switches will not require addresses for the purpose discussed here. Routers will require addresses as described in the ""Important Notes"" section.

, For 192.168.2.x, which is a Class C, the mask is: 255.255.255.0 The computer needs it to tell which part of the IP address is the network and which is the host.
IPv4 originally used the first number (ex. 192) to determine this based on the address class, as described above. However, the advent of subnetting and non-classful networking made it necessary to provide a mask because other ways of dividing the address into network and host portions are now possible. For Class A addresses the mask is 255.0.0.0, for Class B it's 255.255.0.0 (More information in the Important Notes section.)

, Gather all needed materials including cables, computers, ethernet switches, and (if used) routers. Locate the Ethernet ports on the computers and other devices. Look for the 8-pin modular connector. (RJ-45 style) It looks like a standard telephone jack except it's a bit larger because it has more conductors.
Connect the cables between each device, just as in your map. If an unforeseen circumstance causes you to vary from the diagram, make notes to show any changes.

, Power on all other connected devices. (Some devices have no ""power switch"" and will power up simply by plugging them in.)

, Go to internet options (this varies depending on the Operating System), and go to the dialog box that lets you change the TCP/IP protocol. Change the radio buttons from ""Obtain from DHCP server automatically"" to ""Use the following IP address:"". Type in your IP address for that computer, and the appropriate subnet mask (255.255.255.0).
If you have no routers, leave the ""Default Gateway"" and ""DNS server"" fields blank.
If connecting to the internet using NAT, use the Host Address assigned to the router between your private network and the internet as both the DNS server and the Default Gateway. Do not use the Network Address (192.168.2.0)
If using more than one router see the Important Notes section.
If configuring a home network with a relatively new router, This section can be ignored as long as the network is connected correctly, The router will assign network addresses to everything on the network going into your network, until it hits another router.

, The simplest way to do this is with Ping. Bring up MS-DOS or the equivalent on other OS's, (In Windows open the command prompt which is located in the Start Menu - Accessories - Command Prompt) and type in: ping 192.168.2.. Do this on one host and ping to all other hosts. Remember, your router is considered a host. If you cannot reach one, read over the steps again or contact a professional.


NAT allows private networks to connect to public networks, by converting IP addresses on the private network to ones allowed on the public network. All devices will appear from the Internet's perspective to be connected to one of its public networks according to the public addressing plan (as defined by IANA - Internet Assignment Numbering Authority). ""Dynamic NAT"" allows multiple private IPs to ""take turns"" using a public IP.
A related technology, PNAT (Port Network Address Translation) - also known as PAT (Port Address Translation) or NAT ""Overloading"", allows multiple private IPs to ""share"" one public IP at the same time. It manipulates both OSI Layer 3 and OSI Layer 4 information so connections from multiple private IPs appear to come from one computer with one public IP.
Many computer, electronics, and even department store sell small routers designed to allow multiple users to share a single internet connection. Almost all of these use PAT, to eliminate the need for more than one public IP (extra public IPs may be expensive, or not allowed, depending on your provider).
If you use one, you will need to assign one of your private network's Host Addresses to the router.
If using a more complex commercial router, you will need to assign a private Host Addresses to the interface connecting to your private network, your public IP to the interface connecting to the Internet, and configure NAT/PAT manually.
If using only one router, the interface used to connect the router to your private network will become both the ""DNS Server Interface"" and the ""Default Gateway"". You will need to add its address to these fields when configuring your other devices.

If your network is divided using one or more internal routers, each router will require an address for each network connected to it. (IP Unnumbered is beyond the scope of this article) This address will need to be a host address (just like a computer's) from the host range of the network. Typically, the first available host address (that's the second address in the address range ex. 192.168.1.1) will be used; however any address in the host range is fine as long as you know what it is. Do not use the network address (ex. 192.168.1.0), or the broadcast address (ex 192.168.1.255).
For networks containing one or more user devices (ex. printers, computers, storage devices) the address the router uses for that network will become ""Default Gateway"" for the other devices. The DNS server, if present, should remain the address used by the router between your networks and the internet. For networks interconnecting routers, no default gateway is needed. For networks containing both user devices and routers, any router on that network will do.
A network is a network, no matter how big or small. When two routers are connected by one cable, even though a Class C (the smallest network) contains 256 addresses, all will belong to the cable. The network address will be .0, the broadcast will be .255, two of the hosts will be used (one for each interface the cable connects), and the other 252 will simply go to waste because they cannot be used anywhere else.
Generally, the small home routers described above are not used for this purpose. When they are, understand the ethernet interfaces on the ""private network"" side usually belong to a ""switch"" which is built into the router. The router itself connects to this internally using only one interface. When this is the case, only one host IP will be used by all of them, and they will all be on the same network.
When a router has multiple interfaces with multiple IP's, each interface and IP will create a different network.

The concept of a subnet mask. The general concept will help in understanding why this number matters.
Dotted decimal notation is a human way of writing IP Addresses to make them easier to work with. What the computer ""sees"" is 32 ones and zeros in a row like this: 11000000101010000000001000000000. IPv4 originally broke this into 4 groups of 8, hence the ""dots"" - 11000000.10101000.00000010.00000000, each group is an ""octet"" of 8 bits. Dotted decimal writes the value of the octet in decimal to make it easier for people to read - 192.168.2.0
A complex set of rules concerning the order of the ones and zeros in the first octet was used to create the ""Classful Addressing Scheme""; however, no subnet mask was needed. For all Class A's the first octet was network, for Class B's the first and second were network, for Class C's the first three.
In 1987, intra-nets started becoming larger and the Internet was on its way. Wasting whole Class C ranges of 254 host addresses on small networks became a problem. Class A and B networks often wasted addresses because physical limitations forced networks to be divided by routers before they could get large enough to use so many addresses. (Class B's host range (256 X 256) - 2 = 65534 addresses; Class A's (256^3) - 2 = 16777214.)
Subnetting divides a large Classful network into many smaller ""sub-nets"" by increasing the number of ones and zeros used to address networks(leaving fewer for the hosts in each network). A small subnet can then be assigned to a small network without using a large number of extra addresses. To say which bits are the network address we use a 1. The ""mask"" (ex. 255.255.255.192) when converted to binary (ex. 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000) defines exactly how many more bits are added to the network portion (ex. two host bit). In this example, one Class C with 254 hosts becomes four sub-nets with 62 hosts each. Of these sub-nets only two may be assigned to networks; the first and last cannot be used according to RFC-950.
Further discussion of the rules of subnetting is beyond the scope of this article. What matters here is that even though we are using Classful addresses, Windows (and other software) doesn't know this. And hence, will still need a mask to tell it how many bits we want to use for the network portion. By saying 255.255.255.0, we're saying that

For those choosing to install a wired network larger than 15 to 20 devices, the requirement demands the hiring of a consultant for all wiring and installation based issues. However, in the case of installation of a wireless network, the need would be to have one or more wireless access points. But then again be it either type of infrastructure, the requirement would be to possess round-the-clock Internet connectivity through the chosen Internet Service Provider.;
, The need in this case is to identify the IP addressing scheme and then progressively assign IP addresses to servers on the network. Servers with static IP addresses are easy to find on the network using DNS services. Please pay attention private networks typically use a ""192.168.0.n"" range, wherein ""n"" is considered as the host address for each individual device. Once done, assign a subnet mask of ""255.255.255.0"" for this range. Please note Windows Vista and Windows 7 provide automatic IP addressing scheme for each device automatically, all based on the fact what the OS determines via the prevailing network discovery processes.

",How to Set up a Router2," It should be a square-ish connector on the device end. On computers and laptops, there may be a symbol depicting three computers with lines connecting them. On the router side, look for a set of four ports-that is the common configuration, which usually would be numbered.

, For simplicity's sake, just insert the connection into the port in the router with the number one. If you find difficulty connecting the cable, try aligning the locking tab with the slot. If the cable doesn't work, make sure you are using a Ethernet cable, not a telephone cable which looks similar.

, Insert the ports in ascending order for clarity.

, If there is none, choose an empty slot.


If your router is also a modem, you will not need to do the above step.

, If your computer is connected directly to the router by an Ethernet cable, your setup may be complete. If you are using wi-fi, you may need to enter settings into configuration windows. This is usually done with a browser by communicating directly with the router through the router's IP address. For more information, see the router instruction guide.

The first option that a website owner may want to explore is to use the web space that is allocated for each web hosting plan.,
Another option would be to host it on a remote website such as Box.Net or any other remote file storage websites.,
For image files you may want to explore using other types of image hosting websites to safely store your files.",How to Safely Store Files Through Web Hosting," This is the simplest and easiest method as you will be storing the files directly in your website's domain itself and on your web host's servers. Of course, the drawback to this method is that if people hotlink directly to your files, your bandwidth will be eaten up pretty quickly. Also, most web hosts usually only give an allocated amount of space which may run out if you use it extensively.;
, These websites allow you to upload your files to their server and hotlink the files from there. Not only does this save you some bandwidth as you are not hosting your own files, but it also allows you to keep a large number of files on the web host. This is one method to safely store files through web hosting. However, the fact that the files are hosted on a remote server also means that they can go down anytime, and they can also be deleted anytime. It would be prudent to keep a backup of your files either on your own server or on your computer just in case.

, Online image directories such as Flickr, Imageshack and other such image hosting directories may be a good solution for you to remotely host your pictures. The drawback however, is that with high resolution pictures you may tend to hit the bandwidth cap of the host very quickly. Of course it is always better than using up your own bandwidth. For the larger image directories such as Flickr, they have little downtime and would be a good alternative to storing your image files through web hosting.

There are a variety of speed test sites on the net, just search for ""speed test"" in Google and pick the top few results.


Different tests will give you different results. Even the same test may give you different results between tests. This is due to the location of test servers and the number of people sharing your connection.
Take multiple tests and find the average speed you are getting.
You may need to have Flash installed to run the test.
If given the option, pick the test server closest to your physical location. This will help get you the most accurate results (on speedtest.net, this is chosen automatically based on ping);
, Check with your service provider to see what speeds you should be getting. Keep in mind that speeds advertised by your provider are ""best case"" speeds, and you may not be able to actually get that number on a regular basis, especially if using WiFi.


If you haven't upgraded your internet in a long time, you may be able to get better speeds for less money. Companies aren't usually keen to inform you of better deals, so check to see if new services are available that weren't when you signed up. Check with all the providers in your area.
Be aware of the megabyte/megabit difference. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) advertise in megabits, not megabytes. There are 8 megabits (Mb) in a megabyte (MB), so if you are paying for 25 megabits per second (Mbps), then that's just over 3 megabytes per second (MBps) of actual maximum transfer speed. If your test result was measured in Kbps, then you divide that number by 1000 to attain your measurement in Mbps.

, Restarting your modem and router can help alleviate some network issues by cleaning up old data and re-provisioning your modem configuration from your internet service provider. If necessary, your modem will automatically download firmware updates from the ISP. See this guide for details on resetting your network.

, If you are using a wireless router, some devices can affect your connection due to interference. Wireless routers come in multiple varieties; 802.11 b, g, and n (2.4 GHz) or 802.11 a (5.8 GHz). Common devices that can interfere with your wireless connection are microwaves and cell phones, many of which operate in the 2.4 GHz range. In order to minimize interference, turn off data on your phone and move your microwave oven away from wireless devices and your router when you're using the connection.

, Some internet providers enforce a data cap on their customers' internet usage. A data cap limits the amount of information you can download and upload over the internet in the course of a month. Occasionally, they may call this a ""data usage plan"". Log in to your account page, or contact the customer service department to see if you have gone over your monthly allowance. Often, the penalty for going over the cap is decreased speed for the rest of the billing period or extra charges on your bill.

, Sometimes you just have bad service that can only be fixed on your provider's end. They can usually tell if your connection is substandard without having a technician come to your home by reading signal levels off of your modem. If necessary, they will send a line technician out to your house or neighborhood to check their infrastructure. If the problem is on your end, you might be charged a fee for the visit, so it's important to try troubleshooting over the phone or internet first.

, If someone else on your network is downloading a lot of media from the internet, such as watching streaming videos or downloading large files, it is probably using a significant percentage of your bandwidth. If you're familiar with your router's web interface, you may be able to find QoS (Quality of Service) settings to prioritize traffic from certain IPs or service and limit the throughput for others. Otherwise, ask them to keep their downloading habits to a minimum.

, If you are connected to the internet via a Wi-Fi router, poor signal can lead to lower speeds and dropped connections. Move your router closer to your computer if possible, or move the computer so that it is closer to the router or keep the router on top of a cupboard to transmit better signal.Clean out the dust from your router and modem once in a while using a can of compressed air. This will help keep the unit from overheating and consequently, improve its stability.
Maintain proper ventilation around all electrical components to avoid overheating.

, When you activated DSL, you hooked the line from your phone jack into one side of a rectangular box filter. On the other side, you have 2 lines coming out, 1 for your phone and 1 for your modem. If you are using a DSL connection over your land-line, make sure that you have high-quality filters in place to get optimum signal speed.

, If you are using satellite internet, your internet connection might be altered because of wind, heavy snow, rain, lightning, static, or other electrical interference.

, Viruses can eat up your computer's resources and reduce your connection speed in addition to putting your information and identity at risk. Keeping your computer virus-free will go a long way towards speeding up your connection.You should always have an antivirus program installed and active, especially if you are using the internet. Antivirus programs can be installed for free. You should only have one antivirus installed at at time (otherwise they would conflict with each other).

, Most antivirus programs will not scan for adware and spyware. These are potentially dangerous programs and can greatly reduce the speed of your connection as they constantly connect to other servers. Removing these can be difficult, but there are a variety of programs that are specifically deigned to target and remove invasive programs. Unlike antivirus programs, you can and should have multiple different anti-malware programs installed:


Malwarebytes Antimalware
Spybot Search & Destroy
Adw Cleaner
HitMan Pro

, If you've installed a lot of toolbars for your browser, these can significantly slow down your connection. Removing these toolbars can help speed up your browser, and can also help protect your private information.


Some toolbars can be difficult to remove, and you may need to use one of the antimalware programs listed in the previous step.

, If your old browser is infested with hard-to-remove toolbars and everything just seems to be running really slow, you may want to consider switching to a new browser. Microsoft Edge, Chrome, and Opera are all considered significantly faster than Internet Explorer and Firefox., A poorly-optimized hard disk can drag down your computer's speed, affecting everything you do, including browsing the web. Keeping your hard drive optimized only takes a few minutes and can significantly improve your browsing experience.


Make sure that your disk is regularly defragmented. Most modern versions of Windows automate this for you.
Run Disk Cleanup to flush out temporary files which could be slowing down your browser.
Try to keep at least 15% of your hard disk free. If your hard drive gets too full, programs will take longer to load and make changes, which can drastically slow down your browser.

, Web browsers store data from websites that you visit to make visiting them again quicker in the future. If your cache gets too large though, it can actually negatively affect your performance.


See this guide for instructions on clearing your cache depending on the browser you use.

, Often your connection speed is slow because other programs are using it. To test if other programs, such as anti-virus and other updates, are accessing the Internet without your knowing, you'll need to open the Command Prompt. Press the Windows key + R to open the Run box. Type cmd and press Enter. (Win 7, Start>All programs>Accessories> right click on Command prompt, choose 'run as Administrator')


Type netstat -b 5 > activity.txt and press Enter. You will start to see a list of programs that are accessing the internet. After a minute or so, press Ctrl + C to end the scan. This has created a file with a list of all programs using your Internet connection.
Type activity.txt and press Enter to open the file and view the program list.

, Press Ctrl + Alt + Delete simultaneously and open up the Task Manager. Go to the process menu and close those processes that may be hogging your valuable bandwidth. (NOTE: Closing processes with unknown filenames may cause known programs to not function properly).


Look for the ""User"" column in the Processes tab. If the process is under the ""System"" User, then closing it may cause other programs to fail, requiring a restart of the computer. If the User is your name, closing the program will likely not cause any issues except with that program. Often the system will not allow closing of, or will reopen, needed system programs.

, If you've found programs that are taking up bandwidth that you no longer need or don't remember installing, uninstalling them can help improve the bandwidth that your browser can access.


See this guide to uninstall programs in Windows.
See this guide to uninstall programs in OS X.

, If many people in your building are using the same channel, then you could notice a major slowdown in your Internet speed. Use a program such as inSSIDer for PC and KisMAC or Wi-Fi Scanner for Mac to scan for channels that aren't as populated. Switching to one of these channels will reduce interference and possibly increase your speed.


If you see a more open channel, then switch channels to increase Internet speed. You'll need to consult your router's documentation or look up the support site for your individual router to find out how to do access the router and change the wireless channel.

, Check the manufacturer's web site for firmware downloads for your router. Compare this with your version, and upgrade if necessary. Most routers will automatically check for firmware updates when you open their configuration pages.

, If your computer is slow, it doesn't matter how fast your Internet connection is, the whole thing will just seem slow. You can only access the Internet as fast as your PC will allow you to.


One of the quickest and easiest computer upgrades you can perform to increase the performance of your web browser is to install more or better RAM on your computer.

, If your router is old, chances are it can barely keep up with modern web traffic. Old wireless routers will also have weak antennae, which can leave your devices without a solid connection to the network. All of this combined can lead to sub-optimal speeds when browsing the web.


Look for routers from trusted companies such as Netgear, D-Link, Cisco, and Belkin. Make sure that the included antennae are strong enough to reach everywhere that you need.
If you are covering a large area with your wireless network, you may need to install a repeater. This will rebroadcast your wireless signal in another area of your home or office, and greatly increases the range of your wireless network.

, Any solid-state electronics will degrade over time due to accumulated heat damage. Your broadband modem will have a harder and harder time 'concentrating' on maintaining a good connection as it gets older (signal to noise ratios will go down, and the number of resend requests for the same packet will go up). An after-market cable modem as opposed to a cable-company modem will frequently offer a better connection.


Make sure that any third-party cable modem you purchase will work with your current service provider.

, If you can, try to hardwire as many of your connected devices as possible. This will lead to higher speeds for those devices, as well as less interference for your remaining wireless devices, such as tablets and phones.

, So now that you know you want satellite radio and what service you want let's talk about your gear. To receive satellite radio you need three things: a receiver (tuner), a broadcast source (speakers), and an antenna. What you need specifically depends on where you plan to listen to your satellite radio. So take a second and ask yourself? ""Do I want to listen to satellite radio in the car, in the home or do I want the flexibility to listen to it anywhere and everywhere?""

,, This will list all of the wireless cards that support monitor (not injection) mode.


If no cards are listed, try disconnecting and reconnecting the card and check that it supports monitor mode. You can check if the card supports monitor mode by typing ifconfig in another terminal, if the card is listed in ifconfig, but doesn’t show up in airmon-ng, then the card doesn’t support it.

, For example, if yours is wlan0, your command would be: airmon-ng start wlan0.


The “(monitor mode enabled)” message means that the card has successfully been put into monitor mode. Note the name of the new monitor interface, mon0.

,, It will now list all of the wireless networks in your area, and lots of useful information about them. Locate your network or the network that you have permission to penetration test. Once you’ve spotted your network on the ever-populating list, hit Ctrl+C on your keyboard to stop the process. Note the channel of your target network.

, Now type this command: airodump-ng -c --bssid -w /root/Desktop/ Replace with the channel of your target network. Paste the network BSSID where is, and replace with the name of your monitor-enabled interface, (mon0).
A complete command should look like this: airodump-ng -c 10 --bssid 00:14:BF:E0:E8:D5 -w /root/Desktop/ mon0.

, Airodump with now monitor only the target network, allowing us to capture more specific information about it. What we’re really doing now is waiting for a device to connect or reconnect to the network, forcing the router to send out the four-way handshake that we need to capture in order to crack the password. 


Also, four files should show up on your desktop; this is where the handshake will be saved when captured, so don’t delete them! But we’re not really going to wait for a device to connect, no, that’s not what impatient hackers do.
We’re actually going to use another cool-tool that belongs to the aircrack suite called aireplay-ng, to speed up the process. Instead of waiting for a device to connect, hackers use this tool to force a device to reconnect by sending deauthentication (deauth) packets to the device, making it think that it has to reconnect with the router. Of course, in order for this tool to work, there has to be someone else connected to the network first, so watch the airodump-ng and wait for a client to show up. It might take a long time, or it might only take a second before the first one shows. If none show up after a lengthy wait, then the network might be empty right now, or you’re to far away from the network.

, In this terminal, type this command: aireplay-ng –0 2 –a –c mon0.


The –0 is a short cut for the death mode and the 2 is the number of deauth packets to send.
-a indicates the access point (router)’s bssid; replace with the BSSID of the target network, for example 00:14:BF:E0:E8:D5.
-c indicates the clients BSSID. Replace the with the BSSID of the connected client; this will be listed under “STATION.”
And of course, mon0 merely means the monitor interface; change it if yours is different.
A complete command looks like this: aireplay-ng –0 2 –a 00:14:BF:E0:E8:D5 –c 4C:EB:42:59:DE:31 mon0.

, You’ll see aireplay-ng send the packets, and within moments, you should see this message appear on the airodump-ng screen! This means that the handshake has been captured, the password is in the hacker’s hands, in some form or another.


You can close the aireplay-ng terminal and hit Ctrl+C on the airodump-ng terminal to stop monitoring the network, but don’t close it yet just incase you need some of the information later.
From now on, the process is entirely between your computer, and those four files on your Desktop. Actually, the .cap one, that is important.

, Type in this command: aircrack-ng -a2 -b -w /root/Desktop/*.cap


-a is the method aircrack will use to crack the handshake, 2=WPA method.
-b stands for bssid; replace with the BSSID of the target router, like 00:14:BF:E0:E8:D5.
-w stands for wordlist; replace with the path to a wordlist that you have downloaded. For example, you might have “wpa.txt” in the root folder./root/Desktop/*
.cap is the path to the .cap file containing the password; the * means wild card in Linux, and assuming there are no other .cap files on your Desktop, this should work fine the way it is.
A complete command looks like this: aircrack-ng –a2 –b 00:14:BF:E0:E8:D5 –w /root/wpa.txt  /root/Desktop/*.cap.

, However, it will only crack it if the password happens to be in the wordlist that you’ve selected. Sometimes, it’s not. If this is the case, then you can congratulate the owner on being “impenetrable,” of course, only after you’ve tried every wordlist that a hacker might use or make!"

Ask for free cable.",How to Get Free Digital Cable1,"


One of the best ways to get free digital cable is simply by obtaining it from your local cable company. Contact the help desk at the company from which you would be obtaining the cable, and ask if there is any way for you to get digital cable for free. Often, companies will give you a few free months if they believe you will pay for the cable further down the road.;

Hulu is a company which offers digital-quality cable television shows on your computer, free of charge.
Visit Hulu.com to view your favorite shows. Be aware that currently, Hulu does not allow you to watch digital cable television shows at their time of broadcast. Instead, you must wait at least one day after broadcast to see the shows in which you are interested.

,


Like Hulu.com, the TVU network allows you to watch digital-quality cable television programs on your computer. Unlike Hulu, however, which allows you to simply visit a website and select your favorite shows, TVU requires a download. Visit the TVU Network homepage to begin the downloading process.
Once at the homepage of the TVU Network, you can find a green button in the upper right-hand corner which says ""download.""
Click this button, and follow all downloading instructions which follow. Depending on your individual computer, instructions may vary quite a bit.
Understand that the TVU Network operates much like traditional versions of digital cable television. This means that you can only watch digital television which is currently being broadcast. Unlike Hulu, you cannot watch programs which may have aired several days beforehand.

Choose the satellite radio subscription that will suit your needs for the best portable radio.,
Decide where the product will be used to choose the best satellite radio.,
Look for features that will make your movable satellite radio more efficient, easy to use, and more difficult to damage.",How to Get the Right Portable Satellite Radio,"


There is 1 satellite radio service provider in the United States: SiriusXm Satellite Radio. The company was formed when 2 competing companies, Sirius Radio and XM, merged in 2008.
The XM subscriptions have more channels available for all subscription levels than Sirius, except the internet and smartphone option which has equal channels for both systems.
Some shows are exclusive to either the Sirius or XM packages. Carefully review the station offerings before deciding on a subscription plan to ensure your favorite shows are available.
The price for subscriptions is the same.;
,


If you want to use the satellite radio primarily in a vehicle, consider a radio that can be docked in the car to utilize existing speakers.
If you want to listen to your own music and have access to satellite radio, a combination satellite radio and MP3 player will allow you to do both.
The Internet subscription plan for both Sirius and XM allow users to listen to the satellite radio channels on their computer, smartphone, tablet, or Internet radios. This option allows portable access to almost all of the satellite channels without needing to purchase a separate electronic device.

,


Display size is important because it determines the number of lines of text your portable satellite radio will be able to display
The inclusion of an FM transmitter in your portable satellite radio is advantageous because it will allow you to receive local stations and will allow you to listen to traditional broadcasts when your satellite reception is obstructed.
A lightweight radio will be easier to transport and carry as you move around.
Chanel preset availability determines the number of channels you can save on your radio. With as many as 180 station options, being able to quickly find the 1 you want to listen to is beneficial. Memory determines the amount of programming you can save, as well as the number of artists or songs you can save and set to play whenever they become available on any station.

Navigate to the virtual server.,

Navigate to the live video.,
Reset security defaults.",How to Watch Security Cameras on the Internet (Port Forward IP Cameras)," In this tutorial we have used D-Link DSL 2750U router with an IP address of 192.168.1.1, as well as two RedLeaf DF-2011 IP cameras with the IP addresses of 192.168.1.20 and 192.168.1.30. Please note that you must have a static IP address at the installation location of the cameras so you can see the streams from the IP cameras.

If you would like to watch more than a few IP cameras, it’s recommended to use your NVR (Network Video Recorder) port settings (i.e. using the web client of your NVR) instead of those of every single IP camera.;
, Enter its IP address in your web browser’s address bar (e.g. 192.168.1.20). The default username/password of RedLeaf IP cameras is admin/admin. If this doesn't work, contact the camera providers to figure out your username and password.

, The browser may prompt you to install an appropriate plug-in to show the live video stream, like Quicktime, which you can download here.

If necessary, minimize the security and privacy levels of the browser to get the required plug-ins or built-in Active-X installed. (e.g. “Phishing and malware protection” or “Pop-up allowed” options may temporarily need change in defaults)

,, In your camera’s web console, click on Setup tab and then Open Network > UPnP menu. In order to manually perform the port forwarding in the modem/router, you may uncheck “Enable” box, and let the “Router State” remain in failure state. Click on Save button to save the changes.

, Open Network > Connection menu. Apart from https port which is optional to use, you need to forward the other four ports respectively in your modem. But before proceeding to the next step (if no NVR server is used) make sure that you have set unique TCP, UDP, HTTP, and RTSP port numbers to each of the IP cameras. Unique port numbers help the modem to properly recognize the proper IP camera for which the requested traffic is deemed to, thus routing would be accomplished correctly.

, In this example we have set the following network settings for Camera #1 and #2.

, Log in to your modem by entering its username and password, then navigate to Advanced Setup > NAT > Virtual Servers. This tab’s name and location may be different in other router brands. In a Linksys modem you may find Single Port Forwarding page in Applications and Gaming tab with a slightly different configuration options., Click on Add to have a new record of virtual server added. User Interface is the external interface connected to your ISP and needs a static IP address already set. Click on Custom Service and choose an appropriate name for the supposed camera (e.g. Readleaf_20). Check Enable Loopback box and enter the IP address of your camera in the Server IP Address Field. Fill in the virtual server table as shown below and save the changes.


The same procedure applies to the second camera, but make sure you apply different Custom service name, Server IP address, External and Internal port numbers.

, Open your browser on a computer connected to the internet that you want to watch the stream from the IP camera, and enter the public IP address (i.e. your static IP address) followed by the http port of your IP camera (e.g. 87.117.243.10:8020). When you are logged in, you should be able to see the video of the camera by clicking on the Live tab.

, After assuring that you can see the video from camera you can revert the security modification applied in Step 5 to its previous values so the security warning will no longer appear."

You can use the Connection and Network Adapter columns to help determine which adapter you're looking at.
Adapters that aren't in use will say Media disconnected in the Transport Name line.

, This is your network adapter's MAC address. It will always be 12 characters split into six groups of two characters each.

, On older versions of Windows, you'll need to write down the MAC address if you want to save it. In Windows 10, you can highlight the MAC address and copy it to your clipboard.

Choose your location.,
Drill out through the exterior wall (or down through the floor if using a crawl space route).,
Route wire to the NI (Network Interface).,
Open the NI with screwdriver or nut driver as required.,
You should have about 6 inches (15.2 cm) of sheath partially removed from your wire (from when you first opened the sheath).,
The first pair is customarily the white/blue.,
Back at the jack location, attach your modular telephone jack to the wall.,
Test for dial tone.,
Does it work now?",How to Wire a Phone Jack," Consider the route the wire will take from the Network Interface on your house to the jack location. Can it run on the outside walls? Can it run through the crawl space? What are the obstructions to consider: chimneys, eaves, doorways, porches, downspouts, etc.;
, You will need a 12"" long, 1/4"" diameter drill bit (or one just slightly larger than the diameter of the phone wire) and power drill. When going from interior to exterior, angle the drill so that water will not follow the cable indoors. Thread wire through the hole from the inside out (hint: phone wire pushes like wet spaghetti. Use your diagonal cutters to cut through the outside sheath, leaving the pairs intact, and gently pull the outer sheath towards the end. This will give you a short empty sheath on the end you can push a heavier wire into to assist threading through the wall.)

, The NI is the point where the home wiring is connected to the Telephone cable. If stapling on the exterior of the house, use round #25 staples about every 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm). If routing under the house, staple every 30 inches (76.2 cm) and thread through openings and going around obstructions where needed.

, Newer NI's have varied attachments: some use the older strip the wire/wrap it and screw down, some you open a little door and insert the wires that aren't stripped into a pair of holes and switch a lever, some you lift a small lever and insert the wires that aren't stripped, then close the lever and the door. There should be instructions on the inside door. If there is no modern NI (the clue is whether you have test jacks or not), loosen the nuts, strip the wire ends and wrap and tighten. HINT: if wrapping bare wire, wrap it in the clockwise direction.

, Pull it all the way off. If you have a pull string use it to expose about 16"" of wire pairs. Trim the ends to make sure you have clean undamaged pairs. The colors of your wire may vary. Old style cable is two (2) pair (red/green and yellow/black). It is designed for voice and modem speed communication and is still installed by many phone companies today. Use of CAT3 or better yet, CAT5 and CAT5e may be a better choice as it is much better at rejecting cross-talk and noise. Regardless of which type chosen, there should be 4 pairs: white/blue, white/orange, white/green, and white/brown.

, Attach the white/blue pair to the posts or slots in the NI.

, The inside of the jack will have short colored wires going from the screws to the pins of the jack, probably red/green and yellow/black. The red/green are attached to the center pins in the plug in part of the jack (line 1 if using a multi-line telephone), the yellow/black go to the outer pair (line 2). Attach the white/blue pair of the wire to the red/green screws.

, If nothing, make sure you've hooked the wires to the correct place in the NI (should be labeled and/or have other wires hooked to it), check to make sure you haven't stapled through the wire, check the butt of the sheath to make sure you haven't partially cut the pairs. Check all connections, re stripping and re-tightening if necessary. All good? Try again and make sure you have a working phone.

, Congratulations! You've saved at least $99 (phone company's jack price) and learned that you're handier than you thought!

It can act as an efficient secretarial service that makes appointments and takes messages. It can be a source of technical assistance. Perhaps you want to help potential customers explore your product line and contact sales personnel. Whatever the case, you cannot proceed until you know what type of call center you are creating.;
, Remember that the call center may take a year or two to prove its worth.

, Make your task easier by finding an existing employee — or hiring a new one — who has experience creating a call center. It will be invaluable to have someone who knows the ropes, what questions to ask and, most importantly, what can go wrong. This person will save money and help you avoid pitfalls, as well as get the call center up and running in a reasonable amount of time and within your budget.

, You may be able to deploy existing employees to the new task of handling calls, which will be an advantage because they are already familiar with your products. Chances are, you will need to do some hiring as well. Call center experience counts, and people who have worked in customer service will be of benefit to you. Determine if you need to use vendors. If your business is cyclic, then hiring vendors for peak periods is a good way to manage work load.

, Adding a call center to your business represents a big change for existing employees. To ensure buy-in and employee satisfaction, sufficient training on the purpose and use of the call center is essential. Different training programs may fill the needs of different employees, such as product experts who provide technical support or experienced sales teams that generate new business. Training should be ongoing as the call center software is updated or your business changes.

, Database, spreadsheet and accounting programs are examples of different types of software that you might need. As you define the call center’s purpose, you can add appropriate software. Most software vendors will help to design the software package that fits your needs.

, You’ll probably need to add new phone lines and the capability to route calls to the appropriate personnel. Your telephone provider can help you determine and implement your infrastructure improvements.

, If your current facility is large enough to house a call center, determine how you can use the space at hand. It is likely that you’ll have to buy additional furnishings and equipment. Possibly, you’ll need to buy or lease additional space.

, Outages can result from natural disasters or technical difficulties, or you may experience unexpectedly heavy call volume. Either way, you must ensure that customers can get through. If your business has national or international offices, they can b

Determine your audience.,
Identify the purpose of your text.,
Begin texts with your conclusion.,
Avoid slang and jargon.,
Proofread your messages.,
Convey tone with emoticons where appropriate.",How to Write Clearly in Texts and Messages1," Audience refers to the person or people who will be receiving your text. With friends and family, you can be a lot more casual with your language and friendly with your expressions. With an acquaintance or coworker, you’ll likely want to be more formal and polite., Knowing the purpose of your text will help you stay on topic and cut to the chase. This doesn’t mean that you have to only stick to the point, but the topic of your text should make up the body of it.When writing a text, for each part of it ask yourself, “Is this really important? Does this matter for my topic?” If the answer is no to either of these questions, you can likely delete the section in question.
Texts to friends and family might sound cold if you only stick to the topic. You might want start out with a pleasantry, like, “Long time no see,” or “How’ve you been lately?” After that, you can move on to your topic.

, With longer messages, the main point of your text can sometimes get lost. In some cases, the recipient might get distracted halfway through reading and only skim the rest. To prevent the purpose of your text from getting lost, start with your conclusion or the reason for the message.For example, if you’re writing to set up a hang-out session, start with that and add details after, as in, “Hey John, want to hang out? I’m meeting Joe and Deborah at 4PM at the arcade.”
Another example of starting with the conclusion first might look something like, “Mary can’t come camping. She has a doctor’s appointment and a big test coming up. She’s pretty disappointed.”

, In some cases, like when talking to your peers, slang can be a helpful way of communicating your feelings and making the text sound more conversational. However, sometimes the recipient might not understand these expressions. When trying to be clear, leave slang and jargon out of your texts.Jargon is a fancy word for special language used in a profession or social group. For example, online gamers often use the jargon terms: noob, gank, afk, bbl, ftw, and more.

, You don’t have to crawl word by word through your text, puzzling over commas and the such. A quick glance through your message should be enough in most cases for you to pick up on errors or unclear spots. Correct these when you find them.If you find yourself going back and forth over whether a particular part of a text is correct, that’s usually a good sign that it could be improved, even if it’s not technically grammatically wrong.

, Emoticons are a way of communicating something graphically. These include things like emotions, activities, and more. By adding a smiley face or a frowny face, you can add an emotional aspect to your text to better convey your feelings. In most cases, emoticons are not considered appropriate for formal or business texts. Some examples of emoticons follow.


Smiley faces: :-) , :) , ^_^ , :]
Laughing/big grin: :-D , :D, =D
Crying smiley: :’( , T_T , :*(
Irritated/angry: >:[ , >_< , >:(
Listening to music: d-_-b"

Consider your relationship to the message recipient.,
Determine the point of your message.,
Write a relevant subject heading, when necessary.,
Personalize your message.,
Check for spelling and grammar errors.",How to Write Clearly in Texts and Messages2," With close friends and family, you’re likely going to want to take a more conversational tone with the message. In business, however, it’s generally expected that you will communicate the point of your message without wasting time on pleasantries.Even with friends and family, if you want a message to be as clear as possible, consider dropping pleasantries like “how are you,” and get straight to the point instead.

, Just like when writing a text, knowing the point of your email message will help you stay focused on it. Popular message topics include: making plans, clarifying business matters, asking questions, and so on. Keep yourself on track with your message by looking at each part of the message and asking:”Is this part of the message necessary to communicate my topic?” If not, you should delete the unnecessary part.
”Would the meaning of my message be changed if I deleted this part?” If not, go ahead and delete it.

, Subject headings can be tricky. The key here is to convey your topic. Your subject heading doesn’t have to be artful, like the title of a book. It could be something as simple as:Quick question
Status update on project
RE job opportunity
Birthday party

, Messages that sound too clinical can also make them sound distant. This can make it seem like your message doesn’t actually pertain to the recipient. To prevent this, use inclusive language, like the pronouns “you” and “I.”


For example, instead of saying ""Clients should arrive 15 minutes early with all their paperwork"" you could say, ""You should arrive 15 minutes early with your paperwork.""
Another example, instead of ""ABC Corp does not refund customers' items after 30 days"" you could say ""We cannot refund your items after 30 days."", Generally, you should be able to glance through an email and pick out most spelling and grammar errors. With business emails, you may want to spend an extra minute or two double checking everything.Oftentimes in business situations, correct spelling and grammar are interpreted as more professional.
Many email services offer a spellchecker. Especially if you're not confident in your spelling ability, this is a quick and easy way you can proofread your emails

"
"
Use simple sentence structure.,
Write in the active voice.,
Select strong verbs.,
Read frequently.",How to Write Clearly in Texts and Messages3," Short sentences are easier to follow. Long sentences, even if grammatical, can lead to confusion. Further simplify your sentence structure by using a Person – Action – Subject structure. If you’re giving instructions, you can often leave out the person and use an Action – Subject structure. For example


”Tom won the game.” (P – A – S)
”Alex is watching TV.” (P – A – S)
”Refresh the webpage.” (A – S), Active voice puts the doer of an action close to the action being done. Passive voice, the opposite of active voice, separates doer from that which is done. This can make writing difficult to follow. Always use active voice where possible to improve the clarity of your writing.Passive: The game was played at the party by my friends.
Active: My friends played the game at the party.
Passive: The boy was attacked by the vicious kitten.
Active: The vicious kitten attacked the boy.

, One of the most frequently used weak verbs is “to be” and its conjugations (am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been). In many cases, you can choose an active verb that is more descriptive and clearer. Examples follow:Weak verb: One way to write clearer is to use strong verbs.
Strong verb: Use strong verbs to clarify your writing.
""The writer makes an oversimplification on how hard it is to use strong verbs"" would be stronger as ""The writer oversimplifies the difficulty of using strong verbs.""

, The more you read, the more you'll be exposed to new words, ideas, grammar, and so on. This will naturally improve your writing ability.Even reading your favorite fiction novel will improve your ability to make connections, which will have a positive effect on your writing ability.If you don't have time or the interest to read a full length book, you might subscribe to a magazine, newspaper, or online version of one of these.
Even reading a few pages per day will help improve your writing skills. Don't feel like you have to finish a book in a time limit. Every little bit will help.

Check if the number is from a payphone.,
Use reverse phone directories.,
Activate call tracing with your service provider for blocked numbers.,
Hire a private eye.",How to Trace the Owner of a Phone Number," One of the quickest ways to trace the origin of a number is to do a web search. If the number is publicly listed, there’s a good chance it will show up in your search results. At the very least, you should be able to determine the approximate location.;
, This will give you the phone number of the last call you received, provided it wasn’t private or being blocked. If the number is blocked or set to private, there is very little chance that you will be able to determine the number or where it was coming from.

, These are databases of publicly-available information on businesses and individuals with public numbers. Many allow you to do “Reverse Phone” look-ups that will provide you more information about the phone number, such as where it is located and what service it is on.

, There are several resources available online that list payphone numbers and their locations. Many of these directories are community-run and updated, meaning that they may not always be 100% accurate. Two of the more popular sites are:


Payphone Project
McPayphone

, There are a variety of phone directories online, both free and paid. Many offer to provide you with phone information for a monthly fee by collating large amounts of publicly available data. You may be able to find this information yourself, but it may take quite a bit of digging.

, Most service providers offer a tracing service for harassment situations. You may need to pay a fee in order to use this service, and it won’t actually provide you with the phone number or any other information. Instead, it is sent to law enforcement for investigation.


After activating the service, dial *57 after receiving a call you want to trace. The phone company will make a record of that number and forward it law enforcement.
Make sure to note the time and date of each harassing call, and try to take notes about what the caller sounds like as well as a rough transcript. This will all aid in the investigation.

, The last and final option is to pay a professional private investigator to research the number and determine the subscriber name and address. This is of course a method of last resort, and should only be explored once you've determined that no public information is available through every other possible resource.

First of all, you need to determine which type of call recording you require.,
As setup will be technical, once you have decided on which service you need, it’s best to get in touch with a professional telecoms company who can provide and set up call recording for your business.

Diagnose if you need a new belt.,
Purchase the correct belt for your turntable.,
Disconnect the power from the turntable.,
Remove the plastic mat.,
Remove the platter.,
Turn the platter upside down on a flat surface.,
Stretch the belt over the center hub of the platter.,
Stretch the belt onto the small peg or post if your platter does not have access holes.,
Flip the platter over and put it back on the turntable.,
Turn the platter so that the access holes expose the motor.,
Grab the belt and hook it around the motor.,
Test the belt by spinning the turntable in both directions.,
Troubleshoot any problems by repeating the process.",How to Replace a Record Player Belt," The biggest indicator that you need a new belt is when the record player turns on, but the turntable doesn't spin. That said, there are other indicators as well:


Your records sound lower-pitched, or deeper.
You notice a change in speed, especially when the needle hits the record.

You've downloaded and used a ""strobe disc,"" which checks the running speed of your record player to make sure it runs well.;
, Not all belts are created equally, as the width, length, and even thickness of a belt will make a difference in how your records play. Whenever possible, get the same belt your turntable started with by searching online for ""Replacement Belt."" There is a variety of sites that offer specific belts, such as Needle Doctors or Turntable Belts, and all you have to do is click your make and model. If you cannot get a perfect replacement:


Measure the old belt's length, subtracting 5-10mm for the amount it has stretched.
Measure the belt's width.
If you don't have the old belt, pull off the platter and measure the circumference of the hub (open cylinder on the underside, the belt wraps around this) with a tape measure. Subtract 5-10mm -- this is the suggested length of your new belt., This will prevent any potential electrical shocks, though they should be rare. Still, it is for the safety of you and the motor.

, This is the surface that the record sits on. It should be easily removed from the center shaft. Just pull it off and set it aside., The platter is a metal or plastic circle underneath the mat. It usually has two ""access ports,"" small holes that let you see the motor through the platter. It may be attached to the center shaft in a variety of ways, but they are all easy to remove:


If there is a small, C-shaped clip attached to the center shaft, use a flat-head screwdriver to pry it off. Save it for later.
If there is no clip, but the platter resists removal, it is likely ""press-fit."" As you pull it up, use a hammer to lightly tap on the center shaft to remove the platter., This is also a good time to clean the motor if you haven't in a long time or it looks dusty. Simply use a lint-free rag and some rubbing alcohol to wipe down the exposed parts and remove and dust or dirt.

, It should fit snugly onto the circle. Some pointers, to make sure things are correctly attached:


Make sure the belt is straight.
Put it in the center of the circle as much as possible.
Make sure it is not twisted or kinked.
If there is a ribbon on the belt, line it up with one of the access holes in the platter. This makes it easier to pull the belt onto the motor., If the platter is one solid piece you will need to find the small little peg near the edge of the platter. With the belt on the center circle, stretch the belt onto this post so that the whole belt looks like a round-bottomed triangle. If your platter has access holes, ignore this step., Return the platter to the turntable, but do not replace the C-clip yet.

, The motor is a small metal shaft coming up from a corner of the turntable. The belt hooks to it, which turns the turntable while the motor is turning. Line up one of the access holes on the platter so you could reach in and touch the motor.If your platter does not have access ports, align the post on the bottom of the platter with the motor spindle. Place the platter down, then spin it two full rotations clockwise and two counter-clockwise to hook the belt up to the motor., Pull the belt through the access hole and stretch it over the motor spindle. There should be a little cap on the top that prevents the belt from slipping off, so be sure to pull the belt over this and rest it on the body of the motor.

, You should see consistent, light resistance. The platter won't spin forever, but it is also not jerking or stopping instantly. If it is, check the belt for kinks or twists and reattach it. If if is smooth, replace the c-clip and mat and plug the player in. Hit start and watch it spin.

, The most common issue is that the belt is not attached to the motor correctly. Make sure it is beneath the small cap on the top. Another issue is a belt that is too tight or loose. If you cannot spin the platter by hand than it is too tight. If it doesn't spin with the motor on, the problem is it is too loose.

Understand your traffic patterns and what you spend better than they do.,
Package your services into something that you can explain to the carrier market in their terms.,
Identify the minimum level of service that is required to meet the needs of your organization.,
Identify the carriers that provide service in the locations where you originate a need for service.,
Invite every carrier to compete for your business that has even the slightest chance of winning your business.,
Set the pace.,
Measure everything and report your margin of success to your executives to they can understand your performance.

",How to Reduce Your Telecom Costs," Many people rely on their carrier to tell them what to do. This is ill-advised and reflects laziness on the part of the person making the determination. Given the choice, a telecom carrier will always sell you a gold plated Mercedes, whether you need it or not, on a 50 year lease, which only increases in cost every year, that you can never get rid of, even after the wheels have long fallen off. Don't fall for this trap. You make the rules. It's your money!;
, Measure service by origination, type, distance, and per unit expense. Roll it all up from perfect granularity to absolute 100,000 foot (30,480.0 m) level.

, This doesn't mean cheap, it means that the combination of services you buy should exactly meet your needs, being neither greater than, or less than your needs. You don't need to pay for widgets you can't use, and you don't want your users to go without services which are critical to the success of your business.

, For instance, it doesn't matter if XYZ carrier has nationwide service to major cities, if your main city is not on their list. Get market comps from reliable sources. The carriers may be telling you the best rate is a nickel, while other may be paying a penny, and they will never enlighten you beyond that which they need to. Other top performing end users probably have the best rate information, which you can informally exchange. Be sure not to just look at the leading rates that are generally followed, but look at the entire list of services. Recognize that the largest companies with the highest volume do not necessarily pay the best rates. They often suffer from ossified contracts that have been carried forward after far too many ""good guy deals"" have been cut. Carriers will always be quick to cite others who are paying more money than you are. Don't worry, they only cite the higher ones, keeping the ones getting a good deal private.

, Even if its just a single circuit. The more the better. Don't invite carriers who you wouldn't seriously consider giving business to, which is called using ""stalking horses."" If you do this, the market won't respect you. Don't give any one carrier any advantage that every other carrier is not getting. Make it fair. Use a level playing field. Make everyone compete using the same information, released at the same time, and under the same rules. Don't give anyone more time than you could perform within. Open the information from all of the carriers in private, sharing it with the minimum number of internal people required to do the work. The more people that know of your internal influences, the more they will share it with the market, and not to your benefit.

, Your incumbent carrier will use excuse after excuse to slow down the process. Why should they help you speed the process which will only result in their having to write down part of the fat profits they are making on your business? This is not a time to get nostalgic. Set your terms, your timing, and award to the carriers who earn your business. Not in the past. In the present. Once you have tentatively identified a carrier, make sure to come up with a list of 2 or 3 others that can also suffice. Never tell any carrier what the outcome is until you have your contracts signed. It's a very small vendor community, and your information will be shared (again to your detriment) if you disclose it before the deal is done.

Be sure you're staying legal.,
Be aware of potential complications.",How to Record a Phone Conversation1," The United States federal government places no restrictions on private citizens recording their phone conversations, but many states require consent from all involved parties. Without such consent, your records will be legally useless in those states, and could even get you in trouble.


There are 11 states that require consent from all parties: California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Washington. In addition, the state of Hawaii requires full consent any time a recording is made inside a private residence.
If you're planning to tap a phone line instead, there are federal laws you must abide by in addition to state laws. Tapping a phone is the act of recording a conversation without the knowledge of either party. It is generally illegal except in certain law enforcement situations.;
, Recording your phone calls can be very useful, but it can also have unexpected consequences. Arm yourself with knowledge and play it safe.


You may get into a state jurisdiction snafu if you record a conversation without two-party consent, and it turns out that the other conversant lived in a state where two-party consent is mandatory. Even though you aren't breaking the law in this case, your phone records might be thrown out of evidence.
Your friends and family may be upset with you if you begin to record all your calls and they find out. It's better to speak to those close to you before you start, and respect whatever boundaries they set with you.
Depending on how above board your own calls are, there could be trouble if your records fall into somebody else's hands. Be sure you're living on the straight and narrow with regards to your love life, your finances, and any illicit activities you might be tempted to discuss over the phone.

Record with an induction coil microphone.,
Attach a recording device.,
Place the microphone.,
Record your conversation.",How to Record a Phone Conversation2," These microphones are available at electronic and phone stores, and typically come mounted in suction cups to allow easy attachment to the handset.

, Plug the microphone's audio output jack into a computer, tape recorder, or other such device. A tape recorder or digital portable recorder has the advantage of being relatively small and portable, but a computer has advantages when it comes to cataloging and organizing your conversations.


A good basic audio editing program for your computer is Audacity. Audacity is free, simple, and useful for things like clipping dead space off the ends of conversations. It can also export the conversation files in a variety of formats for easy storage. Audacity can be downloaded here.

, Secure the microphone to the handset near the receiver (the end you speak into). Test the microphone by speaking into the receiver and playing back the audio record on your input device.


If you're worried the microphone's suction cup won't hold, secure the microphone with tape to ensure that your recording won't be interrupted.

, Turn on the induction coil microphone when you pick up the handset. Turn it off and stop recording when you're finished.

, Plug your telephone line into the appropriate jack on your inline recorder, then plug the recorder's outgoing phone line into your wall jack as though it was a normal phone line.


Find the recorder's audio output cable, and plug it into your audio recording device of choice. Some inline recorders come with a recording device integrated into the unit. If you'd prefer to save a step, buy one of these models. More basic models let you decide what type of audio recorder to use, which may make them more useful for some people.

, Do it just as the conversation begins, and don't forget to start recording if using a separate audio recorder.


Some devices come with a “remote input” feature. These devices will begin to record automatically when there's a call, saving you the trouble.

Use a software program to record your conversations.,
Tap the “Install” or “Purchase” button to download and install the app.,
Follow the app's instructions to record your calls.",How to Record a Phone Conversation5," If you are using a smartphone, there are programs that let you record effortlessly whenever you have a phone conversation. Although not everyone with a cell phone is using a smartphone, this is by far the easiest option for those who can do it.


Browse the app store for your phone's operating system. Search for call recorders. Most of them are free or very cheap.
Double check what you're getting. Read over the developer's description for the app to be sure it's what you want. Most call recorders only work with certain phones or brands; some only work with the speakerphone on. Find one that suits you.

, Make sure the app is properly working by doing a test phone-call with a friend.

, If the app seems to work, but your recording quality is low, snoop around on the Internet for solutions. There are often workarounds for such things.

They do not inform your caller that the call is being recorded.",How to Record a Phone Conversation6," Several cloud based web portals facilitate recording of phone conversations without the additional hassle of installing any software or purchasing hardware.

, The service calls both the source and destination numbers, bridges them, and records the call. The service is tightly integrated into a telephony infrastructure which resides in the cloud. This allows providers to store recordings in the cloud and make them available to subscribers through personal portals.

, Some of such services are www.recordator.com, www.saveyourcall.com etc and a list of such services can be found at this Wikipedia article, All your call recordings are made available by the providers in your personal dashboard and you can download them as well.

, At first, you need to create your personal profile on their website and purchase calling minutes according to their pricing plans. Average call + recording pricing varies from 10-25 cents per minute depending on which plan you choose.

, You need to take care of the legal angle. So if your location requires two party consent, the onus in on you to inform your caller that the call is being recorded.

Verify your customers' contact details.,
Send customer reminders before the due repayment date.,
Send a text message after your customer has missed the first repayment date.",How to Reduce Default Rates Using Text Messages," The level of fraud in the UK is growing and short-term loan providers are one of the easiest targets for fraudsters. To avoid fraudulent activity in your business, make sure you verify each customer who signs up on your website is a genuine customer in search of a loan.


When customer signs up on your website, make sure that you have all the correct contact details that are unique and belong to the specific customer who is applying for a loan. This includes all contact details, including a home telephone number and mobile number. Some companies even ask for a work number that the applicant can be contacted on during normal working hours.
When the customer has signed up, you can offer the option to activate an account by sending a text message to your customer’s mobile. The text message should include a unique code that the customer needs to enter on your website to confirm that the mobile number provided belongs to the applicant and is an active number.
By verifying your customers mobile number you make the first step towards reducing your default rate and preventing fraudsters from signing up on your website.;
, It is very important to remind your customers notification of the repayment date of the loan before the actual due date elapses. It shows that you are a responsible lender and you do not want your customers incur penalty charges for late payments. It will also reduce the possibility of the customer inadvertently defaulting through being ignorant of the due date, or simply forgetting.


Your customer might not remember the exact repayment date of the loan, especially if it was an installment loan with multiple payments, or a loan spread out over a longer period of time. Sending a reminder email is one option, but it is worth bearing in mind that only 22% of emails are actually opened and read, compared to the 98% of text messages that are seen.
There is also the risk that your emails might go directly to your customer’s spam folder, which reduces the possibility of them opening the email even more. So, send your customer a polite reminder by text message, just to let them know that the repayment date of the loan is approaching. It might be a little bit more expensive than a free email, but a defaulted loan will definitely cost you much more.

, If you have not received the payment from your customer on the due date, contact your customer immediately. Send them a text message to make sure they are aware of the outstanding debt, but make sure that you follow the Debt Collection guidelines by OFT when pursuing your debts.


In practice sending a text message to customer’s mobile works a lot better than email and the response rate is at least 70% higher compared to email. Make sure you put your contact number and company name into the message, so that customers can call you when they need to discuss the payment.
Remember that with a text message, space is limited to just 160 characters. So ensure that your message is succinct and contains only the most important information. You can also use your company name as the Sender ID instead of the number to make sure your customer knows that the message is from you.

Use a suitable, quality means for recording the interview.,
Check the batteries.,
Try to hold the interview in a quiet environment.,
Be close to the interviewee.,
Avoid holding the recorder.,
Ensure that the person being interviewed is aware of the fact.,
Do a short test with the interviewee, to check it's working.,
Begin asking questions.",How to Record an Interview Ready for Transcription," This could be a digital recorder, Smartphone or tablet. Whatever you use, check in advance that it records the sound well and does not increase background interference noise or muffle the sound.;
, Always use new batteries when performing an interview, or charge the recorder beforehand. It's also a good idea to bring along some spare batteries, just in case.

, Ideally, hold it in a small room, as large rooms or halls can make the audio less clear and can mar the recording by picking up echoes and background noise.


Avoid doing an interview in bars, restaurants, outside in the street and other noisy environments; the background noise is a typist's worst nightmare and can lead to a less accurate transcript.
If you do have to record the interview in a noisy environment, try to place the recorder as close as possible to the voices that you want to record but avoid distortion. However, don't get too close!

, Where possible, sit opposite your interviewee with a table between you and place the recorder, placing it equidistant from you both.


Although most recorders use omni-directional microphones (meaning that they pick up sound from all directions), you'll notice microphone holes in the recorder so try and point them at both participants.
If you think that one of you has a quieter voice, then place the recorder slightly closer to that person.

, If you do have to hold the recorder, keep as still as possible. If possible do not conceal the recorder in a pocket or a bag either. Both holding and concealing the recorder can severely reduce the audio quality to the point where it could be useless for transcription purposes.


Distorted audio is impossible to rectify, making it useless for transcription purposes.

, This is often part of the appropriate process for interviews if performing them for research or work purposes. In any case, it is polite and in many cases, it is legally required.

, Have a quick listen to check whether the recording device is working correctly and to check the audio quality.

, Listen avidly and avoid interrupting them.

When global or multinational regions are involved, include members from each.;
, Resistance to change is normal and should always be anticipated. Manage user expectations by using education and frequent communication to mitigate mystery and uncertainty.

, Understanding your organization's culture is critical to successfully implementing new technology on a large scale. Consider questions such as:


•Does your company encourage risk taking?
•What have previous technology deployments taught you about how users prefer to be trained?

,, Develop surveys and focus groups to identify user-preferred services and features. Use the survey as a tool to identify critical communications features, validate key business needs, gauge risk tolerance and user discomfort, and identify key functionalities that are paramount to your business.

, Your implementation strategy should allow you to progressively move faster as your experience levels become more efficient. The number of employees, complexity of user requirements, size of the organization, and how widely all are dispersed affect your migration strategy. Develop a strategy that accounts for all the variables that could change or affect implementation of the network.

, Success depends on several considerations, most important among them is planning. In fact, implementations usually consist of 80% preparation and 20% installation. Quite simply, if you focus on your plan first, the implementation will be much smoother.

, A successful Day 2 handoff (defined as the time period immediately following cutover of your new IP telephony solution) requires a well developed support plan, with four elements:


•Team: people who can resolve the entire spectrum of issues
•Processes: use the ones you already have in place rather than creating new ones
•Services: internal and external teams, management tools, and global coverage
•Tools: network monitoring tools to resolve problems before they become visible to users

, Most large enterprises have hundreds of lines and circuits that, through the years, have either been forgotten about or are simply unused. View your IP telephony implementation as an opportunity to start anew, as well as clean and prepare the IP infrastructure. So, when the implementation team begins the conversion, remove as many unused lines off the PBX as possible, and only convert those lines that are actually in use.

, The team member responsible for the retrofit cleanup should enter all PBX leases into a spreadsheet and develop a project plan to keep the returns on track.

, Whether an IP telephony implementation involves 200 phones or 20,000 phones, change management will be the most challenging ongoing process to maintain, but not because of routine changes or software upgrades. Maintaining a strict, yet manageable and scalable, process will be critical to your success, so eliminate as many unknowns as possible by documenting your procedures and capturing lessons learned.

Watch your minutes to avoid huge phone bills.
Depending on your plan, if you are really low on credit, you can ask your friends to phone you. Not all cell phone plans work this way, but some only charge you for minutes if you make the call, not if you receive it.

, Some cell phones come with music already on them, and others allow you to add your own music files. Why not use the WiFi free time to listen to some great tunes?


Wear headphones - you don't want the people around you singing along do you.
If you haven't got headphones make the volume quiet.

It's also a good idea to take several high quality selfies and turn them into a collage later on.

, Another way of entertaining yourself without WiFi is to take pictures of your surroundings. If clever enough, you could also Photoshop yourself into it later on and share with your friends.

, Very often, cell phones have some games that have been downloaded beforehand that don't use WiFi. You could try some of them out and see what you think of them.


Turn background data off as some games will use data and therefore, use your credit/increase your bill.

Make the message short and to the point, while still being sociable.

, You should also use your professional social media pages to network with others. Follow potential clients or employers on social media. Comment on their posts and “like” them. Do this consistently so they are aware of your social media presence.You can also post content that you think will attract the attention of your social media followers, which can then help you connect and network. For example, you may post content about copy editing for corporate briefs on Facebook as a way to gain the attention of potential corporate employers.

, To be an effective networker online, you need to have an online presence that is constant and active. Update your social media pages on a daily basis or several times a day. Make sure your profiles on networking sites are current. Post new content regularly to any professional blogs or social media pages you have.


Having a constant and active online presence will also ensure that you are made aware of job opportunities or potential clients right away, especially if you are part of a good networking community. This can allow you to take your career to the next level and network better as a telecommuter.

, When you are attending networking events in person, make sure you always introduce yourself to others at the event with confidence. Maintain eye contact and open body language, with your arms relaxed at your sides and your chin up. Turn your body towards the person you are addressing and smile to engage them in conversation.


Use a firm handshake when meeting someone and say something pleasant like, ""Hello my name is . Nice to meet you,"" or ""Hi there, I'm a small business owner in the area. Nice to meet you.""

, These ports can frequently be found on USB extension cords.

, Strip the wires Find the black (-) and red (+) wires. Make sure these are separate from the green and white data wires.

, Be careful not to add too much as it may not fit in the Altoids tin. About 9 inches (22.9 cm) branching off of the female USB should suffice.

, For now, they do not need to be charged. (Hint: rechargeable AAA batteries can cheaply be bought on eBay or similar auction site. These batteries are rated by the amount of power they can store not the power that they output. The units used are milli-Amp hours (mAh), which can be explained as the current (in milli-Amps) needed to fully discharge the battery in an hour. A 1000 mAh battery will last twice as long on one charge as a 500 mAh battery. AAA battery holders can cheaply be bought from Radio Shack, make sure it will fit in the Altoids tin--this usually means to buy the thinner square looking one--see picture in Things You'll Need.)

, Remember red to red and black to black. Soldering is usually the way to go. Other methods are twisting the wires together, but this is unreliable. Remember to cover the exposed connected wire in insulated material (like PVC or electrical tape) to avoid letting the positive and negative wires touch.

, If using a Dremel, beware of sparks that can ignite flammable materials. Make sure it is one of the shorter sides--not the sides above or below the text--to the left or right only.

, Make the ON/OFF switch (if your battery holder has one) to the battery holder is up so that when you open the tin you see it the female USB port not stick out of the USB port, but have it line up so it doesn't stick out.

, You can also put double sided tape or hot glue on the battery holder so it doesn't move.

, Your charger is now complete. If your batteries are uncharged, follow the last step to charge.

, Cut the ends off 2 USB cables, leaving as much wire possible after the USB connector. Strip the wire exposing the colored wires. You may cut the white and green wires. Strip the red and black wires. Connect the wires together (red to red and black to black) by soldering or wire twisting (unreliable.) Cover the individual wire connections together with electrical tape, having 2 separate pieces (cover the black to black separately and red to red separately.) Then after the reds and the blacks are separately covered in tape, you can cover these connections with electrical tape so you are left with a single wire.

Gather your materials.,
Open the clip-on ferrite and remove one of the iron cores.,
Wrap your solenoid wire around your core 100 times lengthwise.,
Replace the core with the coils into the ferrite housing.,
Push both wires through a length of shrink wrap, moving the wrap off to the side to insulate after soldering.,
Solder the two 1/8"" wires from the jack plug to the ends of your wound wire.,
Move your shrink wrap sheath so that it covers the solder joint.Cause your shrink wrap to affix closely where you have wrapped it by using a heat source.,
Unplug your phone and the cable running to it.,
Open the ferrite and place the red or green wire inside.,
Plug the jack from the phone tap into an amplifier.,
Listen to the conversation aloud on your amplifier.",How to Make a Phone Tap," To ensure that you don't have to interrupt construction of your inductive tap, collect the necessary materials first and prepare your work space. Set up a sufficiently comfortable soldering station that is flat and at an appropriate height. Your target line for you inductive tap should be a standard land line, also known as a POTS telephone. For the construction of your tap, you will also need:


Enameled copper wire (solenoid wire is ideal)
Clip-on ferrite
Denatured alcohol
Wire cutters
Shrink wrap wire casing or electrical tape
Soldering iron
Solder;
, Your clip-on ferrite should be comprised of an outer case that houses a magnetic core made of iron oxide and other metals. It is typically dark in color and is often used in electric transformers and inductors where components like your solenoid wire are wound around the inner core.


Clip-on ferrite is usually shaped so that there is a circular hole through the middle where a cord can pass, and can be opened the side opposite from where the two halves hinge.
Your core may be circular in shape or rectangular, but it is important you position your clip-on ferrite so that one side is open, much like a book. Without opening the ferrite, it will be difficult to wrap your solenoid wire around the core to make your inductive tap.

, Leave yourself a few inches to spare at each end of the wire. These will be used to connect your jack plug.

, Now you can use fine sandpaper or some other mild abrasive to remove the enamel coating on the last inch of your wire tips.


Exercise care when removing the enamel coating. It's easy to nick a wire, but doing so will ruin your inductive tap.

, This will protect your inductive tap against damage and you from shocks from open wires.Remember to leave enough poking out of the end so you can connect the jack plug.


In place of shrink wrap, you can also use electrical tape to insulate your wires.

, Do this by soldering the ends of your miniature phone plug cable to your wire ends. Do not overheat your wire or else it will become brittle and potentially snap off.


The best soldering joint requires you to prepare the surface by cleaning the area you will solder with denatured alcohol., This will cause your shrink the wrap to shrivel so that it is drawn tight.


If using a lighter, hold your flame at a distance of about an inch and a half from the shrink wrap.
If you have insulated with electrical tape, this step should be skipped.

, For your inductive tap to work, you will need a POTS telephone (a standard landline telephone). Remove the plastic casing but be careful not to cut through the wires inside. This will cause your telephone to break, and your inductive tap to not work.

, Either of these two wires, which make up the phone line pair, will suffice. You should be careful to avoid the yellow wire. Placing this inside your ferrite will prevent your tap from receiving signal.

, A 3.5mm audio extension cable may be needed if there is considerable distance between the tap and the amplifier.

, When the telephone is in use, the signal should be transferred to the amplifier through the induction of your phone's electrical signals.Stand back and admire your handiwork as everyone around you calls you a genius.

If the mobile phone has sat idle for a long time, it may need special moisture treatment. In humid areas, the internal moisture of the mobile phone could cause harm to the parts. When using your mobile phone has been idle for a reasonable amount of time, it will have attained a certain internal temperature. This can cause the accumulated water to evaporate at ordinary times. To avoid harm to the body, don't touch the antenna.





;
,,






Keep your mobile phone dry. Rain, moisture, and liquids all contain minerals that can corrode sensitive electronic circuit boards.






Do not use or store your mobile phone in dusty or dirty places, as this could undermine its circuitry or essential components






Do not store your phone where it could overheat. High temperatures can shorten the life of electronic devices by damaging batteries or melting some of the plastic parts, causing deformation. Also, when the temperature rises high enough, the moisture will form inside of your phone, and this can damage electronic circuit boards.







, This can cause damage and can be dangerous if you do not know much about phones and how they work.

, Rough handling can break internal circuit boards, or the screen.

, Use a soft cloth, preferably a slightly damp one.

, If the phone or any of its parts are not working, take it to the nearest qualified maintenance facility., Prevention is better than cure. If you always wait for accidents to happen, it may be too late. If you know some daily maintenance methods, they will be very beneficial to your phone.


Use a mobile phone holster. They can reduce the amount of wear done to the phone. Secondly, they can also reduce the harm to the phone when it gets wet.






Of course, this does not mean the holster is flame-resistant after you use it. Be cautious to avoid damaging it.

, For example, if your mobile phone has a crack or a hole, rainwater could easily get in it and cause internal damage such as erosion of the circuit board.


Don't use mobile phones in the rain or the bathroom.






Don't put your mobile phone in the cold air outlet, because condensation in the mobile phone will invisibly corrode the circuit board. The longer this goes on, the more severe the water erosion of the circuit board is. You may not notice anything initially, but if you keep going on, the phone could stop working.
Pay attention to how you carry it. Everyone has different ways to carry mobile phones, but some methods can increase the chance of damage. For example, carrying a phone in the back pocket of your jeans can cause it to fall out when you walk or be damaged if you accidentally sit on it. Also, when people keep slim phones in their breast pocket, these can fall out easily if they bend over.







, The phone's speakers contain small magnets. If a magnet becomes attracted to the speakers, it could block the sound, meaning it's more difficult to hear.

, It’s likely that at some point the mobile phone will come into contact with water, for example by rain or having drinks spilled on it. If this happens:

Turn off the power immediately and then remove the battery to avoid water corroding circuit boards. Water is an enemy of your phone - after coming into contact with it, your phone should be sent for repair as soon as possible.






Do NOT use a hair dryer to dry the cell phone's internal moisture. This may cause more harm than good. Instead, place it in a bag of uncooked rice for a day.

, Many users have experienced this situation and there are several possible reasons for it:


The power source you have plugged it into is too high and so the fuse has blown. This can be sent to a repair shop and fixed.
The battery itself is aging. This can also be sent to a repair shop and fixed,or may need replacing.






The battery has come into contact with pieces of metal with dirt, causing poor power contact and stopping it from charging. The problem is caused by oxidation of the contact terminals and as long as you use a glue stick to wipe clean, the situation will be improved.
The battery is too loose. You can put paper between the battery and the mobile phone to stop it being too loose. Do not put paper between the terminals of the battery and the phone.

, If not, call your mobile phone provider and get them to lock the phone so it can't be used for illegal activities.

, Do this periodically,once a week if possible.

Call the contact who you suspect blocked you.,
Listen to the way the call ends.,
Call your contact again to confirm.,
Call your contact back with a masked number.,
Ask a friend to call your contact's number.",How to Know if Your Number Was Blocked1," You usually won't be able to tell whether or not a contact has blocked you by sending a text message, so you'll need to call them., If the call ends after one ring (or, in some cases, half of a ring) and you are diverted to voicemail, you are either blocked or your contact's phone is dead.Depending on your contact's carrier, you might hear a message telling you that the contact can't be reached. This generally applies to AT&T and Sprint, and it means you have been blocked.Of course, if the contact answers your call, you haven't been blocked.

, Sometimes a call will divert to voicemail even if the line is clear and your phone unblocked; calling again will confirm the call's ending.


If your call still ends after a ring or less and diverts to voicemail, your contact's phone is definitively dead or blocking your calls.

, You can do this by typing ""*67"" before their phone number. While you can't feasibly expect anyone to pick up a call from a restricted number, calling in this way will verify the contact's phone status:


If the call goes through like usual--e.g., five or more rings--then your contact has blocked your number.
If the call still stops after a ring or less and diverts to voicemail, your contact's phone is dead.

, If you've determined that you're blocked but would like verbal confirmation, you can ask a friend to call your contact and talk to them about the situation. Keep in mind that, as tempting as this may be, doing so might harm your friend's relationship with the contact who blocked you.

Attempt to get in touch via social media.",How to Know if Your Number Was Blocked2," If you were blocked in error, then the person probably won't be unhappy to hear from you. But it could be considered harassment for you to attempt to work around a block that somebody enacted to put distance between you and them. Be wary of the legality of disregarding a block in your region before proceeding.

, You can do this by typing ""*67"" before the phone number you're trying to call; this will result in your call showing up as an unidentified number.


Most people won't pick up if they see a ""Restricted"" or ""Unknown"" number calling them; this is because telemarketers often use this tactic to reach numbers on the do-not-call list.

, If, for example, you and your contact both use Facebook, you can use Messenger to try to reach out to them. The same concept applies to WhatsApp, Viber, Skype, or any other IMing services you share.

, Though your contact won't receive a notification of your call or your voicemail, it will still end up on their phone. You can use this loophole to communicate important information to them if need be., If you absolutely have to get into contact with someone who has blocked you, you can email them or message them from various social media accounts. Again, consider your urgency here: if you're simply upset because they blocked you, it's best to leave the situation alone until both you and your contact have cooled off a bit.

Be sure that your friend really has a drug problem.,
Please keep in mind that these are guidelines.,
Prepare a strategic plan of action.,
Write down how you want to help your friend.,
Approach your friend with a nonjudgmental voice.,
State your commitment to your friend.,
Be the example.,
Do not enable your friend.,
Get the help of capable people.,
Gather a variety of possible solutions.,
Be direct in your approach.",How to Tell Your Friend They Have a Problem with Drugs," There is a big difference in drug use, drug abuse and drug dependence.



Drug use: simply ingesting a drug. This is not bad OR good. People use drugs for medical and recreational use, and drug use can be okay if the person using it is knowledgeable about the drug and uses responsibly. (See erowid.org for a great repository of drug information.)

Drug abuse: using a drug, legal or illegal, in a way that interferes with your daily functioning and interpersonal relationships. If your grades are falling because you spend time getting high instead of studying, or if you are getting warnings at your job because you are high at work, or you find yourself not being able to pay rent because you spent all your money on drugs, then you -may- have a problem. If your friends feel you are 'different' in a bad way, or you find your loved ones unable to connect with you because of your drug use, you may have a problem.

Drug dependence: the most severe form of drug abuse. This is when you cannot get through a day without using and you abandon friends, family, passions and obligations in the pursuit of a drug. This type of drug use severely and noticeably impacts your mental and physical functioning. Physical and psychological dependence are part of the same construct, so don't try to separate the two. People generally refer to physical dependence when a user's body will start to shut down or the user experiences severe withdrawals, but psychological dependence is the same phenomenon, only within the mind. And as the mind and body are inseparable, drug dependence is best treated as one singular issue, regardless of the locus of the most severe symptoms.;
, Never diagnose yourself or others unless you are a trained and licensed professional. Even then, professionals should keep in mind that the DSM-IV's definitions of these drug use-related phenomena are slippery. (For example, one sign of drug abuse according to the DSM-IV is getting in trouble with the law for drug violations. However, someone who carried half a gram of marijuana for a friend could get a drug charge just as easily as someone who shoots up heroin 5 times a day. Clearly, legal violations are not a good metric of drug abuse, so the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria should be taken with a grain of salt.)

, Talk with a health care worker and ask what would be the best options with helping your friend's drug problem. But remember what you can do for your friend depends on your age, the help, resources, and on the friend themselves.

, Before you approach your friend, ask yourself, ""What do I want to get out of this meeting?"" Possible objectives might be:


A realization that this lifestyle is destructive.
An honest admission of drug use.
A desire to be drug-free.
Agreement to ask for help.
Attendance at a support group.
A system of accountability.
Enrollment in a drug rehabilitation program.
Reconciliation with estranged family members.
Restitution for damage to others.
Surrender to authorities for outstanding warrants.

, Confrontations that begin with ""You should..."" or ""You shouldn't..."" will turn the discussion into a battle that will force your friend to defend him or herself. A better approach might be, "" When you use marijuana, I feel sad and I get worried you might be hurting yourself and/or putting yourself into harms way."" Try talking about your feelings about said friend and how much they really mean to you. You may also bring up problems that are arising in your friendship because of them using, and how you never want to lose them. Telling them and really showing them that they can totally count and trust on you to listen and just be there for them no matter the situation, may help reassure and help to move forward because they have someone in there corner!

, One of the greatest fears of the drug abuser is that he will lose his friends or family if he is found out. Offering support in the rehabilitation process is important. Offer to attend 12-step meetings with your friend. Offer to be there if he has to tell his parents and other superiors about his abuse.

, It is important that you walk the walk as well as talk the talk. If you are going to help someone get clear of drugs, you must be willing to go drug free as well.

, Make it clear that you will not tolerate his drug use and will not associate with him when he is using. This is not the same as never talking with him, but it means you will walk away if you see him using, and not talk to him for the rest of the time he is high.

, Do not do this alone if possible. An intervention is far more successful if others are present. If you are young, talk to a parent or a teacher or a counselor or a principal or a religious leader. Don't stop seeking help until someone listens to you and offers to help.

, It is not easy to get someone to admit that they have a drug addiction. After your approached your friend you can give possible solutions. It's better to go through the the information in the forms of brochures or videos that you can hand to your friend so that he may see help is available.

, Be clear and direct. ""I saw you lighting up a blunt last night and I felt scared."" ""When you use drugs, I get afraid that you will say and do things that will hurt my feelings and my body."" ""I will not hang around you when you are using or are under the influence of drugs."" ""I want to help you kick the habit, I know of a Drug Abuser Anonymous meeting tonight at 8, I will go with you and sit through the meeting to help you check it out.""

Talk to your friend when you are both clear-minded.,
Speak with your friend about the risky behavior soon after it happens.,
Be honest when you share your concerns.,
Research possible solutions prior to speaking to your friend.,
Place the concern on yourself.,
Talk about the consequences.,
Ask your friend questions.,
Offer to assist them as they seek help.,
Ask yourself if you would want to be told.,
Determine if there is a reason for the risky behavior.,
Enlist the help of others.",How to Talk to a Friend About Their Risky Behavior," The best time to speak with someone about their behavior is when you are both stress-free, in good moods and not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to find the time for a conversation when you are both at your absolute best. Still, you should try to initiate the conversation during a time when you think your friend will be more receptive.For instance, avoid talking while you are out drinking with each other. Also, try not to talk to your friend when they’ve had a particularly rough day or are overly stressed about something, if possible.;
, Talking to your friend after they exhibit the behavior in question has more of an impact than waiting a substantial amount of time to point out their actions. They may forget what happened, or may not feel as emotionally attached to it if they have time to get over what occurred. As soon as you can, confront them about the situation.


This approach should only be used in a more severe situation, such as when you feel like your friend’s risky behavior is putting them or others into harm’s way and potentially threatening their life.
If you are unable to address the behavior when it happens, keep a log of your friend’s behavior. Write down the day and time the behavior occurred, and what your friend did. Having solid evidence in front of them may make them take your concern more seriously., As important as it is to point out the issue right away, it's also important not to sugarcoat it. You may try to minimize what's happening so you don't offend your friend, but downplaying risky behavior could lead to negative consequences. Be straightforward and honest with your friend about what happened.


Try saying, “I watched the way you behaved last night and it really concerned me. Do you know why you behaved in that way?” Don't say, ""You were wild last night!"" since this could be misconstrued as approval rather than concern.
Also, Avoid accusing your friend of anything and focus on what concerned you., Part of the benefit of planning your approach is the opportunity to conduct some research. If you don’t take the time to research and brainstorm ways your friend can receive help with the behavior, the meeting won’t have as much of an impact. Your friend may want to come up with solutions together with you, and that’s fine, but you’ll want to have some of the work already completed before you hold the meeting.


If you’re afraid your friend is addicted to drugs or alcohol, look into treatment options and support groups that may help. If you believe the behavior is due to a medical condition, talk to health care professionals about what can be done., Avoid going into the meeting by telling your friend everything they are doing wrong. Your friend is likely to become more defensive if they feel you are attacking them rather than wanting to help them. By making it seem like the meeting is more about how you feel instead of that you are upset by their behavior, they may feel less stressed and more willing to make a change.


For example, use “I” statements like, “I am concerned about you missing work so much,” “I am worried about how much you’ve been drinking lately,” or “I want to offer my support for you and help you with whatever you are going through.” By starting your sentences with “I,” you avoid placing blame and show that the reason for your talk is because you care and are concerned., People who live in the moment rarely worry about what’s going to happen down the road. As such, they may have a “lightbulb moment” when you point out what their behavior is going to cost them. They may not realize it right away, but spelling out the consequences gives them something to think about, which may be what finally gets them to stop hurting themselves.


If your friend has a drug or alcohol problem, say “I am worried that your drug or alcohol use will not only hurt your health, but could cause you to lose your job or even put you in jail.”If the risky behavior has to do with sexual choices, tell your friend “I am concerned that you have unsafe sex with people and that you may end up with a disease or an unwanted pregnancy because of it.” Again, start your sentences with “I,” and also be clear of the dangers this behavior can result in.

, Talking non-stop without giving your friend a chance to offer input may make them feel frustrated and left out. Instead, ask questions that get your friend involved. You’re more likely to get a positive result out of the meeting when they feel like they have had a say.


Ask “what do you think?” to your friend after you discuss your concerns.
Be sure to ask open-ended questions. Open-ended questions are those that do not seek a “yes” or “no” answer. The more your friend talks and is open to discussion, the higher the chances are the meeting will be a success.

, If your friend seems open to talking to you about solutions, propose some possible suggestions from your research. One of the first avenues for help is speaking with a professional counselor. You might help your friend research therapists in your area and even offer to accompany them to an appointment.

, Before you run the risk of hurting your friendship over something trivial, first determine if you would want your friend to talk to you if you were exhibiting the same behavior. If you’re not sure that you would, perhaps you should question if the behavior is really that risky. If you definitely would, then you should speak to your friend immediately about it.Issues that you wouldn’t want to hold your tongue about are those in which your friend may be in danger or pose a danger to others. These include drinking and driving, unprotected sex, theft or using drugs.

, Before you talk to your friend, understanding why they are acting the way they are is often helpful. This allows you to go into your conversation with a clearer idea of what your friend is going through, which may provide you with more ways to help. Asking other friends or those around that person may help you figure out why they are behaving the way they are.


You might mention to some other friends, “I’ve noticed Cassidy has been going out and drinking a lot lately. Have you noticed that, too? Are you concerned?”
Some psychological disorders, such as ADHD, cause people to behave in risky ways. Adults with ADHD are often impulsive and tend to engage in dangerous behavior, such as drug use, aggressive driving, and unsafe sexual behaviors. Knowing if this is the underlying reason for your friend’s uncharacteristic behavior can give you ideas about how to get help, such as adjusting medication or going to see a doctor., If you are unsure of yourself and what to say, having other people who care about your friend there with you may be helpful. Additionally, asking a school counselor or addiction specialist to speak with your friend is beneficial, particularly if drinking or drug use is your concern. Professionals can answer questions and offer support that you may not be able to, and they are experienced in having these types of meetings, which may help things to stay calm and productive.


You’ll need to take your friend’s personality into consideration when planning the meeting. If they are deeply private or even paranoid, they may react better to a one-on-one conversation. Having a group of people there may make them become defensive."
"
Set up a time to talk in person.,
Express your concern.,
Avoid attacking the character of the person’s partner.,
Listen to what your friend or family member tells you.,
Offer to help your friend or family member however you can.",How to Support Someone Stuck in a Controlling Relationship1," Choose a private, safe location. Avoid having the conversation over text or email, as the person’s partner may have access to their computer and phone.Avoid making a big deal of this conversation beforehand, or your friend (or their partner) may be suspicious of your motives. Just say something like, “Hey, I miss you. Can we get together sometime soon for a chat?”;
, Once you’re together in a private place, tell your friend or family member that you’re worried about them. Back up your concern with specific things you’ve observed about their relationship.For instance, say, “I’ve noticed that Joe puts you down whenever you talk about looking for a better job. That doesn’t seem very healthy or supportive.”
Don't hesitate to continue expressing your concern in future meetings if the problem continues.

, Your friend or family member may love their partner, despite their flaws. If you talk about what a terrible person you think their partner is, they could get defensive and shut down the conversation.Don’t criticize the person for staying with their partner, either. They won’t want to talk to you if they feel judged.
Instead of saying, “Jane is bad news. I can’t believe you let her dictate your schedule,” say something like, “I’ve noticed that Jane doesn’t want you to see your friends on the weekends anymore. How do you feel about that?”

, Let the other person steer the conversation. Try to suspend your judgment of their relationship, and don’t interrupt them. Instead, focus on understanding what they have to say.Take the person seriously, no matter what they tell you. They understand their relationship better than anyone else does.
Ask good follow-up questions to make sure you’re understanding them fully. Try, ""So, what you're saying is you feel like you have to stay even though you are unhappy?""
Reassure the person that any abusive behavior they’re experiencing is not their fault. “Don’t beat yourself up about this. I know that’s easier said than done, but this is her fault, not yours.”

, Ask them what they need. Let them know that you’re there for them and want to support them.Don’t make assumptions about what your friend or family member wants or needs. Let them tell you what kind of support is best.
This kind of conversation may have to take place on numerous occasions over time. Just be steady rather than pushy.
Your friend or family member may not be ready to leave their relationship. If that’s the case, let them know that you’ll still be there to help them if and when they ever need anything.

Remain supportive even if the person doesn’t leave right away.",How to Support Someone Stuck in a Controlling Relationship2," Find some reading materials about controlling relationships, locate counselors in your area, and track down the numbers of some helpful hotlines. Share these resources with your friend or family member.Do not give the person pamphlets or books to read unless they have a safe, private place to keep them. Likewise, don’t send them information online unless their partner does not have access to their computer and phone.

, Many people stay in their controlling relationships because leaving is too logistically difficult. If your friend or family member wants to leave but doesn’t know how, offer to keep their personal items at your house, give them rides to counseling appointments, or let them stay with you while they look for an apartment.Don’t promise more than you can realistically give. Once you make the offer, the other person will depend on you to follow through.

, Sometimes it takes a long time for a person who’s being abused to work up the courage to leave their partner. Remain available and supportive for your friend or family member, even if it’s painful to see them in a bad relationship.Your ongoing support and willingness to listen may mean more to the other person than you realize.
Avoid pressuring the person to leave their partner, or they may turn away from you. If they leave, it has to be their own choice.

Notice patterns of isolation.,
Be alert for excessive criticism.,
Keep an eye out for manipulative behavior.,
Notice if your friend’s partner is suspicious or nosy.",How to Support Someone Stuck in a Controlling Relationship3," A controlling person often discourages or forbids their partner from spending time with others. They may speak badly of their partner’s friends and family or act jealous when their partner sees other people.If your friend or family member has become less and less available after getting together with their partner, it could be a warning sign that their partner is trying to isolate them.
If the person tells you their partner doesn’t approve of their friends or social life, it could be another red flag.

, Controlling people try to gain the upper hand over their partner by breaking down their self-esteem. One way they do this is by criticizing their partner’s appearance, personality, or abilities. Criticism may be overt, or it may take the form of backhanded compliments or hurtful “jokes.”Notice if the person’s partner says things like “You’d look so great if you lost some weight” or “Why are you going back to school? You were no good at school before.”

, Does the person’s partner get them to do things they normally wouldn’t do? Using guilt, threats, or pressure to control a partner’s behavior is a common tactic in unhealthy relationships.If your friend or family member has been acting out of character lately, consider whether their partner might have something to do with it.
Statements like “If you ever left me, I’d probably kill myself” or “I do all these things for you, and then you repay me by making your own plans and leaving me alone” are giveaways of a manipulative relationship.
Be aware that your friend's safety or even life might be threatened, and they could be unwilling to disclose that. The harder it is for them to make contact with you, the more serious the situation may be.

, Controlling partners always want to know what the other person is doing and with whom. If your friend or family member has to call their partner frequently to check in, or if they have to get their partner’s permission to make plans with other people, the relationship is probably unhealthy.Another major red flag is if the person’s partner reads their text and email conversations.

Find your members.,
Make a schedule.,
Divide up the work; assign jobs.,
Work on performance.,
Practice.,
Get booked to perform.",How to Start a Girl Group," If it will be one soloist with instrumental backup, you would choose different members than if you want to sing barbershop harmony, for instance. Or it could be something in-between, where a couple of you sings, and maybe all play instruments.;
, Time to decide who you want to be in your group. School Friends or maybe your sister! Select people who have the talent and the time. Make sure they are willing to participate and work for it. At least one of you should have some musical knowledge and experience, and at least one of you must have the patience and the discipline to make sure the group keeps going!

, As soon as you know your plans, you need to have a meeting with your 1st few members; maybe they have an idea about someone else who could join the group. Maybe they have an idea for a new song.

, Maybe one of your friends can't sing but wants to be a part of the group; she would be perfect for a secretary to take notes at meetings about ideas. You should also have a treasurer, who could also take the place of secretary sometimes. Both should have computer skills. The Treasurer will hold onto the money and keep track of what you put in and take out.

, Write a song or choose a song to make a routine to. This is team effort. All the members should put forth ideas and mix and match the agreed upon ideas.

, This is what the group needs to do consistently. You should practice every week, several times a week, in the summer, and at least once a week during the school year.


It is best to practice for at least two weeks before you go up to perform in public. You should try to meet once a weekend for 3-5 hours.

, Once everything is set, you need to get noticed.


Upload your videos to YouTube.
Try to get an agent. Even though doing this is not necessary in the beginning, it could be helpful in getting your performances noticed.
Ask your local recreation center if you can perform during one of their sports events.
Ask your cousin if she wants entertainment for her birthday.
Ask all (or some) of your friends to help you make a support team (street team).

Find out the person’s online information and request to add them.,

Use the content on their profile to start a conversation.,
Send an email message.If you are messaging the person from Facebook, his or her email may be listed on the profile.,
Arrange to meet up, if possible.,

Keep it casual at first.,
Be prepared for your attempt to crash and burn.",How to Talk to an Old Friend over Instant Messaging," This can be done through chain mail, by asking other friends or by searching for them on the Facebook search bar or through a search engine. If you don't think the person will remember you, write a short note in the greeting box for the invite to remind them who you are.An example statement may be: “Hi, I’m not sure if you remember me, but we used to attend the same high school. I’m the girl that always turned red when called on in class!”;
, Check out their occupation, where they live, and their relationship status. Look at pictures. Find out what they're interested in, and see if you both have any similar hobbies or interests. Any connection points can fuel your messaging conversations and make things a little less awkward., Once the person adds you, send your first official message. In most cases, you don’t actually have to wait until the person comes online to message him or her. You can send a message anytime and wait for the person to respond at their convenience.


Maybe start off with something short and sweet like “Hey, I haven't spoken to you in ages! How have you been?”, After the two of you have messaged back and forth for a short while, it can be hard to come up with interesting topics to keep the energy going.Also, be sure not to talk about yourself too much. But, at the same time, don't be afraid to include details about you every so often. Keep the balance right.


Instead of asking a broad question like “What have you been up to?” be more specific by commenting on a picture or post and then moving over to instant messaging to learn more. For instance, if the person makes a post about their job, send a private message saying something like “Your job seems really interesting! What got you started in marketing?”

, Once the two of you have gotten reacquainted, it is appropriate to transition to other forms of communication like email. Send the person a note letting them know how pleased you are to get back in touch.


You can use email to pursue other ways to connect like asking for the person’s phone number or scheduling a Skype or Hangouts session to chat face-to-face.

, One way to forge a deeper connection with an old pal is to schedule a time to meet in-person. Choose something low-key and casual like getting together over coffee or sharing breakfast or lunch. If meeting one-on-one makes you anxious, consider setting a date when you can meet up with a group. Reach out to several old friends at once who share a common background to reduce the pressure.


This may be difficult if your friend has moved away. If this is the case, perhaps invite them to stay with you for a couple of days, or wait until they're visiting the area again to make plans together.

, If the friend you lost touch with was a very close pal, it may be appropriate to send a package and/or letter to the person. Ask for an address and put something in the mail that boosts the connection between the two of you. It could be a postcard if you are traveling, or a small care package of nifty little things that the person liked when the two of you were closer., If either you or your friend aren’t big posters on social media, it can help to share picture of what you’ve been up to. This helps bridge the connection and gives your friend a visual of your life now. Recently graduate college? Send a few pics of graduation, letting her see what your parents and family look like now. You can even take a walk down memory lane and dig up old pictures of the two of you from the past.

, Keep in mind that the success of your reconnection will depend on the history the two of you share. How your friendship faded away will determine whether your friend is actually open to restoring your relationship.Prepare yourself for backlash in the case of a friendship that ended badly. For instance, your friend may still have bitter feelings about an issue from the past. In such cases, you may want to prepare a statement to address any previous problems you two had.
In one of your messages, you may want to apologize for past indiscretions. Or, it may be better to arrange a time to meet up in person or hold a Skype session to discuss the issue.

, Another factor to consider is your reasons for wanting to get back in touch with this person. Be honest with yourself about your motives. Are your motives genuine for trying to reconnect?


For example, have you recently ended another friendship and are looking to fill the empty space in your life? If so, it may be best for you to wait until you adjust to the changes to see if you are still interested in rekindling the friendship., Any early interactions should be time-limited and pressure-free. This allows the two of you to keep it light and friendly while keeping expectations low of where things may go. Also, keeping things casual enables the two of you to decide how you want to move forward., Sometimes, trying to find a spark in an old friendship is hard. There’s a chance that it won’t go anywhere, and that’s okay. Don’t take rejection or failure for the connection to go deeper as a sign that there’s something wrong with you.


People change. You two may not have very much in common any longer. Your friend may not have room for more friends with all the obligations he or she is juggling. Or, it may be hard for your friend to move past a betrayal or disappointment from the past. Whatever the reason, be proud of yourself for trying and keep moving on with your life."

Maintain a presence in your friend's life.,

Do little things to make them happy.,

Understand that your friend lives a very different life than you do.,
Ask your friend to explain their illness to you.,
In a new friendship with a sick person, you may find yourself in the unpleasant position of being cancelled on or ignored via phone.,
After you know the person better, you may find that you want to make their lives easier.,
Be a source of cheer.,
Keep doing caring things.",How to Support Someone Who Is Chronically Ill," Your friend is facing a very different life than they had imagined for themselves, and will need to grieve their loss. They are likely dealing with an overload of painful symptoms, and coming to terms with their new limitations.The first step is to let them know that you intend to be there for them as a friend. This alone will be a gift to them; many chronically ill are dropped by their friends, who find the problems associated with the illness to be too difficult or uncomfortable. Assure your friend that you will be present in his or her life. Make it clear that you are ready to support your friend as well as you can through difficult times.;
, Ask your friend for a good website that will help you to understand exactly what their disease is. Simply googling it may not give you the best of results, as the general search system lacks vital information returns for medical issues. You may wind up with a false impression of the disease, so be sure to ask your friend. It will also be a good step to show them that you care, and have a genuine interest in their health.


You might also like to ask your doctor or a friend with medical qualifications for suggested websites to read through, and perhaps some medical journal articles as well.

, It is likely that your friend is dealing with an enormous amount of pain and new emotions. He or she is probably a mess, and you may find hearing about the state of their lives unpleasant or uncomfortable. This is understandable, however, you must work to put those feelings aside in order to support your friend. You may feel tempted to quickly change the subject. You may not want to meet their eyes. Little in this world is more obvious or more hurtful. So be prepared, but make it clear that you are ready to listen when they want to talk.

, When your friend talks, be a good listener. Make eye contact, let them speak without interrupting, and nod every now and then. When they finish, reply to what they said––do not start talking about something else in your life. You can be certain that your life's problems are completely unrelated.


For example: Your friend says, ""It's so hard. Everything hurts, all the time. I'm so tired sometimes I can barely breathe. I was so nauseated this morning I thought my stomach might explode."" Do not respond with: ""Oh, that sucks. When I ate this burrito from this Mexican place, I was super nauseated too. Have you tried coffee?""

The more appropriate response would be something along the lines of: ""Wow. I'm so sorry, that must be really hard for you."" Validate what they are feeling, and give them permission to talk as much as they need. If you are doing this much already, you are a truly exceptional friend!



, Somebody who is chronically ill finds everyday tasks challenging. Something like showering or making dinner might take every bit of energy that they have in them. Show up with dinner, offer to do their grocery shopping when you are at the store, or offer to drive them somewhere that they may need to go. You don't need to become their caretaker, but dropping off a casserole once a month would go a very long way. Your friend needs a lot of help, but will probably be careful not to ask you for too much.

, You can bake them a cake, bring some movies to their house to watch together, or send them a cute balloon. Offer to go to support groups with them, to better understand what they are going through. Gestures like these can make somebody's day.

, For example, if you make plans, be aware that they may need to cancel suddenly. Don't hold it against them. If they cancel on your lunch plans, understand that they may not have been able to leave the house for weeks. It's possible that they can't go out because they don't have the strength to bathe. They live very different lives. So, if you are cancelled on suddenly, or they aren't responding to your messages, don't be upset. Try to think what they might be going through, and ask them if you can do anything to help. It might be a good time to drop off that casserole! Everybody needs somebody looking after them. Chronic illnesses often put strain in families, so you, as the empathetic friend, may find yourself in the position of being the sole caring person. You are very important.

, Imagine what your day consists of: you probably wake up, take a shower, wash your face, brush your teeth, make yourself breakfast, eat, and get dressed, all before going to work or school. Each of these actions is probably effortless and mindless for you, but any one of them would present an enormous challenge for somebody who is extremely ill. It is impossible to truly understand what that life is like if you have not lived it, but try to imagine the worst illness you have ever had. Preferably one that put you in constant pain, gave you frightening new symptoms, and drained you completely of energy. Now imagine that you never recovered. Think of the long term consequences on your career, your relationships, and your emotions.

, Attempt to understand their limitations. Do your best to get a good understanding of what they are living with and the daily challenges that they face. Many sick people find that others do not want to hear about their illness, so your desire to understand will put them at ease. You may also feel uncomfortable about asking, maybe because you feel that they don't want to talk, or you don't know how to handle the answer. The fact is, most sick people do want to talk about their illnesses. Illness is life for a sick person! People want to talk about their lives. If you don't know how to handle the answer, simply listen well and express empathy for the other person. That's all they need.

, Be assured, this is most likely not a reflection on your personality, but a reflection on how ill your new friend is. If your friend cancelled on your movie plans, offer to come over with movies. It's possible that they can't leave the house. If they say no, don't worry, because it's possible that they simply cannot bathe themselves. If they take a long time to respond to your messages, it's possible that they are not capable of responding. It might be a good time to drop off a casserole or something, if you know the person well enough.


If you ever feel hurt, put yourself in their shoes. Friendship is an enormous energy expenditure for a sick person, and you should take it as a compliment that they are even attempting one with you. It means that think you're worth their precious reserves of energy. You're pretty cool.

, In this case, offer to pick up groceries for them when you are at the store. Contact them, saying that you accidentally made a double batch of macaroni and cheese, and would they want you to drop some off? Eventually, they may feel comfortable asking you for the help that they need to get to doctors' appointments and do other things. They will be careful not to overburden you, and probably will not ask for any help at all unless you take the first step. These small things are not small to somebody in the position of your friend, and they will be remembered for a long time to come.

, Let's say your lovely friend is feeling down. They just saw a doctor who was unkind, or got back some bad lab results. Time to cheer them up! Make yourself available to empathize. Listen to what they have to say, and respond by validating their emotions. For example, when they say: ""I'm really disappointed, I had no idea how much I was hoping for this until it was gone,"" You say, ""I'm so sorry, Bobert. Is there anything I can do?"" Don't respond with your feelings, or attempt to convince them that their problems are not so terrible. Their problems are terrible, and it is helpful if you acknowledge that and provide comfort.

, Want to go the extra mile in friendly kindness? Your friend is so lucky. Bake your friend a cake, send them a balloon, or go to their house (having confirmed it with them first) with a favorite book or movies. Offer to attend a support group with them, and they will feel particularly grateful to have such a caring and thoughtful friend.

Pick someone who is available.,
Pick someone who won't get too attached.,
Pick someone you already like.,
Pick someone outside your social or work circle.,
Pick someone with experience.",How to Start a Friends With Benefits Relationship1," This means ""available"" in all senses of the word -- single being the most obvious definition. The person should not only be single, but he or she shouldn't be recovering from the end of a devastating break-up, dealing with the loss of a loved one, or so busy studying that he or she practically lives in the library. This person should be feeling fun, emotionally stable, and up for anything -- especially hooking up with you.;
, Friends with benefits relationships often end because one person starts falling for the other. So, unless you want to date the person, or you don't care if the person gets really hurt, you should avoid someone who will get attached. How do you know who will get too attached and who won't? Well, you can't figure this out with 100% certainty, but there are a few clues that the person may get too attached:


If you've heard this person described as ""clingy,"" whether it's by friends or past significant others, then you may have a problem.
If the person doesn't have a lot of friends, interests, or a lot going on, then he or she may have nothing better to do than to spend a lot of time with you.
If you know that this person has really liked you in the past, then it's better to avoid it. If you know the person has a harmless crush on you, then that's perfect.

, Key word -- like, not really really like. This should be someone who you think is cute and fun to be around -- you should like this person just as much as you like spending a day at the beach with your friends. If you're going to spend a lot of time with that person, then you should feel a baseline of affection -- just nothing too serious.


Pick someone you already like, but not someone you would normally date. Go out of your comfort zone and remember that you're looking for a hot hook up partner, not your future husband or wife. If you pick someone you might date, then it's more likely that you'd end up falling for that person.
You should have some natural chemistry with this person. That doesn't mean you want to stay up for hours talking about the meaning of life with him -- you just want to rip his shirt off.

, Don't have a friends with benefits relationship with one of the members of the group of friends you've known since you were five, or it'll lead to some serious awkwardness when the relationship ends. Typical friends with benefits relationships only last a few months, so don't pick someone you know you'll have to see all the time.

, You should try to find someone who you know has had some experience hooking up -- even better if you've heard he or she is great in bed. Since that's what you'll be doing, it's good to have a sense that the person will deliver. It will also help if the person has had some casual flings before, so he or she is experienced in that department. If the person has only had one relationship and it lasted seven years, he may not be your best bet.

"

Flirt with the person.,
Start hooking up.,
Set the ground rules.,
Enjoy some hot sex.,
Keep up your communication.",How to Start a Friends With Benefits Relationship2," Start flirting with the person by teasing, playfully touching, or just paying attention to him or her. Let the person know you're interested and give him or her a few not-so-subtle compliments. You're not trying to be coy here -- you're looking for a hook-up buddy.

, Once the person is interested, you can start kissing or doing something more. Tell the person how attracted you are to him or her but do not compliment that person's personality or say anything that makes it sound like you want to date.

, Every non-couple is different. Some friends with benefits know each other well enough to set some ground rules before they start hooking up. But that can feel a little awkward and unnatural, so you may want to wait until after that first kiss or hook-up session. Ideally, you should have the talk before sex, so you know that both people are on the same page and that no one gets really hurt. Here are the things you should talk about:


Make it clear that you are not dating -- you're just having fun. Both of you should be free to hook up with other people.
Make sure that you won't see each other too often. You should see each other just two or three times a week, preferably at night. If you see each other almost every day, then guess what? That's dating.
Decide that you'll end the relationship when one person gets too attached. Unless you both start falling for each other, make it clear that if someone gets attached, it's over.

, That's what having friends with benefits is for, isn't it? Have fun hooking up with your ""friend,"" letting loose, and trying the things you were too afraid to try with your old boyfriend or girlfriend. This is your time to let loose and experiment, picking up the tricks you can use to wow future partners. Have fun trying new poses, having sex in kinky locations, and just throwing caution to the wind.

, As you ease in to your friends with benefits relationship, don't forget to check in with the person you're hooking up with. Make sure you're both into each other, but not too much. If you'll both be at a party, talk about how you'll act. If you're also hooking up with another person, don't be shady about it. You don't have to spill your heart out, but you should keep talking so you know what's working and what isn't.

"
"
Don't forget to see other people.,
Keep it casual.,
Keep doing your own thing.,
Know when to say goodbye.",How to Start a Friends With Benefits Relationship3," Part of a no-strings-attached relationship means that you are free to see other people. Don't forget this important perk. If you're only hooking up with one person, it may turn into a real relationship. If that's not what you want, then keep a look out whenever you're out at a bar or a party. Don't just wait to get a text from your hook up buddy, but look around and see if there are any other options for you.

, You can hang out with your friend with benefits, but you need to make it clear that it's not a date. For one thing, you should spend more time in bed together than out of it. You can go out for a drink -- but not for dinner. Try to make your place as inhospitable as possible so your hook up buddy doesn't want to linger in the morning.


If your friend does stay the night, don't fry up some pancakes in the morning, or give her a kiss goodbye. Be nice, but not loving.
Don't do things a real couple would do, like go on a mini-vacation, go grocery shopping, or go on double-dates with your friends.
Don't go clothes shopping together, and don't bring your ""friend"" as a date to a wedding or a party.
Don't get gifts for the person you're hooking up with, or call him or her just to chat.
Keep your distance. Don't see the person more than two or three times a week.

, The joy of a friends with benefits relationship is that you can still have enough time to pursue your own goals, whether it's grad school, your love for painting, or just all of the fun times you have hanging out with your friends. You can keep hooking up with your friend while having plenty of time to do all of the things you love during the day.

, There are three main reasons that a friends with benefits relationship ends: one person gets too attached, one person finds someone else he really wants to date, or both people just get bored and want to move on. The fourth reason is that there is a natural time-based end to the relationship, such as the end of a summer, the end of a long trip, or that one or both people is graduating.


Once you have a feeling that it may be over, then it's over. If you set the ground rules early on, then it shouldn't be too painful to have a conversation about ending the non-relationship.
And in the rare event that you and your hook up partner have fallen for each other, just sit back and enjoy the ride.

, I'm going to go out and pick up some ice cream for us (ice cream and chocolate solve everything) and we can talk about it some more when I get back.""

Then tell them a story about something that happened to you that got you down.

, Once your comforting has finished and you have answered any questions your friend may have asked, smile at him or her and say ""Yes... it was a heck of a bad time then."" And just comfort him or her until the time is right. Hopefully, that's when he or she will start laughing or smiling.

If someone insults you, just ignore them. The people who are jealous and hate you will be outnumbered by the people who love you for being yourself. Play to your strengths.


If you are shy or reserved, play up your mysterious side. Be friendly and open to people, but don't be an open book. If people are interested in what makes you click, they'll try to get closer to you to find out.
If you're into sports, use your athletic skill to boost your confidence. Just don't be cocky. The people who are great at sports but who are still humble get a lot of attention. Be that person. Don't be the stereotypical jock who picks on the nerds because he's insecure.
If you're brainy, focus on being more approachable. One of the least cool things you can do as a really smart person is make other people feel unwelcome, even if they're not that smart. Try to relate to them, and be aware that they may be looking for reasons not to trust you if they are jealous. Only talk about really brainy things with other brainy friends.;
, Not everyone is born with great social skills, but they can definitely be developed. With the right training and exposure, you can really make a difference in your confidence and your impressions quickly.



Be Patient. Talking to strangers is never easy. But the more you do it, the easier it will get. Give conversations time to develop. Hang around people and conversations will naturally develop.
Make eye contact. This is important as a lot is conveyed through your eyes and when you avoid looking at someones eyes they may think you are lying or not interested. It is proved by psychology that creating an eye contact is really a great social skill which will help you do develop healthy relationships.


Be forgiving. Your friends and classmates are bound to make mistakes. Don't hold every last thing against them. Forgive a friend if they come to you with an apology.

Be loyal. Little things count. If you make an appointment, be on time. If you're in a group, show up early, and stay late (even if you have nothing to say at the moment).

Stick up for your friends. If one of them gets in a fight, try to break it up and calm them down. Don't let people say stupid, mean things about your friends and get away with it.

Don't gossip. Gossip is like a boomerang: it will always come back to hit you. Don't develop a reputation as a gossiper. Only say things about people that you'd be comfortable saying to their face.



, Even if you are feeling really down, remember that there's always something out there to smile about. A positive outlook will make people want to be around you a lot more. Be cautious, however. There's a point where optimism can be annoying. Don't be too optimistic.


Focus on the good more than you focus on the bad. There's always a good side to things and a bad side. Look at the glass half-full. A breakup is an opportunity to meet someone new; a failed test is an opportunity to learn something; a social slip-up is an opportunity to get better with people.
Trust that things will work themselves out. Some people believe in Karma, other people think that good things happen to good people. Whatever you believe, it's good to believe that you'll be rewarded for the way you behave.
Focus on what you can change and don't try to change the rest. You can't change who likes you or who thinks that you're funny, but you can change how you interact with them. Don't try to move mountains; stick to bending branches.

, It is difficult to like others when you do not appreciate yourself for who you are. Try exercise to improve your self-esteem. Start your journey to ""self-discovery.""


Make a list of all the things that you set off to do during a week, and check off the things that you finish. At the end of the week, you'll feel great about all you've accomplished.
Find a reason to laugh. Repeat watching that side-splitting movie you love; get a super-funny friend to make you laugh; whatever you do, make sure to laugh, because it'll make you feel happier. Every time you make a mistake in front of others make a joke about it, this will not only make you feel less embarrassed, it will make you more popular.
Open. Be open to everybody as when you ignore some people you will find it harder to interact with others and over time you may start ignoring everyone.
Treat yourself well. We can get caught up in the world every so often. It's nice to step back and realize that the little things count. Don't be afraid to treat yourself.
Don't get too down on yourself when you make mistakes. Mistakes are natural and this only teaches new lessons. Don't be mad or frustrated when you make a mistake; take it as an opportunity to get better at something.

, Dress Well. The way you look isn't the ticket to getting people to like you, but it can help. Make sure you're sending other people great body language. Be unique, be yourself.


Wash regularly, smell nice, and brush your teeth. Take a shower once a day. (Wash your hair every other day.) Wear a clean-smelling deodorant or a bit of perfume if you're a girl. Brush your teeth at least twice a day, and floss at least once.

Smile as much as you can! Signs of encouragement let people know you care about what they are saying. Smiling is a way of letting other people know you're happy as well, and people want to be around others who are happy.
Pay attention to the body language you're sending other people. Crossed arms, tapping feet, rolling eyes and sighing are all signs of boredom, exasperation, and disappointment. Make sure you're sending people the right messages with your body.

, For example, every time you go to school, work, or a party, say hello to someone and have a one-on-one conversation with them. Focus on the easier social tasks before going onto the harder ones; that way, your success will motivate you even more.


Say a cherry ""hello"" to those who don't talk much. Share something about yourself, such as where you're going or why you're there. Just be friendly. Avoid talking about the weather — as Tom Waits says, ""Strangers talk about the weather."" Ask them questions and learn about them if you're unsure about what to say.

Listen more than you talk. Instead of nodding and smiling and occasionally wiping the drool off your face, try to take what the person says and run with it. Add your own thoughts into the mix — but don't hijack the conversation. Conversation is a two-way street.
Don't expect perfection out of anyone, especially yourself. For example, if you forget your own name while introducing yourself (which probably won't happen), just make fun of the situation. Everyone slips up once in a while; it's how you recover that makes you likable or awkward.
Share interesting/silly ideas. Your thoughts can open up many doors that can lead to friendship. You never know if something you say is going to cause people to think deeply, to laugh, or look at you in a different light. After all, ideas are ideas.

, The people who are considered popular may not be the sharpest tacks in the box, but they know how to reach out to other people and make them feel good by doing so. It is never too late to feel that being popular is important.


Talk to older people, maybe even your own folks. If you're respectful, older people will respect you back They won't ridicule you, make you feel inferior, or laugh at you. Gaining foothold with older people might help you feel more comfortable when it comes time to talk with people your own age.
Befriend the younger crowd if you are in middle school. Hanging out with kids a year or two younger may help you build confidence, which will help you with kids around your own age. The 10-year old next door will be really easy to talk to, making your confidence skyrocket.

Organize an event with friends. Depending on your age, organize something to do with your friends and let them invite new people. Maybe organize a pickup soccer game, or a pool-party, or a happy hour after work. Try to get new people to join!

, Always give compliments, but don't try too hard. If you are shy, take a deep breath and risk it - you never know what might happen. If you are shy on the outside but a little crazy on the inside, let it out once in a while. Wear your hair up high and spin around or dance. Others will laugh and find you funny and fun to be with.


Don't be defensive over something that's only an issue for you. For example, don't shout, ""Why are you so prejudiced?"" or ""Why don't you like women?"" when due to past situations you may just be overly sensitive. Try to always believe the best about others and give them the benefit of the doubt.

If you're arguing with someone about something stupid such as shoes, drop it. Try to get out of arguments that are dumb. If you're arguing because you were sticking up for your friend because someone was making fun of her and you were trying to stand up for her, then it's understandable.


Don't say nasty or offensive things to people. Avoid touchy subjects like politics, religion, and sexuality, because people get offended easily talking about them. If someone asks your opinion, give it to them, but understand that others may have different viewpoints.
Respect everyone, no matter what they think or say. They are a person and deserve to be treated with respect. If you treat people well they will treat you the same. Don't be offensive just to try to look cool or like you don't care. You risk alienating people and sounding like you don't know what you're talking about.

, Get up, move and join a group of classmates that has similar interests whether at lunch or at a party. In that environment, it would be easier to meet people and make friends. And it's fine if your friends don't have much in common with you as long as you both are happy and comfortable.


If your friends judge/don't approve of something you do, they aren't friends. Your friends should protect you and look out for your well-being (so they might not be cool with smoking cigarettes), but other than that, they support what you do.
Join clubs and other extracurriculars that you're interested in. If you want to paint, join the Art club. If you like debate, join the debate team. Don't worry about what people say or think about you. If you're confident about what you do, they'll look silly making fun of you.
Don't worry about what group you fit into. You don't have to define yourself the way other people define you. If you want to be a part of the skateboard crew, then start skateboarding, and don't listen to other people if they tell you you're not a skater.

, For many people, being funny is about calling attention to something strange or unexpected. But how do you do that? First of all, you have to trust that you know what's funny. Remember a time when you were funny and know that you can be that funny person again.


Find the things that make you laugh, because they have a good chance of making others laugh as well. Keep a note of all the really funny things that happen to you, or the really funny things that other people say. You'll get used to being around humor.
Find out why things make you laugh. Knowing how to make a joke depends on figuring out why something is funny. When somebody says or does something funny, ask yourself, Why is that funny? Become a student of humor.
Surround yourself with people who are funny. Those people can be your friends, or they can be actors you watch on TV. Whomever they are, get close to them; their comedy will rub off on you.

, Having a good sense of humor is all about being able to make fun of yourself. Look at stand-up comics: Practically all they do is make fun of something that they did or something that happened to them. If you can make fun of yourself (in a confident way) people will know that you have good self-esteem.


Practice self-deprecating humor. Self-deprecating humor is when you make fun of yourself in a playful way, and because you don't seem afraid of making mistakes others are less likely to be afraid of you criticising them. The following are some good examples of self-deprecating humor. Remember that these are more formal jokes; with your friends, try to use more casual jokes that call attention to what's funny about you.

""I went to the psychiatrist, and he says 'You're crazy.' I tell him I want a second opinion. He says, 'Okay, you're ugly too!'""
""I feel sorry for people who don’t drink or do drugs. Because someday they’re going to be in a hospital bed, dying, and they won’t know why.""
""I was so ugly when I was born, the doctor slapped my mother.""



, There are a lot of kinds of humor; knowing a wide range of humorous remarks is all about understanding what goes into being funny. Here are breakdowns of different kind of humor.


Expectation v. Reality. When we expect something, and we're given something completely different, we're surprised: ""I went to a fight the other night and a hockey game broke out.""
Wordplay and puns. Playing around with language to make something sound slightly different from what we expect: ""A chicken crossing the road: poultry in motion.""
One liners or comebacks. A quick word or sentence delivered to make a joke out of something someone said: One of your friends says ""Isn't it weird that we only have hair on our heads and in our pubic areas?"" The friend is not really even expecting a response. You say: ""Speak for yourself.""

, Being funny is an art, not a science. There's not one textbook that you can read and be done with it. Therefore, it's important to keep at it, learning how to be funny by trial and error.


Read comedy books and watch comedic movies. You can find lists of funny books and movies easily on the internet, or you can ask friends for their suggestions.
Practice jokes on your own. If you've never practiced any jokes before, ease into it: You don't want to suddenly bombard your classmates or friends with constant material. Try a joke here, or a joke there, and take note of what works. If it doesn't work, ask yourself what you need to do to make it funny.
Get back up when you fall down. Every funny person is going to make some unfunny jokes now and then. Often you can turn this into a further self deprecating joke. It doesn't mean that they're not funny. So don't be afraid of failing. The good news is that no one will remember your jokes unless they're actually funny!

Make sure you don't want to be their friend.,
Let the person know.,
Keep a distance.,
Don't be mean to the person when you're in a group.,
Stay connected with your group.,
Tell your other friends as needed.,
Deal with any jealousy in a mature way.,
Be prepared that one-on-one interactions with your ex-friend may be awkward.,
Let your friendship (or lack thereof) evolve over time.",How to Stop Being Friends with Someone Who's Friends with Your Other Friends," Often times people will get into arguments and you may feel as if you are done with that person. However, these feelings aren't always permanent. Before you do anything drastic, evaluate your friendship and think of the good and bad things your friend has done to you.;
, Avoid a scene or adding to the drama; try talking with them in private or even in writing over email. Handling the issues one-on-one in person is the best way to make sure you're both heard and understood.


If it's a person who you know wants to be your friend and you don't want to be theirs, let them down gently. A good thing to say might be ""I think we should have a distance for a while. I really need to focus on school right now. I know you want to be my friend, so I hope you understand."" Say it nicely.
If it's a person who does not want to be your friend and you want to be theirs, make sure you understand their reason. Sound sad, but not angry at them for their choice. ""I understand,"" is a good way to put things across.
If you have been through an argument and you both do not want to be friends, you should evaluate this, because the argument may fade and time may heal it. If you're sure you both want to move on from the friendship, the transition should be fairly easy; accept your feelings openly and decide to ""cool it"" together.

, The best way to really cool a friendship is to stop hanging out. This may be more difficult if you have shared friends in common, or you attend the same school or workplace. But it's not impossible. Stop calling one another, texting, or hanging out one-on-one. In groups, stay cordial and friendly, but don't seek one another out. Just build a healthy distance, and your friendship will soon become less intense.

, Don't launch into a deep conversation with that person, but there's no need to be rude. Talk with your other friends and talk to that person if he/she happens to join the conversation. Instead, stay polite and say hi in the hallways sometimes, as if he/she were just a classmate and not anything better or worse. Do not give the person the cold shoulder, or they may start to be mean to you too.

, If the ex-friend is talking with one of your friends, therefore leaving you out, make sure you engage. Don't walk away just because the person you don't like is talking to someone else who you do like. Still, be polite so that your friend doesn't mention anything in public.Also you friend may question you about that person. Tell them slowly and calmly what happened,  if your friend is a good one they will understand.

, It's best to avoid making a big scene

, If a friend of yours is starting to become closer to the person you don't like than you, you may feel jealous. This is okay.  But do not be mean or cruel to your friend or that person. Instead try regaining the friendship with that person.

, You'll both feel it, especially at first. Just try to be polite and talk normally as if you were talking to a friend.

, You may eventually choose to be friends again. Let the friendship evolve naturally, and if you find yourself wanting to talk or hang out more again, just go with it. You don't need to make big public announcements; just let it happen.


If they want to be your friend but you don't want to be theirs, it is better to avoid making a big scene or saying ""no"". You can be nice to them, but you don't have to spend all your time with them. Don't feel bad. You can be polite without becoming best friends again; just keep the distance that you feel comfortable with, without being intentionally rude or off-putting.

Make friends with your coworkers.",How to Pursue Friendship if You Suffer from a Tic Disorder," When you are deciding on people to be friends with, choose someone who has similar interests as you.Even though you have a tic disorder, you still want to befriend people who have similar interests. This may mean someone in drama club who shares your love of theater or someone in one of your classes who likes comic books.Look around at the people you interact with on a daily basis. This may include people in your classes, at your job, or in your neighborhood. These people are already familiar to you, so they are all potential friends.;
, You probably have a lot of acquaintances. These are people you interact with on a regular basis, like at work or school. You may exchange small talk or say hello to one another. One way to make friends is to start talking more to these acquaintances.Ask the acquaintance what they did over the weekend or what they like to do in their spare time. You may discover that you share common interests.
Offer a bit of yourself to the other person. Tell the person about an activity you’ve done recently you’ve enjoyed, or a movie you’ve seen or book you’ve read that was good.
One way that some people with tic disorders break the ice with people is to make a joke about their tic disorder. It may be a way to see if the person will be kind and worth being friends with, and help the other person be more comfortable about your tic disorder., Some people might not know how to deal with their own uncomfortable feelings and avoid people who have a disorder. It helps to read the signals the other person is giving off to determine if they are interested in becoming friends despite your disorder. Pay attention to how the other person acts when you talk to them. Are they interested, or do they quickly move on to another person or activity?Does the person ask follow up questions to you? Do they offer information about themselves?
Does the person seem happy to see you when you interact?

, If you want to meet people who have similar interests as you, you may consider joining a club or a group. These groups contain people who are interested in the same thing and can help you get to know people in a safe, low-stress environment. For people with a tic disorder, it may offer you a more inviting place to meet small groups of like-minded people who may be more accepting of you as a person instead of just as your condition.For example, you may want to join an art club or find a board game meetup. You may also look into intramural sports. Engaging in activities with people with similar interests can help you start building friendships.

, Before you approach someone, think about how you will introduce yourself to him or her. You don't need to do anything fancy to make an introduction. You can simply plan to say something like, ""Hi! My name's Janet. What's yours?""


It can be helpful to ask a question to get a conversation going. Try to think of an open-ended question that you can ask to get the person talking. These are questions that do not result in a short answer. Instead, they get people talking.For example, at a book club meeting, you might plan to ask someone, ""What did you think of the ending?"" or ""How did you like the main character?""

, Before you approach someone it might help to decide if you want to mention your tic disorder or not. This is up to you. You may choose not to mention it, or you may choose to bring it up.


If you decide to mention it, you can say something like, “You might have noticed my tics. I have Tourette’s syndrome…”
You may also decide to make a joke about it or treat it lightly; that may help show the other person it isn’t a big deal.

, Once you have found someone you want to potentially be friends with, you can introduce yourself. Make eye contact and smile. Then tell the person your name.If the other person notices your tic disorder, understand that many people may never have met someone with a tic disorder before, so it may be new for them. That doesn’t mean it bothers them or they won’t like you. It just means the other person, like you, is experiencing something new.
If your tic disorder is apparent when you introduce yourself, like through a verbal outburst or physical tic, make a joke about it, address it, or let the person know that you don't mean to offend but you can't help it because of your tic disorder.

, After you introduce yourself, or if you have already been introduced previously, you can casually ask the other person questions. This is a great way to start a conversation and let the other person know in a subtle way you are interested in talking to and getting to know them. By asking questions and talking to the person, you show that you are interested in being friends with them.Don’t ask too many questions at once. Ask one question at a time, and stick to one or two questions related to the situation you are in.
For example, if you are in class, you may ask, “What did you think of last night’s reading?” or “What did you think about that lecture?” If you are at a club meeting, you might ask about the person’s interest in art or drama, or ask them when they started playing the sport.
Making friends can be a slow process. Start by asking a few questions one day, then leaving the person alone. The next day, ask another question or two. Slowly build a relationship between you and the other person. You want to be able to show the other person that your tic disorder doesn't make you that much different than them.

, Unfortunately, not all people you may want to be friends with will want to be friends, and this holds true for anyone. The person may not be understanding of your tics, which is not your fault. People might not feel comfortable around you, or maybe they are not looking for any new friends, which has nothing to do with your tic disorder. You should notice the way the other person acts to decide whether you should pursue a friendship with them or not.If you ask a few questions and they give you short, clipped one-word answers, the person may be having a bad day, so try the next day. If you try again to have a conversation and the person answers in short, one-word answers or doesn’t respond with any questions of their own, you should try to make friends with another person.Observe people carefully to see how they interact with other people. For instance, that person who gives you short answers could simply be shy, so you might observe that the person communicates like this with everyone. Being observant will help you tell the difference. You could in this case take a softer approach with the person, or you could step back and say something to the person occasionally, or simply smile at the person.
Watch the other person’s body language. Are they making eye contact with you while you talk, or are they on their cell phone? Are they smiling and nodding like they are listening? Are they giving you detailed responses or asking you follow up questions?
You should also notice if the person is genuinely interested or if they act like they are mocking you or being mean to you. If the person seems to be treating you poorly or mocking you, then do not waste your time on this person.

, Some people may notice your tics or be surprised or distracted by them at first, but after they get used to talking to someone with Tourette’s syndrome, they won’t pay attention to them anymore. If you experience this, and the person seems interested in you, then the person is worth pursuing a friendship with. Any person who you like, who seems interested in talking to you, and who is nice is worth being friends with.Even if it takes a few weeks to become friends, as long as the person continues to be nice, interested, and friendly towards you, keep talking to them.
If the person does not seem interested, is unfriendly, or seems annoyed when you speak to them, they are not worth pursuing. If the person seems turned off by your tics, or they seem like they are amused or making fun of you, they are definitely not worth pursuing.

, Because of their own personal issues, people might feel uncomfortable or not understand how to approach you. If you want to make new friends, take the first step in initiating contact with a person you want to be friends with. Not everyone will respond well, but you will never know until you try.


When you talk to the potential new friend, ask them to go see a movie with you, ask if they want to have coffee, find out their phone number or email address so you can talk to them, or just simply say hi. This can help break the ice and let others know that, despite your disorder, you still do the same things that everyone else does.
Start small if you are afraid to make a larger leap at first. You can work up to more direct contact as you become more comfortable with yourself and the act of making friends., If it doesn't work out, that's fine. All people experience rejection from time to time, or even more than that. There are lots of reasons why. By not always placing blame on your tic disorder, you'll learn that not everyone makes connections with other people for many reasons.

, Try to avoid getting attached too quickly to a new friend. Don’t come on too strong or act clingy when you are in the early stages of your friendship. This may upset your new friends or scare them away.


In order to not come on too strong, give your friend space when you first meet them. Make sure you don’t call or text too much so your friend doesn’t get overwhelmed by your presence. Go enjoy a hobby on your own or spend time with your family if you feel like you want to contact your friend too much., If you have been isolating yourself, then getting out more often can help you to encounter more potential friends. You will not be able to make friends if you are not around people. If you want to make new friendships, try your best to get out a little more and socialize. Look for little opportunities to socialize more in your daily routine.


For example, you might just try going to a coffee shop once a week. You could strike up a conversation with someone who you have seen there often by saying something like, “I love this place too. What’s your favorite drink?”
Or you could try visiting a local dog park with your dog and strike up a conversation with another dog owner by saying, “Your dog is beautiful! What’s his/her name?”

, If someone you start getting to know isn’t the kind of friend you want or you don’t get along that well, don’t try to force the friendship to happen. Friendships should feel natural and somewhat easy as the friendship progresses, so if it doesn’t feel right, it’s ok to stop being that person’s friend.


Try to find quality friends who you enjoy being around. You don’t have to have a lot of friends, just a few people who you like spending time with., To make new friends, it is helpful to like yourself and feel confident. This is easier said than done, but you can work with your family and therapist to get to a place where you find yourself worthy.


Tell yourself every day that you are a person worthy of friendship and love.Try saying something like, ""I am a wonderful person and I deserve good friends who care about me.""
If you find this difficult to do, create a list of your positive attributes to read over every day. You can include things like you artistic abilities, your kindness, and your awesome hair. List all of the positive aspects that you can think of and read over this list at least once per day.
You can also make up a personal mantra to remind yourself how great you are, such as ""I'm smart, I'm cool, and nobody has my style."", If you want to meet people who have had similar experiences, look into joining a tic disorder support group.You will be able to meet others with a tic disorder, and you might find that you connect with some of them.


Being around people who understand your experience may also make it easier to relax around the person.

, Having to deal with your own disorder may cause you to feel more compassion for the struggles that other people are facing. Try volunteering for a cause you are passionate about. Not only will you be helping others, but you will also be able to meet people that care about similar things to you.


If you aren’t sure a cause to help, look for opportunities in your area to see if any of them seem interesting.For example, you could volunteer your time at a local homeless shelter, become a dog walker for an animal shelter, or help organize a fundraising event for a good cause.

, Attending public events is a great way to meet people who might become new friends, especially if you attend events that interest you. By talking with people at events that interest you, you will already have something in common that you can bring up.


Start at events where you feel comfortable and relaxed.
Good events to try are gallery openings, art shows, public lectures, music recitals, or book clubs.For example, you might strike up a conversation with another book club member by saying, “I loved this book! What did you think of it?”

, When you work, you are often with the same people while you are there. This is a great place to try to make friends. These people will already know about your tic disorder, so you will not have to help them understand or explain your condition in order for you to be friends. Try to talk to your coworkers more and get to know them.


See if your coworker would like to go for dinner after work or go for a walk in the park at lunchtime.
Don’t let worry or fear get in your way. Your coworker already knows you somewhat since you see them every day. Just make the first step towards being their friend."

If you go into your sleepover already sleep deprived, you will never make it through the night.Make sleep a priority leading up to your sleepover. Do not stay up late playing video games or watching television. Get to bed at a reasonable hour so you're well-rested for school the next day.
Strive for eight to 10 hours of quality sleep each night.If you have trouble getting to bed, try reading a book or doing something else relaxing until you feel tired. Avoid screens, however, as the light emitted from your phone or computer screen can make you more energetic.;
, This can help energize you for your sleepover. The day your friend is coming over, take a nap in the afternoon. This way, when bedtime rolls around, you will not feel as tired., Protein can help boost your energy and endurance. You and your friend should have a healthy, protein rich meal the day you plan to stay up all night.Go for healthy proteins. While pepperoni pizza or a hamburger may sound enticing, these are unlikely to give you needed energy.
Instead, have something like a grilled chicken breast or salmon.
Avoid things like sandwiches or pastas with protein. Too many carbs can make you sleepy.

, The ideal temperature to keep you alert is around 75 °F (24 °C). People tend to sleep better in the cold, so a temperature of around 65 °F (18 °C) degrees may make you tired.If you switch off the air conditioning, this should put your room around 75 °F (24 °C) unless you live in a warm area.
If it's hot outside, try setting your air conditioning to 75 °F (24 °C) to keep the room at an adequate temperature to stay alert.

, You do not want to end up getting bored. This could make you sleepy. Make sure you've got a lot planned for the evening.You can try playing board games, games like Truth or Dare, or telling scary stories.
You can talk online with other friends. Try video chatting with a long distance friend. Lights from electronic screens can keep you alert.Try doing crafts. Browse the Pinterest craft board and see if you have the supplies to make something.

, Dim lights tend to make you sleepy, so keep every light on. Switch on as many lights as possible so both of you stay awake.Your parents may get angry if you keep all the lights on. However, lights closest to your face tend to be the most effective. If your parents do not want you switching on every light downstairs, turn on a desk lamp or another small lamp. You can stay close to this light as you do activities.

, Caffeine reduces the effect of chemicals that make you feel sleepy. You can try drinking coffee, soda, tea, or other beverages that contain caffeine throughout the nigh; however, do not drink caffeine continuously as this can make you crash. Stick to a caffeinated beverage once an hour throughout the night.As sugar can make you sleepy, it's a good idea to stick to diet sodas.

, You may experience junk food cravings if you're sleep deprived. At a slumber party, you may want to indulge a little bit, but don't go overboard. Sugary foods can actually make you sleepier.While sugar can provide a momentary burst of energy, you're likely to crash in a few hours. Candy, energy drinks, and other sugary snacks won't help you stay up all night.
Instead, go for lean protein and healthy carbs. For example, snack on low-fat string cheese, apples and peanut butter, and yogurt.

, Moving around can get your blood pumping. Find a variety of activities that keep you and your friend alert throughout your slumber party.Try something like dancing, playing tag, or playing hide and seek. Anything that gets you moving can help. Do not just watch movies all night.
If you have a backyard, try playing outside a little. Just be careful to take safety precautions. Do not leave your backyard and do not play anywhere where the lighting is dim.

, If you find you're starting to loose steam, give energetic breathing a shot. Keeping your mouth closed, inhale and exhale very quickly through your nose. Try do three cycles of inhaling and exhaling in one second. Do this for no more than 15 seconds. This is a loud exercise and may have you and your friends cracking up, but it should give you a little burst of energy., If you pulled an all-nighter, you will likely be exhausted the next day. While it's not possible to ""catch up"" on sleep loss that is greater than a couple of hours, you will want to work to get back on a regular sleep schedule.Go to bed earlier than normal the day after your sleepover.It may be a bad idea to nap the next day. If you do so, you may have trouble falling asleep at night. This can get you on a poor sleep schedule.

, Much like napping, too much caffeine after an all-nighter can disrupt your sleep. While caffeinated drinks may give you a momentary boost in energy, they're likely to disrupt your sleep at bedtime.If you're struggling to make it through the day without a caffeine boost, limit your intake. Go for one cup of coffee or one soda rather than two or three. Do not drink caffeinated beverages too close to your regular bedtime.

, It's fine to have fun and stay up once in awhile; however, regularly depriving yourself of sleep can have serious consequences. A lack of sleep can reduce your immunity, affect your mental health, and increase your risk of developing health problems like diabetes. Only stay up all night on special occasions. Work on having a healthy sleep schedule overall."

Don't do things you don't like or feel uncomfortable doing. Don't change yourself to please others. It's your life, your choice. You may be happy in the short term when you are able to please someone, but in the long term it is unlikely to work out. Do things that make you feel good about yourself and give meaning to your life. Keep in mind that nobody has the exact same mind and or experience. That's what makes us unique individuals.;

Be a good listener.Being a good friend and showing you care starts with being a good listener.,
Tell them you care.,
Avoid judgments and arguments.Make your friendship one of unconditional positive regard, meaning that you accept and respect them just the way they are.Try not to point out mistakes in your friend, especially if they're distressed.,
Apologize.,
Keep your word.,
Keep in contact with them.",How to Show a Friend That You Care1," Listening to your friend discuss their problems or concerns is a great way to show that you care about them and what they are going through. Being listened to helps people to vent their frustrations, share their feelings, and feel validated and important.


Show you are listening by maintaining eye contact and interested body posture such as leaning forward.
Every once and awhile reflect or repeat back what your friend has told you to show you are listening and make sure you are hearing correctly.Try not to interrupt your friend while they are talking.;
, Sometimes it can be difficult to come out and tell someone you care. Think about how nice it is for you to hear that someone cares about you. Make sure you are making the time to tell your friends just how much they mean to you. If there is something that is concerning you about your friend, talk to them about it as well.Try saying something like the following.


”Hey, just so you know, I'm here for you if you need anything.”
”I hope you know that you are important to me and I care about you.”
”Whatever you are going through, I'm here if you need me.”

, That will only make matters worse and your care might be taken as criticism.


In addition to avoiding judgments, you should support them during difficult times or in efforts to change or improve. Show them you care by providing supportive suggestions if they ask.

, Apologizing is an essential aspect of showing someone you care.Even if you are not at fault you can still apologize to your friend. If it is an argument between the two of you, think about what is more valuable to you. Is your need to win the argument or your friendship more important?Apologizing shows your friend you care about your relationship and that they are more important to you than an argument.

, It can be difficult to show your friend that you care if you cannot be true to your word. If you go back on your word your friend is going to get the message that they are not important enough for you to keep a promise to, and that can cause damage to your relationship.Consider the importance of keeping your word in the following situations.


If you agree to do something or be somewhere, make sure you stick to your word.
If your friend is relying on you for something, make sure you are there for them.
If you make a promise, keep it.

, It can be really easy for you to get wrapped up in your own life, between school, work, and/or family. But taking the time for a quick phone call or a sweet text message is a great way to maintain contact. This is especially important for friends who are not local.


For example, you could draft a text that says. ""Hey! We've been super busy this week, but I wanted to let you know that I'm thinking about you. Call you this weekend!""
Or, you could call them while you're walking between classes and leave a quick voicemail saying that you'll call back at another time, but you miss them and are excited to talk with them again.

Look your friends up on social media.Today, the simplest, most direct way to find someone is usually via social media.,
Try a search engine query.,
Get in contact with mutual acquaintances.,
Contact your school or alumni organization.,
Use a public database.,
Attend reunions.,
Consider using a paid ""where are they now?"",
Keep in mind that women may have new names post-marriage.,
Send a warm, inviting initial message.,
Plan a low-key get-together.,
Invite your friend to upcoming events.,
Introduce your old friend to your new friends.,

Don't make assumptions about your friends' opinions.,
When in doubt, ask questions.,
If you're old enough, ease tensions with a drink.",How to Reconnect With Old Friends," Almost all social media sites will allow you to search for users by name. If you you find your friend and he has a public profile, reaching out is fairly simple — all you need to do is send a message with the in-network messaging service. Popular networks to start looking on are Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Google+, and Ello. Nearly one in four people used a social network in 2013, so there's a good chance you'll find your long lost friend on at least one.If you can't find your friend by name, try searching for your old school or workplace and going through the list of people who have ""liked"" or commented on it. Your friend may have a social media connection to these sorts of pages.;
, If you can't find your old friend on social media, an online search engine is a good place to go as your next step. These sites will allow you to find pages on the internet on which your friend's name appears.


A good strategy to use here is to put your friend's name in quotes when you type it into the search bar, like this: ""Jane Doe."" This usually makes the search engine look for pages where the first name and last name appear in sequence, rather than appearing separately anywhere on the page.
You can also try adding names of people and places your friend is associated with to narrow your results, like this: ""Jane Doe"" ABC High School Idaho Smith Industries.

, If you can't find your friend, someone else will. Try calling someone who used to know your friend — this can be a mutual acquaintance, an old boss or teacher, a fellow employee, or, if you're very tactful, an ex. Even if these people don't know how to get in touch with your old friend, they may be able to get you on the right track by giving you your friend's last known whereabouts.

, Most high schools and colleges keep track of their alumni students after graduation — often, they'll try to keep an up-to-date address and phone number for the purpose of soliciting donations and informing alumni of upcoming functions. Try contacting your friend's old school and asking for current information, especially if your friend was previously very active in school life. Note, however, that the alumni office may not be willing to give you precise contact information for privacy reasons.

, Believe it or not, many free public records and databases are available online. You might, for instance, try using a site like publicrecords.searchsystems.net, which allows you to search for court rulings, liens, eviction records and more for free.If you can't find what you're looking for, you might also try contacting the city hall or municipal government where your friend last lived, though this method is likely to be slower.


Another quick, easy way to search online databases is to use Pipl.com. This site has a simple-to-use database — simply type in your friend's name and place of residence and you can receive results in a few seconds., Most schools will host class reunions fairly often — usually at least every five years or so, but often much more frequently. If the school you and your old friend went to has an upcoming reunion, don't miss it. Even if you don't find your friend, you'll probably run into someone who may be able to clue you in on where to look.


You might also try going to your school's homecoming events, which usually occur in the fall at the start of the school year. These events, which can include sporting events, parties, dances for the students, and so on, are usually billed as an open invitation for old students to attend, so feel free to grab some friends and head over!

, service. If all else fails, spending a little money can help you find old friends that can't be found normally. Anything from a private investigator to an online veteran's service like Vetfriends.com may be able to put you in touch with someone from your past who's seemingly fallen off the grid. Note, however, that these sorts of services usually charge some sort of fee — in the case of a private investigator, this fee may be substantial. For this reason, it's usually best to exhaust the free options above before spending any of your hard-earned cash.

, During your search, don't forget that it's very common for women to take their husband's last name after they get married. While many women today choose to keep their original last name, most still do not, so be aware of this possibility.


Though scientific data on the subject varies, there's no doubt that adopting the husband's last name is still the route that most women take today. One study found that a little more than 60% of women who get married in their 20s take their husband's surname and that older age groups were significantly more likely to do so., Once you find your friend, take the bold leap of reaching out! Call, text, email, or even write a letter — it's up to you. Just don't put the task off for too long or you may risk losing the opportunity when their life situation changes or they move.


If you're on social media, you may want to send them a short personal message like this:



""Hi there! It's been such a long time. I hope you remember me — we were in Smith Hall together back in college. Anyway, I just got back in town and was looking to reconnect. Let me know if you're interested in getting coffee! Talk to you later.""




On the other hand, if you've found someone in the real world, you can afford to be a little more involved with your message. Here's a short sample letter you might want to use as a guideline for postal correspondences or emails — note the instructions in parentheses:



""Dear (Name),
It's been so long since I last saw you. How are you? I hope things are going well with you. The last time I was with you was on graduation — remember how hot it was and how badly we were sweating in our robes? (You can replace this with your own anecdote as you wish.) After that, things were so hectic that I never got a proper chance to say goodbye, even though I knew I was going to miss you. Well, I've decided to remedy that. I'm back in town and looking to reconnect. Give me a call at (your number) if you'd like to get coffee sometime! I'd really enjoy it.
Best,
(Your name)""





, If you haven't seen your friend in quite a long time, there's always the chance that you two simply won't get along like you used to. You may, for instance, have developed different opinions and personalities in the time you've been apart that make it difficult for things to be like they once were. Because this unfortunate scenario is always a possibility, make your first meetup a casual one. Getting coffee, drinks, or a meal can be a great low-commitment scenario — if you get along great, you can do something together afterwards, but if you don't, you can leave after an hour or so without embarrassment.


You may also want to have a ""plan B"" in mind in case things go especially well at your initial get-together. For instance, you may want to look up the address of the old bowling alley you used to frequent prior to meeting your old friend. If you hit it off, you can head over after your coffee!

, If your initial reconnection goes well, you can probably start inviting your old friend back into your life. One easy way to do this is to ask him to attend events with you that you'd be going to anyway. This way, you're virtually guaranteed to have fun because the event is something you'd enjoy regardless of who's with you. Plus, since you'll feel at ease doing familiar things, you should have an easy striking up casual conversations with your old friend.

, As you start inviting your old friend to do things with you, it's almost unavoidable that he'll eventually meet your new friends. Don't be afraid of this! Let it happen naturally. As you do, make it clear to both your new friends and the old friend that you're not ""playing favorites"" by making sure not exclude anyone from the conversation.


A good policy in situations like these is to tell both groups of friends about each others' interests before they meet each other. This way, they'll have some easy topics of conversation available: ""So, I hear you're into pottery?""
Keep in mind, however, that some of your new friends may not necessarily like your old friend right away. Since they don't have any shared experiences, they'll have less of a personal connection. This is OK — your friends don't have to like each other for you to like them.

, In the words of the late, great James Gandolfini, ""'Remember when' is the lowest form of conversation.""It's perfectly fine to reminisce about the good old day when you reconnect with an old friend. However, after a while, it's important to start planning fun things to do together in the future. Don't let your relationship with your old friend be defined by your past — if you do, you'll eventually end up bored with each other or even frustrated that you don't have more to say.

, If you didn't part with your old friend on the best of terms, you'll probably want to address this fairly soon — ideally, the very first time you reconnect.Pretending that your painful memories don't exist is a bad choice. Doing this can give the impression that you don't care about your friend's hurt feelings, or, worse, that you're deliberately ignoring them, so swallow your pride and openly acknowledge any tension early on.


If, after your time apart, you've decided that you were partially or completely to blame for your painful split, offer your sincere apology. If you don't believe you were at fault, simply acknowledge your desire to move on with a few words like this: ""Hey, I know the last time we saw each other we weren't on the best of terms. I was hoping we could put all that behind us and start fresh.""

, Be wary of immediately returning to your previous level of intimacy with your old friend. Keep in mind that your friend may not have the same plans in mind for your reunion as you do — he, for instance, may only be interested in a brief, one-time meal together while you're seriously trying to restart your friendship. It's best not to get too invested in your reunion before it happens. Instead, approach it with an optimistic but calm attitude. This way, no matter how your reunion goes, you won't end up feeling hurt and disappointed.

, To avoid an embarrassing faux pas, be careful not to bring up controversial topics until you have an idea of where your friend stands on them. Keep in mind that even if these topics were at one point the topic of frequent conversation between you two, they may not be today. People — even people close to you — can have their opinions shaped and molded by their experiences until they barely resemble what they once were. Below are just a few topics you'll want to avoid until you get a chance to ""feel out"" your friend:


Religion
Politics
Hot-button news topics
Money
Negative gossip about mutual friends
The opposite sex

, Finding it difficult to come up with things to say to your old friend? Just try asking him about what he's been up to since you've last seen him. When he answers, ask questions about his answers. As a general rule, most people like to talk about themselves — psychological studies have shown that people spend the majority of the time they spend communicating talking about themselves, rather than others.Below are just a few sample questions you may want to try asking:


Where have you been working or attending school recently?
How are things with the guys/ladies?
How is the family?
Can you help me with this problem I've been thinking about?
Read any good books lately?

, A responsible amount of alcohol can usually take the edge out of awkward social situations. Thus, if you and your old friend are of age, consider having an alcoholic beverage or two to calm the jitters that can come with making a connection with an old buddy. With luck, after a drink or two, you'll feel loose, friendly, and ready to have a great time!


Whenever alcohol is involved, it's important to drink responsibly. See our responsible drinking guide for more information and remember to never, ever drink and drive.

Remember important dates.,
Perform acts of kindness.,
Hug them.,
Give them something of yours.,
Anticipate their needs.",How to Show a Friend That You Care2," There are countless small things you can do to show you are thinking about someone or that you care about them.

Create something handmade and give it to them.
Cook dinner for them or offer to take them out if they've had a rough day.
Send them a text saying that they crossed your mind and that you hope they are having a good day.

, It is important to remember dates that are cause for celebration for your friend, such as their birthday or anniversary. Remembering days or dates that are important to your friend can also help show you care. Remembering these dates allow you to be able to check-in with your friend more often on days that might be emotional for them. Try and recognize dates such as the following.


The anniversary date of a loved one's passing may be very difficult for them.
Dates of important doctors appointments or surgeries may cause them anxiety or stress.
Dates of large presentations at school or work can be celebrated after.

, Going a little out of your way to be kind to your friend can communicate a lot to them. Open doors for your friend, offer to help bring in the groceries, or help change the baby's diaper. If you are hanging out and you are getting up, ask if they need anything.Anything that shows you are thinking about them and wanting to make their life easier can show that you care.

, Physical contact such as touching someone's arm when they are upset or giving them a hug can communicate affection in a simple and direct way.Hug each other as a hello and goodbye, or throw an arm around your friends shoulder when you are congratulating them. Make sure that you are operating within your comfort zone as well as your friend's. If you know they do not like to be touched then respect that.

, Sharing your life with your friend sends the message that you care enough to include them in your world. Share something with them like a family tradition, or an object that means something special to you. Explain to them the story behind what you are sharing with them and how important it is to you.


In addition to sharing your life with your friend, you should also be prepared to make sacrifices for your friend in times of need. For example, if your friend is struggling you might want to cancel social plans in order to be with them.

, If you know your friend really well, you might be able to tell what your friend needs without having to ask or be asked. Think about what's going on in your friend's life and try to anticipate what they want and need from you as a friend. This requires being in-the-know with your friend, so staying current on their life is a prerequisite.


For example, if your friend had an interview, offer to call and chat about it to process what happened (or offer to do so at happy hour that evening!).
Or, if you know your friend had a stressful week, ask them if they want to get brunch and pedicures over the weekend.

Communicate concern.,
Ask how you can help.,
Find resources.,
Show devotion.",How to Show a Friend That You Care3," If your friend experiences a difficult time, a tragedy, a loss, or a crisis, they will need a friend like you who cares. Notice if your friend is going through something and communicate your concern to them.It may be difficult to know what to say and it may depend on the situation or what they are going through. Try the following.


”I don't know what to say, but I'm here for you.”
”I'm so sorry you have to go through this. I'm worried about you.”
”I'm a little concerned about you because...”

, Communicating your concern shows your friend you are present in your friendship and notice when something is wrong. Take it one step further and ask how you can help or what you can do for them.Recognize that they are going through something challenging and the best way you can show you care is to be present for them in whatever might be helpful.Try asking the following.


”I've noticed some changes lately. Can you tell me what's been going on?”
”I want to help. What can I do?” or something more specific such as ""Can I pick up groceries for you?""
”This has to be so hard. What do you need right now?”
”Do you want to talk about it?”

, Depending on the type of crisis or event, and your friend's support system, you may be able to show you care by looking for resources for them.If your friend is suffering with grief from a lost loved one, find local support groups or counseling services. If your friend had a fire in their apartment offer for them to stay with you. Depending on the situation, it may help your friend to have someone to help them navigate afterwards.


It may additionally be helpful to offer assistance with any responsibilities and duties they may have following a crisis. If your friend is resistant, suggest you do it together., Whether it's medical problems, failures, work issues, or relationship difficulties, you can always show devotion by showing perseverance. Offer your support now and make sure they know you will be by their side in the future.Not being there for your friend, during a crisis or a time when they need you the most, communicates a lack of devotion to the friendship.


Show your devotion by visiting them, sending a card, or leaving a note.
If others are coming down on them for whatever reason, stand by them.
Even if you don't know what to say or do, just be there. If they need you, you won't be far away.

Be able to trust your friends.,
Consider comfort.,
Consider the touch barrier.,
Think about loyalty.,
Look at how you fight.,
Consider how you insult each other.,
Think about nicknames.,
Consider your inside jokes.",How to Recognize a True Friend," You should be able to trust a true friend and they should return this trust. Does your friend confide in you? Tell you secrets that no one else knows? Let you share secrets? Ask you for advice? These are sure signs that your friend trusts you. However, if your friend hides things from you and acts secretive, this could be a sign that they do not trust you, but it could also mean your friend keeps to themselves or doesn't like to reveal too much about themselves. Of course, we all need a friend who we can be confident in confiding in. People who trust are usually trustworthy people themselves.;
, How comfortable is your friend when they are around you? Watch them, are they being themselves or are they timid around you? Are they acting fake - perhaps hiding an insecurity? True friendships can take a while to develop, but if your friend is true they should feel comfortable around you, and vice versa.

, This is not meant in a romantic way, but consider whether your friend is comfortable with touching you. If your friend is fine with hugging you, leaning on you, resting their head on your shoulder, and so forth, then you can be almost certain they love you in a platonic way and are, therefore, a true friend.


If your friend shies away from physical contact, there are various reasons for it. They may not be comfortable around you yet, they may be insecure or shy, they may dislike touch, and so forth. It varies among people.

, True friends are always there for one another. If you are in need of a helping hand, your true friends should be there to offer it to you. True friends do not ""backstab"" and do not try to get one another into trouble. You should be able to trust a friend with anything, knowing that they will be by your side. During a fight, a true friend will remain loyal and will not reveal your secrets.

, Nearly all best friends fight, so if you and your friend have a little dispute, don't sweat it! True friends will remain faithful and find their way through a fight, no matter what the size. They will not tell each other's secrets and they still care about each other. If you have found yourself a true friend, it should be easier to sort out your differences and move on from a fight (depending on the severity of the fight).

, Some friends enjoy insulting or teasing each other in a friendly way. If you and your friend ""insult"" each other without either of you feeling offended, then they may be a true friend. If you insult your friend in a playful way, they should know that you are not serious - this comes under trust. (Keep in mind, however, that not all friends do this.)

, A lot of close friends love to give each other nicknames! If your friend is giving you nicknames, this is a great sign - it shows they care enough to actually think of one for you. If you are given a nickname, try to think up one for your friend in return - nicknames should come naturally. Think of the nickname your friend has given you. Does it suit you well? If so, this shows your friend must know you quite well and is a good sign.


If your nickname isn't such a great one or is insulting, be sure to let your friend know if you are offended.

, Best friends usually have a never-ending list of inside jokes. An inside joke shows that you share a special connection with your friend that others don't. It also shows that you have enough fun and spend enough time with your friend to develop such jokes. An inside joke should be between the two of you, and should also be a cherished memory.

Understand the squabbles and disputes among groups of young people are common.,

We all choose our friends, but school situations don't give you many people to choose from so it's fairly likely that you will fall out at some stage.
, Make sure not to talk so much that they can accuse you of talking too much. Talk to them about interesting topics but talk less. If possible, end the conversation with a curious statement. If you can do this, then the chances are, they may want to continue the conversation with you and this time you are not the one who wants to be around them, but the opposite.


If you speak less, then you don't seem irritating, because people find overly talkative people annoying at times.

, Being touchy-feely is when you make physical contact with people too often or in an inappropriate way that they, or people around are uncomfortable with. Sometimes, people don't like being touched by someone whom they find annoying.

, If they're not interested in having you around much, then they're not worth it. Don't appear uninvited in front of them. If you used to do this before and you got rude statements in return from them to stay away etc., stop being with them.


Value your self respect and know your worth. Don't allow anyone to insult you.

, You may do this by moving here and there in your break time, reading an interesting book, by listening to music etc. This may keep you engaged and you won't feel the need to be around them as much.

, If you find them online, ignore the fact that they are online. If they're interested in talking to you, let them start chatting first.

, It's hard to miss someone who is always around, so try to disappear as often as possible when it is break time, as listed above. Don't use the social networking sites for communicating with your friends if you want them to miss you.

, Now it's really the time to move on and stop caring about such people who don't value you.


Make new friends and stay busy with them and you'll totally forget those people.

, This can be hard, but don't be afraid to skip over certain people. Before you scribble down a name out of instinct, here are a few things to consider:

Do you trust this person?
Does this person live close to the general area your potluck will be?
Is there any tension between this person and another desired guest?
Does this person have good table manners? (For a potluck especially)
Has this person caused trouble at parties or potlucks before? (If you're unsure, question their friends.)

, For the place, make a list of ideas. Look at a map of your town. Get recommendations from former potluck hosts. Make sure there's enough room for everyone there. Most people throw potlucks at their home, parks, community centers, schools, and churches, but there are far more options than those few. For date and time, write an informal email to guests to get idea for when they're free. Think about yourself, too. When are you free?, That means:

Decoration. Think about the theme. Choose pictures and colors by the theme or the season. Also think about the location. Does the person who owns it allow décor?
Tables and chairs. map out a plan for it. Leave space for dancing and chatting if applicable.
Music. Again consider the theme. Consider using something like Pandora and Rhapsody. Make a playlist ahead of time or plan for someone to perform at the party.

, Here's a good format:

What: Potluck
Who: Hostess, Guest of Honor
Why: What you're celebrating
When: Day and Time
Where: Location

Be in a good mood.,
Be comfortable and have enough sleep.,
Think first.,
Don’t exaggerate.,
Say impossible things, avoid overdoing it.,
Compare.,
Fart.,
Seek for ugly and funny things.,
Use your enemy’s name as your joke by comparing it with something you want.",How to Make a Friend Laugh," Who wants to be happy if you are lonely or even angry? If you plan to have some fun with your friend and you want him/her to laugh or you want to make a joke for him/her to laugh, make sure you are in good mood. It is your friend wants to be cheered, not you.;
, Enough rest will help you think properly. Funny jokes are sometimes difficult to produce in mind if you are having stressful and have rested less than your preferred time of sleep. Don’t think of some other things that will destruct your mind so that you can think well of the jokes you want to say with your friend.

, Before you start to speak or make a funny joke, think first. You will make him/her laugh not make him/her angry.

, If you tend to make joke through gestures, don’t make yourself a clown. He/she will call you crazy and may even get rid from you the next time you will ask her/him to go with you and worst is he/she will never talk to you again. Some people don’t want to have a crazy friend.

, It is a joke so it is understood that it is not true. You can say anything unbelievable but make sure your friend will like your joke. Example, you may start your joke by saying “I saw a monster this morning, I was really terrified!” she will then ask you “Really? Where?”. Then, you will say “In the mirror and I almost break it until I realized that it was me”.

, When you are in a public place and there are many people around, you may use them as part of your jokes but make sure that you pick also a funny one to compare. Example, you say “Do you see that guy over there?” then she ask “Yeah, why?”, you will reply “If he faces left, he looks like my father and if he faces right he looks like my uncle but if he faces front, well, I don't know!” Your friend will then surely ask who will be the next person you will be mentioning. This is the best answer for your friend “My girlfriend”. It is best if your friend has not yet seen your girlfriend or does not know that you already have one for him/her to picture it out. Try to imagine that you have a girlfriend whose face is the same as your father.

, This maybe crazy but you can still use this as one of your jokes. For example, if your friend talks so much and you are starting to get tired of listening, this is the best way to do it without saying anything that you don’t want to listen to his/her stories anymore. Just say immediately “Shh, keep quiet, do you hear that sound?”. She will then ask “What sound?” and then release that air within you but make sure it will make a sound or else nothing happens.

, There are lots of things in the surroundings you can use as your subjects. You may compare it to something or someone that your friend also knew but make sure you know where to put your limits because sometimes it will just be offensive.

, However, make sure your friend also doesn’t like your enemy or your friend is not your enemy’s friend or else you will be your friend’s enemy. Example, If your enemy is a big hairy guy then you can start making your joke like this “Have you gone to the zoo?” and your friend answers “yes” then you will add “have you seen that big gorilla there?” and she replies “of course”, you then add “you know its name?”, if she says “no” put an end by saying “his name is (your enemy’s name) and now I know where he is having his part time job!”.

Have circles of friends.,
Choose your friends wisely, especially the ones that will have good influences on you.,
Join clubs or activities you enjoy.",How to Make Long Term Friends1," This mean reaching out to different kinds of people, including preps, band members, nerds, etc. As a result, other students will see you as an open person who accepts others for who they are. Spend a healthy amount of time with each group so that you don't lose your friends.;
, This is best achieved by establishing friendships with your friends' friends. Don't hesitate to introduce yourself and talk to them. Always have a select few that you can trust the most.

, Surrounding yourself with people you love is a good step towards having strong friendships. Remember that people aren't always who they say they are. Never place your complete trust in someone until he or she has earned it well.

, This will increase your chances of meeting someone with similar interests. The chances of friendship lasting long between people who share common interests or passions is high.

Have a neat appearance and good hygiene.,
Smile at the people to show that you are approachable.,
Always introduce yourself before you ask others for their names.,
Start a short conversation, touching upon popular topics.",How to Make Long Term Friends2," This is important since some people approach you based on your looks. If you seem clean and tidy, your classmates won't hesitate to talk to you.

, It'll help her/him feel more comfortable when talking to you. It'll also show that you are a friendly person.

, That way people will trust you and not look at you as some stalker.

Be a peacemaker.,
Keep your friends' secrets.",How to Make Long Term Friends3," If two of your close friends are fighting, remain neutral. Avoid taking any sides because you may lose their trust. If possible, calm them down and have them both tell their sides of the story. Do your best to work out a good solution that benefits both friends.


If the fight is worse than you can handle, ask your friends to talk to a trusted adult or teacher. They may be able to resolve the situation better than you can.
Avoid getting involved in their fights with other friends. While you may be willing to help, you aren't obligated to solve your friends' problems. Don't push yourself into situations that are bigger than you can handle. Keep your distance until they can resolve it among themselves.

, If they tell you any secrets, keep it to yourself. You do not have the right to tell a person's secrets to others without their permission. This will result in the loss of your friend's trust.

Ask your friend ahead of time for tips.,
Introduce yourself politely.,
Address them by their proper title.,
Dress appropriately for the situation.,
Hold a conversation with them.,
Talk about your successes if asked.",How to Make a Good Impression on a Friend's Parents1," Before you meet your friend’s parents, try to learn a little about them so that you can avoid accidentally offending them. Ask your friend what you can do to make a good first impression on their parents.If their parents disapprove of a certain hobby, avoid bringing it up. For example, if they dislike skateboarding, don’t mention that you have a skateboard. Instead, discuss your other hobbies.
If their parents like something, on the other hand, you can find a way to bring it into conversation. For example, if their dad was a musician, you can say, “I heard you used to be in a band. That’s so interesting. Do you have any cool stories?”;
, When meeting them, smile, and offer your right hand for a firm handshake. Tell them your name. If you’d like, you can also tell them how you know their child or what you will be doing.For example, you can say, ""Hi there, Mr. Mann. I'm Grace. Kayla and I have been working on our science project for a few days now. We'll just be upstairs, working. It's nice to meet you!""
Remember to smile. Avoid slouching or crossing your arms when meeting them.

, Never call the parents by their first name. Instead, refer to them by their last time and a title such as Mr. Smith, Mrs. Garcia, or Dr. Robertson. This will demonstrate that you are polite and respectful.Sometimes their parents may tell you to call them by their first name or a nickname. If they give you the OK to do this, feel free to call them by the other name.

, No matter where you’re meeting them, it should be right for the situation. For example, if you meet them at a nice restaurant, you might want to wear slacks or a dress, but if you're meeting them at a pool party, a bathing suit is acceptable.Make sure that your clothes are clean and unwrinkled. Remember to brush your hair.
If you know your friend’s parents like them to dress a certain way, you might want to copy that style. For example, if they don’t like tank tops, make sure to wear a shirt with sleeves.

, Your friend’s parents may ask you about your family, hobbies, home, or schoolwork. As long as you are comfortable with the subject, engage them in conversation. If they share something about themselves, act interested by asking questions.Avoid talking about politics, religion, or other touchy subjects, as you might accidentally offend their parents.If they ask you how you are, answer politely, and ask them back in return. Avoid one-word answers like “fine” or “OK.” Instead, answer with full sentences. You can say, “I’m doing pretty well today. How are you?”

, Some parents may try to interview you to see if you are a good influence on their child. Avoid talking about any bad habits, failures, or vices that you may have. Instead, focus on your positive qualities.

For example, you may be asked what you do for a living. If you don’t have a job, you can say something like, “I’m still looking for a job. I’ve had some positive leads recently, so fingers crossed!”
Be honest when answering, but frame things in a positive light. For example, if they ask how you are doing in a particular class, you can say, “I’m not the best at history. Algebra, on the other hand, is my favorite subject.”

"
"
Agree to their rules.,
Ask for permission before doing things.,
Compliment their home.,
Practice good table manners.,
Write them a thank you note after special events.",How to Make a Good Impression on a Friend's Parents2," You may be informed about certain rules in the house while you are visiting. While you are there, follow these rules as best as you can. Ask if you're uncertain about something.

Watch to see if people remove their shoes inside of the house. If you're unsure, you can ask, ""Should I take my shoes off?""
Avoid commenting on the rules while you are in their home. Don’t say anything like, “I don’t understand why we need to be so quiet. It’s not like we’re bothering anyone.”

, Be sure to ask for permission before getting a drink, helping yourself to a snack, or leaving to do something. This will show their parents that you respect their home and boundaries. It will make them think you are responsible and polite.You can say, ""Mr. Phillips, Kayla and I would like to go to the park for a few minutes. Is that alright with you?""
You do not need to ask permission to use the bathroom, but you may want to ask where it is so that you do not accidentally walk into the wrong room. You can say, ""Can you show me where the restroom is?""

, When you visit your friend for the first time, you may want to say something nice about their home. Make sure that these compliments are sincere. For example, you can admire their garden or say something nice about their decorations.For example, you can say, “Mrs. Jones, you have such a lovely home. I really like your paintings. Where did you get them?”
Avoid giving too many compliments or they may seem insincere.

, If you are having a meal with your friend’s family, make sure that you are polite at the table as well. Ask them if you can help set the table. Wait to eat until everyone has been served or until the parents have started eating.The family may say a prayer or blessing before they eat. Even if you do not share their religious beliefs, bow your head in silence until it is finished.
Try a little of everything that they serve. If you are allergic or have dietary restrictions, tell them before dinner so that they can try to accommodate you.
Sit straight in your seat. Avoid slouching or putting your elbows on the table. Do not use your phone at the table.

, If your friend’s parents have done a big favor for you—such as buy you dinner or let you stay over for a few days—write them a brief thank you note. This can be a handwritten letter or an email. Write a few sentences thanking them for their hospitality, and let them know how much you enjoyed their company.For example, you can write, “Thank you so much for taking Sarah and me to the zoo last weekend. I had a great time, and I really love being around your family. I am looking forward to our next adventure. Best wishes, Oliver.”

"
"
Apologize if you have made a mistake.,
Speak politely on the phone.,
Offer your contact information if you want.,
Watch what you post on social media.,
Be a good friend to their child.",How to Make a Good Impression on a Friend's Parents3," Sometimes you may accidentally offend their parents or break a rule. Try not to sweat it. Instead, offer a sincere apology to their parents. You can even explain your mistake if you choose.For example, you can say, “I’m so sorry for keeping Jessica out so late. I didn’t realize what time it was. It won’t happen again. I promise.”

, If you are calling your friend’s home, you may sometimes reach their parents or an answering machine instead. Be sure to state your name and who you’re calling for before politely asking if you can talk to your friend.If you reach a parent, you can say, “Hi, it’s John. Can I speak to Justin please?”
If you reach an answering machine, you can leave a message like, “Hello, this is John Pollman. I’m calling Justin about our homework. If he could please call me back, I’d appreciate it. Thanks.”

, If you feel comfortable, give them your phone number, and mention where you live. Be sure to let them know they can call you anytime you are with your friend. This will make you seem trustworthy. It may also give the parent peace of mind when you are out with your friend.


You can say, ""I live on Oakwood Street, Mrs. Gillman. Here, would you like my number?""

, You never know who might be watching on social media. Many parents monitor or watch their children’s accounts. Make sure that there is nothing on the page that could embarrass you. Never post embarrassing pictures of you or your friend.Avoid pictures of you and your friend drinking or doing reckless activities.
Ask your friend for permission before tagging them in photographs.
Do not use curse words or other offensive language online where your friend's parent might see it.

, When you’re around their parents, treat your friend nicely and respectfully. Even when the parents aren’t watching, remember that your friend may tell them about you. If their parents know that their child trusts you, they may trust you as well.

You may have inside jokes or nicknames that your friend understands but which may seem offensive to their parents. Avoid using these in front of the parents.
If you treat your friend poorly, your friend may tell their parents about this. This can affect their parent’s opinion of you, even if you make up with your friend.

Look around the house to see what you already have.,
Choose whether you want to theme the package or not.,
Take a look at your gathered care package in a nice pile.,
Wrap your package carefully.",How to Make a Care Package for a Sick Friend," Think of the person, their age, the circumstances they need a pleasant distraction from, and what will most comfort and delight them. Things like a giant Hershey chocolate bar with almonds, or chicken noodle soup packets, some nice pamper products bought a while ago, like shower gel, peppermint foot lotion, purse sized packages of tissues, and lip balm! Good eats include packs of gum, a package of popcorn, a nice mug stuffed with packets of instant apple cider or hot cocoa. Puzzles, gourmet tea packets, cold medicine, soda crackers, inspirational “Get Well” quotes, Goldfish, Dole Fruit Bowls, Get Well “pills” (candy coated mints), and a nice get well card. All these are wonderful spring boards! More personal items could be the book you just finished that you couldn't put down, the awesome football game you recorded- slap it on a blank DVD- or a great movie! Write or type up memories of the person, if you have time. Cut off each & roll up, then tie or tape them up. Tell them to open one a day, like a fortune cookie! Have a small photo album from the $1 store? Fill it with pictures of you and your friend, or funny things that will cheer them: cartoons, inside jokes, memories, etc. Write either a lovely, or goofy, poem. You can employ all kinds of crazy-awesome things that are free! Doing these may take a little time, but if that's what it takes to touch a heart, so be it!;
, Looking at what you've collected, see if there could be a theme with those items. A theme can be fun, but being thought of- even if it's a bunch a random stuff with no point but to cheer you- is always delightful! Theme ideas can be based on their sickness, what you think will help them feel better, or just something they are crazy about. You can put together a pamper package for a girl, a movie night or football/sports package for a boy, or man. Some good themes are the straight up Get Well, Make 'em Laugh (all things funny), Hawaiian, Fiesta, Spa Day, Hygiene Kit (make sure you include a new toothbrush and TP), Big Kid (whoopie cushion, crayons and color book, balloons, frisbee, marbles, sidewalk chalk and silly string), Romance (flowers, chocolates, homemade coupons for kisses, hugs and help with chores), Serviceman or Student away from home (backyard dirt or grass clippings in a baggie, pillowcase sprayed with cologne or perfume- anything that smells like home- and candy or fudge you make at holidays). You get the picture. Dream up your own theme, but most important is find what will do your friend the most good, be comforting, help them get better, and feel loved. Still idea-less? this may seem like a desperate measure to some, but you might consider praying to know, or meditating about, what to give them. See what come to your mind! Sometimes this yields the most remarkable, surprising results if you have just a little faith!

, Two things now need to be decided: first, do you want to package, decorate, or wrap any individual items- and second, what container will be just big enough that your goodies fit, but still look abundant?

, Wrapping items can be overdone, so just adorn one or two, unless the point is to have them unwrap everything for fun! You can also put things like a tube of lotion, cookies, or a Christmas ornament in small cellophane bags. Tie with a ribbon or raffia, a metallic bread tie, new shoe laces if it's a shoehorn, or even dental floss if it's a new toothbrush! Let your mind go wild! Print a photo and a little message on cardstock and wrap it around a giant candy bar. Lots of you have scrapbook paper from before you went digital. Use these colorful, printed papers in your packages to wrap items, make thoughtful, homemade cards, and use scraps to band around items like a bar of fine soap, and tie raffia over top. If you don't have time, it's still good. Finding a container: if you have just a few small things- a tea bag, a Chapstick, a $1 store necklace- go to your closet, the $1 Store or Variety Store to find a small treasure box. Here is a trick- if your basket, bowl, bag, decorative or plain box, or kidney shaped bed pan is too big, here is what you do. Just take some colored paper/ Sunday paper funnies, and wad it up as a base for your items. Or buy some sparkly shredded tinsel used in gift bags, or use a small, clean throw pillow or make a custom pillow if you sew, or a little throw blanket at the bottom to take up space. If the extra mile is desired, wrap the whole deal in a cellophane bag/wrap and tie at the top. In your collection of things to give, are there odd shapes- like a rolled up poster, or a basketball? Just find a big enough container, and work it!! Be a little creative. Anyone can come up with something, and if it looks disastrous, well, consider the person you are giving it to. If it is your best friend who has a great sense of humor- he/she will adore your vulnerability. If it is your somewhat critical neighbor, boss, mother-in-law (they get a bad rap, but most are just lovely), then get a creative thinker to help you get your own ""out of the box"" juices flowing.

Treat your friends as you would want to be treated.",How to Pursue Friendship if You Suffer from Social Anxiety Disorder," If your social anxiety is holding you back and preventing you from living the kind of life you want, your first step in changing things should be to start working with a therapist. A professional therapist can help you understand the reasons behind your social anxiety and customize a treatment plan to help you overcome your symptoms.Some people are prescribed medications to help reduce their anxiety, but this is not the right option for everyone.
Your therapist may also recommend techniques to help you combat anxiety, such as deep breathing exercises, during which you will focus all of your attention on your breathing, so that you stop thinking about the source of your anxiety.;
, Low self-esteem is often a big hurdle for people who have social anxiety disorder. If this is the case for you, you may feel that you are not worthy of friends, that others perceive you as boring, or that others judge you for your social ""mistakes."" In order to overcome these thoughts, you must recognize them as a symptom of your anxiety, and not reality.If you find yourself having these thoughts, try repeating a positive thought silently to yourself. The thought can be something general like, ""I am awesome and deserve great friends"" or something specific like, ""It's no big deal that they didn't laugh at my joke.""

, Try creating a list of all of the social situations that make you anxious and rank them in order of least uncomfortable to most uncomfortable. Then start exposing yourself to each item on the list, one by one. Taking small, incremental steps will make it much easier to eventually face your biggest fears.
You can start as small as you want. For example, the first item on your list may be making eye contact with the cashier at a grocery store or saying hello to the mailman.

, As you begin conquering some of your fears, it's a good idea to keep challenging yourself by creating new goals for yourself based on what you want to ultimately achieve. This will not only help you continue making progress, but it will also keep you motivated because you will constantly be accomplishing something.These goals can be more specific versions of the items on your list of fears. For example, if you said hello to two strangers yesterday, you could make it a goal to say hello to three strangers today.
Be proud of yourself whenever you accomplish a goal, no matter how small it is.

, Social media is a great tool for keeping in contact with people, but it can also trigger anxiety for some people. If this is the case for you, consider either deleting your accounts or reducing the amount of time you spend on social media.Social media causes some people to compare themselves to others excessively, which can cause them to feel bad about themselves.
Other people feel pressure to have a certain number of followers or to impress people with great pictures and witty comments, which can cause a lot of anxiety.

, People with social anxiety often feel as if they have nothing to talk to other people about. A little planning prior to social engagements can eliminate this worry, so conversation will come much easier. Try new things and develop new hobbies. Even if it's just a casual interest, it will give you something fun to talk about.
Brushing up on world events is also a great way to always have something new to talk about.

, If you're worried about being out of practice when it comes to making conversation, try practicing with people that you never plan on seeing again. Make small talk with the person standing in front of you at the post office or sitting next to you on the bus. This kind of practice will help you feel much more comfortable when it comes time to talk to people who you want to become friends with.The more often you do this, the easier it will get.
Try to engage with different types of people and talk about different topics all the time. This will give you lots of practice in different situations.

, Another way to practice your social skills is to find someone you know who is willing to help you out and do some role playing. Enact a social situation that would typically make you anxious, and ask your partner to give you feedback on how you handled the situation.Your partner can be anyone you feel comfortable with, but it's best to choose someone who has strong social skills.
Instruct your partner to pay attention to your body language as well as your conversation skills. This can help you get valuable feedback about things like eye contact or nervous twitches.

, As you begin talking to more and more people, you will eventually encounter some people who do not want to talk to you. This rejection may be hard to accept at first, but do your best to move on and continue talking to new people.Remind yourself that the other person is missing out by not talking to you.
Keep in mind that the other person may be having a bad day or may be distracted. There's a good chance that the reason they don't want to talk has nothing at all to do with you.

, You may live in the same neighborhood as a lot of potential friends, but because people tend to live insular lives, you may have never seen them before. To get to know your neighbors better, try attending events in your neighborhood, like block parties and holiday parades.If there are no neighborhood events in your area, consider organizing one. It can be something very casual like a potluck picnic at your local park.
If you go to one of these events, make a goal for yourself regarding how many people you will introduce yourself to. Everyone is there to meet new people, so they should be very welcoming.

, If you work at an office, your coworkers may be great potential friends. It will take a little work to turn your working relationship into a friendship, but it will be worth it if you have coworkers who share your interests.Make small talk with coworkers when you see them in common areas, like in the elevator or in the break room.
To get to know your coworkers better, consider going out to lunch together or going out for drinks after work. Once you have gotten to know some of them better, you may suggest weekend plans.
If you're not sure who to approach at work, you can send an email to your entire office or department. Say something like, ""I was thinking about going to the diner for lunch today. Is anyone interested in joining me?""

, Clubs and social groups are excellent resources for meeting people. Because they are usually centered around a specific activity or interest, you will automatically have something to talk about! Check your local paper or search online to find clubs in your area.If you can't find any clubs or groups that interest you, consider forming one of your own. You can base the group around your own interests to attract people who will be likely to have things in common with you. You can form your group online on a website like meetup.com, or you can advertise your group in a public space like the library., Volunteering for a cause you care about is also a great way to make new friends. You will get the opportunity to meet employees and other volunteers at the organization, who most likely share similar passions with you.When looking for volunteer opportunities, focus on ones that will allow you to work as part of a group, rather than individually.
Long-term volunteer opportunities are ideal for making friends because you will see the other volunteers many times and have plenty of opportunities to interact.

, One of the easiest ways to meet new people is to ask people who you already know to introduce you to their friends. You may have a close friend or relative who can really help you expand your social circle.Talk to your friend or relative about your comfort level before you plan anything. For example, you may be okay with going out to lunch with your sister and her friend, but not going to a house party with them.

, While it may be one of the more intimidating ways to meet people, you may also have great success making friends by simply talking to strangers. This may be easier if you talk to people you see regularly but do not know, like people who ride the bus with you or attend the same yoga class as you.Remind yourself that it's okay if not all of these interactions lead to friendships. If nothing else, they will give you more practice interacting with others.

, No matter how you meet people, you will need to take that extra step and make plans to see them again in order to become friends. Try to brush aside any fears you have that the other person does not want to be your friend, and just ask if they would like to get together.

Start with small plans. For example, you might want to ask a new acquaintance to meet you for coffee over the weekend, but not to go on vacation with you.
If you meet someone who you want to become friends with, always get their contact information before you leave. If you don't feel comfortable asking for a phone number just yet, ask about connecting on social media or get an email address.

, Remember that keeping friends can sometimes be more work than making them. The most important thing that you need to do to keep your friends is to stay in touch with them regularly.If you haven't spoken to a friend in a while, reach out by texting or emailing to see what's new. Try to make plans if possible.
Some friends talk to each other every day, while others talk to each other once a month. The right frequency will depend on what kind of relationship you develop with your new friend.

, People with social anxiety disorder often avoid making plans with others or cancel plans at the last minute, which can quickly derail a new friendship. Try to avoid doing this at all costs. Once you commit to plans, keep them unless you have a good reason for canceling.

If your friend wants to do something that makes you anxious, you can always try suggesting a lower key alternative. For example, if your friend wants to go dancing, but you're not up to it, you might say, ""I'm not feeling up to dancing, but I'd love to go out for lunch tomorrow.""
If you need to cancel plans, be apologetic and try to reschedule right away.

, Offering to help your friends will show them that you care and strengthen your friendship. It will also make them much more likely to help you out when you need a hand.You can help with anything at all, big or small. For example, you might offer to help your friend plant her vegetable garden, or you could offer your friend a ride to the movies. Both are very thoughtful gestures.

, Once you've mastered keeping in touch with your friends, the best way to maintain your relationships with them is to treat them right. Think about how you would want them to treat you, and always treat them exactly the same way.If your friend accomplishes something, be happy for him, just as you would want him to be happy for you.
If you have a disagreement with your friend, don't blow it out of proportion or be rude. This is not the way you would want to be treated!
If a friend is sad, try to console her.

Tell them that you don't want to be involved in their fight.,
Avoid commiserating.,
Try to mediate between the two.,
Disregard the fight altogether.",How to Manage when Two Close Friends Are Fighting1," This works when there is clearly no right or wrong person, like when someone just hates someone else for no reason (which of course happens). It's very important to let them know that you will not take sides and you want nothing to do with the drama, or you could end up ""trapped"" by a question like ""Who is right?"" or ""Who is your better friend?"" where no matter what you do, you come off as mean to at least one person.;
, This is actually really hard, because the best way to support a friend is usually to nod and say things like ""Yeah, that's messed up"" and ""Wow, they're being such a jerk"" when they tell you about things that the other person did to them. However, if you do that with both of them you will end up coming off as insincere and like you're taking both their sides when you should be taking neither. Taking sides will only end to problems in your friendships, and it's best to avoid causing unnecessary trouble.

, If you are an impartial judge, and they both tell you what happened, you should be able to help them solve the problem. This is another really hard thing to do, but if you take sides because you knew one person longer or something it will not really help, and so if when you see it all in perspective you can see who's more wrong or more right, it is very important to call them out on it so that they can help themselves.


You may feel like a jerk. That's okay; as long as you are fair and don't try to be a jerk, they will probably respect you more for being wise enough to see through your own emotions and solve the problem.
There are some times that you should not use this method, however:

If your friend starts to engage in reckless behavior (cutting and other self harm, using drugs or drinking alcohol underage, cutting class or skipping work, breaking the law, doing dirty things with people or trying to commit suicide) you should not do this. Take their side and try to help them either by reminding them that you are there for them and helping them stop cutting/doing drugs/etc, or telling a trusted adult like a caring parent, doctor or guidance counselor. Make sure they feel loved and cared for, before trying to help them solve the problem. It's more important for them to be safe than for them to stop fighting.
If the problem continues, you should try a different approach. This one is only good for small problems. Long-term problems and friends who had been dating have different types of problems, which you can find advice for later. For long term fights, see the next two methods.



, Start by pretending not to care. You might care. Just fake it. When they mention something, take out your phone and start texting. Read a book. Listen to music. Just do something to convey that you don't care at all about what they have to say, and as soon as they're done with that, rejoin the conversation. If you're talking to them alone, and they bring it up, say something along the lines of ""I don't really care, please don't get me involved,"" or something.


Soon, you will end up not actually caring. This might prompt your friends to realize that their fight is kind of stupid and not worth working about. However, it depends on the person and some friends might feel betrayed by you or angry, in which case it's best to tell them that you do care about them, just have no interest in the fight.

"
"
Make it clear that you don't want to take sides.,
Tell them that unless they solve the problem, you can't deal with their enmity any more and you need to get away from it.,
Create a distance as needed.,
Start to spend time that you would spend with your fighting friends with your new friends.,
Be firm if you really need to.",How to Manage when Two Close Friends Are Fighting2," However, you should also make it clear that you don't really care. This method only works on long-term problems that have been going on for a long time and really are very petty.


Depending on how hard your two friends are pulling on you, you may want to separate yourself from them personally or from the problem, rather than trying to help them fix it. It's best to let things that last for so long come to their own completion than trying to help fix it, because things like this are only able to be solved by the two competing parties. This particular one is about separating yourself from the other people. This is emotionally very difficult, but it may decrease a lot of the stress in your life.

, If it is stressful for you, tell them so! Make sure they know exactly what they are doing to you. It's very hard to deal with stuff like this if you're in the middle, and sometimes, if it's been spread out like this, it's harder than even being one of the people causing the problem.


Sometimes, the guilt factor alone can speed them to fix it themselves, in which case your friends are good people and you should hang on to them, rather than continuing on. This step takes a while to work, so make sure you tell them both and give them time to work it out or not before continuing.

, If the warning step failed, it's time to start separating. The first thing to do is start getting close with some other people. Make new friends, in or out of school. Find people with similar interests to you and people who you feel comfortable being around; choosing friends is hard sometimes but these are a few good tips.


Make sure you're not just getting close to spite your other friends. They should be people who you actually enjoy being around or your friendship will feel forced and fake, and you will end up alone and sad after they realize you were using them.

, If you want, you can tell them that you don't want to be around them because of how stressful and bad their fight makes you feel and that you need to get away from it. This is called ""guilting"" and if your friends truly care about you, they will try to end the fight.


If they are trying, stop getting away from them and give them time to work it out. Support them as they try, because sometimes if you have been in a fight with someone for years it's actually more comfortable to be in that fight than to end it. This sounds crazy, but status quo is a very easy place to be mentally and it will take your friends some getting used to if they finally start to ease the tensions between them.

, If they still don't try to stop you from leaving, you should realize that they care more about hating someone than they do about keeping a friend who actually cares about them. You deserve better, so you should finally stop talking as much with them.


Don't totally cut off communications, but you should definitely not hang out with them any more. Be civil, as that is very important, but don't go out of your way to say hi or anything. Remember. They are not your friend at this point but someone who doesn't care enough about you to try to keep you at least a little happy. (Realize that this step comes like three months after step 3, just to put that into perspective. That's a very long time.)

Make sure they know it's about the, not you.,
try to help them get over the breakup.,
Failing that, tell them that they have to get over it.,
Make sure they know that you are still there for them even if you aren't a crutch.",How to Manage when Two Close Friends Are Fighting3," It's clearly not your fault that they broke up. Just make sure they realize that making you choose sides will not help them or you.

, They might never be friends again, but they really don't have to be enemies. Set him up with another girl. Watch sad movies and eat too much ice cream while you cheer her up. A lot of the time, they are angry with one another because they're sad that it didn't work out, and the best way to fix that is to get them to cheer up and maybe introduce them to new people.

, Don't let them dwell on the past; it's never good for anyone. You clearly care about yourself and your friends, so you should try to help them deal with it. But, if they won't do their part, you have to let them know that you aren't a crutch, you're a human being and you have your own life to deal with.


If you drop everything to help them, you will only make it worse. (It's like if you broke your arm, and after it healed someone still carried all your stuff and wrote for you, you still wouldn't be able to use your arm.) Make sure that they can still take care of themselves.

, A rough breakup is hard to deal with and some people need more time to get over it than others, and the length and intensity of their relationship also plays a factor in recovery time. It's important to remember to be nice.

Raising the computer just six inches off the floor will decrease dust intake by up to 80%.Place your tower on the desk or raise it off the ground in some way.


Many computer desks will have a tower shelf that is raised up off the ground to help promote airflow.
You can use just about anything to raise your computer tower, as long as it's stable.;
, Vacuum your carpets and sweep your hard floors on a regular basis to prevent dust from accumulating. Keeping your floors clean will help prevent that dust from making its way into your computer.

, Much like keeping the floors clean, making sure all of your shelves cabinets, and other nooks and crannies are clean will help keep that dust from getting in your computer. The frequency you'll need to clean will depend a lot on your environment.

, Doors and windows tend to draw dust towards them, potentially into your computer if its in the way. Windows can do this even if they don't get opened, especially if they're poorly insulated. Try to situate your computer tower away from windows and doors.

, Putting an air filter in the computer room can be a fairly inexpensive way to keep dust from accumulating. You can get more complex with a filtration system for your whole house, but you should see positive results from a single-room filter., If possible, keep your computer in a room the pets don't go into. Pet dander is a major dust contributor, and dust will build up quick if they're in the same room often.

, Ash will increase dust build-up, and too much smoke can damage the components. Avoid smoking indoors to prevent this accumulation.

, There are a few things you'll want to get your computer clean. For a quick job, you only need the compressed air.


Compressed air
99% isopropyl alcohol
New soft-bristle toothbrush
Phillips screwdriver

, Before cleaning the inside of the computer, make sure it is completely shut down.

, You'll be moving your computer to a new location for cleaning, since you don't want to blow the dust out in the same place the computer sits.

, Even a little bit of dust in the computer will spread a lot when blasted with compressed air, so take your computer tower to a place that has good ventilation and you don't mind getting dusty. A table outside or in the garage will be your best bet.

, For extra protection from electrostatic discharge, plug the power cable in for your computer but keep the computer off. This will ground your case, and you by extension when you're touching it.

, Most computer towers have thumbscrews along the back that you can use to remove the side panel. If the thumbscrews are too tight, you can use a Phillips head screw driver to remove them. Most case panels either swing out or slide back and off.

, Use your canister of compressed air and blow the dust out of the case. Focus on the large clumps first. Hold the canister upright and spray in short bursts to prevent it from getting to cold.


Try to avoid blowing to long directly on the components in the case. If dust is caked on, you'll be using the brush and alcohol to remove it.

, Dip your toothbrush in the alcohol and use it to gently scrub dust off of components and fan blades. Clean the brush off in between uses to avoid spreading the dust around.


Make sure that the toothbrush is new so that you aren't introducing contaminants to the components.
Hold the exposed metal of the case while scrubbing to keep yourself grounded.

, After scrubbing your components clean, give the alcohol time to completely evaporate. If you're using 99%, this won't take too long. You'll have to wait longer if you used 70%.

, If your system is really dirty, you may need to remove each component and clean them individually. This can be a significant undertaking, especially if you've never worked inside a computer before. See Build a Computer for detailed instructions on working with these components.For things like disk drives, you'll likely need to take both sides of the case off.
If you remove the CPU cooler, you'll need to reapply thermal paste before reconnecting it. See Apply Thermal Paste for tips.

, If you live in a low-dust environment, you can get away with cleaning the inside of your computer just once or twice a year. If you live in an environment with lots of dust, pets, dirt, or other particles, you'll likely need to clean much more often.

, Your computer fans may be causing some of your dust problems. You may be able to reconfigure them so that they actually help prevent dust build-up. Follow the steps in the previous section to open your computer case.


You may need a Phillips screwdriver to detach the fan enclosures from the case.

, You may have one or more fans installed on your tower. For this method to be effective, you'll need at least three fans. Fans are typically located on the back, front, side and top of the computer.

, This arrow is usually printed along the top of the plastic fan enclosure, and indicates which way the fan is blowing. Depending on how the fan installed, you may need to remove it to find the arrow.


If you can't find an arrow on the fan, it is almost always going to be blowing out of the side with the label.

, This will create positive pressure in your case, however slight, which will be higher than the room around it. This will cause dust to find its way to the lower-pressure environment outside of your case.For example, if you have three fans, you'll want two pointing into your case and one pointing out.
Exhaust fans work best on the back and side. Intake fans work best on the top and front.

, You can purchase dust filters that fit into the screw holes of your computer fans. These should be placed on all of your intake fans to catch the majority of the dust that they bring in. Make sure to get the right size filters for your fans, and to clean them regularly.

, After your fans are set up properly, you can close your case up and plug it back in. You should be able to go much longer without having to clean the inside of your computer when your fans are working with you.

Make sure your operating system supports SLI.,
Check your existing components.,
Obtain SLI-compatible cards.,
Install the graphics cards.,
Install the SLI bridge.,
Turn on your computer.,
Install the drivers.,
Enable SLI.,
Turn on SLI.,
Enable frames per second.,
Turn on the SLI visual indicator.",How to Install Multiple GPUs Using NVIDIA SLI," Two-card SLI is supported on Windows Vista, 7, 8, and Linux. Three- and four-card SLI is supported in Windows Vista, 7, and 8, but not Linux.;
, SLI requires a motherboard with multiple PCI-Express slots, as well as a power supply with enough connectors for multiple graphics cards. You will want a power supply that outputs at least 800 watts.


Certain cards allow up to four simultaneous cards running in SLI. Most cards are made for two-card setups.
More cards means more power required.

, Almost all recent NVIDIA cards are capable of being installed in an SLI configuration. You will need at least two cards of the same model and memory to be installed as SLI.


The cards do not need to be the same manufacturer, just the same model and memory amount.
The cards do not need to be the same clock speed, though you may see a decrease in performance output if the speeds are not the same.
For best results, use two identical cards.

, Install the two cards in the PCI-E slots on your motherboard. The graphics cards are inserted into the slots as normal. Take care not to break any tabs, or insert the cards at odd angles. Once the cards are inserted, secure them to the case with screws.

, All SLI-capable boards should come packaged with an SLI bridge. This connector attaches to the top of the cards, and connects the cards to each other. This allows the cards to talk directly to each other.


The bridge is not required for SLI to be enabled. If there is no bridge present, the SLI connecting will be made through the PCI slots of the motherboard. This will result in reduced-performance.

, Once you have your graphics cards installed, close up your case and reboot your computer. You shouldn’t need to make any settings changes until after Windows or Linux loads.

, Your operating system should automatically detect your graphics cards and attempt to install drivers for them. This process can take longer than a single graphics card installation because the drivers need to be installed for each card separately.


If the installation doesn’t start automatically, download the latest drivers from the NVIDIA website, and run the installation file once the download is complete

, Once your drivers have finished installing, right-click on your desktop and select NVIDIA Control Panel. This will open a new window which will allow you to tweak your graphic’s settings. Find the menu option labeled “Configure SLI, Surround, Physx”.


Select “Maximize 3D performance” and click Apply.
The screen will flash several times as the SLI configuration is enabled. You will be asked if you want to keep these settings.
If the option is not there, your system is most likely not recognizing one or more of your cards. Open the Device Manager in the Control Panel and check that all of your drives are visible under the Display Adapters section. If your cards are not showing up, check that they are connected properly, and that the drivers have been installed for all of them.

, Click the Manage 3D Settings link in the left menu. Under Global Settings, scroll down until you find the “SLI performance mode” entry. Change the settings from “Single GPU” to “Alternate Frame Rendering 2”. This will turn on SLI mode for all of your programs.


You can make adjustments to individual games by clicking the Program Settings tab and then selecting “SLI performance mode”.

, This will vary depending on the game you are running, so you will need to look up the specific instructions for the game you want to test. Frames per second is a baseline test for computing power, and can show you have well everything is being rendered. Most gaming enthusiasts shoot for a solid 60 frames per second with high settings.

, In the NVIDIA Control Panel, open the “3D Settings” menu. Enable the “Show SLI Visual Indicators” option. This will create a bar on the left side of your screen.


Run your game. Once you have a game running, you will see the bar change. A taller bar means that SLI scaling is increasing, meaning that your SLI cards are working well and improving your visuals. If the bar is not very tall, then the SLI configuration is not affecting the display as much.

Check for excessive heat when the battery is in use.,
See if your battery gets bloated or swells up.,
Notice any reduced battery performance.,
Take note of any automatic or sudden losses of power.,
Look for visible corrosion or physical changes.",How to Know when You Have to Get a Replacement Battery," A little heat is normal when batteries are recharging or working, but excessive heat can be a sign that they are dying. Notice if the battery starts to heat up significantly more than normal, or compare your suspicious battery to a newer one to see if there is a significant difference in heat.;
, Sometimes when the rechargeable batteries start depleting, the internal cell ruptures and starts leaking. A small bulge will be the first visible sign of this starting. To check if the battery is bloated, place it on flat surface. If it wobbles or does not lie down properly, that could mean it's depleting.


Using bloated batteries is riskier as they might explode on being charged.

, A fully charged phone battery should provide at least 20 hrs of battery life on standby mode and minimum 7 hrs on usage, while laptop batteries usually have a life of around 2.5 - 3 hrs on usage and several days of shelf life. If your battery lasts for a significantly shorter period of time, or if you've noticed a decrease in the battery life during the time that you've had your device, this could be a sign that the battery is wearing down.

, Sometimes when the unit’s capacity is deteriorated it still as fully charged, after only charging very little. When you use it, it shows the battery as depleting very fast. Sometimes, the battery may shut down, powering off the device, while you are using heavy applications or on a call for a long time. This generally appears with excessive heating of the battery.


If when you switch the phone back on, you find that the battery is not hot and there is still power left, then phone is faulty but your battery should be fine.

, See if the terminals and electric panels on the battery appear to be rusted. No matter how small the area is, show it to a specialist. Visible corrosion means that there is some internal problem and it is time to change the battery. Continuing with the corrosive battery may end up destroying the phone.

Attach your devices to your card.",How to Install a PCI Card," Power down your computer and then unplug the power cable and all the other cables that are connected to the back. If you were recently using your computer, wait a few minutes for it to cool before proceeding.


Note: Some PCI cards may require you to install drivers before installing the card, but these are rare. Always read the card's documentation before installing.;
, PCI cards need to be installed onto your Computer's motherboard. To do this, you will need to open your computer so that you can access the insides. Lay the case on your table or workbench, with the connectors on the back closest to the work surface. This will ensure that when you remove the side panel, you will have access to the motherboard.


Most cases use thumbscrews which can be loosened by hand, though some may require a Phillips screwdriver.
Avoid laying the computer on carpet. Friction from the carpet is more likely to generate static electricity, which could then result in an electrostatic discharge.

, You will see rectangular slots on your motherboard that correspond with bays on the back of the case. There are usually one or two PCIe slots closest to the processor, used for graphics cards, followed by one or more PCI slots. You may have expansion cards installed here already, or they may be empty.


If you are having difficulty locating your PCI slots, refer to your motherboard's documentation.

, Each PCI slot will have a bay associated with it on the back of the computer. When there's nothing installed, the bays are covered by small metal protectors. You can remove one by unscrewing the single screw holding it in place and then lifting it directly out of the case. Set the screw aside.


Don't remove any protectors for slots you aren't using, as this will let more dust into the system.

, Before handling any computer components, you should ensure that you are properly grounded. This will prevent an electrostatic discharge, which can damage or destroy sensitive computer components.


Grounding yourself with an electrostatic wrist strap is the best way to ensure that you are properly grounded. Connect the wrist strap to the exposed metal of your computer case. You can also ground yourself by touching a metal water tap.

, Gently remove your new card from the anti-static bag, gripping it by the sides. Do not touch the contacts along the bottom, and try to avoid touching any of the circuitry.

, Line up the contacts on the bottom of the PCI card with the PCI slot you plan to insert it into. Press the card firmly straight down into the slot. Ensure that the card is level and seated fully in the slot before continuing.


If you have the space, leave an open slot between your new card and any existing card. This will help keep your cards and components cooler., Use the screw that you removed from the metal bay cover and use it to secure the card into the same hole. Tighten the screw firmly but not so tightly that it will strip later.


Your card will be suspended horizontally when you set your case back up, so securing it is very important.

, Put your computer's side panel back on and secure it. Set the computer back at the workstation and plug all of the cables back in. If your new PCI card adds ports to your computer, such as USB ports or audio connectors, wait to plug anything into them yet.

, Boot up your computer and wait for your operating system to load. Depending on what operating system you have, the card may be automatically detected and installed. If not, insert the disk that came with the card and install the drivers using the Setup program included on the disk.


You will typically need to install drivers before the card will function properly.
You may need to restart your computer after drivers are installed.

, If the card is a USB card, you can now attach your USB devices. If it is a sound card, you can plug your speakers in. If it's a wireless network card, you can attach the antenna."

Once the CPU is in plain view, grasp the lever on the Zero Insertion Force sockets and carefully but firmly pull the lever straight up.,
Place the beveled end of the chip to match the beveled end of the socket when inserting the new chip.,
Confirm that the chip you buy is compatible with your system and ask if you can return the chip if there are any problems.",How to Install a CPU Chip," You may also determine your CPU type and speed by removing the system unit cover and taking a good long look at the chip. Look at the label on the chip to determine its model, speed,and the manufacturer.


Note: If a Heat Sink or a Fan is installed on top of the chip, you will have to remove these components to view the CPU label.;
,,,,,, The chip will be mounted onto the motherboard in a socket and depending on the type of computer you have, the socket may be shaped in various forms.


Note: Some CPU chips are soldered onto the motherboard and can only be upgraded by removing and installing a new motherboard. This type of chip is referred to as the Proprietary CPU Chip.

, If the manual tells you to consult will the manufacturer if you want to upgrade the processor, it's mostly likely a propriety Central Processing Unit.

, Newer Tower units allow easy access by removing a couple screws and sliding the panel with the motherboard down.

, This lever is normally located on the side of the chip. Some chips may contain a clamp that must be removed as well. Check your owner's manual to see the components of your CPU.


Note: Some chips are covered by a Heat Sink and/or a Cooling Fan. These components will have to be removed and set aside.

, This was designed so that the chip can be installed in only one direction.

, Be sure that the upgrade will perform what you want it to do. Your computer's performance will improve with a CPU upgrade but you may need to add more ram if you want to improve your Windows programs.


Check to see if all connections are seated firmly and properly in their sockets. This is a must as these connections do tend to work themselves loose over time and cause problems you may blame on software.
Note: If you have been working in your system unit recently and you noticed a fault manifesting itself, you want to go back and take a look at all connections you were near. Look to be sure your fingers did not press against other connections and causing then to work loose.
Perform preventive maintenance on your computer and keep it clean regularly. It's a good idea to open up the system unit and remove all dust that have accumulated on the motherboard as well as all other boards from time to time.

You can quickly find the support page for your printer by opening Google and searching for ""manufacturer model support"".

, There are generally two ways that you can connect a network printer to your home network: wired or wireless.


Wired - Connect your printer to your network router using Ethernet network cable. Generally this doesn't require any further network configuration.
Wireless - Connect your printer to the wireless network using the display screen (if available). Most wireless printers will have a small display screen that you can use to find and connect to your home network. If your network is secure, you will be asked for the password. If you don't have a screen, you will likely need to connect the printer to your computer using USB and configure it in OS X first.

,,,,, Your network printer will be installed in OS X, and you will be able to select it from the print menu in any program.

If you are unsure of how to fix your mistakes, log into your root account and change the permissions on the file or directory to 777 when using the chmod command, which will return read write and execute permissions to everyone.

,

Have fun (Linux if always fun).

",How to Use File Permissions in Linux," To see the permissions you already have on files use the Ls command with the -l option (picture 1);
, This will determine how you will write the chmod command, and where you put each number.

, These are the permission details (r for read),(w for write)(x for execute) this will allow the user, group or other person to read( open) the file, write (make changes) to the file or execute ( run) the file. The Number used for R is 4 the number used for W is 2 and the number used for X is 1 which equals 7 there is some math required to do this. (refer to both charts in the notes section)


For example, if you wanted to add the Read permission and the write permission to only users you would write the command you would add 4 for read and 2 for write so the permissions on your file would look like what you see in picture 2 for the file user.(refer to the chart in the notes section for the chart of numerical values of permissions).

, These represent Users|Groups|Other from left to right. Putting a number from 1-7 in any of the three parts will change permission for each one depending on what numbers you use.

, Just be sure to use the absolute path of the folder so you don’t make a mistake (i.e. My test folder located in /home/permissiondemo/test). If you are not sure just look at the picture 3

, If it worked, good job. If not try again.( If you forget what the command looks like refer back to picture 1 the first command used)

To find a file you can input the following command: $ find . -name EXAMPLE. This will show you all of your files with that name, however, it is case sensitive., If you would like to find certain text within a file, you need to incorporate the ""grep"" command. Thus, to find all instances of ""EXAMPLE"" you would need to input $ grep 'EXAMPLE' EXAMPLE.txt. This will provide you with all of the instances of the text ""EXAMPLE"" within the EXAMPLE.txt file. However, this particular command is case sensitive. To find all instances of ""EXAMPLE"" regardless of case, continue to the next step.

, To find text regardless of text, simply add -i after the grep command. It should look something like this: $ grep -i 'EXAMPLE' EXAMPLE.txt.

For a single file, try the ""scp"" command.,

What if you have a large ""mess"" of files and directories to copy?",How to Transfer Files from One Linux Server to Another," You can use this as a ""push"" or a ""pull"" command, but let's start with pushing the file to the other server. While on alice, use the command ""scp myfile fieldmouse@madhat:thatfile"". This will copy the file over to the other system, into the fieldmouse userid, with the name ""thatfile"". If you were logged in on the other system, you could just as easily pull the file with the command ""scp rabbit@alice:myfile thatfile"", and get the same results.;
, This time we'll add the -r switch, to cause the copy to act ""recursively"". ""scp -r mydir fieldmouse@madhat:."" will copy the entire directory ""mydir"" over to the other system, including all its contents and additional directories. The directory on madhat will still be named mydir.

, You could use the ""tar"" command to create a single file, and then copy that file as above, then use tar to expand it on the other server... But that would seem so... Un-unix-like. There has to be a way to do it in a single step, right? Well of course!
Enter your favorite shell's pipes. We can still use tar to package up the files we want, and then use ssh to get it to the other system (which is what scp has been using under the covers), and tar on the other side to expand the files back out. But why waste time and space creating an actual tar file, when we could just create a pipe that spans the two systems and transfer the tar data through it?
Using the same directory as in the previous example, try ""tar -cf - mydir/* | ssh fieldmouse@madhat 'tar -xf -'""

Understand the format.,
Create a tarball from a single directory.,
Create a tarball that includes multiple directories.,
Add files or directories to an existing tarball.,
Compress an existing .tar file.,
Compress the tarball when you create it.",How to Tar a Directory," In Linux, archiving multiple files is accomplished using the tar command. This command will combine multiple files into a single file, allowing for compression or easier transfer to another computer. The resulting file will have a .tar extension. .tar files are often referred to as tarballs.


The tar command will only archive the files. It will not perform any compression, so the archive will be the same size as the original files. You can compress the .tar file using gzip or bzip2, resulting in a .tar.gz or .tar.bz2 extension. This will be covered at the end of the article.;
, There are several parts to the tar command when you are creating a tarball from a directory. Below is an example tar command:tar -cvf tarName.tar /path/to/directory






tar - This invokes the tar archiving program.

c - This flag signals the ""creation"" of the .tar file. It should always come first.

v - This indicates that the process is ""verbose"". This will display a readout of all the files that get added to the .tar file as it is being created. This is an optional flag.

f - This flag signifies that the next part will be the new .tar file's file name. It should always be the last flag.

tarName.tar - You can choose any name that you'd like. Just make sure that you include the .tar extension at the end. You can add a path to the file name if you want to create the tarball in a different directory than your current working one.

/path/to/directory - Enter in the path of the directory that you want to create the .tar file from. The path is relative to your current working directory. For example, if the full path is ~/home/user/Pictures, and you're currently in the /home directory, you would enter /user/Pictures. Note that all subdirectories will be included as well.

, Adding multiple directories is pretty much as simple as adding all the paths to the end of the tar command:





tar -cvf tarName.tar /etc/directory1 /var/www/directory2




, You can continue to add files and directories to your .tar archive files by using the ""append"" flag:tar -rvf tarName.tar textfile.txt path/to/another/directory






r - This is the ""append"" flag. It replaces the c flag from the tarball creation command.

, You can use ""gzip"" to quickly compress your .tar archive file. If you need more compression (smaller output file), you can use ""bzip2"" instead. bzip2 will take longer to compress the file than gzip.





gzip tarName.tar
bzip2 tarName.tar






gzip will add the .gz extension to the file name: tarName.tar.gz


bzip2 will add the .bz2 extension to the file name: tarName.tar.bz2


, You can use the commands in the step above to compress existing tarballs, but you can also compress them as you are creating them by using the right flags:tar -czvf tarName.tar.gz /path/to/directory
tar -cjvf tarName.tar.bz2 /path/to/directory






z - This flag will compress the new .tar file using gzip. Make sure to include the .gz extension at the end of the file name.

j - This flag will compress the new .tar file using bzip2. Make sure to include the .bz2 extension at the end of the file name."

Repeat this process for each connecting computer.",How to Share Files Between Linux Computers Using NFS," If you need to share files with Windows or Mac computers, you will be much more successful using Samba.;
, When sharing files with NFS, there are two side: the server and the clients. The server is the computer that is actually storing the files, while the clients are the computers that are accessing the shared folder by mounting the shared folder as a virtual drive. NFS will need to be configured on both the server and any client that wants to connect.

, This is the computer that will be hosting the shared files. The server computer will need to be turned on and logged in in order for clients to mount the shared folder. NFS requires using the terminal to install and configure both the server and client.

, This will begin downloading and installing the NFS files on your computer.

, Select ""No"" from the menu that appears. This will enable other computers on the network to connect to your shared folder.

, This will ensure that your changes take effect.

, This is an empty directory that will direct the clients to the actual shared directory. This will allow you to change the shared directory on your server later without having to make any changes to the clients.


Type .mkdir -p /export/dummyname and press ↵ Enter. This will create a directory named dummyname that the clients will see.

, This will open the /etc/fstab file and allow you to automatically mount the shared drive whenever the server boots up.

, Replace sharedpath with the location of the shared drive, and replace dummypath with the location of the dummy directory you created earlier.


For example, to share the /dev/sdb drive with the clients using the dummy directory created earlier, you would type /dev/sdb /export/Shared none bind 0 0. Save the changes to the file.

, You will need to add your dummy directory as well as the IPs that are allowed to access it to this file. Use the following format to share with all the IP addresses on your local network: /export/dummyname 192.168.1.1/24(rw,no_root_squash,async).,,,, You can name this whatever you'd like. For example, you can type mkdir /sharedFiles to create a folder called ""sharedFiles"".

,, Replace serverIP with the IP address of the NFS server computer. Replace sharedDirectory with the dummy directory you created on the NFS server and the local directory you just created. Leave the rest of the values as they are for now.

Refer to the printer's documentation for the exact location. If you can't find your manual, you can almost always download a PDF copy from the manufacturer's Support site.
If your printer and router both support WPS push-to-connect, simply push the WPS button on your printer, then press the WPS button on your router within two minutes. The connection will be made automatically.
Some older wireless printers may require you to connect to a computer first to set up the wireless connection. This is common if the printer doesn't have a built-in menu, but does support wireless. Connect the printer to your computer via USB, and use the included software to set up the printer's wireless connection. After configuring its wireless, you can disconnect it from your computer and place it where you want.

, After connecting the printer to your network, you can add it to your Windows computer so that you can print to it.Open the Control Panel from the Start menu (Windows 7 and earlier), or by right-clicking the Windows button (Windows 8 and later).
Select ""View devices and printers"" or ""Devices and Printers.""
Click the ""Add a printer"" button at the top of the window.
Select your printer from the list. It may take a moment to appear.
Install any drivers if prompted. Windows should be able to automatically install drivers for most popular printers.

, If you're using a Mac and the printer is Mac-compatible, you can add it after connecting it to the network.


Click the Apple menu and select ""System Preferences.""
Click the ""Print & Scan"" button.
Click the ""+"" button at the bottom of the list of printers.
Select your new printer from the list and follow the prompts to install any necessary software.

, Once your printer has been added to your operating system, you can select it from any program that can print. Your new printer will appear in the ""Printer"" selection menu when you go to print your document or photo.If your new printer isn't showing up, make sure that your computer is connected to the same network. Sometimes restarting your printer can make it appear again.

, Before you can print from your Android device, your printer will need to be properly connected to your home network using the steps above, or directly to your computer via USB. You'll be adding the printer to Google Cloud Print, which will allow you to send print jobs to it from anywhere from any app that support printing.


If the printer supports Google Cloud Print, you'll be able to add it with minimal fuss. If the printer does not support Google Cloud Print, you'll need to add it using a computer that the printer is already installed on.

, If your printer supports Google Cloud Print, you'll be able to connect it to your Google account directly from the printer's built-in menu. Follow the prompts to log in with your Google account. Make sure this is the same Google account that is associated with your Android device.


If you can connect your printer to Google Cloud Print, you can skip down to Step 9.
If your printer does not support Google Cloud Print, you can still add it through your computer.

, If the printer cannot connect directly to Google Cloud Print, you'll need to add it to your Google account manually. The downside to this is that the printer will only be available while your computer is turned on and logged in.


You'll need Chrome to set up your Google Cloud Print services.
Make sure you're using a computer that can already access the printer on the network. Follow the steps in the previous section to connect your computer to your wireless printer first.

, This will open a new tab.

, You'll find the Google Cloud Print section towards the bottom of the menu.

, You'll see a list of your currently-connected devices.


If you are asked to sign in, make sure you sign in with the same Google account that's associated with your Android device.

, You may have multiple devices listed here, especially if your printer is a fax machine as well.

, This will add your printer to your Google Cloud Print account.

, This will allow you to access your Google Cloud Print printers from your Android. You can download it for free from the Google Play Store.

, Once Google Cloud Print is installed, you can print to your Google Cloud Print printers from any app that supports printing. Printing support varies from app to app, though most apps that open documents, images, and emails support printing. You can usually access the ""Print"" option from the ⋮ menu.


If you added the printer from Chrome, the computer that you added it from will need to be turned on with Chrome open or running in the background. If the printer can connect directly to Google Cloud Print, it just needs to be on and connected to the network.

, This feature allows iOS devices to send print jobs directly to the printer. Look for the AirPrint logo on your printer or for an AirPrint option in the printer's Settings menu.


Some printers need to be configured to use AirPrint first.
AirPrint printers will need to be connected to the same network as your iOS device. Follow the steps at the top of this article to connect your printer to the network.
If your printer doesn't support AirPrint, you'll need to find a printing app from your printer's manufacturer.

, Not all apps support AirPrint, but most apps from Apple and other major developers do. You'll be most likely to find AirPrint options in apps that can open documents, email, and pictures.

, Use the app to open the document, picture, or email that you want to print.

, This will allow you to select your AirPrint printer.


Make sure you're connected to the same network as the printer.

, Your file will be sent to your AirPrint printer.

Remember that Unix and Linux are case sensitive to settings and commands.,
Learn to use emacs or vi, preferably both.,
Set Up Paths -- A ""path"" is the directories the computer will look in to find a command (or program) you wish to run.,
Modify the "".Xdefaults"" file, in order to change your default fonts and colors.,
Create Aliases -- Aliases in Unix are commands that substitute for other commands.","How to Set Paths, Colors, Fonts, and Aliases on a Unix or Linux System"," Be precise when entering settings. The directory listing command ""ls"" will not work if you type ""LS"" or ""Ls"".


All commands will be listed in their correct case, even at the beginning of a sentence in this article.
""Unix"" will be used to refer to Unix or Linux.
Prompts will not be shown in this article. It is also assumed that you need to press <Enter> after issuing a command.
Unix files that control setting and aliases usually start with a ""."" ! When you wish to list these out (using the ls command), you must add "" -a"" after it, like this:
ls -a;
, emacs and vi are the text editing tools used in Unix. emacs is easier to use than vi, but vi is included with all forms of Unix; emacs is not.

,


Make a copy of the .login file before you edit it. If you make a mistake, you will only need to copy back the original.
The path to most commands should already be set up.


Determine which directories are in your ""path"".
Enter this: echo $path
Examine your path to determine if you need to add another directory. You should see a listing after entering the above command like this (We will suppose your username is ""joe""):
/usr/local/bin /etc/log /home/joe
The listing will probably be much longer.
Modify the .login file, in your home directory in order to add to your path.


The .login file probably already has a line saying:
set path = ($path)
If you want to access programs, without typing the full path, in a subdirectory of your home directory; modify the path line in the .login file to look like this:
set path = ($path $HOME/bin)
If the programs you wish to access are somewhere else, you will have to give the explicit pathname:
set path = ($path /etc/log/monitors/)

,


Make a copy of the .Xdefaults file before you modify it. The ""X"" is capitalized.


Examine the .Xdefaults file. It should look something like this:
xterm*Font: courr10
xterm*VisualBell: true
xterm*Background: black
xterm*Foreground: cyan
xterm*Geometry: 95x50-0-92
xterm*ScrollBar: true
xterm*ScrollLines: 200
dtterm*blink Rate 0
emacs*Background: black
emacs*Foreground: ghostwhite
emacs*bitmapIcon: on
Modify the file (with emacs or vi) to change to your preferred fonts and colors. You can modify almost any part of the X window, from the title bar to the cursor.


Consult a Unix or Linux book about ""X"" window settings. The potential fonts and colors available are too numerous too mention here.

,


For instance, you are constantly typing ""Ls"" instead of ""ls"" when you are trying to list a directory. So you create an alias that makes ""Ls"" behave like ""ls"".
Unix administrators often arrange that all users have the command rm set up as an alias for ""rm -i"". This forces the user to type ""y"" before deleting a file!

Make sure that the alias you wish to set up is not already in use. Use the command ""which"" to verify that the command is not in use. If you see this, it is ok to proceed:
which jk
jk: Command not found.

Temporary Aliases -- if you need an alias for only a short time, create it at the command prompt. type:
alias <name of the alias> '<command you wish to substitute>'
Example, you are working in a facility with 3,000 CPUs. Most of these machines only have marginal user accounts because they are rarely accessed(by regular users). You need to look at many directories (each having many files) and do not want to keep typing ""ls -alth | more"" (This command is a directory listing command that lists all files, in order of most recent modification and lists the size of the file in human readable form. It will halt scrolling when the page is filled until you press the space key.)
You type:
alias l 'ls -alth | more'
Now, you only have to type ""l"" to issue the command.
Permanent aliases
Check to see if an .aliases file already exists in your home directory.
If the .aliases file already exists, make a copy of it before you begin.
Create or Modify the .aliases file using emacs or vi. Use the same syntax as when you made a temporary alias:
alias <name of your alias> '<command you wish to substitute>'
Here is an example from an .aliases file:
alias l 'll -alht | more'
alias clock 'xclock -fg red -hd green -bg black &'
alias giant 'xterm -bg black -fg cyan -fn courr24 -sb -sl 500 -n `hostname` & '
alias tiny 'xterm -bg black -fg cyan -sb -sl 500 -fn courr08 -n `hostname` &'
If you wish to use your permanent aliases without logging back in do this:
source .aliases
Your aliases will be available in that window ONLY (unless you repeat the command in the other windows) during the current session. Any new windows that read the file will have the aliases automatically available.

Don't allow root logins on your primary sshd port 22 (set PermitRootLogin to ""no""); many automated tools run brute-force attacks on that.",How to Secure a Linux Server," Every layer of software added on to make your system administration ""easier"" actually adds more methods for crackers to gain access to your machine and also reduces performance. All the further steps will assume your familiarity with using a shell.;
,, Shut down any unknown or unneeded services, using the appropriate tools for your Linux distribution, such as update-rc.d on Debian systems, or in some cases editing the /etc/inetd.conf or /etc/xinetd.d/* files. Along with this, get rid of any tools your server provider added for system administration, such as Plesk.

, Set up a secondary port for root access that only works by shared keys, disallowing passwords:

Copy the sshd_config file to root_sshd_config, and change the following items in the new file:


Port from 22 to some other number, say 8899 (don't use this! make up your own!)

PermitRootLogin from ""no"" (you were supposed to set it to ""no"" for port 22, remember?) to ""yes""

AllowUsers root add this line, or if it exists, change it to allow only root logins on this port

Challenge Response Authentication no uncomment this line if it's commented out, and make sure it says ""no"" instead of ""yes""


Test this command: 
sshd -D -f /etc/ssh/root_sshd_config and see if it works correctly -- try logging in from another computer (you must have already set up shared-key authentication between the two computers) using: 
ssh -p8899 root@my.remote.serverand if so, control-C at the above (sshd) command to stop the sshd daemon, then add this to the end of /etc/inittab:

Learn about the many Linux distributions available.,
Learn about the desktop environments you can use with your Linux distribution.,
Browse the applications that came with your OS.,
Use the internet:


Chances are your broadband has been set up during installation.,
Download and view files.,
Install applications that you want or need.,
Install applications that aren't in the Software Center using the Terminal.,
Install a simple binary package using the Terminal.,
Learn where common directories are.,
Share files and folders with other users.",How to Learn Linux," For server-level operations, CentOS, SUSE, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux are the most popular distributions. For the home users, Ubuntu, Linux Mint or ElementaryOS are good distributions. For someone who wants the latest applications, there is Fedora. However, Ubuntu will suffice for nearly all types of users.(http://www.ubuntu.com)


The image below shows OpenSUSE.;
, In Linux, the user can choose what their desktop (and related bits and pieces) looks like. Distros like Ubuntu or Mageia give you the choice. The most popular desktop environments include kde and gnome. These can be chosen during installation.To switch between desktop environments (assuming they are there!) the command switchdesk is used. (e.g. Open Terminal and type in switchdesk kde to switch to kde.


Below is a picture of Gnome 3.

, In Gnome 3, one has to click on ""Applications"" to view applications. In Kde, there is a type of 'start menu' in the bottom bar. Thus the installed applications can be viewed. To open an application, click on it once. To surf the web, there may be an application titled 'web' or 'browser', or some distros even come with Firefox bundled. All the fundamental applications usually come bundled with the distro. Installation of extra applications are covered in the later sections of this article.

,
If you are using a wireless dongle in your laptop, then after installation of the OS, connect it and follow the instructions given in your dongle's manual to install it.
Open the browser from the list of applications. It may be Firefox, Midori, or just Web/Browser.
Access the internet!

, You can download files and applications via the terminal.


File downloads are similar to Windows, but you must keep in mind the type of file you are downloading. If it is an application, make sure it is meant for Linux and not Windows or Mac.
If you are trying to open a document (e.g. a text document) and there is no inbuilt application for opening it, try opening it in the browser (e.g. Firefox can open a text document).

To do this, right click on it and then select Open With. Then choose your browser and set it as the default. Usually, there are options for this at the top or bottom of the window.



, The first place you should always look is in the Software Center that came with your OS. This is the application that will help you find new apps you can install; it will also help you install and uninstall them easily. If you can't find the application you want in the Software Center, then you may be able to find it on the internet and install it using the Terminal.


Applications may come in a binary package(installation without compiling - this is easier) or in a tar.gz/tar.bz2/tgz package (this is more difficult).
The image below shows the downloading of a binary package from a repository.

, Follow these steps to install a tar.gz/tar.bz2/tgz package.


The first thing you need to do is extract it to a folder. For this example, let's make it your desktop. You can extract an archive right-clicking on it and choosing the appropriate entry. It should create a new folder with a similar name, e.g. program-1.2.3. Now you need to open your terminal and then go to that directory: cd /home/yourusername/Desktop/program-1.2.3. Make sure you first read a file called INSTALL or INSTALL.txt or README. Check if there are any of these files with the ls command, then display the right one with: (type these in the terminal. Note: please make sure you have root/superuser privileges. Become root first. Do this by typing sudo -s in distros like Ubuntu. In distros like Mageia, the ""su"" command works.)
xdg-open INSTALL
The file will contain the right indications to go on with the compiling process. Usually the three ""classical"" steps are:
./configure
make
sudo make install
You may also need to install some dependencies, generally after a configure error that will tell you what you are missing. You can also use check install instead of make install.,


For Ubuntu/Debian/distros based on either (e.g. ElementaryOS) the binary package comes with a .deb extension. Go to the Terminal and type dpkg -i /home/yourusername/directory/filename.deb
OR you can right click on the file, go to properties, copy the directory given and type:
dpkg -i
Make sure there is a space and a slash (/) before the directory. The directory looks like this:
(space)/directory

, You should not have problems finding files and documents and downloads in linux because they are generally listed as follows:


Downloads can be found under Downloads (unless the user specifies). The Downloads folder is /home/username/Downloads (generally it is this one) or it may be /username/home/Downloads for your distro. (Then you are not using Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.)
Documents can be found under Documents.The directory is /home/username/Documents.
You can always see the directory of a file by right clicking on it and then selecting ""Properties"".

, One can easily set up their Dropbox account or sync their bookmarks and open tabs via the browser.


Use Ubuntu One. Ubuntu users get Ubuntu One, which gives them free cloud storage. This can be used for sharing of files across multiple platforms. Below:Ubuntu One

Install any web services you want to test.",How to Install XAMPP on Linux," You can get it from apachefriends.org/download.html. Make sure to download the correct version for your system (32-bit or 64-bit).


This guide will be using version 5.6.3 64-bit as the example. Make sure to change the commands based on the version that you are installing.;
, Before you can install XAMPP, you'll need to change the permissions for the downloaded file so that it can be executed.

, Enter the following command and press Enter, entering your password if required:


sudo chmod +x xampp-linux-x64-5.6.3-0-installer.run
You can drag the downloaded file into the Terminal window to automatically enter the file name and location.

, After changing the permissions, you can run the installer to begin installing XAMPP. Type the following command and press Enter:


sudo ./xampp-linux-x64-5.6.3-0-installer.run

, The graphical installer will open to walk you through the rest of the installation process. Most users can leave all of the options at their default settings.You can uncheck the ""Learn more about BitNami for XAMPP"" if you're not interested in it.

, You can start XAMPP using the Terminal by entering the following command and pressing Enter. You may be prompted for your password.


sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start

, Open your web browser and type in http://localhost/xampp/ in your address bar. If the XAMPP service is running, you'll see the Welcome page. This will help you test that XAMPP is running correctly.

, If you want XAMPP to run whenever the computer is turned on and logged in, you can add a line to your rc.local file:


Open the Terminal, type sudo nano /etc/rc.local and press Enter to open the rc.local file in the editor. You can replace nano with your preferred editor.
Add /opt/lampp/lampp start to the line before exit 0.
Save and close the rc.local file.

, XAMPP installs with no passwords, and it is not recommended that you run it when it is not secured. You can configure all of your security settings by entering the following command. This will take you through a process where you will be given a series of prompts related to various security aspects.


sudo /opt/lampp/lampp security
You will be asked to set a password for XAMPP, set some MySQL security settings, create a MySQL password, phpMyAdmin password, and FTP password.
Note that this will set your XAMPP username to llamp.

, XAMPP includes eAccelerator, which is an optimization tool for PHP development. If you want to use it, you'll need to open the /opt/lampp/etc/php.ini file and remove the ; from the beginning of each of the following lines. Restart XAMPP after saving the file:


;extension=""eaccelerator.so"";eaccelerator.shm_size=""16"";eaccelerator.cache_dir=""/opt/lampp/tmp/eaccelerator"";eaccelerator.enable=""1"";eaccelerator.optimizer=""1"";eaccelerator.check_mtime=""1"";eaccelerator.debug=""0"";eaccelerator.filter="""";eaccelerator.shm_max=""0"";eaccelerator.shm_ttl=""0"";eaccelerator.shm_prune_period=""0"";eaccelerator.shm_only=""0"";eaccelerator.compress=""1"";eaccelerator.compress_level=""9""

, If you receive the error message ""Cannot restore segment prot after relocation: Permission denied?"", there is a conflict with SELinux.


Type sudo /usr/sbin/setenforce 0 and press Enter. This should allow you to start XAMPP.

, If XAMPP is running but no images are appearing when you open it in your web browser, this is because of an issue with Apache and certain Linux systems.


Open the /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf file.
Remove the # from #EnableMMAP off and #EnableSendfile off.
Restart XAMPP. Your images should be appearing now.

, You can add files to your local XAMPP server by adding them to the following folder. This is the ""root"" folder for your local XAMPP web server. All files placed in this folder will be accessed by the web server:


/opt/lampp/htdocs/

, XAMPP comes with a configuration program that will allow you to change settings through a graphical interface. You can start it by typing the following commands:


cd /opt/lampp
sudo ./manager-linux-x64.run

, After the server is running, you can perform a quick test to ensure that the server is processing PHP correctly.Open your text editor and type the following:




<?php
 
        echo 'Hello world!';
 
?>





Save the file as test.php and place it in /opt/lampp/htdocs/

Open your web browser and type http://localhost/test.php. You should see your ""Hello world!"" text appear.

, Now that your server is configured, you can start installing tools such as Drupal and Wordpress. See the following articles for detailed instructions:

Check that your graphics card is supported by XGL!,
First, you need to update your list of packages to the latest version, but first you must choose:


You can enable the entire Gentoo unstable/testing branch.,
Sync your portage to the latest tree: emerge --sync.,
Check whether to upgrade your version: XGL requires Modular X 7.0 or higher.",How to Install Xgl on Gentoo Linux Running KDE With an ATI Graphics Card," There's a superb and up-to-date list maintained by the Gentoo Wiki.;
, This branch is a subset of all of the available packages which are seen by Gentoo dev's as... well... unstable. They're fully functional, but they haven't been tested enough to make sure that they're free of bugs. If you enable this branch, a whole wealth of easily mergeable software will be available. But it could wreck your system!

In order to use this entire branch, simply edit /etc/make.conf and change the line starting ACCEPT_KEYWORDS= in order that there is a ~ (a tilde) in front of the variable (which should be your architecture). For example, you could have ACCEPT_KEYWORDS=""~amd64"", but you will most likely have ~x86.
Doing an emerge -Uv world after this point will take a very long time, and could irrevocably destroy your system. In other words - don't.


Or, add to /etc/portage/package.keywords every package henceforth in this tutorial which you attempt to emerge and get denied because it's ""masked by ~"". This would take the form of a line such as app-office/gnumeric ~x86, where x86 is replaced by your architecture and app-office/gnumeric is replaced by the package in question.

,


This will take a while, so doze off briefly and watch a bit of TV. On your return, or its completion, check to see if the last few lines tell you that portage needs updating. If so, then you may need to emerge portage. It's possible that this will be a large change (i.e. a profile changing change).

, If you do not have it, you will need to install it.

You'll be able to install Ubuntu alongside Windows or replace Windows entirely.


If you're planning on replacing your Windows installation, make sure that all of your important files are backed up. Ubuntu will erase the drive containing Windows if you choose to replace it.;
, You can install Ubuntu from any USB drive that has at least 2 GB of space. Make sure that the drive doesn't have any important files on it, as the drive's contents will be deleted when creating the USB installer.

, You can access the Ubuntu Desktop site at ubuntu.com/download/desktop.

, Ubuntu typically offers two versions: the LTS version and the latest stable release. The LTS (long-term support) release will get security and system updates for five years, and is the recommended option for most users. The newest release will get nine months of updates before you're expected to move on to the next new release.


Most newer computers can run the 64-bit version of Ubuntu. If you're using an older computer and aren't sure if it's 64-bit, click here.

, You'll be prompted to donate to Canonical before you're taken to the download. If you don't want to donate, scroll down and click ""Not now, take me to the download"".

, You'll be downloading the Ubuntu ISO file, which is a little over a gigabyte in size. This could take a while if you have a slow connection.

, This free tool formats your USB drive, adds the Linux installation files, and makes the USB bootable. You can download it for free from pendrivelinux.com.

, Make sure that your USB drive is inserted and that it doesn't have any important files on it.

, You can use this utility to create a USB for any Linux distribution. Make sure to select Ubuntu so that it is formatted correctly.

, You can usually find it in your Downloads folder.

, Make sure you have the correct drive selected if you have multiple USB drives inserted.

, This will begin formatting the USB drive and copying the Ubuntu files to it so that your computer can boot from the USB., You'll need to set your computer to boot from the USB drive. The process for this varies from computer to computer.


Press the BIOS or BOOT menu key as your computer starts up. This key will be displayed on the same screen as the manufacturer logo. Common keys include F2, F11, F12, and Del. Select the BOOT menu in your BIOS and set your USB as the primary boot device.
If your computer boots directly into Windows 8 or 10 without showing the manufacturer logo, you'll need to do an advanced startup. Open the Charms menu (Windows 8) or click the Start menu (Windows 10) and select ""Settings"". Open the ""Update & security"" section, click ""Recovery"", and then click ""Restart now"" in the ""Advanced startup"" section. In the ""Advanced startup"" menu, click ""Troubleshoot"" and then ""Advanced options"". Select ""UEFI Firmware Settings"" and then navigate to the BOOT menu. Change the boot order so that the USB drive is the primary boot device.

, When you first boot from your USB drive, you'll be taken to the Welcome screen. You can pick your language and choose to either try Ubuntu or begin installation. If you opt to try Ubuntu, you can access all of its features (though you won't be able to save anything). At any time while trying out Ubuntu, run the installer on the desktop to begin the installation process.

, Check both the ""Download updates while installing"" and the ""Install this third-party software"" boxes. If you can't check the ""Download"" box, move on to the next step and then return to this screen after connecting to the network.

, If your computer is connected to the network via Ethernet, you won't see this screen and your network connection will be automatically configured. If you are using a wireless adapter to connect, you'll be asked to select the network you want to connect to and enter the password if necessary. If you're connecting to a wireless network in this step, it is recommended to return to the previous screen after connecting and check the ""Download"" box.

, This is the most important decision you'll be making during the Ubuntu installation process. If you install alongside your copy of Windows, you'll keep all of your files and a new partition will be created out of your free space. You'll be able to select which operating system you want to load when your computer starts up. If you choose to replace Windows, all of your files and programs will be deleted.


If you choose to install alongside Windows, you'll be able to use the slider to set how much space will be used for Ubuntu and how much free space will be left for Windows.
If you replace Windows, the partition you installed Windows on will be wiped and Ubuntu will be installed on it. The partition will stay the same size as it was originally.

, If you're connected to the internet, Ubuntu should be able to automatically detect the proper region. If you don't know what keyboard layout to select, click ""Detect Keyboard Layout"".

, Enter in your name, and then create an account for yourself. Your username should not have any spaces, and your password should be easy to remember but difficult to guess. You can choose whether or not you want to be logged in automatically or be asked for your password when logging in.


You can also change your computer's name on this screen. This is the name that will appear for your computer when it is connected to a network.

, After creating your account, you just need to sit back and wait for the installation to complete. This usually takes about 20-30 minutes.

, Once the installation is complete, your computer will reboot. If you installed Ubuntu alongside Windows, you'll see a new menu when you first start up your computer allowing you to choose your operating system.

One of the most popular free programs is 7-Zip, which you can download from 7-zip.org. Once you've installed 7-Zip, use it to open the ""tar.xz"" file that you downloaded. Extract the files inside into a new folder.

, There are only a few settings you'll need to change before running the installer, and they are all on the same menu.

, Ubuntu will create its own partition out of your available free space to install itself on. Use the drop-down menu to select how large you want this partition to be. Ubuntu needs at least 7 GB of space, more if you want to install programs and download files.

Understand the system.,
Plug headphones into the speaker port.,
Check obvious things.",How to Fix Computer Speakers1," To know how to troubleshoot speaker problems, it's a good idea to know how it all works, at least at a basic level.


Sound signals generated inside your computer are sent to the speaker port (usually green) on your computer.
You plug your speakers into that port, and the sound continues down the wire into the little amplifier built into the speakers. This is just like how your stereo is wired, only smaller!
The output of the amplifier is wired to the speakers.
Power from the wall enables the amplifier to boost the tiny signal coming from your computer into something strong enough to wiggle the magnets in the speakers, vibrating the speaker cone, which in turn vibrates the air, which vibrates your eardrums.
Any failure in that little chain of events will stop all that vibration from happening. No vibration = silence.;
, This will tell you the one big thing right away: is your computer sending sound out of the port. If you hear sound, then everything inside the computer is hunky-dory, and your problem is with the speakers. If you don't hear sound, then don't worry about the speakers—find out what's wrong with your sound card.

,


Is the volume turned up or right down?
Are the speakers plugged in?

"
"
It's not your computer.,
Make sure the speakers are plugged in.,
It still doesn't work?",How to Fix Computer Speakers2," Armed with that knowledge, let's look at troubleshooting speaker problems.

, Yes, that seems obvious, but maybe the dog knocked the cable out while chasing the cat, or maybe your daughter's missing gerbil chewed through the speaker wire.


Check the power cord. If your speakers use a ""wall wart"" (that black box, the power adapter that plugs into the wall), check to see if it's warm. If so, it's probably working. If it's cool or room temperature, it may be that it has ceased working. This is common with wall warts, and replacements are not hard to find. Go to Radio Shack with your power adapter and cable and they'll be able to test it and recommend a replacement, warts and all.
Check the connectivity to the computer's speaker ports. This connection is usually made with thin wires connected to little plugs, and those little hummers are subject to wear and tear. Look especially around the joint between the plug and the wires, and see if the cable is split or torn. If you can see copper or silver, it's a good bet that is your problem. If you're handy with a soldering iron, it's an easy fix: cut off the old plug, get a matching one from Radio Shack (or your favorite electronics store), and solder the leads from the speakers to the new plug.

, If you've got a good connection to the computer on one end, and have verified that there's power getting to the speakers on the other, than the last problem point in this chain is the speakers themselves. It's pretty hard to destroy speakers sealed in plastic cases, so there are two final points to check:


Open your speakers up, if you can, and make sure the wire leads coming from the amp are wired to the backs of the speakers. It might be that they took a tumble, and the wires came loose.
Check all the wires inside the speaker. Do they all appear to be secure? If you see solder joints (silver blobs on the wires where they connect), is the solder shiny and smooth, or dull and pebbly? If it's dull and pebbly, you may just have what's called a ""cold solder joint,"" which doesn't conduct electricity very well.
If all looks well, and nothing is loose, then you're down to one source: the amplifier inside the speaker. If that's toast, you can try to have it repaired, but it's probably more cost-effective to recycle them, and go buy a new pair of speakers.

It's Captain Obvious time again!,
Try hooking up the speakers to another computer.,
On a PC, open Control Panel.,
Double-click Sound, Video and Game Controllers.,
On a Mac, run Software Update... From the Apple menu, select Software update...,
Install software from your sound card's manufacturer.,
Still not working?,
If that doesn't solve the problem, haul that beast down to you local repair store, and have them take a look at it, knowing you did everything you could do before you resorted to that.",How to Fix Computer Speakers3," Make sure the volume is turned up and that the output is enabled on your music playback software. I know it's like asking ""is it plugged in,"" but very often, it's something that simple that's the root of the problem.

, If they work on a totally different computer, that's another way to verify that there's nothing wrong with the speakers themselves. Time to check the drivers!

, From the Start menu, click Control Panel, then System and Security, and then under System, click Device Manager.

, If a sound card is listed, your drivers are present. If your audio device drivers are not present, try installing the appropriate drivers. There are a few ways to do this.


Use Windows Update. Run Windows Update and have it download and install recommended updates. Doing so can update system features and other software that might help to fix your sound problems.

, It will check for updates on all system and built-in sound card software.

, For example, if your device came with a disc, that might have the software you need. Run the installer, and it will install or update your sound card driver.



Get the latest version from the Internet. Go to your speaker manufacturer's website, locate the driver there. Look under Drivers, Downloads, or Support—that's where they usually hide those things. Download the latest version, and install it.

, Troubleshoot. If you still have problems after all that, check any other sound port on your computer. If there are front ports and back ports, try the one you don't normally use.


Also check the sound card connection inside the computer, and make sure it's secure. Look for the same thing you looked for inside the speakers: loose wires, cold solder joints, or anything that looks out of place.

, Good luck and happy listening!

Reboot your PC.",How to Install Solus," Though Linux distributions are well known for being flexible, it's always a good idea to check and see if your computer meets the system requirements before installing a new operating system.

Your computer must have either a DVD drive or USB port.

If you intend on using a USB drive as explained in this article, it must have at least 2GB of space to hold the installer.


You'll need at least 10GB of space on your computer.
2GB of RAM is necessary for a smooth experience using the OS.
Finally, your computer must use a 64bit processor.;
, Never underestimate the importance of backing up your data before installing a new OS. If you're not planning on installing Solus along the side of your current operating system, recognize that all of the information you have stored on your hard drive will be erased. Even if you are going to dual boot your current OS with Solus, data loss is still possible.

Most operating systems come with software used to back up your information preinstalled. Try reading How to Back up a Computer for instructions on your device.

, The installation medium is the device that you're going to load the installer onto. You can use either a CD or USB drive. As mentioned before, your USB must have at least 2GB of space if that's what you intend on using to install Solus., There's a variety of tools you can use to write the ISO file to a USB.

For Linux users, it's recommended that you use Gnome Multi-Writer to write the ISO file to a USB thumb drive, while Windows users should use Rufus.
Although UNetbootin is a popular choice when it comes to writing an ISO file to a USB stick, UNetbootin will not work for this installation.

, Here you will be presented with two options: Solus and Solus MATE. The difference is that Solus MATE uses the MATE desktop environment instead of Budgie. If you're trying to run Solus on older hardware or simply prefer the traditional desktop environment that MATE provides, choose the second option.

Below the screenshot and headline, you will find a list of cities from where you can download the disk image. Choose the one that's closest to your location.
If you have a BitTorrent client, then you also have the option to download the file over a Torrent. This would speed up the download if you have a slower connection.

, Take the USB drive that you retrieved in the first part. You should plug it into your computer. All of the information on it will be erased, so take this opportunity to back up any important files it may hold.,

For Windows users, click on the Start button or press the Windows key to open the Start menu. Once the menu is open, type in ""Rufus"". Assuming you downloaded it properly, it should show up in the results list. Click on the application to open it up.
Ubuntu users can press the super key to open up the Dash. With the dash open, search for ""Gnome MultiWrite"" and launch the application when it shows up.

, Creating the LiveUSB can and probably will take a long time, especially if you're doing this on older hardware.

When in Rufus, select your USB thumb drive from the Devices drop down list. Next, check the box labeled ""Create a bootable disk using"", and then select ""ISO image"" from the adjacent menu. Click on the drive image logo and browse to the location where you saved the Solos ISO file. Finally, Hit start and then confirm to begin creating the LiveUSB.
When in Gnome MultiWriter, Ensure that your USB drive is plugged in and hit ""Start copying"". Once the file browser pops up, navigate to the location that you saved the Solus ISO file and open it up. The copying will start immediately.

, As mentioned before, writing an ISO file to a USB thumb drive can take some time. Depending on how large the file is and how old your computer is, things can take much longer. Be patient., Once your computer is completely shut off, turn it back on. While the manufacturer's splash screen is being displayed, press the key used to enter the Boot Menu. This key is typically F9, F12, Esc or Del. Here, you can select your USB drive from the list of bootable devices.

If you can't get to the boot menu, then you may need to change the boot order in the BIOS menu.

, In the first few steps, you will be asked about your location, language, keyboard layout, and time zone. Make these changes based on your information., In the next step, you're required to select where you want Solus to be installed. Choose your hard drive from the drop-down list and select the fashion in which you want to install it., A host name is a unique title used to identify a machine on the network. Your host name can use letters ""A"" to ""Z"", 0 to 9 and a hyphen, although it can't start or end with one., Once you have set a hostname for your computer, you will be asked to create one or more accounts who will use your computer. Choose a username, real name, and password for the new user.

Optionally, you can also give the new user administrative privileges. Do this by checking the box below the ""Confirm password"" field.

, Finally, you will be presented with a page listing everything you have set up in the installer. Review this list to avoid doing anything unintentional. Once you have done this, press the button labeled ""Install"" at the bottom of the window., The installation will now begin. Depending on how fast your computer is, this may be a quick process or it might take slightly longer. The installation progress will be displayed at the bottom of the screen., As the very last step, you will be required to restart your computer before you can use your new Solus installation. Power off your computer and remove the installation medium before turning it back on. Once your computer boots up, you will find yourself in the Budgie desktop environment."

Learn the way connection speeds are measured.,
Understand the basics of connecting to a server.,
Know the difference between uploading versus downloading.,
Understand ping.",How to Find the Upload and Download Speed on Your PC1," Connection speeds are measured in Mbps. This stands for Megabits Per Second. Mbps is the standard method of calculating transfer speeds. The most important thing to note is that a megabit (Mb) is different than a megabyte (MB).


File sizes are typically measured in MBs.
A megabit is 1000000 bits, which translates to about 125 kilobytes. A megabyte is made of 1024 kilobytes.
This means that a 10 Mbps connection will deliver download speeds up to 1.25 MBps.;
, Connections are made to servers. A server is the location where you are retrieving data from. Servers are physical objects, and their relative distance to your computer will affect the speed at which you connect to them.


All things being equal, you will download a file faster from a server that is 10 miles (16 km) away as opposed to a server that is 500 miles (800 km) away.

, When you download something, you are retrieving a file from a server. When you upload, you are sending a file to a server. Internet connections are typically significantly faster downloading than uploading.

, Ping measures time to connect. The ping is a measurement of how long a message takes to reach one end of the connection to the other. This affects how long a download may take to get started, but does not affect overall transfer rate.

, Speed tests usually give a list of servers nearby to connect to and perform the test. Most tests automatically select the most optimal server for your location.


A close location will give you the best results and the closest transfer rate to your maximum.
You can test your speeds to servers around the world to see how long it would take you to download files from another country.

Know your network.,
Think critically.,
In this instance, the router and switch is down:

,
Determine whether or not it is a WAN outage that you are dealing with.

,
In order to do that, find out from the router located at headquarters whether the connection there can be made to the “Site A” router.,
Once you have gotten this far, you need to start thinking about recent changes that have occurred on your network.,
Learn more on how to use a network performance monitor to detect faults.",How to Find the Root Cause of a Network Outage," Here is an example scenario:


This example shows us a simple network configuration. We have a headquarters with a server farm. This is also where the network management system is located on the network. We also have two remote sites. Each site has users, and it is connected through an MPLS virtual private network:
In this situation, let’s say that a syslog message comes into you main router at headquarters, identifying an internet issue. It tells you that the connection to “Site A” is down. Your NMS is showing green for that connection.

What should you do?

;
, Where is this data being pulled from? It is possible that your remote site is actually fine. Should you trust a syslog message? Or should you collect polling data into your NMS? Using your NMS, poll “Site A” to see if the router or switch is down.

,,, This is known as checking an adjacent interface:

, Often times, you can trace a problem back to a recent change if the issue is not a WAN problem. This can be a misconfiguration on a router, switch or other network device. If you have taken proper backup steps, it shouldn’t be a problem to revert those changes.


These few critical steps are helpful to track down a network fault. In the case of it being the MPLS, you have problems on your node. Otherwise, start checking for network configuration changes on your network right away.

, Having your tools properly configured is a big step toward being prepared for a problem.

, In the command prompt window, type the following syntax: ping .


There’s a space in between each command. This is quite technical, but just follow the syntax.
The next few steps will explain the parameters of the syntax.

, In the syntax from step 3, after the command “ping,” type in a URL or website address you commonly use. This is the website the command will send a ping to.


For example, use www.yahoo.com or www.google.com.

, In the syntax from step 3, the last parameter states “MTU value.” This pertains to the test packet size in bytes that would be sent together in your ping. It’s a four-digit number.


Try to start with 1500.

, If you use Yahoo’s website, the syntax would be as follows:


ping www.yahoo.com –f –l 1500
Press ""Enter"" on your keyboard to send the ping.

, After the ping, the results will be shown on the command prompt. If the results display “Packet needs to be fragmented but DF set,” this means the packet size isn’t optimal yet.


Proceed to step 8.

, Reduce the packet size by 10 or 12 bytes. You’re trying to figure out the correct packet size that won’t need fragmentation.

, Repeat step 6 using the adjusted or reduced MTU value.


Repeat steps 6 to 9 until you don’t see a message saying that the packet still needs to be fragmented.
Once you don’t see the message anymore, proceed to step 10.

, Once you have a packet size or MTU value that doesn’t fragment, increase this value in small increments.


Try increments of 2 or 4 bytes.

, Send another ping using the adjusted or increased MTU value.


Repeat steps 10 to 11 until you determine the largest packet size that won’t be fragmented.

, Take the maximum packet size you got from the ping tests and add 28 to it. These 28 bytes are reserved for the header data. The resulting value is your optimal MTU setting.

, Go to your web browser and type in your router’s configuration IP address. Log in using your admin user name and password.

, Navigate through your router’s configuration settings until you find the MTU field. This may vary depending on a router’s brand and type.

, Once you find the appropriate field, key in the MTU value you’ve computed from step 12 of part 1.

Based on OS:

Windows: Start --> Type ""CMD"" in search field --> open command prompt --> type ""ipconfig /all"" --> look at and note the computers IP address and Subnet Mask
Mac: Applications --> Utilities --> Terminal --> at prompt, type ""ifconfig -a"" --> look at and note inet address (aka IP address) and netmask (aka Subnet Mask - given in HEX (ex: 0xFFFFFF00) Conversion - Tip 1);
,
Based on your IP address and subnet mask, we can determine what subnet we are in, including the Net ID, Broadcast Address, and range of assignable IP's.,
Now that the number of subnets has been determined (as per above example), we will have to determine which of the two subnets our IP address falls into.,
Lastly, note that we have established our Net ID, we can determine our first assignable IP, last assignable IP and broadcast address (Tip #5) for the example IP - 192.168.3.52; Subnet Mask 255.255.255.128.",How to Find a Network IP Address,",

Begin by determining the of subnets that are present. This is accomplished by using your subnet mask. The formula is: 2^n (where n = # of network bits used less the default for that range) Tip #2. Example: IP - 192.168.3.52; Subnet Mask - 255.255.255.128.
Default subnet mask based on first octet (192) is 255.255.255.0 (or CIDR /24)
The ""128"" in the last octet tells us that one additional network bit is used beyond default. Tip #3.
Plug values into formula (using CIDR). Example: 25 - 24 = 1. 2^n = 2^1 = 2 = 2 subnets.

,

The first three octets of the IP will not change; leaving us with 2 Net ID's: 192.168.3.0 and 192.168.3.128. Tip #4
By looking at the value of the fourth octet, we see that 52 falls between 0 and 127, thereby putting our IP in the first subnet with a Net ID of 192.168.3.0.

,

Network ID: 192.168.3.0
First Assignable IP: 192.168.3.1
Last Assignable IP: 192.168.3.126
Broadcast IP: 192.168.3.127

If you received your Windows 7 as a downloadable ISO file from Microsoft, you can skip to the next section.;
, Open your new burning program. Look for an option such as “Copy to Image” or “Create Image.” If prompted, select your DVD drive as the source.

, Choose an easy to remember name and location for the file. The ISO you make will be equal in size to the disc you are copying. This means it can take up several gigabytes of space on your hard drive. Be sure you have enough storage available.


Creating the ISO can take a long time, depending on the speed of your computer and DVD drive.

, This is available for free from Microsoft. Despite its name, this tool works with Windows Vista ISOs as well. You can run this tool on virtually any version of Windows.

, This is the ISO that you created or downloaded in the first section. Click Next.

, You are given the option to either burn to a DVD or create a USB device. For this guide, click USB Device.

, Make sure that your flash drive is connected correctly. You will need at least 4GB space on your flash drive to copy over the Windows installation.

, The program will format the USB drive to boot correctly, then copy the ISO file onto the drive. The copying process can take up to 15 minutes to complete, depending on the speed of your machine.

, First plug-in your USB stick to your USB port and copy all the content to a safe location in your hard drive.

, To open a command prompt, go to the Start menu and search for CMD. Right-click on it and select Run as Administrator to use it with admin rights.

, To do so, type in the following command in the command prompt: DISKPART


Running DISKPART will display the version of DISKPART you are running and the name of your PC.
Type “list disk” to see a display of all your connected disk drives. Make a note of the number assigned to your Flash drive.

, Execute the following list of commands one-by-one. Make sure you replace Disk 1 with the proper Disk number from DISKPART.select disk 1cleancreate partition primaryselect partition 1activeformat fs=NTFS QUICKassignexit

, Use the bootsect utility that is shipped with Windows 7/Vista. To do so:


Insert the Windows 7/Vista DVD and note down the drive letter of the DVD drive. For this guide, the DVD drive is D: and the USB drive is G:.
Navigate to the directory where bootsect is found.D:cd d:\boot

Use the bootsect to make the USB Drive bootable. This updates the drive with BOOTMGR compatible code and prepares it to boot Windows 7/Vista.BOOTSECT.EXE/NT60 G:

Close the Command Prompt windows.

, The safest and the fastest way would be to use the Windows Explorer. Open the disk, select everything, and drag it into your flash drive. This could take a few minutes to copy.

, To boot from the USB drive, you will have to set the BIOS to boot from USB first instead of the hard drive. To open the BIOS, reset your computer and hit the displayed key to enter Setup. The key varies by manufacturer, but is usually F2, F10, F12, or Del.


Open the Boot menu in your BIOS. Change the 1st Boot Device to your USB drive. Be sure that it is inserted, or you may not be given an option to choose it. Depending on your manufacturer, it may say Removable Device or list your flash drive’s model.

, If you set the boot order correctly, your Windows 7 or Vista installation will load after the manufacturer’s logo disappears.

, The installation process will load and the Windows setup will begin. Check out our guide on installing Windows 7 for an in-depth walkthrough.

, When your first operating system has installed, remove the first install source, insert the second one, power down your computer and boot from your boot media.


When you install your second operating system make sure to install to a different partition to the one you installed the first OS on or the multi boot will not work.

Your friend probably does not expect you to have the right words and, in fact, there may be little to say that will provide concrete comfort in the aftermath of a miscarriage. Often, the best thing to do for a friend grieving pregnancy loss is to simply listen without judgment.Oftentimes, simply telling the story is a healing process to someone suffering a miscarriage. Allow your friend to tell their story as many times as they need. Always be attentive.
You do not have to say a lot while listening. Acknowledge you're paying attention by occasionally restating your friend’s feelings or thoughts. Let your friend know you're always willing to listen, even if you can't take the pain away. Say something like, ""I know I can't take away your pain, but know that I will always be willing to listen when you want or need to talk.""
When your friend talks, give non-verbal cues you are listening. Make eye contact and nod on occasion.;
, A miscarriage can result in a wide range of feelings. There is no wrong way to feel about pregnancy loss. Oftentimes, a friend does not need someone to explain or change their feelings. They simply need the validation of knowing their feelings matter. After a miscarriage, try to provide your friend with this support.Encourage your friend to open up. Say something like, ""No matter what you're feeling, you can tell me. It's okay to take this time to grieve.""
Your friend may also experience negative feelings during specific times. Anniversaries, holidays, or the baby's due date may be difficult. Reach out to your friend during these times and let them know you're there to listen.

, People are often hesitant to raise the topic of a miscarriage. You may want to avoid making someone sad or raising a difficult topic. However, sadness is an essential part of the grieving process. Many people feel isolated after a miscarriage as people avoid the topic. Do not be afraid to ask your friend how they're feeling on occasion.Make sure you ask appropriately. Try something like, ""I was just wondering how you're doing with everything. Let me know if you want to talk.""
You can also make yourself available to watch a movie, hang out, or have a cup of coffee. Your friend may not know what she needs, so being a gentle initiator may be helpful.
Your friend may not always want to talk about their miscarriage. If this is the case, do not push it. Just let them know that, if they want, you're there to listen. Say something like, ""I understand if you don't want to talk about it right now, but I'm always here.""

, Keep the door open for support after a miscarriage. In addition to asking and listening, make sure your friend knows they can always come to you. Each time you talk to your friend, say something like, ""Just so you know, you can talk to me any time you want. Feel free to call if you need to talk.""Check in on occasion so your friend knows the door is open. You can, for example, send a text that says something like, ""Just wondering how you're doing. Let me know if you need anything.""

, If your friend is not ready to talk, you can show your support in writing. Do not hesitate to send a thoughtful condolences card just after a miscarriage. If your friend needs space, they will appreciate being able to read your heartfelt words even if they're not ready to reach out directly.You can also send additional cards of support or e-cards to let your friend know you are still thinking of her.

, Miscarriage can cause physical symptoms in addition to emotional ones. Your friend may be laid up after a miscarriage and unable to keep up with household chores. Offer to do things like the dishes, laundry, and other basic household tasks in the wake of your friend's miscarriage.Keep in mind, even after physical symptoms pass, your friend may find it difficult to get up the motivation for chores. Offer your help even if your friend seems physically capable.

, As a miscarriage can be physically debilitating, see if your friend needs help with any errands. Offer to do things like run to the dry cleaners, pick up groceries, pick up prescriptions, or any other tasks your friend needs help with after pregnancy loss.For example, if your friend needs a prescription filled, offer to pick it up for them. You can have them call in the prescription and let the pharmacist know a friend will be picking it up.

, If your friend has other children, childcare can be difficult after a miscarriage. In addition to the physical symptoms, your friend may feel emotionally drained and struggle to interact with their other children. Offer to help out with childcare. You can offer to babysit, take the kids somewhere, or simply just come over and help out with the kids while your friend is at home., Your friend may avoid social situations at first. Do not push your friend to come out if they're not ready, but always extend the invitation. It may be good for your friend to socialize after a point and you want them to know they're always invited.As your friend may initially hesitate to socialize, do not put too much pressure on them when extending an invitation. Say something like, ""We're all going out for dinner Saturday. If you're feeling up to it, we would love it if you joined us. If not, we completely understand.""

, Many basic tasks can be difficult after a miscarriage. Your friend may struggle to do things like cooking. Bring your friend over some food so they keep up with nutrition after a miscarriage.Make meals that can easily be heated up and will last for a bit. You could, for example, make a large casserole or pasta dish that your friend can refrigerate and then heat up when they want to eat.

, Many women are sensitive about their bodies. Before and after pregnancy, body image can be a tricky subject. You want to avoid talking about your body or your friend's body if they've just had a miscarriage. Such comments can trigger memories of a lost pregnancy.For example, refrain from discussing things like your weight, weight loss, or your friend's physical appearance. Even if they're unrelated to pregnancy, such comments can serve as a reminder.

, Many people forget that a miscarriage is a loss. Just because the baby was not carried to term does not mean you're friend is not mourning the child. Therefore, avoid comments encouraging your friend to see the bright side. Things like, ""Remember, you can always get pregnant again"" or ""At least you know you can get pregnant"" are not helpful during a miscarriage. Your friend likely already knows these things, but they do not make up for the loss., Try to avoid platitudes of cliches when discussing your friend's miscarriage. These statements are likely to come off as condescending or rude. Stick to talking about your friend's specific feelings.Things like ""Everything happens for a reason"" and ""Time can help heal you"" are generally not helpful. Such statements can even be offensive, especially if your friend is still grieving.
It is also important to steer clear of telling stories about other people’s miscarriages during this time.
Instead, focus on your friend's specific experience. For example, ask something like, ""How do you feel about everything?""

, Your friend will not appreciate unsolicited medical advice. They probably have a doctor talking them through the miscarriage. Avoid suggesting ways to prevent a miscarriage in the future or speculating on the causes of a miscarriage. This is unlikely to help your friend grieve and will simply come off as insensitive.For example, refrain from making suggestions about your friend's health. Do not say things like, ""I hear stress can contribute. Maybe in the future, when you're more relaxed, you'll have a healthier pregnancy."" While you may think this is helpful, your friend may find it presumptuous and insensitive.
If your friend wants to talk about things like doctor's appointments, ask questions instead of diagnosing. For example, ""How did it go at the doctor's? How are you feeling about what your doctor said?""

"
"
Pay attention to your friend’s needs and wants.,
Notice when someone is feeling down.,
Talk together frequently.,
Trust your friend with secrets or deep thoughts.,
Think about them when they aren’t around.,
Keep your promises.,
Plan events with people.,
Tell them that you care.",How to Show Someone You Care1," This is often the hardest, but most important, way to show you care. Even if they are just telling you a story about something silly that happened at the supermarket, it's important that you respond appropriately so that the other person senses you are genuinely interested. If you dismiss or ignore them when it comes to simple things, they won't feel that you care about them, therefore they are much less likely to share anything deeper with you in the future.


Remember when someone tells you their likes or dislikes.
Ask specifics, like ""How's your boss treating your these days,"" as opposed to ""How's work?"";
, Showing you care means paying attention to your friend’s mood and asking if they are okay when they seem blue. Ask if everything is okay, if you can do anything for them, or what the problem may be. Signs that someone is unhappy include:


Moodiness
Unnaturally quiet
Bouts of anger

, Showing someone you care is a continual exercise, not something you only do once. Take time every week to talk about how things are going, new developments in life, and anything stressful.


Make sure you’re listening to your friend’s response. You should care about them and their opinions, not what you want to say.

, Feeling like someone trusts you is a great way to feel cared for. Most people only share their hopes, secrets, and ideas with someone they care about, and building up trust with someone shows that you value their friendship.

, When you buy someone a small gift, send a letter, or call someone you haven’t seen in a while, you prove that you care for someone even when they aren’t in a position to receive your heartfelt love. This kind of surprise is a wonderful reminder that someone is cared for, even if they don’t always realize it.


Buy a small gift when it reminds you of someone.
Send a letter or postcard when you are out of town.
Reconnect with long-lost friends from time to time to catch up.

, Basic respect for someone is paramount to showing your affection. If you make an appointment, show up on time. If you promise to finish and errand, get the job done. If you agree to keep a secret, don’t tell anyone.

, Make time in your schedule to make plans with someone, which shows them that you are willing to prioritize them above other things in your life. Make dinner plans, agree to see a movie, or go for a walk together before work. Making a friend a priority means that you value their time.

, Sometimes the best feeling in the world is hearing someone say they care about you. Telling someone you love them, value their friendship, and like being around them is a great, simple way to show you care. Just be genuine and they will know you care.


Note the specific things that your like to be more sincere. Say you think they listen really well, always have something nice to say, or value their opinions.

Listen to them if they want to talk.,
Offer to help with chores or errands.,
Bring over food, or invite your friend to dinner.,
Organize an event to take their mind off of things.,
Be patient as they heal.",How to Show Someone You Care2," While some people are quiet after a difficult event, other people will want someone to talk to. Make yourself available to them if they need a sympathetic ear, and be sure to listen to their issues. Don’t feel like you need to have any answers or solutions – just listening is often enough.

, Even if they do not take you up on it, offering to help out around the house can help someone going through tragedy feel less burdened by everyday life. You can even offer to provide company as they go to the store or complete their errands.

, Having a nice meal with someone is a great way to talk and show your affection. After someone loses a family member, for example, some people organize meals for the family so that they can forget about cooking for a while and enjoy a meal and some company.

, This can be big, from a surprise spa day with friends, to small, like going to the movie theater together. Even if you don’t talk, having your company will be enough to make the person feel better.

, Some tragedies, like the death of a loved one, take time to heal. Your friend might be angry or depressed, and they might lash out at friends when they feel upset. Don’t take it personally. Know that your time together is helping them feel better and be patient as they heal.

Limit distractions and interruptions.,
Focus on what’s being said.,
Pay attention to body language.,
Take their perspective.,
Stay calm.",How to Respond to Someone Describing a Hard Childhood1," When someone is sharing something as personal as the details of a difficult childhood the last thing you want is a phone constantly ringing, beeping, and buzzing. And the last thing they want is to have to repeat a painful detail because you were distracted. Do what you can to remove any distractions and limit interruptions so the person feels comfortable talking with you.If you know in advance they’ll be telling you something personal, eliminate distractions and possible interruptions in advance. For example, you might turn the TV off and ask your kids to play in their room.
Avoid checking your alerts and notifications while the person is talking. Give them your full attention.
If you two are conversing over a meal, put your fork down, look at them, and focus on listening.;
, It may not be easy for the person to tell you about their childhood so don’t start daydreaming or allow your thoughts to drift while they’re talking. Focus your thoughts and senses on the person so that you will be able to respond appropriately and with empathy.Active listening techniques may be helpful, such as asking for clarification, summarizing, and repeating back what they have said to you.
Look at them while they are talking. This is a clear way to let them know you’re paying attention.
Notice if they seem to be having a difficult time telling you about their childhood. For example, are they hesitating a lot? Is their voice softer than usual or does it sound strained?
Think about what they are telling you. Focus your mind on understanding their story.

, People don’t always say so when something is bothering them. Sometimes the only clue is in their body language. Although they may sound calm when telling you about their childhood, there may be nonverbal signs that what they are telling you is hard for them to talk about.


Does their body seem tense? For instance, is their jaw tense? Are their lips pressed tightly together?
Do they seem nervous or anxious? For example, are they sweating or shaking? Are they pacing or do they seem fidgety?
Do they seem to be having trouble breathing? Is their breath shallow or really fast?
Do they seem to have trouble making eye contact with you?

, Some of the things people may tell you about their childhood can be hard to understand or imagine. Rather than disbelieving, try to put yourself in their shoes and really consider what they went through and how it might have felt.Visualize what they are telling you. This will help you take their perspective. For example, if they’re telling you about living in foster care, picture moving into a new bedroom every few months.
Imagine how you would have felt if you had their childhood. For instance, you might think about how confusing and isolating it might be to have a serious childhood disease.

, Depending on what is said and who it is saying it, you may be shocked, outraged, or saddened when someone tells you about their hard childhood. Instead of responding with a strong reaction, try to remain calm so that you can support the person telling you about their childhood.Keep your breathing slow and steady. If you need to, silently remind yourself to inhale slowly, hold it for a second, and then release it slowly. Also, focus on your body and see if you are demonstrating any restlessness, tension, or other indicators of discomfort.
Remind yourself that although what happened to them wasn’t good, they’re okay now and here with you.

Acknowledge that they shared.,
Be honest.,
Ask questions.,
Tell them you believe them.,
Remind them it’s not their fault.,
Avoid trying to be a counselor.",How to Respond to Someone Describing a Hard Childhood2," When you respond to someone describing a hard childhood you should try to show empathy.It may be very difficult, embarrassing, or even scary for them to share something so personal. You can show empathy by letting them know that it took courage to share this with you and that you appreciate their trust.


Depending on the relationship, a display of touch may be appropriate. Place a hand on their hand or arm briefly to display empathy.
You might also try saying, “I know it wasn’t easy for you to tell me this. You’re very brave. Thank you for trusting me.”
Or, you could try, “Thank you for sharing this with me. I know it was hard for you to talk about, but I’m glad you did.”

, There is no need to try to make the person feel as though you completely understand or can relate to what they went through. In fact, it can be counterproductive to say this and make the person feel as though you don't understand the depths of their pain. If you can’t imagine what it must have felt like to have their childhood, then say so. They will appreciate your honesty and know that they made the right decision in sharing this with you.


You might say something like, “I can’t begin to understand what that must have been like. I do know that you’re really brave and strong for getting through it.”
Or, you might say, “Even though I can’t imagine having a childhood like that, I do feel empathy for what you went through.”

, You don’t need to interrogate the person, but it is okay to ask questions to make sure you understand everything. Be sure not to ask leading questions, appearing as though you know how they feel or what they went through. Try to be sensitive and calm when you’re asking for more information and respect their wishes if they don’t want to answer your questions.


For example, you might say, “Do you feel comfortable telling me more about what happened? I want to fully understand.""
If they say they don’t feel comfortable answering a question, you might say, “It’s okay. I understand that this is difficult for you. You tell me what you’re comfortable with.”

, This may be one of the most important things you do when you’re responding to someone describing a hard childhood.It can take a lot of courage for them to tell you, especially if they’ve never told anyone else. Letting them know that you believe them can help reassure and calm them.


You might say something like, “I know this wasn’t easy for you to talk about. I believe what you’ve told me and thank you for trusting me.”
Or, you might simply say, “I believe you.”

, Depending on what happened during their childhood, the person may feel that they are to blame. One way that you can respond is to let them know that this isn’t the case.Let the person know that things that happened in their childhood were beyond their control and weren’t their fault.


For example, you might say, “What happened to you isn’t your fault. You were a child and had no control over it.”
Or, for instance, you could try saying, “You aren’t to blame for what happened. You are brave, though, for talking about it now.”

, Although you may want to support someone that has described their hard childhood, remember that you’re not a trauma or crisis professional.Instead of trying to tell the person how to heal and move on or find out how their childhood made them feel, focus on letting them know that you’re there to support them.


You don’t have to help them ‘process’ what happened. For instance, don’t try to get them to remember ‘repressed’ memories.
Encourage them to seek professional help if you feel their childhood might still be affecting them. You might say, “It seems this still hurts you. Have you considered talking to a counselor?”

"
"
Check-in with them.,
Offer support.,
Suggest professional help.",How to Respond to Someone Describing a Hard Childhood3," You don’t have to spend 24 hours a day monitoring them, but a good way to support them is to check on them every now and then.Just asking how they’re doing can go a long way in supporting them as they cope with having a hard childhood.


If they seem to be having a difficult time coping with what they told you, you might check on them every day or couple of days. You might call and say, “Hi! How’re you doing? Are you okay after our talk?”
Stop by and see them when you can. Sometimes people can sound fine, but seeing them can give you the full story.

, There are several ways that you can do this that don’t require a lot of effort of time, but may have a positive impact on the person. Being there for them lets them know that someone cares and that they’re not alone in what they’re going through.A powerful way to do this is often in writing. Send them a card with a heartfelt message. This effort lets them know that your support is genuine and not just something you said.
You might offer to just be with them. You don’t have to do or say anything, sometimes a person’s presence is enough.
Offer to listen if they want to talk more. For example, you might say, “I’m here if you need to talk about this more. Just let me know.”

, In some cases, a hard childhood can lead a person to have other challenges such as substance abuse or post-traumatic stress disorder.They may need professional support to work through what happened to them. Gently suggest that they talk to a therapist or counselor.


For example, you might say, “Something like that seems hard to get over. Have you thought about talking to a therapist about it?”
Or, for instance, you could tell them, “I think your childhood might still be affecting you. Would you consider seeing a counselor to work through it?”
If you have seen a counselor yourself, then you can say, ""I talked to someone about what happened to me and it was incredibly helpful."" Making it about you and not them helps with stigmatization.
You could refer them to a hotline such as 1-800-656-4673 or suggest that they text crisis counselors by texting ‘GO’ to 741741.

"
"
Recognize how you feel.,
Do something calming.,
Depend on your support system.",How to Respond to Someone Describing a Hard Childhood4," It can be upsetting if the person tells you that someone you know is responsible for their hard childhood. It can also be distressing if you care a lot about the person and the events were extremely traumatic. You may need to work through your feelings about what they have told you.Think about if your feelings are an appropriate emotional reaction to what this person disclosed, or if you are experiencing codependency and this person's emotions are controlling you.


For example, if your cousin tells you that a relative abused them it might be emotionally challenging for you to handle.
Or, for instance, if your spouse was a young runaway it might be hard for you to accept.
Think about what they told and write down all the emotions that you feel as you’re thinking about it. For example, you might write, “frightened, sad, disappointed, confused.”

, It can be challenging for you as well as the person when someone is describing a difficult childhood. You might find that you feel sad, angry, or confused. You may need to do something to relax yourself and calm down.You might go for a walk after you get through talking to the person. Even a brief walk can help clear your mind and calm you down.
Try meditating for a while. Sit or lie somewhere comfortable. Close your eyes and try to focus on your breathing.

, In some situations you may need to seek support yourself because of something someone told you about their childhood.Turn to your close family and friends and let them know that you need help working through something.


If you don’t feel comfortable telling them what has you upset, you might say something like, “I don’t want to go into details, but I’m upset and just need someone to be with me.”
Or, if you’re trying to respect the privacy of the person that confided in you, you could say, “It’s someone else's private matter, but it has me upset. Can we just talk about my feelings?”
Spend some time doing something relaxing, calming, or even fun to help you release your stress and tension.

Make him feel wanted.,
Strive for openness, honesty, and equality.,
Listen.,
Be positive.,
Be affectionate.,
Flirt!,
Be romantic.,
Know him well.",How to Make a Guy Feel Good," Humans are social animals. No matter how much satisfaction we can gain from our own solitary pursuits, we need to interact with other people to feel truly ""whole."" People want to be wanted. They need to be needed. If you want to make your guy feel good, start here. Depend on him. Let him help you through difficult times. When he does, let him know how much you value him. Your relationship should be a balanced one - just as you rely on him, so should he rely on you.;
, Because they're so used to being guarded, most guys will really appreciate a relationship that allows them to express themselves with complete sincerity. It can take time for a guy to ""open up"", so, if yours hasn't yet, be sure to let him know that, should he want to, he can talk to you about anything that's troubling him. He might not immediately take you up on your offer, but when he does, he'll really appreciate that he can come straight to you to pour his heart out.


It's easiest to be open and honest with someone we consider to be our equal. Try to share experiences, responsibilities, and conversations with your partner - as you come to trust each other, your communication will naturally deepen.
Even in the closest, most intimate relationships, guys and girls don't constantly talk about their inner demons and emotional issues - can you imagine how awful relationships would be if we did? One common mistake is to ""press"" your S.O. for details about what's troubling him - though any couple should try to have open communication, this doesn't necessarily mean both partners will always want to talk about serious things.

, Guys want to know that they're taken seriously. Because many guys have a hard time talking about their emotions with their friends and even their family, they want to feel that, when they open up to you, you notice. During normal conversations, you obviously don't need to hang on your guy's every word, but when your guy is talking to you about something serious, give him your full attention. Stay near to him and look him in the eye as you talk - he will undoubtedly appreciate the respect you give him and will do the same for you when you need someone to open up to.


Listening isn't just a matter of just sitting there quietly - give your guy time to get his thoughts out, but when there's a lull in the conversation, add your own thoughts, questions, and suggestions. This will show that you've really been listening, making your guy feel valued.

, Inner happiness shows externally. While you and your guy should be more than comfortable talking about the things that trouble you, most of the time, you'll simply want to be as happy as you can around each other. Try to have a full and fulfilling life - indulge your hobbies, get plenty of sleep and exercise, and keep an optimistic attitude. When you do hang out with your guy, you'll probably find that both of you have more fun if you're free of stress and in good moods.


There is a sexist stereotype that women should act pleasant and smile around men as a matter of course. Don't do this - living with a positive outlook will make you and the people around you happier, but pretending to be happy when you're not is not only disrespectful to yourself, but also not at all what good boyfriends want from their girlfriends.

, One sure-fire way to have your guy feeling great about himself (and you) is to give him affection (within reason). Think of affection as a way of showing how much you care for someone - a healthy amount of affection makes you seem appreciative, while a ton of affection can make you seem a little obsessive, so be reasonable. Your affection doesn't have to be grandiose or attention-seeking - you might, for instance, just touch him delicately by 'mistake' while you walk by him.

, Most guys love affection, but giving affection is twice as fun (for both parties) if accompanied with some light teasing. Try one of the oldest tricks in the book - playing hard to get. Keep your guy on his toes when it comes to your affections. This will drive him wild and have him completely into you.


Be cagey with your intentions, but, if you're playing hard to get, make sure you're not too cagey, or you'll never be ""gotten."" You don't always have to hide your true intentions - sometimes, it's OK to be openly affectionate.

, We all know the stereotype - guys are gruff, no-nonsense, unsentimental lovers, while girls are emotional, capricious, and romantic. Real life isn't nearly so simple. Plenty of guys are openly romantic, while still more are romantics at heart but are embarrassed to be open about their sentimentality. Guys are usually encouraged to engage in romantic gestures - buying chocolates, flowers, etc. Flip this tired old trope on its head with a romantic gesture of your own - you might be surprised how touched your guy is.

, This key. Ultimately, to make your guy feel good, you need to know what makes him truly happy and satisfied, which is impossible if you don't both open up to each other. Know your guy's quirks - the weird things that make him laugh, his pet peeves, his crazy fears. Have inside jokes that no one else will understand. Know, at a glance, how he's feeling. You'll naturally learn these things as you spend more and more time with each other, and, best of all, your guy will learn them about you.


Remember, the more you know about someone, the easier it is to hurt him or her. As you learn more and more about your guy, be sure to use your knowledge for good, not for evil. It's all-too-easy in a moment of anger to bring up something deeply personal in a short-sighted attempt to hurt him.

Have patience.,
Reassure your friend that it is acceptable for them to feel anger, guilt, fear, depression and remorse.,
Reach out to your grieving friend.",How to Make a Friend Feel Better After a Death1," There is no right or wrong way to grieve, and it may take months or years for a friend to process their grief.;
, The grieving process may be a roller coaster ride of emotions- 1 day your friend may not have the will power to get out of bed, and the next day, they may be yelling, screaming or even laughing.

, Sometimes, bereaved individuals feel isolated and alone. You don't have to have all the answers. In fact, sometimes just listening or providing a hug will support a grieving friend.

Give your friend some space.,
Start with a little token.,

Summarize and validate what they're saying.,
Don't try to solve the problem.,
Talk about other things.,
Distract the person with activities.,
Do something physical.,
Do something light and entertaining.,
Get something to eat.,
Encourage them to cancel non-critical plans.",How to Make Someone Feel Better," It's important to let someone process pain or grief on their own clock. Sometimes, people want a shoulder to cry on and an ear to listen. Other times, people might have to do a lot of processing and thinking on their own, depending on what's upsetting them. Don't rush it, if your friend wants some time alone.


Reach out with something gentle after some time. You don't have to lead with, ""I'm so sorry I just heard what happened, I'm headed over right now."" Just say, ""So sorry to hear. Thinking of you."";
, If your friend is hard to get a hold of, or isn't being communicative, just do something little to start the process and get the door open. It doesn't have to be a big gesture, but a little token can help you start to make someone feel better.


Before you do try to talk to a friend or find out more about what's wrong, a card, a bouquet or flowers, or some other small token can do a lot to speak for you and reach out to someone who's really grieving. Likewise, a six-pack of beer or a mixtape can be a good reach-out gift.
Just getting someone a soda, or a tissue, or a place to sit comfortably is a good way to start. Help your friend put her hair back.

, When someone is upset, they often don't want to be the one to ask for help. Especially if the grief is severe. If a good friend has just gone through a rough patch, like a break-up, or even a death in the family, it might be a challenge just to get in touch. Be persistent and come up with creative ways to get them talking.


Try text messages, if your friend isn't answering the phone. These are easier to respond to in a quick way, without having to put on a good face.
Even if your friend hasn't been through something super-serious, and is just upset because of a scraped knee, or because a favorite sports team lost, it's still tempting to isolate and ignore other people. Reach out to those people too.

, Sometimes, you don't need to do anything but be there for a friend. Just sitting with someone and being present for their grief is helping. Being alone and suffering in silence can be the hardest part sometimes. Let the person know that you're available to talk, if they want to, but that you're also just available.


A little physical affection can speak more than a long comforting talk. Just pat someone on the back, or give a little hug. Hold someone's hand who's struggling.

, Ask a few gentle questions to get your friend talking and opening up about what's wrong. If you have some idea, you can be specific, but if you don't, just say something like, ""Want to talk?"" or ""What's going on?""


Don't push. Sometimes, just sitting there and being quiet is enough for letting someone talk if they don't want to. If your friend doesn't want to talk about it, don't make them.
Follow up in a few days, if your friend doesn't want to talk. Make plans to get lunch and say, ""How you been?"" They might be more willing to talk at that point.

, If your friend starts talking, be absolutely quiet and focus on them. Don't say anything. Don't interrupt to try to sympathize, or start telling your own story to try to relate to their miseries. Just sit quietly, look at them, and allow them to talk. This is what your friend needs the most during a time of grief.


Make eye contact. Look at your friend sympathetically. Put your phone away, turn the TV off, and ignore everything else in the room. Lock in and listen.
Nod along to show that you're listening, and use non-verbal cues to be a good listener. Sigh during the sad parts, smile during the funny parts. Just listen.

, If your friend slows down, one way to keep them talking is to summarize what they've said and try to put it in your own words. Hearing it back can be a good part of the healing process for some people. If your friend is going through a break-up and talking about everything the ex did wrong, say, ""Sounds like your ex wasn't really committed in the first place."" Fill in the blanks for them to help the grieving process move forward.


You can also use this if you're unsure exactly what they mean. ""Let me see if I'm getting this straight: you're angry with your sister because she borrowed your astronomy books without asking?""

, Lots of people, especially guys, make the mistake of thinking that talking about a problem means that you're trying to solve the problem. Unless your friend specifically asks something like, ""What do you think I should do?"" don't try to come up with a solution. Grieving isn't a problem that has an easy solution, so don't go looking for a tidy one. Just listen, and just be there.This is especially true if your friend made some mistake. It's probably not necessary to point out that your friend might not be so upset about failing a test if they had studied instead of playing video games.
If you want to offer advice, pause. Ask ""Are you looking for advice, or do you just want to vent?"" Honor their response.

, After a while, it's good to move the conversation forward gently, especially if you see that your friend has run out of steam or has just starting repeating things. Try to get your friend to look on the bright side, or just start talking about other plans to start looking forward.


Talk about what you're doing later, or what you're doing next. Take a little step into talking about a new issue. If you're sitting outside a school building, talking about a break-up, say, ""So, are you hungry? What do you want to get for lunch?""
Eventually, your friend may run out of things to say. Don't let them keep circling back to the same topic, over and over again, if it doesn't seem to be productive. Encourage them to talk about other things, and focus energy elsewhere.

, Go do something so your friend doesn't just keep dwelling on the upsetting thing. It really doesn't matter much what it is, just as long as your friend can stay busy and engaged in some activity.


Just get up and go for a walk, if you're sitting around. Walk around the mall and window shop, or just walk around the neighborhood to get a change of scenery.
Blow off some steam, but don't blow off too much steam. Grief isn't an excuse for abusing drugs, tobacco, or alcohol. Be the voice of reason if you're trying to help your friend feel better.

, Exercise helps to release endorphins in the brain that can help calm and restore the mind.If you can get your friend to do something physical, it can be a great way of getting some good feelings back the healthy way.


Try doing some meditative exercise, like some light stretches, or even yoga.
For a fun distraction, play backyard sports, bike, or go for a walk.
If your friend is feeling angry or frustrated, do something really high impact and physical to work it out. Hit the heavy back at the gym, or do some dead-lifts.

, If your friend keeps dwelling on some darkness, go the opposite direction. Decide you're going to head to the mall and go window shopping, or that you're going to go swimming and eat popsicles. Get out all your favorite Disney movies and make popcorn and have a movie marathon and talk about your crushes. Do something light and fun, to keep from dwelling on the sad stuff., Treat your friend to something special when they're feeling down. Go out for ice cream, or grab a bite at your favorite restaurant. Sometimes, grief can cause people to avoid meals and lose their sense of appetite, which drops the blood sugar and makes everything worse. Get a little snack and your friend might start feeling better.


Sometimes, it's good to drop off a meal to a friend who's going through a tough time. Make up a pot of soup and drop it off. One less thing for them to worry about., If your friend has really gone through a terrible experience, it might be a bad idea to try to go do that presentation at work, or try to sit through a long and arduous class period. Take the day off and do something to get your head straight instead of going about the regular routine, if necessary.


In some cases, it might be better for your friend to just put their head down and get back to work. Regular stuff can be a good distraction. Let them make the final decision, but let them know they have a choice, at least.

Acknowledge the death.,
Let your friend know that you care.,
Offer your assistance.",How to Make a Friend Feel Better After a Death2," You can help a grieving friend by not being afraid to use the word death. Trying to soften the situation by saying something like, ""I heard you lost your husband,"" may make them angry. Their husband is not lost. He is dead.

, Be open and honest when you communicate with a grieving friend. ""Sorry"" is a good word in this situation.

, It's OK to tell your grieving friend that you don't know what to do, but would like to help in any way. They may ask you to help them sort through photos, go grocery shopping, or help them mow the lawn.

Deliver food to your bereaved friend. Often, the newly bereaved forget to eat, and bringing them a favorite snack or meal from a restaurant they enjoy will ensure they receive adequate nourishment.

You can help a bereaved friend by offering to write the obituary, help them find a church or hall for the memorial, and assist them in finding someone to speak at the service.
Clean your grieving friend's house. They may be in a state of shock and may not be capable of doing their normal household chores. Often, family and friends from out of town will be coming to stay with them for the funeral, and cleaning the house for them will be beneficial.

, Grief takes time, and you can help a bereaved friend by keeping in touch with them after the memorial. Call them on the phone, take them out to lunch, and talk about the person that died.

, It's normal for a grieving friend to feel depressed, but if they can't get to school or work, have troubling sleeping, can't eat or eat all the time, they may need extra help.


The grieving process varies from person to person. If your grieving friend does not seem to be getting better with time or talks about suicide, you may need to intervene.
Offer to take your friend to a grief group or talk to them about scheduling an appointment with their family doctor if they focus only on death, have hallucinations, or can't perform their normal daily routines.

Skip the platitudes and criticisms.",How to Make a Friend Happy," One of the best ways to make your friends happier is to be happier yourself. That is, you tend to be happier when you are around people who are happier. Similarly, your happiness will rub off on your friends., Relationships, no matter the form, are a key to happiness. Therefore, just spending time with your friend can make both of you happier. Make sure to encourage one another, as well as offer gratitude for the relationship, all of which will increase her happiness.For instance, you could let her know that you value her friendship by telling her regularly, such as saying ""I just want you to know how glad I am you're in my life,"" or by sending her a card every now and then.

, ""Laughter is the best medicine"" is a saying for a reason. Laughing can make you happier and healthier as a person, so try to get your friends to laugh by cracking jokes or even poking (light) fun at yourself., Everyone needs to hear they are are smart, strong, and beautiful sometimes. Don't be afraid to tell your friend these things, as they can help her build confidence and self-esteem. Try to make your compliments unique to the person, so she knows you truly mean what you say.For instance, saying ""I really like how you take the time to listen to everyone you meet. It shows how much you care about people."" is a more specific compliment then, ""You're a good listener.""

, If you're friend is grouching about a situation at work, for instance, help her see the positive side of things. That doesn't mean you should downplay her feelings. In fact, definitely hear out her problem before reacting. But try to help her asking probing questions such as, ""What things can you do to make the situation better?"" or ""What's been happening at work lately that's been good?""Research shows that those who choose to look for happiness learn to be more optimistic overall, making them happier in general., True happiness is in part about the adventure. It may mean you may need to step outside of what's comfortable and try something new, and in turn, discover new things you love. If you want your friends to be happy, encourage them to try new things with you.For instance, try a new restaurant in your city, explore nearby towns, or begin a new hobby together.

, Pick a time when you have no agenda. Just give her a call to say hello, and see how she's doing. Nothing says, ""I'm thinking about you."" like giving someone a call., You know what your friend likes. Maybe she can't live without an afternoon coffee, or maybe she has a penchant for black forest cake. Surprise her by bringing one of them to her when you know she's having a rough day., Dancing gets your blood pumping, plus it's silly and fun. Put some music on, and rock out together., Not many people get handwritten notes anymore. It's so rare, in fact, that it's bound to put a smile on her face. Drop a note in the mail to her. If you include one with a funny card, that's a bonus., Drop by with her favorite casserole. Do a chore you know she hates to do, like mow the lawn. Send her a small present you know she'll love. Any concrete gesture will be sure to brighten her day., Sometimes, just being with a friend who's depressed can be a big help. If you can't be there with the person, offer your emotional support, letting her know that you're there to listen and help in whatever way you can., Being depressed can make the smallest things hard. You can offer concrete support to the person, such as volunteering to drive her places, cooking for her, or calling to make appointments for things she needs to get done. Just make sure to follow through on what support you offer.Go ahead and make the offer of support up front. Sometimes people who are depressed have a hard time reaching out for help when they need it.

, Even something small can mean a great deal to someone who's depressed. Bring her a coffee, or drop her a note in the mail. Try cooking her a plate of sweet treats she'll enjoy. These small gestures add up, letting her know that she's loved and you are thinking about her., If she hasn't already, try to get her to seek a professional opinion. Ask her if she's talked to a therapist or a psychiatrist, both of which can help with depression.Because mental illnesses have a stigma in society, you should also mention that she shouldn't feel ashamed of getting help. Depression is just a disease like any other one, and it can be treated.
If she's hesitant, offer to take her to an appointment or to work with her to help her feel less anxious. Maybe you can help her work through what to say or what questions to ask when she gets there., If she's not willing to see a psychologist, look up some local support groups for people with depression. You can give her the information to encourage her to go, but it's ultimately up to her. However, one way you can encourage her is to offer to take her., Many times, people with depression will isolate themselves. Encourage her to spend time with you doing things she likes or taking a walk with you. Getting out and seeing people can help on the road to recovery.Of course, you have to meet people where they are. If she doesn't feel like going out right away, ask if she wants some company at home or if she wants to come over to your house.

, You're only trying to be helpful by offering advice such as ""Just buck up,"" or ""You really need to snap out of this."" However, these types of statements tend to only make the situation worse. Supportive statements are much better, such as, ""I know you're going through a difficult time. I do believe you are strong enough to get through this, but don't be afraid to ask for help."""

For example, a local café might be the meeting place for a new mom’s club. Or, you might find a group especially for teenagers sponsored by a science museum or church.;
, A group or club organized around a hobby allows you to meet people interested in similar things. Don’t feel that you have to be an expert already: people love teaching new folks about their favorite hobbies! In fact, taking up a new, interesting hobby might be the best way to expand your circle of possible friends. Visit local stores that cater to your hobby. Talk to the people there and ask them questions.


Sing! Choirs and choruses foster friendships more quickly than other social activities.Sign up for a cooking class. Preparing and eating food together helps to build social connection.
Join a hiking club or rock-climbing group. The combination of being outside and moving around will allow you to talk to many new people, as well as improving your physical fitness.
Take part in a book club. Most large libraries host book clubs, and many bookstores also advertise them. Some book clubs focus on a special interest or theme.

, Working together in a common cause will help you to develop closer connections with new people.


A regular volunteer commitment allows you to get to know people over time. Take on a shift at an animal shelter, or sign up to tutor with your local school system or church.
Other volunteer commitments might be briefer but more intense. Working together on a political campaign can forge significant bonds, especially in the weeks leading up to a major election or vote.

, Once you’ve had several interactions with someone, it’s much easier to become friends. You won’t be make instant friends at the end of your first volunteer shift or club meeting. But after a several months of doing something side-by-side, friendships are likely to develop.


For example, if you sign up to work on the school newspaper, try to join the department that seems the most interesting and friendly. Then, pitch in and stay late.

, You will attract people to you by accepting yourself and by accepting who they are.Don’t start off by complaining about the faults of past friends or the difficulty of meeting new people. Instead, emphasize the positive. Express interest in the people you meet. Present yourself in an up-beat, friendly way.

, Once you’ve met some people, the next step is to socialize with them.


Invite members of your new club to get ice cream after the next meeting.
Offer to host the next session of your book club at your house – and maybe make cookies for everyone!
If you find a shared interest with someone, propose a relevant activity. For instance, if you and a fellow volunteer both love art, you could suggest checking out a new exhibit together. Invite more than one person to be clear that you’re looking for friends, not a romantic interest.

, Just as in romantic relationships, friendships are based on mutual attraction. If you find yourself looking forward to seeing someone again, chances are that you’ve found a potential new friend.

, Choose friends who can understand or share important aspects of your life. People are often friends with people similar to them, and there’s nothing wrong with that.You might bond over similar past experiences or shared challenges.


Establish connections by talking about what you have in common. If you hear someone quote your favorite movie, tell them that you love it, too. Ask questions and offer examples from your own life.

, Make sure that you are open to friends who might challenge some of your assumptions. The best friends help to broaden our horizons.


Look for clubs and organizations that have a range of different people in them.
Remember that everyone has many different aspects. Someone might come from a very different sort of family, but have precisely the same kind of enthusiasm for chess as you do!
Having a diverse set of friends helps you to relate to a wider range of people. You learn more about the world, with positive results not only for your social life, but your professional life as well., A good friend doesn’t have to agree with everything you say. But they must care about your life and listen to you. You need friends who will respond to you and support you on your own path.If someone never laughs at your jokes or gets outraged on your behalf, they’re not going to be a real friend.

, If someone is friendly to you, but mean to other people, or if they spend a lot of time gossiping about their other friends’ shortcomings, they are unlikely to become a really good friend. In the end, they will treat you the way they treat their other friends.

, This might sound obvious, but when you’re lonely, it can be tempting to grab on to anything that seems like friendship. Real friends, though, make you feel genuinely happy. You should laugh together and look forward to hanging out. If something feels off, it probably is. Let that person go and keep meeting new people.

, Even if a new friendship doesn’t take off, treat that person politely and respectfully. People change over time, and you might find yourself growing closer to them later on.

, As friends get to know one another, they move on from safe topics, such as the weather or sports teams, to more personal matters.Ask your new friends about themselves, and share your own experiences and feelings.


For example, if a new friend mentions a difficult experience, invite them to say more about it. Don’t pressure them, but let them know that you are interested and that you care.
Talk about your hopes and fears. It’s ok to be a bit vulnerable with a friend.

, Close friends often share regular meeting times or activities.These rituals provide the framework for deepening your friendship. You shouldn’t force them, but when it feels natural, look for ways to develop these sorts of rituals.


Suggest a weekly meeting time. Perhaps you can have lunch on a certain day, or watch the same TV show together.
If you’re both big fans of the actor or movie franchise, make plans to go together when the next installment comes out.
Meet up before going to a larger party or club meeting. It’s always nice to walk in with friends!

, Don’t let the demands of family or work mean that you go for weeks or months without seeing them. Recognize that friendships will wax and wane. Sometimes, for example, a friend might need a lot of support – after the death of a loved one, for example. Other times, you might just catch up once or twice a month.
Send a message to tell your friend you’re thinking of them, even if you’re both too busy to plan a get-together right away.
Stay in touch with your friends, even if you live far apart.

, Friendships offer a network of support and protection.You don’t need to fight your friend’s battles, but don’t indulge in gossip or talk about your friend behind their back.

, If your friend is having a hard time, be sympathetic and try to understand their perspective. Your most important role is to listen, not to offer advice or try to “fix” your friend’s problems.

Be open to meeting someone.,
Don't rush getting into the person's personal sphere.,

Build a solid relationship.,
Be loyal and dedicated.",How to Nurture a Friendship Into a Lifetime Partnership," Meeting potential marital partners can happen when we least expect it. It can be at school, work, church, bars, or even a funeral. The important factor, however, is that the basis of the meeting should be friendship. If it is anything other than this such as trying to see if you can pick-up women/men then you are setting yourself up for regret. The meet should be based on certain commonalities.


The initial meet should be a basis of finding out who the person is and why they find themselves in the place that they are in. Note, physical attraction is at the forefront of relationship disasters. Stay away from meeting a potential partner based on physical attributes; instead look for personality and character qualities.





;
, In time, get to know the person, and if you 'roll in the same circles', have a similar or common vision and feel that you can submit to one another then it's time to make known to that person that you think of them as a valued partner. A marriage is a business partnership.

, Find out things about each other that you must learn to deal with and live with. All this while, refrain from physical contact! Tough. The single most biggest destroyer of relationships is that it is based and founded on physical contact, getting busy, hanky panky... After ten years of the physical, which was surely great, what then does the relationship cling to?

, After figuring out the hard stuff, now it's time for the harder stuff. Working together towards common goals that you established as part of your vision statement, achieving these goals together in unison, and laying down a solid foundation for the continuation of the partnership. Sex and the awesome physical should be the benefit of the business partnership. The physical won't necessarily fall away in this kind of partnership as the main focus will be on the common course and not the physical. And even if it does, the glue that holds this team together is the vision that they have and are working towards.

, The most awesome thing that you can do to strengthen the bond and partnership in a relationship (that no-one should ever come between), is that you should be loyal to one another and do what's best for the partnership.

Knowing how well you want to get to know someone and deciding the nature of the relationship can both help you interact appropriately.

Ask yourself if you want the relationship to stay at the gym or go outside of it.
Decide if you are looking for a work-out partner, friend or a new romance.
Always act in a way that is in-line with the type of relationship you want to build.

, Although it may be uncomfortable, there are many ways you can start a conversation with someone at the gym. Starting a conversation will be the first step in building a new friendship. Try opening up a conversation by using some of these examples: Try offering a compliment about something they are wearing.
Ask them where they found their workout gear.
Try asking about any classes or sports teams you could join.

, Asking for help can be a great way to start building a new friendship at the gym. Most people will be happy to help you out and show you how to do an exercise or operate a piece of workout gear. If they agree to help you and seem friendly, try opening up the conversation a bit to make a connection.You could try asking how to turn on a treadmill.
You might need help understanding how to use a weight machine.
You could ask if someone knows the proper form for lifting weights.

, Asking someone to partner up for a workout can be a great way to start building a new friendship.

Running with someone can be a great way to talk and get in a workout.
Working out with someone can provide extra motivation to push yourself harder.

Avoid approaching someone if they are lifting weights, running hard or are otherwise heavily working out.
Try to speak with people before or directly after their workouts.

, Offering to help someone improve their form without them asking won't be a good way to make friends. Although some people may appreciate the advice, others will be annoyed. Always avoid criticizing someone's form or technique unless you are already good friends with them.Even if you are trying to be genuinely helpful, most people won't appreciate being critiqued.
Telling someone how to do a workout without being asked will likely prevent you from starting a new friendship or romantic relationship.

, Although many people hit the gym to improve their physique, complimenting it can be a mistake. You might come across in an unfavorable way if you try to compliment how someone looks at the gym. Always keep you compliments neutral when trying to make a new friend at the gym.Genuinely complimenting someone's technique or ability can be a better way to start a conversation.
Both women and men may be made uncomfortable by compliments that are too forward. Avoid making such remarks if you are trying to build a new friendship or romance.
Offering compliments about someone's workout gear or workout plans can be safe.

, Showing off at the gym isn't a great idea when trying to make new friends. Many people aren't interested in your workouts and likely won't even notice them. Other people may notice that you're showing off and actually lose interest in being your friend. Always opt for good conversation over physical demonstrations when trying to make a new friend at the gym.Some men may try to impress women at the gym by lifting as heavy as they can, grunting, yelling or flexing. Most women won't even notice this behavior and may actually be annoyed by it.
Women who focus on looking good or showing off at the gym instead of working out, might not be taken very seriously by fellow gym goers.

Ask questions.,
Listen well.,
Joke around with people.,
Ask for help when you need it.,
Say nice things about other people.",How to Make People Fall in Love With You2," People who who pretend to know everything are not as well liked as people who are willing to ask for help. Asking questions gives other people the opportunity to help you and that makes them feel good. If you are unsure of something or just want to know what someone else thinks, ask questions to give them a chance to share their knowledge.Try to get people talking about themselves. Research has shown that when people talk about themselves, they feel the same pleasure as when they eat or receive money., Active listening is a great way to get people to love you. The better you are at listening to people when they are talking, the more they will want to spend time talking with you. Practice active listening by nodding, using neutral phrases, and rephrasing what the speaker has just said.Demonstrate that you are listening by nodding your head and using neutral phrases, such as “Uh-huh,” “I see,” and “Yes.”
Demonstrate comprehension by rephrasing what the person just said. For example, if a friend says, “I have been so busy this week,” you can say, “So you haven’t had any time for yourself lately.”

, Using humor is a great way to get people to love you too. If you know a good joke, share it with people. If you are witty, make witty remarks. Just make sure that the humor you sue is appropriate for the situation or you may end up offending someone. Look for little ways to make your companions laugh and they will love spending time with you., People who are willing to ask for help when they need it are often interpreted as more likeable than people who pretend like they know everything. Show that you are open to other people’s advice and suggestions by asking for help when you need it. Allowing people opportunities to share their expertise with you will make them feel good and love being around you because of how useful you make them feel., You can also use positive gossip in your favor to get people to love you. Instead of talking about what you don’t like about people, talk about what you do like about them. This will show others that you have a good opinion of others and that you might even be saying positive things about them as well."

Maintain a positive attitude.,
Be flexible and easygoing.,
Show that you care.,
Help people without expecting a favor in return.",How to Make People Fall in Love With You3," People who have a positive outlook tend to be happier in general and they also have better social lives.If you are always complaining and being pessimistic, people will not want to spend much time with you. Instead, try to be positive and optimistic so that people will feel happier when they are with you. Focus on good things to discuss and steer clear of negative or depressing subjects.

, People who are easy to please are easier to love. Having a laid back attitude and being willing to go with the flow opens up possibilities for the people you spend time with.

Try to adopt an open, laid back attitude to make people love spending time with you.Try asking what your friends want to do sometime and do whatever they want for the day.

, Demonstrating to others that you are a caring person will make them love you even more. Talk about your passions, be considerate of your friends’ needs and feelings, and be kind to strangers.

Offer your support if they are having a bad day or in need of encouragement.

, To make people love you, it is important to help when people need you. But sometimes we help others with the expectations that they will return the favor sometime. Demonstrate your willingness to help without expecting a return favor. Let them know that you are just happy that you can help and that you are there for them any time. Showing that you are selfless will make it even easier for people to love you."

It may also make it easier to bond with the person. Try to search out people who share some of your interests.


Try talking to people who share your hobbies, such as other members of your kickboxing class or members of a book club you belong to.
Talk to people that you meet at events, such as at a poetry slam, at a protest, or at a 5K race.
Join a Meetup group on Meetup.com to find people who share your interests. There are meetups for board games, hiking, knitting, and other special interests.;
, Good friends will be able to support you without judging you. Even if they don't agree with everything you do, they'll still show they care by listening to you, showing compassion, and staying with you through good and bad times.A friend who doesn't listen well will change the subject, try to one-up you, or tell you how to fix your problems.They won't really care about what you're saying and might be more interested in giving you advice or getting you to listen to their problems.

, True friends will be curious about what's going on in your life. They'll ask how you're doing and care to hear the answer. In your daily interactions, notice people who ask about your opinions and feelings. If you're having trouble determining if anyone in your life is really interested in you, ask yourself if they:Actively talk with you to get to know you better.
Go beyond making small talk about school, work, or the weather.
Avoid distractions when they're with you, like looking at their phone.

, Good friends will let you freely express yourself without judging. Pay attention to current friends and acquaintances. Notice how they treat you and other people.


If you identify as gay, a good friend is someone who will be accepting of your sexuality. They'll ask you questions, understand the coming out process is difficult, won't put pressure on you, and won't call you names. They'll defend you if anyone makes fun of your identity.If you don't come from a wealthy background, a real friend will understand that friendship is about more than status, labels, and brands. They'll accept you for your style or where you live. They won't hold your background against you, pity you, or make fun of where you come from.

, Good friends will consistently be there for you when you need them. In general, they'll make you feel comfortable around them and feel like you're a valuable part of their life. Look for people who follow-through on their promises or plans with you.Avoid people who tend to share secrets or gossip. Chances are you won't feel safe sharing close, personal information with them, which you should be able to do as a friend. You might want to avoid them.Stay away from people who pressure you into doing things you don't want to do. You won't be able to build trust or feel safe with people who don't have respect for your values.

, Good friends for you will be those who are in general fun to be around, self-confident, and happy. Everyone has their down days, but try to surround yourself with people who can recognize the humor in life and keep the bad things in perspective for you.Stay away from people who constantly complain about their problems or try to pull you down into their drama., Be open to trying new activities in your town or school. This will allow you to meet and interact with people who could become new friends.Volunteer.
Take a music class.
Join a team or a club.
Walk your dog.
Explore your town more.

, If you're shy, or just don't have access to or time for meeting new people in-person, consider using social media more. Chatting with people from work or school online is a great way to get to know people more. Chatting online may reduce some nervousness and allows you to talk to people from the safety of your own home.Keep in mind to be careful when meeting or talking to new friends online. You may be getting inaccurate information about who someone is.

, To get good friendships to grow, actively try to spend quality time with new friends. Plan time for something fun or interesting, such as going to a movie, going on a hike, or sharing a meal.


Be wary of always having to be the one to make time for your friends. Your friends should also be initiating and making plans with you, too.Keep in mind not to overwhelm friends by calling them too much. Avoid calling or texting late at night.If you don’t have a lot of time to spend one-on-one, schedule a group activity., Notice what your new friends like. Try to schedule activities with them around their interests. Try to connect with them by showing interest in their opinions and experiences. Ask questions about them that require more than a “yes” or “no” answer. For example, you might ask:What do you like to do on the weekends?
Who is your favorite band?
Where do you like to vacation?
When did you meet your boyfriend?
Why do you like that sports team?

, After you start a friendship with someone new, it is a good idea to reflect on the friendship to see if it is something you want to continue. Try asking yourself some questions to evaluate the friendship, such as:


Do we mesh well?
Do we get each other and enjoy each other's company?
Do I feel safe, trusting, and open?

, A true friendship is one where you’ll connect over meaningful things, not just because you’re on the same team or prefer the same brand of clothing. It doesn’t matter what other people think of your friendship, it only matters how you feel in the friendship. A friend that might be more superficial or focused on appearances will:Criticize you.
Be dramatic or negative toward you.
Disrespect your needs and opinions.
Take advantage of you.
Manipulate or control you to do what they want.

, Don't be afraid to stick up for what you believe in, even if your friends disagree. A real friend will respect your opinion, let you express your beliefs, and let you make your own decisions. Be wary of friends who criticize you, bully you, or don’t listen to you.


You can speak up for yourself while still avoiding blaming your friend. You can say, “I feel__when you do/say___. I need you to___. Can you do that?” For example, “I feel frustrated when you make fun of the music I like. I understand that you like different music than me, but I need you to stop. Can you do that?”

, You may enjoy having some friendships that aren’t as deep or close as others. Establish clear rules and limits for yourself with all of your friends, whether real or superficial. Let your friends know your comfort level on how you spend time with each other.Some good boundaries to set with fake friends include:


Avoid online communication and gossiping.
Set online privacy settings to make their access to your information limited.
Avoid frequent text messaging.
Spend time in groups rather than one-on-one.
Turn down invitations or say “no” when you need to.

, Rejection is a normal part of friendships and may be hurtful, but you don’t have to take it personally. A friend who rejects you may be doing so for any number of reasons. Focus instead on finding and keeping better friends who won’t reject you for who you are., If you're not comfortable being yourself around people then your friends might have a hard time feeling comfortable around you. Don't be fake, don't say you like things just because other people do, and don't try to be someone’s friend just because it would make you more popular.

, You’ll have to like and accept yourself in order for your friends to like you too. You should not have to work hard to be perfect for your friends to like you. You will start to accept yourself more if you can:Forgive yourself for any mistakes you make.
Be open with others.
Avoid calling yourself names.

, Make your friends feel like they have been heard and understood. Listen closely to what your friends say. Try not to judge them, make fun of them, or think of how you’re going to reply.To be a better listener with friends, you should summarize what they said, ask for clarification, and show empathy and understanding.You might say, “It sounds like you were feeling really disappointed that happened. Is that right?”

, Don’t let your friends do all the talking. A good friendship is one in which you both feel comfortable sharing equally. Allow yourself to be vulnerable and share what’s going in your life too, without feeling a need to compete with their experiences.Keep in mind that you don’t have to share your whole life story or deepest secrets with people, particularly around newer friends. Start small and see if you can trust your friends.For example, you may disclose a childhood fear of heights before disclosing something more important, like your religion or sexuality.

, Learn how to be alone and apart from your friends. While it’s important to rely on and connect with your friends, you don’t want to cling to them or for them to be dependent on you. Find ways to be alone at least once a week by:Playing an instrument.
Taking a walk.
Journaling.
Avoiding spending too much time online.

Understand what you want by way of having people be friends with you.,
Be friendly.,
Be considerate of other people.,
Notice the person and be actively aware of them.,
Be supportive.,
Match the effort of the other person.,
Be proud of other people.,
Keep confidences.,
Be loyal.,
Be authentic you.",How to Make People Want to Be Your Friend," There are varying degrees of friendship, from the closest best friends to the circle of ever distancing friends whom you may not see often but who still are counted as your friends and people you can trust and rely on, and who can feel the same way about you. Realistically, the circle of close and best friends must, by necessity, be small. But you can have many friends as a whole with whom you feel comfortable to spend time and catch up with and to know they've got your back when in need.


Realize that different people have different interpretations of what it means to be a friend. You do need to be open-minded and ready to learn from others rather than treating friendship as a narrow concept. However, at the heart of friendship is loyalty, the ability to get along even when holding polar opposite opinions, a willingness to listen and a sense of trust.;
, To have friends, it may come across as trite, but you need to be friendly. This means that you must be prepared to be open to other people, to be encouraging and to not be afraid of making the first move to introduce yourself and start a conversation. It also means not expecting other people to respond in kind; be unconditional in your friendliness, don't attach expectations or ""must-dos"" to it.

, Hold doors open, carry their parcels and be there when they need a hand. Respect their time and keep your promises when you make them. Importantly, be honest with people.

, When a person feels ignored, they automatically go into a defensive mode and start thinking negatively toward the person ignoring them. Do your best to make each and every person feel like they are the only person that matters for the time that you interact with them. This is a skill any person can master if they so wish, just by being attentive and genuinely interested in each and every person they meet.


Always be interested in what the other person's story is. Ask questions, ask for clarifications and be genuine in finding out more about them.

, When a person needs help, advice or guidance, be a support for them. Offer your help where needed and provide your advice if asked. Don't force unwanted advice onto people though, especially the preachy, judgmental sort that causes people to want to wriggle away. Just look for the ways in which you can offer support that will actually help and do good, and stand back to think about how you'd feel in the same position of need.


Remember that often you're not expected to solve a friend's problems. But you can let them know you're there for them, which is often what they really need to know. And it can't hurt at times to suggest a good lawyer, doctor, psychologist, car repairer, etc., as relevant.

, It's very simple––put back in what you take out in relationships. If they go to the trouble of helping you in some way, then be sure to return the favor. If they take the time to sit down and talk to you, then do the same for them. If they make the effort to treat you as a friend, then do likewise. By matching the effort, you ensure equal relations and can be assured that the friendship will endure with each person so treated.

, Notice their accomplishments and talents and compliment them often on these. Don't hold back on giving credit where it is due; people love and need to hear that they're doing a good job, achieving a goal, doing their best and making the world better for everyone. This form of recognition occurs so infrequently, that you have the upper hand when you make a conscious effort to compliment other people on the things that matter, and do it often. Through doing this, you can show them that you admire their efforts and tenacity, you respect them and you are proud to be their friend.

, Friends are people who hear secrets and don't tell. They know the worst and don't care because they are there for you and have your back. Thus, you must cultivate the ability to stay quiet on the titillating facts you learn about your friends and keep those locked away in the treasure chest of your mind. Being non-judgmental can go a long way to helping you to achieve this because you won't feel so offended or shocked that you just have to divulge for gossip's sake. By being non-judgmental, you can act as an observer and may even have a role in offering objective advice.

, Following on from keeping confidences, also defend your friends. Don't allow gossip about them to go on unchallenged; step in and inform the gossipers that you are the person's friend and that they are rumor-mongering. Be there for your friends through the hard times as well as the good, so that they know you are solid and trustworthy. Remember––loyalty isn't about solving their problems for them or even agreeing with them or their actions. It is about putting the friendship before judgment and not giving up on it.

, The main advice of all is to stay you through each and every friendship. You don't need to reshape yourself for others. While it is normal to communicate in different styles with different people, depending on their age, rank and personality, this is not the same as changing yourself completely to fit someone else's expectations. Know the difference and don't be afraid to let other people know the real you, for if they don't, then you're not real friends together.

Understand that wikiHow is not solely for making friends.,
Realize that you may or may not get to meet wikiHowians in person.,
Contribute to wikiHow articles.,
Be respectful.,
Use Talk pages and email.,
Be honest.,
Exercise caution.",How to Meet a Person on wikiHow," It's okay to make friends on wikiHow, but a common misconception is that wikiHow is a social media site. It's not; wikiHow is a wiki, not a social networking platform of any sort. Chatting excessively while making no edits to the site is frowned upon and may actually get you blocked if you leave more Talk messages than constructive edits.


Refrain from using wikiHow as a place to solicit a date or romantic relationship. wikiHow and its community is not the place for that. wikiHow's Online Dating articles, however, can be a good place to start if you want to know how to find a romantic relationship online.;
, Meeting someone on wikiHow may not extend to meeting them in person. If you're a good, active contributor, you may get invited to a wikiHow Meetup, which enables you to meet some of the wikiHowians that are attending that year's meetup. However, not everyone can go to meetups for various reasons. Not every friendship developed through wikiHow will be developed in real life, and that's okay. Every friendship is different; not meeting a wikiHowian in person doesn't make your online friendship with them any less real., One of the best ways you can meet people on wikiHow is through contributing to wikiHow articles. It doesn't have to be anything huge - it can be something simple like spellchecking. Soon enough, somebody will reach out and send you a message. Don't feel pressured to write an article straight away, but at the same time, try to make your contributions good ones. Generally, the better your contributions, the more messages you'll end up getting.


Contribute constructively - blanking, vandalizing, or spamming wikiHow articles will cause people to view you as a troll or vandal, and won't get you the kind of attention you want.

, Whether you reached out to someone or someone reached out to you, it's important to treat other wikiHowians with respect. Avoid using ALL CAPS (which is viewed as yelling or shouting), profanity, or insults, and be kind to those who reach out to you. Even if it seems like they're criticizing your work, they're most likely just trying to help.


If someone actually criticizes you, rather than your work (e.g. ""Your edits on this article are stupid""), feel free to reach out to an administrator; they'll handle the situation for you.
At some point, someone is probably going to troll you. Avoid responding to them and just revert their messages. Responding will just make them more likely to keep trolling.

, It's great to make friends on wikiHow, but you'll need to find a way of communicating with them. The most obvious way is the Talk page, but seeing as this causes work for Recent Changes patrollers, you may want to use email. This can be a great way of striking up conversation with wikiHowians!


Talk page messages are not received in real-time, and even the most active contributors have to step away from the computer now and again. If someone doesn't reply to your Talk page message right away, don't spam them with messages. This is annoying to them at best, and can get you temporarily blocked at worst.
Keep in mind that if you make an abusive comment over email or do anything against wikiHow policy, the person you emailed can forward your email to an administrator, who can revoke your email privileges.

, Nobody likes being lied to. When communicating with the wikiHowians, be honest about yourself and anything associated with you. People want to be able to trust you on wikiHow, whether it comes to edits you make or your personal life. Keep in mind, it's better to not give the information in the first place than to intentionally give false information.


Don't be too honest; if someone asks you for personal information, such as where you live, your phone number, or so forth, don't give it to them. You might be honest, but you can't really know for sure whether they are.

, You never know what goes on behind the other end of the screen. While wikiHow is a friendly community filled with great people, some people on wikiHow might not be the same as the others. Be safe online; don't give out personal information that could be used to identify you (full name, address, phone numbers, workplace or school, etc.), and never agree to meet up with someone in person by yourself. Take someone with you or go to a crowded place. wikiHow meetups are a fairly safe place to meet wikiHowians; there are plenty of other wikiHowians around as well.


Even if you've met the wikiHowian in person, whether one-on-one or at a wikiHow meetup, be careful of what information you give to them. Just because you know a wikiHowian in person doesn't mean you should let your guard down online. Keep personal information off of Talk pages, and share it privately instead.

For example, what about friends that changed schools or jobs or are just involved in different activities than you? Maybe consider dropping them a friendly text or Facebook message saying ""hi."" If they respond positively, maybe suggest a meet up in the near future.Looking for opportunities to reconnect with people you once knew casually is a great way to build new friendships quickly. You already know something about each other so it's not like you're building a friendship from the ground up. In general, it's easier to turn people you know casually into real friends than it is to meet someone totally new and build a friendship.;
, Expand your social circle by becoming friends with your existing friends' friends. This is another way to build a friend network quickly. Plus, you'll already have something in common: your mutual friend!Ask your friends to bring someone they think is cool to a party or social gathering and have them introduce you.
Chances are that if you like your friend, you'll probably like most of your friend's friends too.

, Going out with your current friends increases the likelihood that you're going to meet other people and expand your social circle. Remember that you can't make friends staying at home by yourself!Good invitations to accept are ones involving parties with big crowds. These include birthday parties, holiday parties, housewarmings, weddings, among lots of other functions. This is a sure-fire way to meet lots of new people and potentially make new friends.

, Taking up a new activity or enrolling in a course on something you've always wanted to try not only gets you out there and doing something new but also opportunities to meet NEW people.Activities, workshops, and classes are a great way to meet people quickly. The nature of the activity or course forces engagement with the other participants and will help turn everyone into fast friends. You also have a ready-made icebreaker in the activity itself!, You can find different groups on various social networking sites, such as Meetup.com. There are a ton of interest-specific groups out there, including groups for writers, vegetarians, board game lovers, cyclists, runners, and so on. You should be able to find a groups that corresponds to one of your passions!Group meetups usually happen each month and will probably include generally the same people each time but with a few new additions here and there.

, The internet can be a great way to meet new people instantly and in real time, as long as you do so safely. Try frequenting online forums related to your interests. Participate in the conversations and add value to the discussions. Over time, you'll come to know these people as friends and you can always arrange to meet up on Skype or in-person down the line.Remember to be safe. Don't disclose any personal information about where you live or how to contact you. Use your discretion about what you put on the Internet and make available to the world.

, Once you've put yourself out there and actually met someone new, you need to make the first move to turn the meet-and-greet into a real friendship! Say hello and share something about yourself, then give the other person the chance to say something about herself.Start with something easy and casual, like how she knows the hostess if at a party, or whether she got caught in the rain that day. Once the ice is broken, making a real and more meaningful connection will be easier.

, Starting and keeping up a conversation requires multi-tasking. You need to make and hold eye contact (but not in a creepy way!), smile, look pleasant and open, and say something clever.Doing all these things at the same time sends out a good vibe to the people around you and shows them that you are someone worth being friends with., Although asking questions of potential new friends shows that you're interested in them and what they have to say, don't appear like you're launching an investigation. No one wants to feel like they're under the spotlight or in the middle of some sort of investigation; this is one of the easiest ways to make someone feel uncomfortable.Intersperse questions with statements or comments. For example, when they tell you what they do for a living, maybe ask them a question about how they got into their careers and then share an anecdote about how you got into yours.

, Make statements that include both you and the person you're talking to in a group; this is great way to establish a sense of rapport, camaraderie, and intimacy, as though you've known each other for longer than you really have.These statements might be something like ""I don't know about you, but I'd die for a burger right now"" or ""I think we can both agree that this DJ is the worst, right?""
Research has shown that talking like friends is important to making ""fast friends,"" so to speak, because it creates a sense of interpersonal closeness., If you want to let a new person know how cool you are, go for subtlety over blatant self-promotion. You don't have to necessarily downplay your accomplishments, but don't turn the conversation into a list of your Top 10 achievements. This is boring for other people and suggests to them that you're not looking for friends, but followers.For example, let other people know about one really incredible thing you've done - like climbed one of the world's tallest mountains or lived for a year in China. This might capture their interest and make them want to talk more to you.

, An extroverted personality and sense of humor attracts people to you. In addition, people are more likely to trust you when you show them that you trust them enough to be able to laugh at yourself. By being open, other people will want to mirror that and be open with you in turn!Try telling a story about something embarrassing or funny that happened to you. One good type of story to tell would be one that is very relatable, such as a story about getting lost when traveling or rushing to get somewhere. Usually everyone can relate to these types of stories and this is one way to start building a sense of connection between you and these new acquaintances.

, This is a scientifically proven procedure for making friends quickly through conversation. Researchers have developed a technique that will help two people become close friends with almost anyone in less than 60 minutes. This technique works best when you meet someone one on one, so it is ideal for situations like meeting someone for coffee or at a party. Basically the key is that both individuals need to gradually disclose personal information using a set of predetermined and incremental questions.Begin by asking something that is just slightly personal. Make sure that you relate the question to what you are currently talking about. For example, if the other person is discussing an unpleasant phone call she recently made, ask, “When you make a telephone call, do you rehearse it beforehand?” After your new friend answers, it's your turn to reveal something personal about yourself, such as “I actually practice a bunch of times before I call someone I don’t know that well.”
Don't ask questions that are too personal too quickly after the beginning of the conversation. This can be perceived by your conversational partner as off-putting and unpleasant. Start off easy and work towards more personal questions. After around 30 minutes of talking, you can start asking deeper questions, such as “What is your most terrible memory?” or ""When was the last time you cried in front of someone else?” By starting with the easier but still personal questions, the progression to deeper and more probing questions will be more natural because there will by that point be an established sense of closeness as more and more information is revealed.
Other questions used by researchers include: Would you like to be famous? In what way? When did you last sing to yourself or to someone else? Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die? If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be? If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?Remember to reveal as many personal things about yourself as your new friend is telling you. If you are also sharing about yourself, the other person will become more comfortable opening up to you. In the end, you'll have a new, close friend after 45-60 minutes!, Irrespective of whether you've had a long or short chat, you want to make sure you will see this person again before your time runs out. Try inviting her out for something in the near future. Say, for example, ""Would you like to come to __________ tomorrow?"" or ""I'm doing __________ later. Want to join?"" If she responds positively, then you've secured some of their time for the near future, which is key to creating a quick friendship., Although you may have met new people and had conversations with them, there's no guarantees that you've actually become friends immediately. Instead you need to create a sense of interpersonal closeness. Bond with each other over the things you have in common. Finding those connections and commonalities usually makes a friendship stronger because you realize you share something that most people don't. You'll also both feel more understood in the world.For example, maybe you both love the same TV show and are the only two you know who actually watch it or maybe you both are in the same profession and can talk shop with each other about your daily trials and tribulations. Finding these moments is what brings a friendship to fruition.
Of course, this connecting means that you have to open up about yourself, even perhaps the things that you don't usually like to talk about (like your parent's divorce or a childhood illness or trauma). You don't have to reveal everything at once, but once you do you'll realize that it can be refreshing to talk to someone and have them accept and embrace you. Be sure not to draw away from the other person if they want to have more deeper conversations. Remember that friendship is about giving and receiving., Seeing the other person is key to a growing friendship. Sometimes this will be easy enough if you both do an activity together. But be sure to also propose get-togethers and hang-outs outside of that commitment.Don't be bummed out if you don't start hanging out all the time. With some people, you might fall into an almost immediate routine of seeing each other all the time. With others, the one-on-one time might be less frequent due to work, school, family or other commitments. Making the effort to make plans is what's key here.
This step is ongoing. You need to keep spending time with someone to make a friendship strong and lasting., Staying in contact when you're not hanging out is one way to solidify a new friendship. Keep up with new friends by sending them texts or asking how their weekends were if you haven't seen them in a few days. This shows that you're invested and interesting them and maintaining the friendship.Don't overdo it. Don't be a needy friend. Give them a bit of time if they don't write back immediately; not everyone texts all day, every day. Once you have a better sense of how your new friend communicates, keep in touch in a manner that respects their boundaries.Do, however, show your new friend that you care. For example, if she mentioned at your first meeting that it's her birthday the following week, send her a 'happy birthday' text or email. This shows her that you cared enough to remember and starts to establish you as a legitimate friend who remembers the important things after only a week!, One thing that separates a friendship from an acquaintance is that you have a shared history with this person, a history filled with memorable experiences. It's those experiences, adventures, and memories that will bind you together. So have fun! That what's will truly make a friendship!


Plan fun outings and trips together. How often have you heard of people doing on a camping trip together who are at first casual friends and then come back and seem to be a tight group? It's time to make your own ""Remember the time we..."" stories.

, This may seem obvious, but it's not an easy concept. A friendship will blossom if each person shows to the other that they are dependable, reliable, trustworthy, supportive, and caring. These are classic friend traits and ones that make a friendship last.You don't have to be perfect but you do have to try, especially with new friends.

Smile.,
Greet them with a “hello.” If you see them in the mornings or walk past them on your way to class, greet them with “hello.” This will likely begin to spark an interest in them to know more about you and to talk to you.,

Enjoy your new friendship.",How to Make Friends with Someone You've Never Spoken to Before," When you see them, greet them with a sweet smile. Smiles indicate friendliness and warmth. You may have never smiled at or even made eye contact with them before, so they may have no idea that you want to be friends with them. Smiling will plant a seed in their mind that you have some level of interest. They won’t be as caught off guard when you actually do speak to them.;
, This also will guarantee that they notice you., This is the most basic first step in actually making friends with someone whom you have not yet met. There is a chance that they know who you are or have been wanting to talk to you as well, so think about that in case you get nervous. Take a moment to approach them when you have some downtown and introduce yourself by name.You might say “Hi, my name is Henry Locklear. I’m a junior. What’s your name?”
You might want to shake their hand, especially if you are in a professional setting.

, If you have mutual friends with this person, a great and non-threatening way to make their acquaintance is to have your friends introduce you to them. This is perhaps the easiest and most effective way to break the ice. If the two of you have mutual friends, it is all the more likely that you will hit it off as well.

, One way to begin having small conversations with them is to ask for a small favor. This is another way to guarantee that you are noticed and a way to start building rapport with them. For instance, you might ask them something like “can you grab a pencil for me?” if they are standing by the supplies desk in the classroom.You might also ask something like “can you let me borrow a piece of paper?” if you have a class with them; just make sure that you give the pencil back.

, Another great way to begin having small conversations is to ask small, simple questions. They will appreciate the opportunity to be able to help you if you ask questions like “what chapter did the teacher say we should turn to?” or “what is our homework assignment for next week?”If you’re lucky, they may begin to rely on you when they have questions as well and then you can spark up more conversations.

, You can also begin the conversation with them by making small statements that don’t necessarily require a response. Saying things like “wow, it’s a gorgeous day today” or “this breakfast is so good” are great ways to speak to them without fear, because such does not require a response. However, they will likely respond to you if interested in chatting, so continue the conversation from there., Remember that people respond well to being praised. Compliment the person on their hair, their projects, or anything else about them that you like or admire. Do not resort to flattery, however, because this will make you seem fake and like you are perhaps interested in more than just friendship.


Don’t compliment them too often, however. Once to twice per week is a good amount.

, Laughter always helps to loosen people up. Share a funny joke or a witty comment with them. Don't be discouraged if the person doesn't find it funny; it's not the end of the world., Remember that communication is twofold: verbal and nonverbal. Even when you are not speaking, you are still communicating with others. Practice open body language by keeping your legs and arms uncrossed. Avoid frowning and looking down when they speak, as well.Another technique to help make friends is “mirroring”. This involves mimicking whatever posture or expression that the person you’re speaking to is doing. For instance, if they are leaning their head slightly left, you could do the same while talking to them.

, Try not to overthink the situation. Though you want to make friends with this person, remember that they may be just as nervous as you are. Remember that your new potential friend may be shy or not accustomed to being approached by new people. If you approach them calmly, they are more likely to be calm, as well..


Breathe deeply before you talk to them. Deep breaths help calm you down.

, If you want to continue the conversation beyond asking basic favors or questions, you will need to ask them for their number so that you can communicate with them more. If they don’t have a cell phone, ask them if they have social media so you can connect with them there. You can also ask if they prefer to call or to text.


You might say something like “You seem so fun! Can I have your number so I can text you?”

, As you begin developing your friendship, you will want to start things off slow so that you don’t overwhelm the other person and so you avoid oversharing. Though a necessary part of friendship building is getting to know each other, remember that you have time to do so, so you should not rush it. Start off by asking them only slightly personal questions.For instance, you might ask where they live, if they have siblings, their favorite movie, favorite book, etc.

, As your relationship continues to grow and develop, you can increasingly begin to ask the deeper questions which will help you grow an even closer friendship with one another. Think about the things that you want to know about them and begin asking them these questions.For instance, you might ask something like “What’s your favorite childhood memory?” or “What’s your relationship like with your mom?”

, In asking your new friend to share things about themselves, don’t forget that you should also be opening up as well. When they ask you a question, you should answer it as long as you feel comfortable and you trust them with the information. Never ask them a question that you yourself would not feel okay answering.


Also, you can answer your own questions. For instance, if you have asked them something like “What do you want to do when you grow up?”, you can also answer that question for them after they have had time to answer you.

, Take some time to find out what kinds of things they are interested in and share your own interests as well. If your interests should align in some areas, that’s great! But if they don’t, that’s okay, too. You can take the time to learn about each other’s interests.Find out what kind of food, movies, books, and hobbies they like.

, Not everyone is meant to be your friend. There are certain qualities and characteristics that needs to exist between two people in order for a true and persistent friendship to form. If this new person seems resistant or reluctant to speak to you, only responds to your texts occasionally, and never wants to hang out, then you should just cut your losses and accept that this person is not a good fit to be your friend. The good news, however, is that there are plenty of other awesome people for you to connect with!


Remember that if someone wants to talk to you, you won’t have to initiate contact all of the time and they won’t ignore your texts or phone calls. They will be happy to see you and excited about this new friendship.

, After your initial conversations, continue talking to your friend regularly. Call and text them at least weekly. The amount of contact you have will depend upon your ages as well as the frequency with which you use to communicate. For instance, if you are in high school, it is normal to talk to your best friends every day. However, if you are older and working, you may speak less regularly as you will have other responsibilities to manage.


Make sure not to be the only one initiating contact. If you find that nine times out of ten, you’re the one reaching out first, give your friend some space to breathe. If they reach out first, it will make your friendship stronger and more mutual.

, Spend some time with your new friend doing fun things either alone or as a part of a group. Go hang out at the mall or see a movie together, or get active and perhaps play a game of soccer or softball at the park.Group outings are fun, but remember that you will be able to deepen your relationship more if it’s just the two of you hanging out.

, In addition to doing things with them that you both enjoy doing, you can also try new things! Trying something new is a good way to get both of you out of your comfort zone and even perhaps to face your fears together. It’s also a great way to bond because the two of you will be out of your comfort zone and may have to rely on one another for support.


Bond over cooking a new dish together or trying out a new sport.
You can also conquer a mutual fear like a fear of heights together by riding a rollercoaster or something similar.

, After you have spent time in conversation and spent time hanging out with one another, continue to develop your new friendship and work on strengthening it. Continue to spend time together and to talk regularly. But most importantly, have fun! Friendships are meant to be fun!

Follow celebrities you like on their social media accounts.,
Avoid adding personal accounts.,
Comment on their posts.,
Send a private or direct message.,
Post things you know they are interested in.,
Join or start a fan club.",How to Make Friends With Famous People1," Most celebrities have accounts on all kinds of different social media platforms. If you don’t have any social media accounts yourself, you may want to sign up just to follow the celebrities you want to be friends with. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are good places to start, but other platforms like Snapchat are becoming popular among celebrities, as well.


If the celebrity you like has a personal website, they might list their social media accounts on their website. Check there for their usernames or links to their different accounts, or do a quick Google search to find them.;
, Until you are on conversational or friendly terms with the celebrity, don’t try to add their personal or private accounts. They will likely ignore or deny your request because they don’t know you, and you might mess up your chances of getting to know them. Stick to following their public accounts.


If you want to be friends with someone famous, you don’t want to come off as pushy by trying to be a part of their personal lives before you’ve been invited in.

, If you want the celebrity to notice you, you’ll need to leave them comments on their posts! If they post a photo on Instagram, leave a comment and let them know what you think. If they post something on Facebook, comment or like their post. Just make sure you don’t comment too much, or say anything that will make you come off looking desperate or obsessive.


Instead of commenting with something like “Wow I love you so much!” you might comment with something like “Looks awesome! You should check out…” and bring up something related to the post. This way, you’re connecting with them and showing them you have common interests, and not just looking like a fan.

, Sending a message directly to their inbox is a good way to make contact. For example, if you know the celebrity will be in your town, or if you’ll be visiting theirs, send them a message to tell them something fun they should check out in your city, or ask something fun you could try in theirs. This will let them know you’ll be nearby, and that you’re interested in something fun to do.


Keep in mind that if you are trying to make contact with an “A List” celebrity, or someone who is extremely popular, you might have trouble making contact at all. These kinds of celebrities rarely check their own direct messages on public accounts, and even more rarely answer those messages.

, Make posts on your own accounts that are related to the celebrity’s interests. For example, if you want to make friends with someone who is famous online and known for her makeup skills or fashion sense, you might make a post related to these things and include hashtags that the celebrity also uses on her posts. The celeb might follow these tags, and notice your posts.


Don’t go overboard and tag the celebrity’s name. You want to come off as someone who has similar interests and could possibly be their friend, not a crazy fan.

, Do a search to find out if the celebrity has an official fan club that already exists, and join it. Attend meetups and events planned and put on by the club, as these official events might involve meeting the celebrity. If there isn’t an official fan club, see if you can get in touch with the celebrity’s management and start the process of starting one.Don’t start an “official” fan club without the involvement of the celeb and/or their management. You don’t want to unintentionally infringe on copyright or end up in legal trouble.

Walk up to them on your own, not with a group.,
Make minimal eye contact at first.,
Ask open-ended questions.To draw out a shy person, you might start by asking a few questions.,
Learn to be okay with silence.,
Keep the initial encounter brief.,
Be prepared to initiate conversations.,
Talk about similar interests.,
Demonstrate open body language.,
Share a secret to deepen the intimacy.,
Don't take it personally when your friend needs alone time.People who are uncomfortable in social situations tend to become drained when they have to socialize for an extended period.,
Avoid trying to make your new friend do things outside his comfort zone.Outgoing folks might think all their shy friends need to become social butterflies is a little push.,
Try not to ask why the person is shy or acting a certain way.,
Understand his shyness.,
Be patient.",How to Make Friends With an Extremely Shy Person," Have a nice, friendly smile on your face. Be calm and polite. Introduce yourself and ask for his name. Refrain from talking in an overly excited tone which can overwhelm a shy person. Talk softly and in a moderate tone. Don't ask them all of a sudden either---it could startle them.


Be sure your approach is friendly and inviting, but not overly excited to the point where it seems insincere. You might say something like ""Hey, I noticed you standing here on your own. I'm Jeff, what's your name?""
Approaching the person on your own as opposed to with a group increases the likelihood that he will engage with you. Shy people typically feel overwhelmed and intimidated by large groups.;
, Shy people tend to feel self-conscious or awkward in social situations. This feeling is intensified when they are subjected to intense stares. Staring at the other person nonstop can feel threatening. So, aim to avert your gaze occasionally to help your new friend feel more comfortable.


Science has shown that direct eye contact increases self-awareness, which is an uncomfortable state for extremely shy people.To increase his comfort level with you, aim to make eye contact between 30-60% of the time during a conversation. Generally, you should make eye contact slightly more when listening than when talking.To further help your new friend adjust to you, stand beside him rather than face-on. This positioning can often feel less threatening. Just be sure to turn to face him slightly with your body to show interest and engagement.

, Open-ended questions, that is, those that require more than a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer are best. These types of questions allow the person responding to answer in his own words rather than offering limited response options. They also give your potential friend the chance to talk as little or as much as he would like.


For example, if you are at a social gathering, and you want to strike up a conversation with a shy person who is hiding out in corner or leaning against a wall, you can ask ""So, how do you know the host?""
Other open-ended questions might include: ""What brings you here today?"", ""What kind of things do you do for fun?"" or ""What was your impression of the film?""

, Conversation involves a natural ebb and flow of speaking, listening, and silence. When you're outgoing, you may assume silence is a red flag that your attempt to socialize is failing. It's not. A few seconds of silence is typically okay, especially with a shy person. These individuals may require longer periods to process what was said and respond accordingly. After the silence settles in, simply choose to start a new thread in the conversation or take the opportunity to end the exchange.If you want to continue talk, you might try to find a connection from something that was said earlier like ""So, you said your brother works on cars?""
If you want to save both of you from an awkward silence, you might say ""Well, nice meeting you, Becky. We'll have to catch up again sometime.""

, Even if an awkward silence doesn't threaten the conversation, it is still a good idea to keep the exchange short and sweet. Once the two of you have briefly interacted find a natural lull in the conversation to make your exit.


Shy people take some time to warm up to new people and new situations. Respect that need by limiting the first exchanges, then gradually the duration of interactions as the person becomes more comfortable with you., If you're serious about making friends with an extremely shy person, you will have to initiate. This means having quite a few conversation-starters in your pocket and often having to pick up the ball when the conversation starts to lull.


Of course, in some cases, the shy person might warm up quickly and start engaging more. However, in the early stages of your friendship, you will have to be prepared to start and/or carry the conversations., When starting a conversation with a shy person, you may want to avoid small talk. In general, many introverted people prefer more engaging and deeper conversations about ideas as opposed to surface-level topics like the weather or weekend plans.Try to stimulate your shy friend by observing what she seems interested in talking about and sticking to those topics.
For example, if your friend seems to light up when discussing a certain television show, try to get her to go into more detail about it. You might ask ""Who's your favorite character on the show, and why?"" or ""Tell me about the episode that officially made you a fan of the show.""

, Shy people are often fearful of social interaction, sometimes responding to these circumstances with physical signs such as sweating, a pounding heart, or a red face. They often worry excessively about how others view them.Use your own body language to create a soothing and less-threatening exchange. When you are around your shy friend, be sure to:Make occasional eye contact (don't expect any in return)
Orient in her direction during conversation
Lean in to show interest in the conversation
Keep your arms and legs uncrossed and relaxed at your sides
Smile and nod to encourage her to continue talking

, Self-disclosure is a bold yet effective way to turn a casual acquaintance into a friend.Friends know things about one another that the general public may not. If you're hoping to upgrade your relationship with a shy person, open up to her in a personal way.


One of the main aspects of friendship is intimacy. You can achieve intimacy through appropriate self-disclosure. Be warned, however, that it's unnecessary to share your deepest, darkest secret. In fact, doing so, may scare your new friend off because of the sudden intimacy.
Start with something rather small but that many people don't know. You might even disclaim your self-disclosure by saying ""A lot of people don't know this but..."".

, Allow him time alone without getting offended. It's not about you; your friend just needs time for quiet to recharge.


Although it may not seem like it, your shy friend may be terribly uncomfortable during the entire interaction. He may be anxious to get away to process the exchange.

, Shyness can be a serious social detriment that inhibits people's relationships and work lives.It's not something that will go away by challenging the person to take a risk.


If you take this route, you can end up causing distrust and making your friend retreat from you. You might suggest a few ""exciting"" things to do with your new friend, but if he doesn't seem interested, don't force the issue.

, Another quick route to ruining the friendship is commenting on your friend's shy nature. Treat your friend just as you would any other. There's no need to point out his shyness.


Asking why your friend is so quiet or introducing him as 'the shy one' can be quite insulting.
This will probably annoy your friend and cause him to be even more self-conscious. As a result, your behavior may actually make him withdraw even more rather than getting him to open up.

, By doing a bit of research you can better understand and empathize with your friend's social behavior. According to science, shy people tend to feel awkward or fearful of social situations, particularly when around new or unfamiliar people. Your friend may experience a pounding heart or an upset stomach. He may think that everyone is looking at or judging him.You can be a better friend to a shy person by recognizing that all people feel shy on occasion. Your friend just appears to be extremely shy.
He probably isn't being shy because he doesn't like people or even because he wants to avoid them. He is simply uncomfortable in most social situations. He probably badly wants to belong, but doesn't know how. Help him feel a sense of belonging by refraining from judging or labeling his behavior., Whether it's sitting through awkward silences or waiting for your extremely shy friend to open up to you, you have to exercise patience. If you are genuine and kind, eventually this budding relationship will fully blossom.Don't push your new friend to open up. Allow the friendship to unfold at its own pace. That way, you both will be comfortable with where the friendship is going, and your shy friend can be himself around you.

Go to places the celebrity frequents.,
Make friends with friends of the celebrity.,
Find out about their other ventures.,
Go to filming locations.,
Get a job in their industry.",How to Make Friends With Famous People2," If you live near the celebrity, find out where that celeb goes on a regular basis. Maybe it’s a certain fitness club, coffee shop, or grocery store. If you go to the same places as the celeb, you’re more likely to casually run into them and be able to strike up a conversation and eventually a friendship.


Even if you only see each other in passing for a while, the celeb will see you as a familiar face, and as someone who doesn’t get crazy or excited like a fan when you see them. Then, once you finally do talk to them, they might be more willing to treat you like a potential friend.

, One of the best ways to meet famous people is to become friends with people who already know them. That way, that friend can introduce you as a mutual friend, and you’ll be able to hang out in groups. The celeb will be less likely to see you as a fan and more likely to see you as a friend if you meet them through someone they already have a relationship with.Don’t bring up the celebrity right away when making friends with their friends. Their friends will probably know you’re just trying to meet the famous person, and they might not be so willing to hang out with you, or to introduce you. Give it some time before you bring it up, or let it happen naturally.

, Some celebrities have multiple venues they work in. For example, some actors might also be restaurant owners, or have their own fashion lines. Find out what other side ventures the famous person is into, and get involved in those. That might be a better way to meet and connect with them.If you meet the famous person through their side venture or business, you might have easier access to them, as this other venture might not have as big of a following as their main one.

, If you’re interested in making friends with actors, go to where they work. For example, many films and television shows are filmed in Los Angeles, but you could do a little searching online and find out more specifically where things are being or will be filmed and go to those places.


Stick with public places, rather than staking out sound stages and back slots at movie production properties. For example, if you know a certain show films in a small town, or will have a few filming days in a public location—like a certain city block in NYC, or a certain landmark—spend some time in that spot.

, One way to meet famous people and develop a relationship is by working in the same fields as they do. For example, if you want to meet actors, you might get a job or internship working for a production company, or television network. If you want to meet famous models, you might consider working for a modeling agency or fashion designer. If you happen to have any experience with the technical side of filmmaking or television production, you could try to get a job on the set of a movie or TV show. This will help you meet famous people naturally, and you’ll be able to spend a lot of time with them to build a relationship.

Make sure you aren’t stalking the celebrity.,
Avoid using famous people for their connections.,
Remember that it might be impossible to become their friend.,
Be a good friend if you do establish a relationship.",How to Make Friends With Famous People3," Don’t repeatedly send them unwanted gifts, follow them, stand outside their home, or generally do anything to make them feel uncomfortable. If you want to be friends with the celeb, you won’t want to make them feel unsafe. Keep a safe distance and don’t overdo it with the attention.Cyber stalking is also an issue. Don’t post anything negative the defame their character, spread rumors, or generally harass them online.

, If you want to make friends with famous people just to use them, keep in mind that they will probably see right through you. Famous people deal with strangers who just want to use them for their money or connections all the time, and they will be able to tell if that’s the case with you. Make sure you are trying to establish a friendship for the right reasons.


For example, if you do make friends with someone famous, pay your own way. If they offer to pay for things, that’s fine, but never expect or ask them to. Treat them like you would any other normal person.

, Famous people deal with obsessive fans all the time. They probably keep most people at a bit of a distance for a while until they’re sure that person genuinely wants to be their friend and isn’t just a crazy fan. Many famous people don’t communicate directly with fans online, or answer private messages. It might be very difficult to become friends with famous people at all.


Give it time if you have started communicating with someone famous. Don’t expect a relationship to happen overnight. They will probably need some time to trust you and decide they want to meet you or hang out with you.

, Once you have made friends with someone famous, be a good person and a good friend to them. If you use them or act like someone you’re not just to keep their attention, they will more than likely notice and be turned off by it. Treat them like any other friend, and they will probably appreciate it.


Famous people don’t usually want to be treated like they’re more important than anyone else, especially by people they consider friends. They would probably appreciate you treating them like a normal person, and like someone they can be themselves around.

Figure out your core values.,
Meet people in activities.,
Use the internet.,
Join a religious or spiritual organization.,
Be an activist.,
Become politically active.,
Volunteer.,
Meet regularly.,
Be aware that conflicts are normal.,
Practice friendship skills.,
Avoid talking only about your beliefs.",How to Make Friends Who Share Your Core Beliefs," Before you go and meet people, decide how you want to define your own core beliefs. You might consider core beliefs to be spiritual beliefs, political beliefs, professional beliefs, ethical beliefs or beliefs about friendship. Come up with some values that you care about, then focus on building friendships.Your core values are what represent you as an individual and what values you want to represent.For example, your core beliefs may be in following the Jewish, Christian, Mormon, or Islamic faith. You may have core beliefs about politics and how local, state, and federal government should be run. Perhaps your core values include treating all beings as deserving of love and compassion.
Remember that while having shared core values with another person is important, it is not the only thing that is needed to have a strong friendship. While exploring your core values, do some reflecting on other qualities about yourself. Ask yourself simple questions and write them down. Such as, “What are the qualities that make up who I am?” “What qualities do I like?” “What qualities do I not like?” “How do I let others see my qualities and what I feel is important about myself?” “What are my interests and hobbies?”
Journal what your core beliefs are or what you want them to be. Think about the things you frequently discuss and the topics that bring out your passion.;
, Before you make friends, you must meet people. One of the best ways to meet people is by engaging in a social activity or interest. The majority of friendships are activity-based, so make sure you have activities you can plug into. If there’s something you’ve always wanted to do but have never done it, or you have a hobby that you’d like to pick back up, now is the time to jump in. Even if you’re moderately interested in something, you might find that you enjoy it and find new friends.Join activities where you may meet other like-minded people. If you’re interested in government, join your school’s student government.
For example, if you believe fitness is important to health, attend yoga, join a running club, attend martial arts training, or start hiking. Find an activity that interests you and discover social groups around it in your community.

, Whether you want to use the internet to meet people in person or you want to make online friends, there are many platforms to connect you to others who share similar beliefs. Find event calendars or look up groups that might meet near you. If you’re interested in meeting with like-minded individuals, check out MeetUp, which is a portal for linking people to events and groups near them.A quick internet search can help you connect to websites that allow you to share with others and make friends.
Think about your safety when you meet people online. Don’t give personal information to someone you do not know, such as your phone number or address. Be cautious if someone wants to meet you in person. If you do meet, go with other people and meet in a public location such as a library or coffee shop.

, Often, core beliefs are tied to a particular spiritual practice or religion. If you’d like to make friends that share your religious or spiritual beliefs, attend a meeting. Find a local synagogue, ward, church, mosque, or temple near you. Participate in the service or rituals and introduce yourself before or afterward. Joining a spiritual organization is a great way to build community and make friends.Many religious or spiritual organizations offer classes, text studies, and small group meetings. Join one to meet people in a smaller spiritual setting.

, Whatever cause fires you up, it’s likely that other people share your feelings. You might be passionate about stopping animal cruelty, expanding human rights and social justice, or demanding access to clean water for all, to name a few. Join an activist group that appeals to you and your beliefs in your community and join it. Attend meetings and get involved in the work. Being surrounded by other activists helps you unite under a common cause and becoming friends may be easily facilitated.For example, if you’re on a college campus and want to protect animals, join a vegetarian society or animal rights group. Attend the meetings and participate in events such as handing out leaflets or protesting. You’re likely to see the same people at these events, so get to know them.
Join a community group that is already active or start your own.

, If you’re passionate about government and making your voice heard, join a local political organization. Go to town halls, encourage people to vote, and join a political party chapter near you. If you align with a particular political party, find ways to get involved and show your support. Being an active member of a local political party can help you meet others with similar values and beliefs about politics.Go to meetings, volunteer at headquarters, and work on a political campaign. These activities are often collaborations, so it’s a great way to see other people regularly and build friendships.

, Volunteering is a great way to give back to your community and make friends that share similar values and beliefs. Find a volunteer opportunity that aligns with your values. For example, if you feel animals should be taken care of, volunteer at an animal shelter or farm sanctuary. If you want to help children succeed, volunteer to be a tutor or mentor. Through volunteering, you can meet and become friends with others who share your values and beliefs.Chose a volunteering position that connects you with others. While doing secretarial work may be a good volunteer opportunity, it isn’t social. Choose a social role.

, If you find someone or a group of friends you’d like to befriend, get together more than once. Find a group that meets regularly to give you more opportunities to meet and get to know people. Friendships often build over time, so find time to meet regularly with the people you’d like to befriend.Find clubs or organizations that hold regular meetings. If you need time to warm up to making a friend, get familiar with people’s faces first, then approach them over time.

, Understand that even within the best of relationships, conflicts will happen and are a natural part of any relationship. Even best friends who share every core value and belief will still fight from time to time. Not all disagreements and arguments mean that the relationship will come to an end.

When you encounter such a situation with your friend, take care to be mindful and respectful of each other’s opinions on the matter. Take time to listen to each other’s concerns and make sure that your friend’s needs are being met. Make a conscious effort to compromise on working out a solution to whatever problems you are facing.

, To have a friend is to be a friend, so make sure you’re a good friend to the people in your life. Be kind and considerate. Listen and support the person. Let friendships develop naturally without having rules or expectations of what you want it to look like. Ultimately, be the kind of friend you would like to have.Be forgiving. Remember that friendships sometimes experience turbulence, but stick with a good friend. Remember that you’re united by your values and beliefs.

, While it’s nice to connect with others who share your beliefs, don’t make your friendship only centered on your shared values. Show that you’re interested in getting to know the person. Smile, say hello, and introduce yourself. If you’re having trouble finding something to talk about, bring up something about the environment or occasion such as, “I love this song” or, “Can you believe it’s so hot today?” Then, ask the person about what brings them to the organization or meeting or how their beliefs affect them.Ask questions about their family (“How many siblings do you have?”) and their hobbies (“What do you like to do for fun?”). Show that you’re interested in being friends with them and want to spend time with them.
Develop the skill of small talk. This is something that may not come easy for everyone, especially if you are someone who may have more introverted characteristics. A relationship isn’t just having similar and shared core values. It is about sharing life and the varying experiences that come with it. Practice having light, easy going conversations about simple topics such as music, school, work, travel, etc. Maintain a positive atmosphere and adopt the value of listening more than you speak.

Let go of insecurities.,
Be positive.,
Stop judging others.,
Be genuine.,
Watch your body language.,
Talk to strangers.,
Make the initiative.,
Say yes to new opportunities.",How to Make Friends when You Are Not Social," If you constantly criticize yourself and tell yourself that you're not likable and that nobody wants to be around you, then that's the message you'll put out there and people will be turned off. Before you can make friends, you have to first believe that you can make friends.


People who are shy tend to avoid social contact because they anticipate a negative outcome. Don't play out scenarios in your head before they happen, just take things as they come.
Tell yourself that you're social. Even if you don't believe it initially, the more you tell yourself that you are capable of making friends and that you are interesting and likable, the easier it will be for you to interact with others. Try to tell yourself this everyday. If you catch yourself criticizing yourself and saying ""I'm such a loser,"" then immediately correct the thought and tell yourself it isn't true.
Make a list of your positive qualities. No matter who you are, you absolutely do have positive qualities that you can bring to a friendship. Make a list of all the things that you think you can offer to others, like being trustworthy, funny, smart, etc. Try not to focus on superficial things like money or looks.;
, Everybody wants to be around optimistic, upbeat, happy individuals. Remember that being negative is a choice; nobody is inherently doomed to being a negative person. It will, however, take some practice to shift your perspective.


Try to counter every negative thought with a positive one. No matter where you are or what you are doing, try to find at least once positive aspect of your situation.
It's important to also be positive when talking to others. Nobody wants to be around people who constantly complain about their own misfortunes. This is especially important when meeting new people. Share the highlights of your life with them rather than the low points, and you'll instantly find that people are attracted to that and will want to know more about you.

, Nobody is perfect, not even you. If you keep waiting around for perfect people to enter your life, you will be waiting for a long time. This doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be friends with anyone and everyone you meet, but you must be willing to get to know people before casting them away.


Your friends don't have to be exactly like you. In fact, sometimes the best friendships stem from people who have opposite personalities or tastes. Don't reject people just because you don't share the same taste in music or opinions about politics. What matters is how the person makes you feel when you are around them.

, If you want to make true, lasting friends, you will have to be willing to let others in to your life and create a sense of mutual trust. Ask people how they are doing, and genuinely listen to what they have to say. Offer support if somebody confides in you, and always keep private information that they share with you to yourself.


Don't gossip about your friends. Though some friendly gossip between friends every now and then can be harmless, gossiping too much or constantly saying negative things behind other peoples' backs will reflect poorly on you, and your friends will be hesitant to trust you in the future.
Learn how to put yourself in other peoples' shoes. If a conflict of any sort arises, consider the other person's perspective, and think about how you would feel if you were in his or her position. Learning how to practice empathy will help you fight off the feelings of anger, jealousy, and resentment that may be holding you back from having meaningful friendships.

, If you are at a party or other social gathering, your body language is extremely important. Avoid crossing your arms, standing in the corner, scowling, or staring at your phone, as each of these things suggests that you don't want to be approached.


Be sure to smile. Smiling makes you look open to meeting others, less intimidating, and more attractive. Even if you have to force it, put a smile on your face. Eventually it will become second nature!

, If you want to be a social person, you can't compartmentalize your life by separating your ""social life"" from your ""work life,"" your ""school life,"" or your ""family life."" To be truly social, you must be friendly and sociable in all aspects of your life. Practice this by saying hello and being friendly to everyone you encounter, from the bank teller to your teachers to the barista at your favorite café.

, Don't constantly wait around for friends to call you and make plans. Being passive and not initiating plans sends the impression that you are uninterested in the friendship. If you'd like to see your friends, pick up the phone and call them.


Consider throwing a party and inviting all of your friends, peers, and/or coworkers. Tell them to bring some of their friends, and make an effort to meet mutual friends.
Come up with fun activities to invite your friend(s) too. Invite them to lunch, ask them if they'd like to see a new movie, or invite them to do an outdoor activity of some sort.

, Every new situation you put yourself in is an opportunity to meet new people. If somebody asks you to come to a party where you don't know anybody, then say yes. You never know who you may meet, and if you don't know any of the people to begin with, then you really have nothing to lose.


Create new opportunities for yourself. Start a new hobby, join a sports team, or travel to a new place. Try to pick activities that involve being around other like-minded individuals.

Develop your personal passions.,
Join a club or organization related to a hobby.Take your personal interests to the next level by participating in a class to advance your skills or joining a club or organization where you can meet up with others.,
Be a solo traveler.,
Meet people through professional organizations.,
Visit a dog park.",How to Make Midlife Friends1," The best way to meet new people is while you’re doing something you already enjoy. This route ensures that you come off as genuine during your interaction because you won’t be pretending to like something simply to form new connections. What’s more, when you’re actually passionate about a topic, you tend to cherish it. Luckily, that’s a nice mindset to forging and nurturing friendships, too.


Your passions can be anything from baking to rock climbing. Whatever it is you love to do, do more of it. Write time for it into your weekly or monthly schedule. This way, you’ll automatically run into people with common interests in the midst of doing something you enjoy.;
, This is a natural and very effective way to meet people, if you are middle-aged. Later in life, many people find that they have more time for hobbies that they put off or stopped making time for in their younger years. Now’s the time to connect with people in a structured format who like doing the things you do.


If you enjoy reading, sign up for a book club hosted by your local library. Do you enjoy baking? Take a class on French pastry-baking. Like music? Start attending local music festivals, recitals, and open-mic nights.
Look for clubs and organizations by searching your local newspaper or asking around at a nearby college or university.

, Another great way to make friends in midlife is with solo travel. When you travel with friends or family members, you are in a safe comfort zone, which makes it less likely that you will strike up a conversation with a stranger. Going it alone affords you an opportunity to actually notice the other people you encounter along the way and cultivate friendships with people all over the world.Try out cruises for singles (even if you aren’t) or visit an all-inclusive resort. In these locations, you are likely to find other solo travelers., If you work, you can use your career to foster new and interesting relationships. In fact, you may already be involved in an organization pertaining to your industry and never thought to use it as a benchmark for creating friendships. These groups are great because, with regular meetings and events, they already have consistency built in.That means multiple opportunities to form and nurture new connections.


Networking for your job or business can serve double-duty as a friend-finding mission. Tons of people build lifelong relationships through work—so can you. If you’re not already a member of a professional organization, ask your boss or a coworker to refer one. You can go large-scale and sign up for a national organization or join a Meetup group relating to your field.

, Walking up to others and introducing yourself comes with a lot of pressure. Thankfully, if you own a dog, he or she can help. Going to your local dog park and letting your pet stretch its legs can actually help you expand your social circle. Just think, the next time your dog runs up to another pet, he or she is helping you make an introduction to a new friend.


If you walk the same route each day or visit the park on certain days, search for familiar faces. Join another pet-owner on a nearby bench and ask “Which one’s yours?” In no time, you can be sharing funny stories and exchanging phone numbers."
"
Segue into a conversation.,
Smile and laugh.,
Ask at least 5 questions about him when you talk; you shouldn't hog the whole conversation.,
Ask him for his email address or screen name when you think things are going well.,
Don't send him an email/IM him right when you get home; wait a day or two.,
Think of the possibilities between you and your new friend:


If you want to be friends with him, that's really as far as you have to go.",How to Make Friends with a Guy You Just Met," Don't just go up to the guy and ask what his name is; mention something about him that you find interesting, and get into a conversation that way. Some examples are: ""I've read that, it's really good."" ""Sorry, that vending machine's broken. Don't you hate it when that happens?"", ""Wow, it's like these cashiers are moving underwater."", ""Nice shirt. I love their music."", ""Do you know what time it is?"".;
, Nothing puts people more at ease than if they think someone else is having fun. It will open him up more and make him more interested in talking to you.

, Just make sure they're in context and not out of the blue. Also don't tell many stories as it will probably bore him.

, Those are more casual than talking on the phone, and don't have all the cultural strings attached to ""talking on the phone with a guy"". It will make you seem less forward.

, When you do first email/IM him, restate who you are, like ""remember me from...?""

, A string of emails or the occasional IM means you did it! You've succeeded in becoming friends with a guy you just met. Congratulations on it!
If you want to be closer friends with him, invite him out to the movies with a couple of your close friends (be sure to invite guys too to make him more comfortable). If your friends get to know him, you'll probably be seeing him more often.
If you find out you like him more than a friend, also invite him to the movies with your friends. If you both like it, make it a regular thing. Start flirting with him a little; he'll get the idea. Sit next to him too, if that's possible. If he seems to want to go farther with you, invite him to the movies, just the two of you, and see what happens. Do other activities too, like going to the park, an art museum, a walk, out for a drink, etc.

Show interest in people.,
Take initiative.,
Connect offline.,
Revive old friendships.,
Extend invitations.",How to Make Midlife Friends2," A primary requirement for developing new friendships is being interested in the other person.Although you may enjoy talking about yourself, it’s polite and thrilling to give another person the opportunity to do the same. They will be pleased to chat, and view you as a great listener.


The next time you’re at a social function, strike up a conversation with someone who catches your eye. “How do you know the host?” or “So, what got you involved in this organization?” are great questions to show interest.
Be sure to use open-ended questions like those above rather than close-ended questions, which are those that demand only a short, one- or two-word answer.That way you’ll have a greater chance of moving learning more about this person and actually keeping the conversation alive.

, No doubt, one of the main reasons why many people have limited social circles is due to their fear of rejection. You worry that others will view you as lonely. You cringe at the thought of your casual invite for coffee will be turned down. This is a common concern, but you must overcome it to make friends in midlife.


Take the risk of reaching out to others by taking initiative.If you spot someone who seems to have mutual hobbies or interests, point it out and then let the person know you’d like to connect. Say something like “Wow, it seems like we have the same taste in movies. Why don’t we go see the new rom-com together?”
If the person turns you down, don’t take it personally. The person could have other obligations. Rejection is not necessarily a reflection of you.

, In recent years, everyone seems to be so connected online that face-to-face connections become fewer and fewer. Although it is wonderful to keep track of what your friends are doing through social media or catching up over email, there is no substitution for in-person interaction. Online relationships, while potentially fulfilling, cannot meet your needs when you are sick, lonely, or grieving.Make an effort to reach out to online friends and take those connections offline. Maybe you have a Facebook friend who lives in your area and has published a post sharing excitement about an upcoming local event. Send the person a quick message saying “Hi, I see you’re going to the jazz festival this weekend. I hope to see you there!”
Taking initiative with online friends indicates to the person that you are interested in forging a closer bond. Maybe you’ll hit it off, maybe you won’t. Either way, you will have made strides towards creating a new, face-to-face relationship.

, A wonderful method to making friends in midlife is by examining some of your old relationships that have slipped through the cracks. Do you have a college friend who recently moved to your area? A previous coworker who just friended you online? Reach out to one of these people and attempt to reconnect.


A major perk to these connections is that you’re already past the awkward introduction phase. Depending on your relationship with the person, you can email, Facebook message, or call to catch up.During the first encounter, mention something like “Oh, it’s been such a long time since we got together. Why don’t we go out for lunch one day next week? What day is good for you?”

, As a middle-aged person, you may have fallen into a set routine of dealing mainly with family or close acquaintances. Such a rigid schedule can get boring. Plus, it hardly provides opening to connect with new people. A great way to deepen a casual connection is by coordinating some sort of function to invite people to.


Is your church hosting a huge, annual event? Ask a few people in your gym class to attend. Are you hoping to get to know the people in your book club better, but feel limited by time? Suggest that you all grab dinner and drinks. Are you an excellent chef? Show off your skills by inviting a few coworkers over for a home-cooked meal.Just as it can help you enhance bonds by extending invitations, it can also help to accept them. Do you often turn down invites to other people’s church functions or potlucks? Start saying “yes” and you’ll be amazed at how your social calendar starts changing for the better.

Be authentic.,
Share and keep confidences.,
Show consistency.",How to Make Midlife Friends3," Starting a friendship by pretending is a waste of both your time and efforts. Making a friend simply for the sake of having a friend is unfair to the other person and to yourself. Ensure that you are putting your true self forward in your interactions with others, and not presenting a different self to impress or fake an interest.When you are genuine, a friendship has the chance to develop naturally because each person acknowledges and accepts the experiences and opinions of the other.

, A central aspect of being a friend is feeling comfortable enough with the other person to disclose parts of yourself that are not known by the general public. When two close acquaintances engage in self-disclosure, the bond between them strengthens because you have transitioned beyond small talk to something more intimate and real.


Intimacy in a friendship is marked by self-disclosure on both sides. This means that you must be willing to share your thoughts, feelings, and dreams with the other person and vice versa.You must also be willing to keep this information confidential and not share it with others.
Self-disclosure does not necessarily mean that you must divulge your deepest, darkest secrets and desires. In fact, doing so would probably alarm the other person if the relationship has previously been casual. The best route to go is to start small and gauge the other person’s reaction. If they reciprocate and do not seem affronted by your self-disclosure, then your connection has moved into more intimate territory.

, Another important attribute about being a friend is dependability. A good friend is not necessarily perfect, but he or she is consistent in words and actions. You show up when you say you will and you make an effort to maintain the bond. Friendships formed in high school or college or through work can sometimes be much easier to maintain because you are pretty much forced to see and interact with the other person.In midlife, it takes much more effort.


Of course, you may not always be available to a new friend, but being consistent shows your commitment to the friendship. Call your friend regularly to check in. Try to make time to see the person whenever possible. And, most of all, make sure they can depend on you during trying times.

Seal the deal.",How to Make Friends with Other New Parents," It can be tough searching for a new friend when you’re also adjusting to your new role as a mom or dad. Instead of going outside your regular routine to cultivate friendships, look for opportunities in things you already do, or in activities that are relevant to your new role. One great place to seek out new friendships is a parenting group offered in your local community.


You may already be signed up for a “Baby and Me” class. Here, you have a wide selection of prospects to choose from because everyone attending is probably a new parent like you.
Also, consider nursing, music, or other parenting classes offered by nearby universities, hospitals, churches, or libraries. You may be able to find such groups by checking noticeboards at your doctor’s office, at baby stores, or at the daycare center.;
, Again, you are more likely to have the time and energy to dedicate to a new parent friendship if this connection fits into your routine somehow. If you typically take your infant on a late-afternoon stroll to the park, keep an eye out for other moms or dads with babies in strollers.You will busy enough as it is adjusting to the new baby. A prospective friendship is likely to crash and burn if you count on yourself having the time to take up a new hobby or take a non-parenting related class.
In addition to the park, consider other places you go with your baby, such as the pediatrician’s office, the infant aisle at your neighborhood grocery store or the play area at a local restaurant. Aim to get out more, which increases your odds of bumping into another new parent.

, If you are a mom or dad who's hoping to enhance your physical fitness by hitting up your nearby gym, look for friends inside. Many gyms have daycare centers where you can leave your baby during your workout. If this is the case, watch for other parents who are checking in their infants and strike up a conversation.


Finding a new parent friend at the gym can serve double-duty as a workout partner, too. Ask the other parent when they usually visit the gym and make an effort to coordinate your schedules for company during your sweat session., In the age of technology, there are abundant resources on the web for forging friendships as a new parent. You can create a profile on a range of parenting websites and search for moms or dads in your area this way. You can also sign up for New Parent Meetups by checking for groups in your community.Finding a group of new parents can reduce the pressure of meeting one-on-one. What’s more, meeting up in this manner enhances your social life by providing you with a selection of potential friendships—you can make one friend or five. Plus, many new parent groups focus exclusively on parenting tips, while others include other grownup social activities like playing sports together or going out for drinks when you have a babysitter., To feel better prepared, come up with one or two questions you can ask another parent to get a conversation going.


Good conversation-starters may include asking “How old is your baby?” or “What’s his name?”
Try to relax as you start connecting with other parents. This should be easier to do than engaging in a more stressful situation, such as on a date.

, All parents turn googly-eyed when admiring their children; new parents are no different. A terrific way to break the ice with another new parent is simply to compliment them on their baby.You can say something like “I know you must hear this often, but your baby’s smile is infectious” or “That dress is absolutely adorable. May I ask where you got it?”

, There’s a chance you’re a relatively shy or introverted person. If this describes your situation, you may feel awkward approaching a stranger.One way to reduce the pressure is to look for naturally-occurring ways to start a conversation with another new parent, such as when your babies “talk” to each other at the doctor’s office or when one infant’s crying sets off another.


During such situations, it can be slightly easier to say to another mom or dad “Well, look at that. Someone’s made a new friend” or “He’s teething and really fussy lately. Is your baby teething yet?”

, Shake off your first-date jitters with the knowledge that you aren’t alone in this journey. While you may feel a little awkward trying to “pick-up” a stranger, the other parent will likely be grateful for a chance to chat or plan a play-date.


Keeping this knowledge at the forefront of your mind makes forging a new parent friendship easier. Plus, if a connection doesn’t pan out, there’s no need to take it personally. The other parent may already have too many friends and not be in the market for new pals.
Also, keep in mind that that all first-time parents are going through a similar transition. You may even want to acknowledge that up front as an icebreaker when meeting another new parent.

, Focus on the common ground between you in order to take a potential friendship to a new level. Most friendships start and grow through the shared experiences or details of the individuals. Highlight your similarities to emphasize the likelihood of you two hitting it off.For instance, you’re at the grocery store and see another mom with an infant. You might ask “How old is your baby?” If your infants are close in age, you might say “Oh, my baby was born the week before yours!” Then, you can strike up conversations about shared developmental milestones or ask for suggestions on baby equipment.

, Don’t let a potential friendship candidate walk away without getting his or her contact information. After the two of you have shared birth stories or talked for a few minutes about your baby’s sleep patterns, make the next move.Say something like “It’s so nice to meet another new mom in the area. I should get your number so we can stay in touch.” Or, you can even try a more subtle approach of “Why don’t you text me the name and number of your pediatrician? He sounds awesome!”
You might also ask to add the person on social media. Say “I’m in this really fun support group for new moms on Facebook. Give me your info so that I can send you an invite.”

, Once you have shown interest in connecting with the other parent in the future, it’s important to follow through.After you’ve exchanged numbers, reach out to your prospective friend and try to set up a playdate. Or, if you’re too shy to go for a one-on-one meeting right off, invite the other parent to a group or class that you’re involved in.


If you do plan a playdate, select a time and place that’s most appropriate for the temperament and age of your babies. For instance, if your baby is usually very fussy in the afternoons, schedule a morning meeting. That way, you are actually able to socialize rather than spending the entire meeting soothing your baby.

So, start by thinking about the minimum amount of information you need to determine if a candidate submission warrants a phone screen.;
, Be careful about how much information you request. Do you really need a street address at this point? Probably not, but it might be helpful to know what city/state the employee resides in. Don't ask for personal information such as a date of birth or social security number. Candidates don't want to give this to you at this early stage of the process. If you ask for it candidates will drop out of the process and you risk losing a great future employee.

, For example, if you are involved in hotel staffing, you may want to ask if the candidate is willing to work nights and weekends. If you are in restaurant recruiting, you might want to ask about how many years of sous chef experience a candidate has.

, Often the last two or three employers is enough. Ask for the candidate's position, dates of employment and reason for leaving. You really don't need more information than this.

, Make sure that the system you choose stores this form separately from the application. Hiring managers shouldn't see this information since it's only used for government reporting purposes.

, That approach doesn't work well with mobile.
Ask the vendor if they use their own system when they recruit staff. It's very telling if they don't!
Ask the vendor if they will integrate with any background check or assessment provider of your choosing. You may really like the vendors you're working with now -- or you may want to change them later. Many large mobile recruiting companies only work with their preferred vendors, some of which may be very expensive to deal with.
Ask if the vendor can integrate into a paperless onboarding system, HRIS, or payroll system.
Ask if the vendor can create a career page for you.
Ask if you have to use the vendor's job board or if you can use any online job board that you choose.
Ask if the vendor makes it easy to post ads on Craig's List.
Ask if the vendor supports grassroots recruiting campaigns to source local hourly candidates.

, Don't feel pressured to implement it without testing it first."

Decide if you need an 800 number.,
Contact your current service provider.,
Contact another service provider.,
Compare rates.,
Check what other features are available.,
Set up your account.,
Assign the number to a designated line.",How to Get an 800 Number," An 800 number is a toll-free number that doesn’t cost the caller anything, but will charge you by the minute. An 800 number is especially useful for businesses, as the number can be personalized to match the business product, and doesn’t cost potential customers anything to call.


An 800 number allows anybody to call from anywhere in the country, or even the world, and the call will be treated as a local call for the caller. This means that the long-distance charges that would normally apply are instead taken on by the operator of the 800 number.
An 800 number is especially important for businesses that spend a lot of time on the phone with customers. If the customer is going to have to be on the phone for 15-30 minutes per call, letting them place that call for free can be very beneficial.
An 800 number can be transferred to your existing landline or cell phone number. You will be charged minutes on your cell phone as normal, as well as the per-minute fees for receiving calls on the toll-free number.
Almost all services will allow you to attempt to personalize your 800 number. A personalized 800 number can make your business look MUCH more professional, and can lead to a serious increase in business.Besides 800, toll free can also be 888, 877, 866, and 855.;
, You may be able to get a better deal by going through your existing service provider as opposed to setting up an account with another service.

, There are a large number of companies that advertise the ability to give you toll-free 800 numbers. In order to ensure that you receive the best service and support possible, it is highly recommended that you go through a reputable business to set up your number.Some of the more reputable solutions include:


AT&T
Verizon
Vonage
Flowroute
800.com

, Every provider will have slightly different rates and packages. Some require a minimum monthly payment that includes a set number of minutes, while others don’t require a minimum payment but simply charge per minute.


Incoming calls from different regions will cost you different amounts. For example, if your business is in the United States, a call coming from Canada will cost you more than a call coming from somewhere else in the US.

, Some services offer additional features such as voicemail, caller ID, virtual office administrators, voice-to-email, and more. Find the feature package that best suits your business’s needs and budget.

, Once you’ve picked your service, contact the company and set up an account. Choose the package that serves your business’s needs the best. Most services will allow you to choose your own number if it is available, which you can use to personalize it and make it easier to remember.


Try to pick a number that matches your business. For example, if you are in the auto business, try to get a number like (800)555-CARS or (800)555-AUTO. This will make your number much easier to remember for your customers., Toll-free numbers need to be routed to existing phone lines. Routing to an existing land-line will be the cheapest and easiest, since you don’t have to worry about running out of minutes or bad reception.


After signing up, your toll-free number should be activated in no more than one hour.

The base is right below the home button. Take care not to drop the small screws on the floor after you've removed them.A very small Phillip's screwdriver won't work to remove these screws. A pentalobe screwdriver has five points and is a security feature that Apple frequently uses for its products.;
, Take a small suction cup and place it directly on the bottom half of the screen. Press down firmly so it sticks to the broken screen. Your suction cup should have a metal ring extending from it, making it easier to handle.If the suction cup is having trouble sticking to the screen, slightly moisten the suction cup and press it against the screen.

, If your screen is so damaged that the glass is broken in several places, the suction cup may not be able to stick to the screen. If so, cut a strip of clear packing tape and cover your screen with one smooth piece. Apply the suction cup to the covered screen.Try not to cover up the home button when putting the tape on.

, Gently pull up on the suction cup while you hold the phone down. You may need to firmly pull up on the screen several times before it starts to come away from the frame. When it does, move the suction cup to the corner of the screen so you have greater leverage when pulling it away.Remember to avoid covering the home button with the suction cup. If you cover it, the cup won't be able to suction the screen away.

, Once part of the screen is starting to lift away at the bottom corner, take a thin pry tool and insert it underneath the screen. Gently take the pry tool and slide it along the bottom to loosen the screen.Your repair kit may have come with thin plastic sliders or guitar picks that you can insert once you've begun prying up the screen. Take care not to push them in too far or they could get stuck.

, Slowly slide the pry tool along each side of your phone's screen so that you loosen it evenly. Avoid pulling up a lot on one side since this could damage or split the screen or home button. Your goal is to loosen and then remove the screen in one piece.You might find it easier to slide a thin guitar pick instead of a prying tool when loosing the edges of the screen.

, Hold the bottom of the phone down by placing your fingertips on one side of the phone. Hold your other hand over the phone so that your thumb is one one side of the screen and your index and middle finger are on the opposite side. Gently lift the screen up about 90 degrees.








Be aware that the screen is still connected to wires in the phone so don't completely remove the screen.

, If you look at the top-right hand corner of the inside of your phone, you'll see a small metal plate with three screws holding it in. You'll need to remove those screws and remove the shield right to left. Lift the shield away.








Keep your screws and shield together but away from any other screws and parts you've already removed. This will make it easier to reassemble.

, Underneath the metal shield, you'll see three ribbon-like connectors that are keeping the screen and bottom of the phone together. Release each ribbon, starting with the one on top. You can lift the screen away.








You'll need to use your fingertips to gently pry up the ribbons.

, Once you've lifted away the screen, you should see a small metal plate near the top inside your phone. Take the pentalobe screwdriver and remove the two tiny screws so that you can lift the small plate away.








Set aside the screws and plate, keeping them separate from other screws and pieces.

, At the bottom of the phone, you'll see a metal plate covering the home button. Take your pentalobe screwdriver and remove the two small screws.If you find it difficult to unscrew the screws, adhesive may be keeping them in place. Continue using the screwdriver until the come out. While some people recommend using a hair dryer to warm up the adhesive, this can overheat and damage the phone's LCD.

, You should see two small screws on the back plate itself (near the home button at the bottom and the earphone piece near the top) and two along each side of the phone. Take your pentalobe screwdriver and remove the screws. Remove the back plate and set it aside.








Consider setting each screw near where it goes on the phone. This will make it easier to remember where each one goes when you reassemble the plate.

, Turn the phone over and push the button through the phone so that it falls out. Now you can slowly peel back the plate to remove it. Avoid pulling it quickly or twisting since this can rip it. You should also remove the connectors at the top of the screen.








You should have already removed the screws from the plate.

, Get your new screen out and place the home button screen into it. Set the metal home button plate over it and use the pentalobe and screws you removed earlier to secure it to the new screen.Make sure the sticker for the home button sticks down.

, Find the small metal tip of the connector that goes back into the top of the phone. Carefully insert this into its hole before you push in the rest of the connector.








The camera should sit in its exposed hole if you've done this step correctly.

, Set the metal back plate over the phone and screw it back in. Remember that there are two screws on the plate (one near the top and one near the bottom) and two screws on each side.








Since the screws are different sizes it's important to get the correct screws back into place.

, Set the earpiece back in the top right corner of the phone. Find the screws that you removed for it and screw them back in so that the earpiece is secured to the phone.








You should have two screws for the earpiece.

, You should have three ribbon-like connectors coming off of the new screen. Insert these into the phone near the top. Make sure to insert the bottom connector first so that you can easily put on the top connector last. Set the metal plate back over the connectors and screw it back in.








If your phone doesn't come on once you've completely replaced the screen, one of these connectors may not be inserted completely or correctly. Remove the screen and check the connectors.

, Once the screen and phone are loosely connected, lower the screen into place on the phone. Firmly press the screen onto the phone from the top to the bottom. Screw in the last two screws on the bottom of the phone (these are the ones next to the lightening port). You can now turn on and use your phone.








You shouldn't have any gap between the phone and the screen.

Try out the Linux distribution before installing.,
Start the installation process.,
Create a username and password.,
Set up the partition.,
Boot into Linux.,
Check your hardware.,
Start using Linux.",How to Install Linux1," If you're new to Linux, consider trying a lightweight and easy to use distribution, such as Ubuntu, Lubuntu, etcetera. Linux distributions (known as ""distros"") are typically available for free to download in ISO format. You can find the ISO for the distribution of your choice at the distribution’s website. This format needs to be burned to a CD or USB stick before you can use it to install Linux. This will create a Live CD or Live USB.


A Live CD or Live USB is a disk that you can boot into, and often contains a preview version of the operating system that can be run directly from the CD or USB stick.
Install an image burning program, or use your system’s built-in burning tool if you are using Windows 7, 8, or Mac OS X. Pen Drive Linux and UNetBootin are two popular tools for burning ISO files to USB sticks.;
, Most computers are set to boot into the hard drive first, which means you will need to change some settings to boot from your newly-burned CD or USB. Start by rebooting the computer.


Once the computer reboots, press the key used to enter the boot menu. The key for your system will be displayed on the same screen as the manufacturer’s logo. Typical keys include F12, F2, or Del.

For Windows 8 users, hold the Shift key and click restart. This will load the Advanced Startup Options, where you can boot from CD.
If your computer doesn't give you direct access to the boot menu from the manufacturer's splash screen, it's most likely hidden in the BIOS menu. You can access the BIOS menu in the same way that you would get to the boot menu. At the manufacturer splash screen, the key should be listed in one of the bottom corners.


Once you're in the boot menu, select your live CD or USB. Once you’ve changed the settings, save and exit the BIOS setup or boot menu. Your computer will continue with the boot process.

, Most Live CDs and USBs can launch a ""live environment"", giving you the ability to test it out before making the switch. You won’t be able to create files, but you can navigate around the interface and decide if it’s right for you.

, If you’re trying out the distro, you can launch the installation from the application on the desktop. If you decided not to try out the distribution, you can start the installation from the boot menu.


You will be asked to configure some basic options, such as language, keyboard layout, and timezone.

, You will need to create login information to install Linux. A password will be required to log into your account and preform administrative tasks.

, Linux needs to be installed on a separate partition from any other operating systems on your computer if you intend dual booting Linux with another OS. A partition is a portion of the hard drive that is formatted specifically for that operating system. You can skip this step if you don't plan on dual booting.


Distros such as Ubuntu will set a recommended partition automatically. You can then adjust this manually yourself. Most Linux installations require at least 20 GB, so be sure to set aside enough room for both the Linux operating system and any other programs you may install and files you may create.
If the installation process does not give you automatic partitions, make sure that the partition you create is formatted as Ext4. If the copy of Linux you are installing is the only operating system on the computer, you will most likely have to manually set your partition size.

, Once the installation is finished, your computer will reboot. You will see a new screen when your computer boots up called “GNU GRUB”. This is a boot loader that handles Linux installations. Pick your new Linux distro from the list. This screen may not show up if you only have one operating system on your computer. If this screen isn't being presented to you automatically, then you can get it back by hitting shift right after the manufacturer splash screen.


If you install multiple distros on your computer, they will all be listed here.

, Most hardware should work out of the box with your Linux distro, though you may need to download some additional drivers to get everything working.


Some hardware requires proprietary drivers to work correctly in Linux. This is most common with graphics cards. There is typically an open source driver that will work, but to get the most out of your graphics cards you will need to download the proprietary drivers from the manufacturer.
In Ubuntu, you can download proprietary drivers through the System Settings menu. Select the Additional Drivers option, and then select the graphics driver from the list. Other distros have specific methods for obtaining extra drivers.
You can find other drivers from this list as well, such as Wi-Fi drivers.

, Once your installation is complete and you’ve verified that your hardware is working, you’re ready to start using Linux. Most distros come with several popular programs installed, and you can download many more from their respective file repositories.

, Debian is another popular distro for Linux enthusiasts. It is considered one of the most bug-free versions of Linux.Debian also has a large number of software packages available.

, Save it to your GNU/Linux machine.

, You do not need to be a root and only must have the write access to the folder where you wish to install Java. If your administrator is not supportive, you may need to place Java into your home folder or (even better) on a shared network location

, For example, you could do this in your home folder. Uncompressing will create a folder called “jdk1.7.0_09”. Java is now installed.


The installed Java JRE is rather independent and can be easily moved into another place just by copying all its files.
You can install multiple different JRE's this way: they coexist together and can be used if some software requires the older version to run.

Make sure that you have superuser privileges on your Ubuntu box; and an Internet connection - preferably a fast one.,
You need to install chroot on Ubuntu.,
Either repartition existing partitions, or create a new partition from free Hard Disk space.,
Format the new partition(s) using a File System of your choice (for /home, /, /boot and /var it is preferable to use ext2, ext3 or reiser2).,Create a new folder, /mnt/gentoo and one for each of the separate partitions that you created.,
Mount your new partitions on here:

sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/gentoo
sudo mount /dev/sda6 /mnt/gentoo/home




where here, sda5 and 6 are the partitions containing your prospective root and home directories respectively.



,
Check that your date is correct (type date).,
Open a web browsing program of your choice, and navigate to here.,Move it to the Gentoo folder mv stage3*.bz2* /mnt/gentoo.,
Move yourself there (cd /mnt/gentoo) and check the tarball through md5: md5sum -c stage3*.md5.,
Extract the tarball!,
You now have a few basic programs installed on the Gentoo partition; next, you need to install Portage: Gentoo's package management system which allows you to have complete control over what is on your system.,
At this stage, you may want to set some compile flags.,
Want to optimise your download?,
Before you immerse yourself in your new system, you need to make sure that you have a few vital settings copied over from Ubuntu as it is.,
Now you can chroot!,
Congratulations!,
Next, you need to compile the most vital component of any operating system: its kernel.,
Remember installing portage earlier?,For the sake of clarity, at this stage I'll assume that you want to install the latest kernel (2.6) rather than 2.4.,
Now we must set our USE flags.,
Every flag you want to add is simply a word.,To choose your USE flags, check out the Gentoo USE Flags documentation to see what flags you might want to include.,Once you have chosen what flags to use, navigate to /etc/make.conf and put in the flags you want.,
Let's now set up your timezone.,Now that we have our timezone set up, it is time to actually download our kernel sources and configure the kernel.,Run (# emerge gentoo-sources) to download your kernel sources.,
This next step can be tricky for first timers.,
Run

cd /usr/src/linux
make menuconfig

,
This will bring up the kernel configuration menu.,Select any network drivers you may need, such as ethernet drivers or wireless drivers (or both).,Choose your processor type and family.,
Once you've finished, type ( make && make modules_install) to start compiling the kernel and kernel modules.,make -j2 && make modules_install,
Now we need to copy your kernel image to /boot.,
Now let's configure your kernel modules.",How to Install Gentoo Linux from Ubuntu," An intermediate knowledge of Ubuntu and Linux in general is also preferable.
, You can achieve this through Synaptic by installing the dchroot and debootstrap packages; or the command line by typing sudo apt-get install dchroot debootstrap. This program allows Linux to temporarily pretend that its root directory is one different from normal., Be careful! You don't want to lose any data.

Most websites recommend that, essentially, the more partitions, the better. At a minimum, you will need a root partition (/); but most people have a separate swap partition, home partition (/home). Some also recommend a separate partition for /boot and /var.

, Swaps need to be formatted as swap partitions.,,, You can change it with the syntax date MMDDhhmmYYYY., Find your local mirror, and download the stage3 tarball from releases/x86/2008.0/stages/ (replace x86 with the architecture of your choice - this guide is only tested for AMD64 and x86). Download the corresponding md5 file.,, This makes sure that the tarball downloaded properly without being corrupted. If it doesn't report as OK, then you'll have to re-download it., sudo tar xvjpf stage3*.bz2. Wait for it to complete.,

Go back to the mirror that you had previously downloaded the stage3 tarball from. Go to the snapshots/ directory, and download the latest Portage file. Move it to /mnt/gentoo, and use the command:
tar xvjf /mnt/gentoo/portage-<date>.tar.bz2 -C /mnt/gentoo/usr
A brief introduction to Portage: Portage is a package management system allowing for the relatively easy installation of numerous software packages. It works by downloading a list of these and their inter-relationships from an rsync server. This will point portage toward relevant files which can be downloaded from a huge number of other servers. Once these files are downloaded, the software will be compiled from source by your computer - optimising it for your machine.

, You do this by editing /mnt/gentoo/etc/portage/make.conf using your favourite text editor. A full guide on various make variables can be found by reading /mnt/gentoo/usr/share/portage/config/make.conf.example. Save your changes to the configuration file, and exit the text editor., Edit make.conf again and ensure that the SYNC variable is set to your most local rsync server. Add as many mirrors are you like to the GENTOO_MIRRORS variable - though put your preferred one first. You can find the list of the available mirrors here.,

First, the dns settings: sudo cp -L /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/gentoo/etc/resolv.conf

And your proc system: sudo mount -t proc none /mnt/gentoo/proc.
And mount-bind the /dev filesystem: sudo mount -o bind /dev /mnt/gentoo/dev.

, This is simple enough really - and can be exited at any time by typing simply... err... exit. This is a three step process:

First, you change the root directory to /mnt/gentoo: sudo chroot /mnt/gentoo /bin/bash.
Then, you update the environment in order to ensure that this terminal knows where it's supposed to be: /usr/sbin/env-update

Finally, commit this to (temporary) memory: source /etc/profile

If you want to remind yourself that you're in chroot, you can use this dainty command: export PS1=""(chroot) $PS1""


, You're inside Gentoo and about... a quarter of the way there. Chin up!, The kernel is the part of the OS which dictates which pieces of software are allowed access to a piece of hardware at any one moment. Without a kernel, there is no operating system, because it can't operate., Now you're going to download a list of packages which you can install from the rsync server that you specified. Type emerge --sync
,, These flags tell the compiler what options to add, as well as what optimizations to use. It is important to set the right use flags for your system, otherwise you may end up with some unexpected results. It is also good to add flags that tell what not to add support for., Every option you'd like to remove is the word with a dash (-) in front of it. For example, if we want to compile everything with ogg support, we would add ogg. But if we wanted no ogg support, we would add -ogg.,,, Gentoo has all the time zones at /usr/share/zoneinfo. Navigate to the directory and issue the ls command to view the available timezones. Then copy the timezone to /etc/localtime with a command like (# cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/GMT /etc/localtime).,,, Here we configure the kernel so that it has whatever support we need. You need to be sure that you set up your kernel correctly, otherwise you may be without functions that you need.,, Be sure to select all the drivers you'll need to boot your system, such as SCSI drivers (if needed), and be sure they are set to be built into the kernel. If they aren't, you won't be able to boot. Also, be sure you enable support for your file system.,,, This may take some time, so go read a book, watch TV, walk the dog, or whatever else you enjoy doing.,, Change kernel-2.6.24 to whatever you want your kernel to be named. ( cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/kernel-2.6.24), Run (find /lib/modules/(kernel version)/ -type f -iname '*.o' -or -iname '*.ko') to find all available kernel modules. Of those, add the ones you want to be auto loaded to /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6.Do not include the .ko or .o or the path. Just simply say, for example, snd-hda-intel."

, You can install the ISO on a USB, or burn it to a disk. After doing following one of the steps below, restart your computer and boot off your media device.



Install via DVD. Download the image burning software of your choice and burn your ISO.

Install via USB. Download a program to create a live bootable USB drive in Linux. Here is a tutorial on how to do that.

, You can find a live installer shortcut directly on the desktop, or you can click the AV Linux system menu, then under the System tab, select Live Installer.

, A window will appear, asking you whether you would like to proceed in the installation. Just click Yes.

, AV Linux can offer you a different locale instead of English. However, to keep this tutorial short, we will just skip the locale selection and use English as the default locale. Click No. A new window will appear, notifying you that you need to create 1 root partition and one linux-swap partition. At this moment, if you wish to install AV Linux on a removable media device, it would be wise to attach it now. Then just click OK to continue., A list of hard drives will be displayed. It might be difficult to identify the exact hard drive you wish to use, so just determine the size of the hard disk you wish to use, then select the hard disk displayed with the same size (sizes are displayed as MBs). Then click OK.

, This is where the main system will be installed. You might need to unmount and delete the hard disk first. After doing so, right click the disk and create a new partition. You can drag the box's side toward the right or left to set the main partition size. Also, select the format of the new partition to be ext2 and feel free to give your partition a label. Don't forget to leave at least 1 GB for the linux-swap partition. Then click +Add.

, Near the top of the window, click the Apply icon in the toolbar and confirm. Depending on the size of your partition and hard disk, this process could take several minutes.

, If you wish, you can save the details; if not, then just click Close.

, Right click the 1 GB empty space you previously saved in step 8 and create another partition. Select the format to be linux-swap, then click +Add and confirm your change. Repeat step 9 and apply the changes you made on the linux-swap partition. Then close the GParted software window.

, A new window should appear, asking you to select the partition in which to install the root system. If you followed the above steps correctly, then you should see your disk you previously partitioned. Double click it.

, If you follow step 11 correctly, you should see your 1 GB partition. Double click it too.

, If you are using a newer computer, an ext4 filesystem will be best; if you are using an older computer (2005 and before), an ext2 filesystem will probably be best.

, If you're a newbie and just trying this out, then double-click the first option.

, The information includes a root password, which is need to modify the deepest parts of AV Linux. Also, fill in a password for your user. You will be required to type in a username and password when logging into AV Linux. None of this information can be left blank. When you're done, click OK.

, Again, if you're just a newbie trying out AV Linux, then just double click the first option.

, In this case, click No., If you're having difficulty finding your city, first locate which zone you're in, then search for your city. Everything is arranged in Alphabetical order., A last window will be displayed before the installation process. Read it carefully and check for mistakes. If you don't see any, continue with the installation.

, Depending on your computer speed, the installation could take as little as 20 minutes or as long as several hours.

, You have successfully install AV Linux. Reboot your computer before you begin to use it.

Avoid sensitive topics.,
Focus on the similarities more than the differences.,
Learn a little about each other.,
Be considerate of your friends family and friends as well.,
Always defend your friend.,
HAVE A GREAT TIME!!",How to Maintain a Friendship With a Muslim if You Are Jewish," As said before, a friendship is a friendship, no matter what. One of my best friends is a Turkish Muslim, and while we have disagreements on certain things, we don't let anything get between us.;
, When ever having a discussion, consider their opinion as equal, and that either of us can be right.

, Never bring up some areas of discussion, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, radicalism from each side, Gaza/Lebanon, or general belligerence (hostility) between both sides (Mashhad massacre, Cave of Patriarch shooting, violence encounters between Judaism and Islam are especially risky)

, This is very helpful as it brings up a protagonist effect. Some examples of topics could be Kosher/Halal, Monotheism, and even history. But don't get too risky in your conversations (Circumcision is a no-no.)

, Study about each others religions, and customs. Always be respectful.

, They may not always be as easy to deal with. Always watch your tongue!

, Unfortunately prejudice is common, and we are all victims of it. If you ever see some ignorant folks beating on your friend, stand up for him or her.

Consider whether your friend pays attention to you and really listens.,
Test how much your friend has time only when it benefits your friend.,
Notice how often your friend forgets or ignores important dates to you.,
Notice how often a friend breaks promises that they make to you.,
Notice how often a friend tries to embarrass you or make you look bad in front of anyone or everyone, especially after you've told, asked, or begged them to stop.,
Observe if the ""friend"" is mean to you or makes fun of you all the time.,
Notice how often they belittle your accomplishments.,
Notice how often a friend chews you out for making mistakes (even the smallest or pettiest ones) or for bringing their very mistakes to their attention.,
Notice how often the person only behaves friendly to you when no other friends are around/when nothing else is going on for them.,
Consider whether your friend respects what you like.,
Consider whether your friend respects your values.,
Notice how often your friend ignores you.,
If you find yourself to be in any of the above situations very often at all, it might be time to start seeking other people to spend time with.,
Consider whether there are any mitigating factors.,
Go back in time to analyse what you did to the unreal friend.,
Remind yourself often that real friends love you just the way you are.",How to Identify a False Friend," If you're there for your friend and listen to their stories and give good advice, but they won't return the favor, they are not real friends. This shows that they only want to talk about themselves and care less about you and what you want to say.;
, Notice how often your friend's friendliness increases whenever they want you to do something for them, and diminishes whenever they don't want you to do something for them.


For example, let's say you're going to have an awesome party next weekend. This person may start being nice to you and acting like your friend so you will invite them. Or they start being nice to you and then try to get you to do something you wouldn't ordinarily do.
This is a major sign that they only want to pretend to be your friend as long as there is something you can do for them, but not be your friend if they can't get something specific for their efforts. Realize that some people will only be your friend if you do something for them. Try to be aware of the fact that this person probably does not want to be your friend, and find someone better to hang out with who actually likes you for who you are.

, They will tell you all about the presents they received on their birthday or the wonderful time they had on their wedding anniversary. But when those dates roll around for you, either the false friend is nowhere to be seen or heard from or they will contact you after the date has passed and claim that they forgot all about it. This is definitely a

sign the person is interested in you only as a casual acquaintance, not a real friend., Maybe your friend calls you up to see a movie, but then cancels your plans at the last minute, or even worse only a minute or two after making it. This can be a major sign that the person does not want your friendship but only your companionship, and only when they can get nobody better to fill that void.

, This can be a major sign that the person does not care for you as a friend but rather as a source of entertainment - at your expenses, of course.

, A mean friend may try to take advantage of you or possibly push you around. Keep in mind that some friends make fun of you in a joking way, while others do it to lower your self-esteem. Realize what they are doing, and find someone else who appreciates you.

, If you write a superb piece of fiction they will accuse you of plagiarizing it from another source. Sometimes they will praise your work to your face, but you may discover they are making fun of it behind your back. Being two-faced is not a sign of a real friend.

, Some people want to surround themselves with perfectly-behaving people so that they will be perceived as being better than they actually are. It doesn't work, but lots of people for some reason believe that it does.

, This may mean that the person is talking to you out of boredom when they have nothing better to do, and does not actually want to be your friend. Also, if the person constantly leaves without warning or explanation, take this as a hint they do not want to be your friend, and need some better priorities.

, True friends respect the things that you like so, they would not want to change your field of interest. If you are a person that enjoys attending art galleries, museums, and going to musical theaters, then your friends should support that no matter what. If they try to make you go to rock concerts that are not enjoyable or go to movie theater with noisy people when you don't want to, perhaps they aren't a true friend.

, Real friends respect another friends' moral values. If you have very high moral values, then your friends should either share the same values or respect them. If you do not believe in having sexual intercourse before marriage, then your friends should respect and leave it at that. If they believe in ""friends with benefits"" and push it onto you, then you should leave them alone and find someone else that does not believe in that mantra.

, This means ignoring what you say, ignoring your presence, failing to introduce you when they're making introductions, they offer something to someone nearby but not to you, etc. Some people just like to talk about themselves and not care one bit about you. On the other hand, some people act super nice to you one day, but the next day they act as though they have no idea what-so-ever of who you are. What ever may be the case, you should think twice about being this person's friend if this is frequently occurring.

, If you find yourself to be in one or more of the above situations pretty frequently, it is time to start spending time with other people. Remember though that some people have differing personalities and it is usually a good idea to talk to someone about the situation before entirely scrapping your friendship, in case what you have judged to be a false friend is actually not.

, Friends may turn abnormal especially when they are out of work, so do not decide too soon. However, if they have been acting unfriendly for too long, they may have a hidden grudge.

, Did you fail to help them out or manage their expectations? There may be a clue there.

, If they are trying to change you in a way that makes them accept you, then don't waste your time on them.

Putting a little distance between you might give you the strength and the perspective needed to continue the friendship.


Take a break for a month or so if you think you need a ""cool down"" period.
If you want to take a break, make sure you let your friend know about it. You don't want to just disappear, that might hurt your friendship. Try saying something like, ""I feel pretty confused after we kissed, and I need a little time. I still want to be your friend, but it would be good for me if we took a break for the next month.""
If you want to continue seeing your friend, try to avoid spending one-on-one time with them.
Consider avoiding certain activities with your friend for a while, such as drinking or any other activities in which both of your inhibitions might be lowered.;
, The first thing you should do after the kiss is talk about it. Talking about what happened is the first step in making sure you can maintain your friendship. Ultimately, your discussion will let you both agree upon how you want to act and how you want to proceed.


Share your feelings about what happened. Say something like, ""I feel we really need to talk about what happened.""
Discuss your concerns about what it means for your friendship. Say something like, ""I'm worried that the kiss might hurt us as friends.""
Let each other know if you have deep and sincere feelings that go beyond friendship. If either of you do, it is best to know how the other feels. This way you’ll both move forward as friends with full knowledge of how the other person feels., After you’ve talked about the kiss, you should both come to an agreement about how you want to handle it and move forward. Coming to an agreement will enable you both to know how you should both act.


In your agreement, you should both try to come to an understanding about how you want to move forward as friends.
Try to agree upon how you’ll handle the kiss in terms of telling other friends.
Try to agree upon how you’ll want to maintain the relationship going forward.
Try to establish some boundaries, like no more kisses or less physical contact., While your initial conversation might have solved a lot of problems and set the tone for a continued friendship, one or both of you might still be confused about your relationship. At the same time, one or both of you might still have some feelings for each other. This is why it is essential to continue communication in order to avoid confusion.

, Say something like, ""I think we should be completely open about how we feel about the kiss and each other.""


If your friend wants to talk to you, encourage them to do so.
If it works for your relationship, talk about your feelings on a regular basis. This could be weekly, or it could be more frequent., After you’ve communicated, come to an agreement, and worked out any confusion, you need to abide by the understanding you’ve both come to. This will prevent any awkward situations.


Try to internalize what your friend said in your prior conversations. If you’ve both agreed to just “be friends,” then you should both act as friends would.
If you still hold feelings for your friend, resist the temptation to act on them. Remember, you both came to an agreement to be friends. If you both wanted to enter a relationship, you would have agreed to do so.
Remember that the kiss was a one-time thing. Your goal is to be friends., Acting normal is key to maintaining your friendship. If you act awkward or treat your friend differently, it could endanger your relationship.


There is no need to act all nervous afterwards or avoid the other person. It happened normally, so act normally.
If you’re nervous or feel awkward around your friend, talk to your friend about it.
Being nervous or feeling awkward after a kiss is normal.Try taking a few deep breaths and remind yourself that the nervousness or awkwardness will fade with time.

, Perhaps the most important thing you need to do to stay friends is to do just that — stay friends. If you stay friends, and try to act the way you did before the kiss, your chances of maintaining the friendship are relatively high.


Continue to talk to your friend as this includes confiding and sharing your feelings and thoughts as you did before
Continue to do things together. You should try to continue doing the activities you did together before the kiss.
Continue to view each other as friends. If you don’t view the person as a friend anymore, there will be no way to stay friends., An important thing to remember is to avoid sharing information about the kiss with other people. Sharing details about the kiss, or telling others about conversations you’ve had about it, will only endanger your relationship. Remember, the kiss and the post-kiss conversations were done in trust.


By not sharing, you’ll eliminate the possibility of gossip that could hurt or offend either of you.
Avoid involving others in the post-kiss discussions. It is best to deal with the situation by yourselves.
The only way you should tell others about the kiss or the post-kiss conversation is if both of you agree to do so., Ultimately, one or both of you might wind up in a relationship shortly after your kiss. While it is perfectly natural to feel a little bit jealous of the other person’s new squeeze, you need to keep those feelings in check and resist jealousy as much as you can. In the end, being jealous or resentful will only undermine your friendship.


Don’t act out or be passive aggressive toward your friend after they’ve entered a new relationship.
Tell yourself that you want your friend to be happy. If their new partner makes them happy, this should make you happy.
Treat your friend’s new love interest as a friend as well. Being mean will only endanger your relationship
If you have any concerns or issues with your friend’s new love interest, it is best to keep the thoughts to yourself or to discuss it with your friend., An important part of staying friends is that you need to continue your relationship in the context of your social circle. This means that you should continue to do things with each other and with your other friends.


Continue to do the same activities you’ve done before. If this includes going to the movies together (with other friends), do so.
Don’t try to win over or steal a friend in order to get someone on your side if you think the friendship is going south.
If you were the one who previously invited friends to certain activities, continue to invite everyone and don’t exclude the person you kissed.

Call early.,
Keep it brief.,
Keep it routine.,
Avoid spending extra money.,
Travel separately.",How to Invite a Girl to Hang out over the Phone Without Her Thinking You're Asking Her Out1," As a general rule, don’t call when she could be asleep. Avoid the hours of 9pm to 9am. Dates and hook-ups generally occur in the evening, so staying out of that time frame puts your conversation in more of a friend zone., Spend a maximum of ten minutes on the phone. Time is an investment and if you spend too much of it on a new friend they may get the impression that they mean something more to you.It may help to make this first phone call on the way to somewhere else. Then, you could end the call by saying, “Okay, I’ve got to go I just arrived at the gym. See you on Monday.”

, Suggest meeting up for a everyday event at a place that is not exclusive and laidback in atmosphere. You want to go for the opposite of a first date setting, especially for your initial time hanging out.If you want her to come over to your place and hang out, maybe say, ""Hey! My girlfriend hates football and I'm about to watch the game, want to hang out? I hate to cheer alone.""
If a girl offers to drop everything and free up her schedule, don't accept as this is a potentially romantic gesture on her part. You might respond, “I know that you are super busy and I am too. Let’s just hang out in an off time.”, If you are going to a movie, tell her that you will meet her inside the theatre. This makes it necessary for you each to buy your own ticket. Paying for her or her paying for you creates additional investment in the relationship that you may not want or be ready for.However, if you were already going to order a pizza and she comes over, don't worry if she doesn't chip in.

, Meet up at your hang out location and do not offer to pick her up unless absolutely necessary. Staying platonic comes down to keeping boundaries clearly drawn and maintained."

Avoid flirting and taboo topics.",How to Invite a Girl to Hang out over the Phone Without Her Thinking You're Asking Her Out2," Open the call by saying, “Hi"" or ""Hey, how are you doing?"" Use words that conjure up friendship rather than love interest. Depending on the culture of your area “friend” terms might include mate, pal, best friend, chum, etc.

, If she calls you pet names such as “baby” or “sweetie” you may have to tell her that you are not comfortable with that. One way you can do this is via humor. You could say, “Hmmm, I'm not really ready for sweetie. Just Mark is good for me.”


Some girls will assume that “hanging out” actually means dating, so be cautious when you use that phrase.Avoid using the word “date” in any context. For example, instead of saying, “It's a date” go with,""Sounds good. See you in a bit.""

, If she asks if you are setting up a date, tell her “no” in a gentle way. It is best to be straightforward early on in your friendship about each of your expectations. Tell her, “It's my loss. I’m just not interested in us being more than friends.”, Be careful giving compliments and don’t talk about overly personal topics such as the body, dating, etc. Again, this sets the boundaries of your friendship within platonic subjects like sports."

, Make it clear that your philosophy is the more the merrier. Tell her that she can arrange things or that she can pass your number along. Or, offer to invite some of your friends.


If you want her to come to your house, tell her that your brother and parents will be home too. This lets her know that she is coming over just to watch the game, for example, and not for anything else.
Sixty-five percent of men and women between 18-54 years old expressed some confusion as to what an actual date looked like. Adding other people into the mix defines the difference between a platonic or romantic outing., A girl will often echo your excitement about any opportunity to extend her friend network and make new acquaintances.You could even play matchmaker and say, “I can’t wait for you to meet everyone.

Begin here as it is the best clue as to whether or not your friend is willing to make an effort in the friendship. Here are things to consider about how your friend reacts to you wanting to spend time together:


If your friend makes the time, that's a good sign. Friends make time for each other and don't act squeamish or as if they'd rather be somewhere else. Sometimes your friend may be genuinely busy and that's fine, just as long as your friend makes time to be together, when it's appropriate, such as during breaks or lunch, perhaps on a weekend, during vacation time, etc.
If your friend doesn't want to make the time or comes up with a lot of excuses every time you try, then you have a warning sign that he or she is not keen to be around you much. If you have arranged going somewhere together and your friend keeps pulling out on such arrangements, that's a telling sign too. Realize that nobody is ""always busy"" -- that is just an excuse showing they don't wish to prioritize you.
If your friend ditches you almost all the time, and it doesn't seem like a joke, that means he/she isn't really a good friend.;
, Tag along with them. This may seem hard but you can say, ""Hey, how are things going today?"" And walk with your friend. Notice his or her reaction and comfort levels. If she or he is your friend, they'll be thrilled to have you around. If she or he is not, your friend may grunt, fail to talk to you, shrug a lot and try to walk faster to get away from you.

, Invite your friend over and see whether or not he or she accepts the invitation. If your friend does come, is she or he being friendly with you or is she or he ignoring you and just stuffing down the cake and soda and grabbing the goodie bag while leaving early? Since you are the host or the main center of attention when it's at your place, a good friend should be spending time talking to you and being friendly. A bad friend will use the occasion to get what he or she wants out of it, then hightail it out of there with nary a goodbye.

, It's about the people who are true behind your back. This section features some ""tests"" that you can make use of to observe and note how your friend behaves when you're not there to defend yourself. These tests are all optional, and you can try one, two or all of them, or just skip this section -- do whatever you feel most comfortable with. Ultimately, your feelings will matter most, so if needed, just jump to Part 3.

, This provides you with the opportunity to find out what type of people your friend hangs out with or if they say anything bad about you or one of your closer friends. Be around where they hang out and just be quietly in the background, saying nothing and not drawing attention to yourself, keeping a nice distance away. Don't give away any clues you're watching them, and if they're not being such a great friend, they probably won't even notice you. They might say uncomplimentary things about you, or about someone else who is really close to you.


Listen for verbal clues, and watch for physical and emotional clues as well.

, A good and trustworthy friend won't gossip about you and won't spread rumors or, even worse, lies. Does your friend keep all of your confidences? Do you ever hear of anything you only told this friend being spoken of by someone else you didn't tell?


Test your friend. Tell him or her a fake secret you have, and see if your friend makes rumors about the matter or not. Make sure that your fake secret is scandalous enough but does not involve anyone but you.

, This is entirely optional and if it feels icky, weird or undesirable, just skip it. If you think it might help and you have someone willing to help out, it can be one more thing to add to the mix for your decision-making. So, the test is: Have a classmate or coworker talk about you in an unflattering way to your friend, and have the classmate or coworker record or tell you whatever he or she said. If your classmate or coworker can't record the response, be the one to observe your friend while the unflattering scene unfolds. If your friend defends you, that's a great sign of loyalty but if he or she agrees and starts dissing you back, then you know this person isn't being a true friend.

, If they want you to fall in line regardless of how you feel or what you'd prefer to do, then it means they don't care about you, and only want you as a henchman/henchwoman. This is a case of being used, not liked, and it is a classic sign of a controlling personality. That kind of person is near impossible to be good friends with, because you never know when they like you for what you can do for them or like you for you.

, Can you be yourself or do you feel as if you have to ""be a certain way"" or be really careful about what you say? A true friend is someone you can be yourself around and who won't judge you for the funny quirks, the odd blurts and the weird ways you perceive the world. A true friend will accept you as the package you are and won't expect you to walk on eggshells or censor the way you talk. When you don't have to be careful about what you say, that's when you're around the right person.


A friend is someone who gives you the liberty to be yourself. Anything less is not true friendship.

, Does your friend wonder why you are doing this and ask after you? Or, does this friend seem relieved that you're not around? This can be an extremely telling factor when trying to determine how much this person cares about you, for only a person who hears your silence and sees your absence truly cares for you.

, Real friends stay by your side through thick and thin. Hardship is actually a good barometer for the true friends in your life. You only lose the friends who were masquerading as friends when you experience hardships and difficulties. Those fair weather friends are not worth your time or effort, as they are the sort of people to flit from one relationship to another, always seeking what is in it for them. A true friend stays, supports and keeps loving you regardless of what happens. A good friend is someone willing to share in both your happiness and your sadness, to notice and to be there for both.


A good friendship is one in which each friend needs only what the person has to give of themselves, not their material wealth, their connections or their power. It's about the intangible of ""I get you. And you get me.""

, Does your friend seem true or false to you? Do you feel comfortable and happy around this person or do you feel awkward, controlled and/or unhappy around him or her? Does your friend inspire and motivate you or send shivers of angst and worry down your spine? Do you have evidence that this person supports you or badmouths you? Remind yourself that no friend is better than a bad friend, and that you will find a new friend if this one proves to be false. Also, sometimes your friendship circle as a whole may decrease in size but will increase in value, so let that be your guide.


When making your decision, keep in mind that the fact you have had to question this friend's loyalty is a red flag. Generally, the only people you owe loyalty to are those who don't cause you to question theirs.

Recognize when they need help.,
Ask if they want help.,
Respect introversion.",How to Help a Self Isolating Friend1," Sometimes self-isolation can be a sign of a bigger problem.They may be trying to cope with abuse or trauma, alcohol and drug abuse, or mental health issues, such as depression. Your friend may not even realize that their problems are causing them to isolate themselves. Recognize when your friend’s isolation isn’t just them being shy or introverted so that you can support them in getting the help they need.


Look for other signs that there may be a problem. For example, mood swings, changes in appetite or sleep habits, nervousness, and agitation may all be signs of a mental health or substance abuse problem. Consider whether you have noticed these changes over time or if they happened suddenly. The onset of your friend’s symptoms can help you to understand it better.
Ask other people close to your friend if they have any concerns. You might say, for instance, “Have you noticed anything that worries you about Daniel?”;
, In some cases, your friend might not be self-isolating. You may not want to accept it, but your friendship might be fading. Your friend might also be voluntarily separating from society. One direct way to determine if your friend wants or needs help with their self-isolation is to ask them.


You might, for example, ask your friend if they feel lonely. You might say, “Do you feel lonely or isolated very often?”
Or, you could say, “Sometimes it seems like you're isolating yourself. Is this on purpose or is there something I can help with?”

, Some people aren’t as social as other people by choice. They may prefer, and even thrive off of time alone.If your friend is an introvert, you may not need to help them at all. Unless they show other signs of a problem, respect that they enjoy time alone and appreciate and make the most of the time you spend together.


Make an effort to spend time with your friend, but if they make it clear that they want or need some alone time, then respect that.

Spend time one-on-one.,
Invite them to social events.,
Support their interests.,
Encourage others to socialize with your friend.,
Keep trying.",How to Help a Self Isolating Friend2," Quality time with just you and your friend can help your friend in a lot of ways.Your time together gives you the opportunity to address your friend’s isolating behavior. It also gives them a chance to spend time with someone they're comfortable with, which may motivate them to be more social.


You might just want to spend some time just being in each other’s presence. You don’t have to do or say anything while you're together.
You could also make plans for the two of you to do something, like watch a movie together or go for a hike.

, You can help a self-isolating friend by encouraging them to participate in social activities. You can do this by inviting your friend to hang out and do things with you and other people.Being in social situations with someone that they can trust can help give them the confidence they need to stop isolating themselves.


For example, if you’re planning to volunteer at your local community center, ask your friend to come along.
Or, as another example, you could invite your friend to come along with you to a party or other social event.

, People are more likely to participate in activities that they enjoy so make some time to do things that your friend enjoys doing. Letting your friend know that you support their activities and hobbies can help encourage them to participate in those activities more. When they know someone cares about their interests, it can help them stop isolating themselves, as well as boost their self-esteem.


If you feel like you don’t know enough about your friend’s interests, then ask them, “What are some of the things that you like to do?”
Tell your friend you want to do something that interests them. You might say, “Let’s do what you enjoy. Tell me what will get you out of the house.”

, Enlisting the help of others can be very useful when you’re trying to help a self-isolating friend. You can ask other people who care about your friend to help you encourage the friend to socialize.


For instance, you might say, “Could you invite Toni out sometime? I think she’s starting to self-isolate and time with you can help.”
Or, you could tell a mutual friend, “I think it might help Mark stop self-isolating if you go by and spend some time with him.”

, It can be frustrating when you're trying to help someone be more social but they seem to be resisting your efforts. Don’t give up on your friend, though. Keep working with your friend on ending their self-isolation. Over time, your persistence will pay off and you’ll help your friend become more social.

Tell them how great they are.,
Update their image.,
Practice social situations with them.",How to Help a Self Isolating Friend3," Your friend may be self-isolating because of insecurities they have or other issues with their self-esteem.

Stand up to bullying.,
Seek help for substance abuse problems.,
Encourage treatment for mental health issues.,

You should also report it to a teacher or other authority figure that you trust.


Try to be around your friend when they are usually bullied. Just having you there can give your friend courage and cause the bully to think twice.
You can tell your coach, for example, “Some of the teammates are bullying my friend. Can you help us work this situation out?”

, You can help a self-isolating friend by encouraging them to get help for any alcohol or drug abuse problems that they have. Problems such as this often lead people to isolate themselves in an attempt to either hide their problem or continue using.Let them know that you think they have a problem and talk to them about seeking treatment.


You could tell your friend, “I’m concerned about the effect your drinking is having on you. You don’t do things you used to do and we barely spend time together. I think you need help.”
If your friend is under 18, you should talk to an ad you trust about what’s going on. For example, you might say, “One of my friends is having a problem with prescription pills. What should I do?”

Treating their mental health problems can help them stop self-isolating and help them overall.


Ask your friend to see a therapist to help them any emotional or mental health issues they're experiencing.
If your friend is a child or teen, talk to a trusted adult about your concerns for your friend. For example, you might tell your parent, “I think my friend has depression. How should I handle it.”

, In some cases, the reason for self-isolation may be because your friend is being abused or has experienced something else traumatic.If you suspect that this might be the case, you can help your friend by talking to them about the situation and reporting to the proper authorities if necessary.


You might tell your friend, “I think some things have been happening to you that worry me. Can we talk about it?”
Or, you might say, “I think you might be being abused. Can we talk about what’s going on and how we can stop it?”
You can also help them contact an abuse hotline like the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 or the National Child Abuse hotline at 1-800-422-4453.

Enjoy yourself and show it.,
Show off your sense of humor.,
Be yourself.,
Demonstrate that you are a confident person.,
Make sure that your appearance fits the activity.,
Actively listen to what they are saying.",How to Hang out With Your Girl Friends when You're the Only Guy Around1," While it might make you a bit uncomfortable initially, this is a great opportunity for you to spend time with a diverse group of friends, so embrace it! You will probably hear and see things that you never would with a group of guys. Let others in the group know that you having fun by smiling, laughing, and just being in a good mood overall.Keep your smiles sincere, but try to smile as often as you can. It draws other people to you and they can’t resist smiling as well. You will be known as a person who elevates the mood of the whole group.You may feel closer to one or two of the girls but, when you are in a group, try to interact with everyone. If you spend all of your time smiling at one specific girl, then the others may get the impression that you are romantically interested in her, which could create awkwardness.;
, Laugh at others' jokes and maybe even tell a few yourself. Find humor in goofy situations or in what other people say. Just keep your humor light and most people will appreciate it. You might suggest hanging out in ways that provide opportunities for laughs, such as seeing a comedy movie.


Laughter also breaks the ice in tense situations and lowers stress overall. As you laugh your blood pressure drops (in a good way) and your circulation improves as well.Make sure that you are laughing with the group, not at a particular person. No one likes a bully.
Tailor your humor to the group. The same jokes that you use around your guy friends may be okay with this group or they may offend. Tread carefully here and avoid jokes that are crude, etc., until you can gauge the reaction that you’ll get.

, It may be tempting to take on a “macho” persona when surrounded by a bunch of girls, but resist this impulse. Likewise, don’t feel as if you need to mimic their behaviors or act “girly” to fit in. Show off your true personality and that will be enough to make them like you.

, Don’t be or act fake. Be exactly who you are when hanging out with these girls. They want to get to know you or they would not have bothered to hang out with you. Do them, and yourself, the favor of being honest about your accomplishments.Part of being confident is not putting yourself down. When talking with the girls try not to say things like, “I’m so stupid,” or, “I’m no good at this.” Instead, asking for help when you need it will solidify your friendships., If you hang out at a place that requires a dressier outfit, ask your girl friends what they would suggest you wear. There is a good possibility that they will consult with each other prior to going, so it’s okay if you do the same. Tailoring your appearance to the rest of the group shows that you respect your time with them.


If you aren’t comfortable asking your friends directly, you can always go online for fashion advice., Many times the single best thing you can do for someone is to listen to them. Whenever one of your girl friends talks, turn toward them and make eye contact. Let them finish speaking before you start what you have to say.If you have questions, ask them. Open-ended questions are the best. You might say, “That sounds like a really fun night. What part did you enjoy the most?”
It also helps to provide feedback and cues to continue. Nod your head or say, “Yes,” as they are speaking. If you disagree, resist the urge to interrupt and wait until they’ve finished.

"
"
Stick to neutral topics at first.,
Do something else if the location is uncomfortable for you.,
Act like a peer, not a big brother.,
Stay platonic.,
Calm yourself down before going out.,
Talk to your friends for advice beforehand.",How to Hang out With Your Girl Friends when You're the Only Guy Around2," If you know the group well, then you can jump into more controversial discussions. If you are new to this group of friends, then you want to proceed carefully. Try to focus your conversation on common ground areas, such as education, entertainment, travel, etc. Avoid talking about politics, religion, and other hot-button subjects, at least early on in the friendship. Keep it light.The girls may be the ones to introduce topics that you are not entirely comfortable with. If, for example, they start to talk about women’s health issues you may want to use humor to change the subject or give you an excuse to step away. However, if you feel comfortable just listening and your presence doesn’t seem to bother the others, you can always do that as well.

, The group of girl friends that you are hanging out with might go to a place where you don’t want to, or can’t, follow. If this is the case and you feel like waiting, try to find something else to pass the time. Or, if you feel like leaving entirely, that’s fine too, just don’t make a big deal out of it.


For example, if you are hanging out and the girls decide to all head to the ladies room together, then your best option is probably just to wait it out. Go take your own restroom break, walk around the area, or play on your phone to pass the time.
If the girls decide to spend a longer time in a setting that may be uncomfortable (or just really boring) for you, like a women’s clothing store, then you may need to consider calling it a day. You might say, “If you all want to go in there, no problem. I’ll just catch up with you later.”

, Your friends want a friend, not a mentor, a watchdog, or a sibling. Watch your tone to make sure that you don’t sound condescending or overprotective. For example, don’t pry too far into their dating lives without being invited to do so. Also, if you are older than your girl friends, try not to remind them of this too often. Instead, look for common ground.


If your girl friends tell you about a problem that they are having your first instinct may be to jump in and offer a variety of solutions. You might even try to solve the problem yourself. Avoid doing this unless they tell you that you can. It can come off as pushy and overprotective. Instead, listen to them and offer empathy., Be very careful pursuing a romance with one of your girl friends while hanging out with other girls as well. Showing more attention to one girl or flirting can create an awkward situation for the whole group. If you are romantically interested in one of your girl friends, act out your feelings when you are one-on-one with her.


On a related note, if one of your girl friends tries to flirt with you and you are not interested, try to be gentle but firm in letting her know. You might say, “I really enjoy hanging out with you and the group, but that’s all I’m interested in right now.”

, If you are nervous or anxious about being the “odd man out,” then try some relaxation techniques before hanging out. Take a few deep breaths, massage the area between your thumb and forefinger (it is a pressure point), or turn on some relaxing music. Remind yourself that they are your friends, so there really is no reason to be concerned., If you have friends who also hang out with these girls, then see if you can find out any extra information about them. Maybe you will discover that one of them really likes music, but can’t stand talking politics. Or, perhaps one of them might be interested in you romantically. These are good things to find out before hanging out, if you can.


You need to be careful about this and only approach trusted friends for advice or information. You might say, “I’m hanging out with Claire and Amy on Thursday. Do you know anything about them?”

"
"
Let them contact you.,
Do what they want to do.,
Offer suggestions once you know what they like to do.",How to Hang out With Your Girl Friends when You're the Only Guy Around3," If you are pretty sure that you will be only guy hanging out with this group, wait for them to reach out to you. It is quite possible that these girls have already spent time together and by waiting you are showing them that you can go with the flow. When they do call or text, try to be flexible with your schedule, at least for the first few times you hang out.


You can always ask them if you are the only guy coming to hang out, but this might draw attention to you and make them uncomfortable. Instead, you can always plan on inviting other guys out with the group, if you want, at a later date.

, You may be different from them, but you are still a part of their group now. If they suggest going to the movies, go along with it. You can always mention that you’d like to drop by the football game afterwards. This will show that you are laid back and flexible, not controlling.


Allowing them to take the lead will also expose you to new and different activities, which will keep your interest in the friendship., Once you get more comfortable with these girls, you can start to push for outings that are of particular interest to you. Throw your ideas out there and hopefully one or more of the girls will agree to go along.


For example, when texting to make plans you might write, “Hitting up the park sounds fun, but I was really hoping we could go to this pool party instead. It’s really hot right now.” Active suggestions are also good because they benefit everyone’s health and boost positive emotions."

Verify the failure.,
Check hardware connections.,
Do a visual check.,
Check to see if the drive is being recognized.,
Make a choice: if this data is worth saving, it is worth finding a professional hard-drive recovery company and paying what it takes to get your data back.,
A quick search on Google for ""hard drive replacement parts"" will lead you in a couple different directions.,
Do it yourself.,
Hire a professional.,
Read this first!,
Physically test the drive.,

Chill it down.,
Get recommendations.",How to Fix a Physically Broken Hard Drive," Make sure your drive is truly broken by checking things that could cause your drive to not be recognized.


If your drive is making a steady, loud clicking noise, stop and skip to part two. Your drive is dead.;
, This is the best place to start, and if found to be the problem, is the fastest, most inexpensive fix you can make!


Make sure power is getting to the computer. If the cat knocked out the plug, or cable is broken, nothing will work.
Open up the computer case. Are the data (IDE or SATA) and power cables firmly in place? Make sure they are seated well, and no pins are bent, broken, or otherwise damaged.

, Sometimes, it's not the drive that's dead, but the PC board that controls its operation (on the underside of the drive). If there's a power surge, or a component failure on that board, your drive will stop working, but only because it doesn't know what to do next.


Look for signs of damage—burns or scorch marks. If you see this, you can breathe a little sigh of relief, for it means that is your likely culprit—and often times, this is a problem that can be fixed with relative ease.
If you want to replace the PCB, search on Google for replacement parts for your drive's make and model.
When it arrives, remove the old board (there are five tiny screws to remove—don't lose them!)
Slide out the old drive, and replace it with the new one. Do not touch the metal leads on the new board—static discharge could blow your new board before it ever has a chance to breath new life into your drive. You can ground yourself by either wearing an anti-static wrist band, or by touching something grounded and metal. The inside of your plugged-in computer will usually work.
Slide in the new board, making sure it's seated firmly into the drive, then re-attach the screws.
Reconnect the drive to the computer, then power back up. If it works, congratulations! It's a good idea to back up your data at this point, but you're good to go.
If it doesn't work—keep reading.

, If everything is plugged in, and nothing appears to have blown up on the controller PCB, check out Windows Disk Management or BIOS, or Mac OS X Disk Utility to determine if your drive is being recognized at all.

, If you attempt anything at all yourself, chances of recovering any data professionally will be nil.

, Replacing parts may work for older hard drives, but usually not for newer ones.

, A favorite method of brave souls is the DIY method, promoted by companies that specialize in providing parts for do-It-yourselves. The idea is that if you simply replace the burned out controller board, your drive will spring back to life.


Truth is, maybe it will! But there's one big caveat: the chips on the controller are, more and more, calibrated for that particular drive, and there's no guarantee a replacement will work. However, this is by far the least-expensive option.

, This is the ONLY option to get your drive back up and running, or at least have the files on the drive recovered (which is really what you want, in the end).


Turnaround times can be quicker than the DIY method, and success is somewhat more assured, but it comes at a cost, which may be worth it if your data is important.
You can expect to pay two or three times more than the original cost of the drive, so you will have to weigh the value of the money against the value of the data on the drive.

, If your drive made a clicking sound the first time you plugged it in, any time you plug it in again causes loss of data by damaging the magnetic layer on the drive. Do not attempt this self repair if the data is important to you for work or legal reasons. Some of these techniques are ""Hail Mary"" attempts that will either work or render your drive truly, finally, really dead. This will totally and finally kill any part of data that is not already damaged.

, Hold the drive in one hand and firmly spin it back and forth, listening for any noises as you do so. This may seem like ""not doing anything"" but actually if anything is loose, you may cause it to break!!! If you can't hear any noises, a likely cause—especially if you have an older drive, or one which ran very hot to the touch—is a seized head bearing or spindle. The following steps can be considered: If you open up the drive you are likely to kill whatever was still able to be saved.

, Pre-heat a domestic oven at its lowest setting for five minutes or so, then turn it off. Place the drive in the oven for 2-5 mins, until it's warmed up. Please note that warming it up -- whether it has already crashed or not -- can and will make it die.


Remove the drive and repeat the first step. If you still can't hear any noises, go on to the next step. However, if there is a difference, reattach the drive to your computer and listen for spin-up of the drive and normal clicking that indicates head activity. If all seems well so far, try to access the drive, and move your data onto a good drive.
If needed, reheat the device and, whilst holding the drive in one hand, sharply spin and hit the drive on a hard surface. This is drastic of course, but may help free the heads from any binding. If anything was still alive on your hard drive, it will now be totally and finally dead.
Repeat the first step. Can you hear head movement now? If yes, re-attach the drive to your computer, and try accessing the drive.
If you can hear a rhythmic ""click"" in time with the movement, the chances are that the drive heads are free on their mounts and are not jammed. Check that you don't hear any rattling noises when you rotate the drive gently (back and forth) through 90 degrees. This would indicate loose and disconnected components inside the drive and are beyond the scope or intent of this article.

, Another option—a controversial one—is freezing the drive. This is a last-ditch effort, and you may only get the drive back long enough to copy off important files, but if all else fails, it's worth a try.


Seal the drive in a zip-lock bag, and remove as much air as possible. Pop the drive into the freezer for a few hours.
Plug the drive back into the computer, and give it a try. If it doesn't work immediately, power down, remove the drive, then smack it on a hard surface such as a table or floor. Re-attach the drive, and try again. If it works, save your files, then toss the drive. If it doesn't, your drive will now be beyond all methods of professional help!!

, There are many companies out there that will offer to repair your drive for a (not so small) fee. Before plunking down any cash, check their credentials. Look at online user forums, talk to them, and find out how long they've been in business and what there recovery percentage is.


Check their guarantee, and how much they charge for both success (which you will gladly pay for) or for failure. How much is it worth to you for them to make a failed attempt.
You may not want to pay for a recovery that didn't happen, but if they attempted repair and if failed, they still spent some amount of time trying, which should be compensated.

Attempt to mount the CPU.",How to Fix Bent Pins on a CPU1," You want to place the CPU on a hard, flat surface with the pins facing straight into the air. Be sure you have discharged any static electricity by touching a grounded metal object.;
, Typically a standard plastic credit card or gift card will do. Find a row on your CPU that has no bent pins in it. Take one of your cards, stand it on edge and gently run it through the row of pins. If the card is the right thickness it should slide between the pins with slight resistance and no bending of the pins.


If there is no contact with the pins or no resistance, then the card is too thin.
If the card is too thick you will not be able to slide the card through the pins without bowing out or bending pins. Err on the side of caution and never force the card through.

, For example, if there is one bent pin, run the card in the rows surrounding it, much like the “#” symbol. This will bend the pin straight in each direction.

, If it doesn't slide right in the socket, it is possible that there is still a bent pin. Sometimes pins in the middle can be difficult to detect.

",How to Fix Computer Overheating Caused by Blocked Heat Sink," Wear a static wrist guard if possible, or touch the metal case before handling anything inside, to ground any static charge you may have.;
, Overheating issues are also often caused by poor air circulation in the computer case. If you have space, adding another fan can help. Also, you should regularly open the case unplug all the cords and carefully take your computer system outside use a can of compressed air or an air compressor. A small vacuum is a good second choice but you have to be careful not to hit any internal components with it, and avoid touching the circuit boards with anything. Take your time and be very thorough with this step. Next take a cotton swab dabbed in some rubbing alcohol and go over the internal case components to get them very clean. You can go over the external case with a rag and a little bit of water. Allow your system 2 hours to dry out before turning it back on.

, Grasp the plastic end and pull carefully until it comes out. Don't pull it by the wires.

, It may be held in place on the motherboard by four Phillips screws or a lock-down lever.

, Often it is held in place by a small lever that lifts to release the processor.

, Dropping the processor will likely damage it. Alternatively, it may be stuck to the heat sink by thermal paste. Try to separate them. A credit card-type card can be useful for this step, but don't damage the CPU trying to pry them apart.

, Blast compressed air directly on the heat sink. It only takes a few good quirts to clean a blockage. If it's persistent, allow a few seconds before repeating.

, Use a clean cotton bud or paper towel. A little rubbing alcohol may help, but too much could cause damage.

,, It only takes a small amount. Too much can cause overheating problems all over again.

, Clip the clip back in. Secure the fan back on. Plug it back into the motherboard.

, Make sure stray wires are secured away from fans, then put the cover back in place.

Find a properly-sized pencil.,
Remove any pencil lead from the pencil.,
Place the empty tip of the pencil over the pin.",How to Fix Bent Pins on a CPU2," This method is best used when there are a few individual bent pins. You will want a mechanical pencil with a .5 or .7 millimeter opening. These sizes should fit comfortably around a CPU pin.

, You need the opening to be free of obstructions.

, Carefully maneuver the tip to bend the pin back into place. You can use the angle of the pencil as a guide to track how straight the pin is.

"
"
Get a properly sized needle.,
Slide the needle underneath the bent pin.,
Pull the needle up at one end.,
Assess the situation for how to move forward.",How to Fix Bent Pins on a CPU3," If the needle does not fit between two pins comfortably then it is too large. The advantage of a needle is its thin size, which allows you to unbend pins that other tools cannot get under.


A toothpick or small tweezers are similar options that can work.

, Take care not to scratch the surface of the CPU.

, This will leverage the bent pin back to a straighter position.

, If the pin seems reasonably straight, you can attempt to remount the CPU. If the pin still needs straightening, try the credit card or mechanical pencil now that you can get underneath it. You can also continue to manipulate the pins with needle to try to get them straighter.


Always be careful when re-bending the pins a lot, as there is the risk of breakage

Best Buy and Walmart tech departments may also have scratch repair kits in-store., Microfiber cloths, unlike paper towels or traditional napkins/cloths, won't scratch your screen during the buffing process.

, Scratches should be easier to see when the screen is dark.

, Usually, scratch repair kits require that you spray a solution onto the scratch and immediate area around it, then gently buff the scratch with a microfiber cloth.

, There should be a fine mist of solution on your screen.

, Do this until the screen appears dry.


You should move the cloth in circular directions rather than left-to-right or up-and-down. This works the solution into the scratch.

, If the scratch appears to be gone, then your repair worked!

After your new screen is installed, purchase a screen protector.",How to Fix a Scratch on an LCD Screen2," If your screen is scratched to the point where it impairs the visual presentation--but the actual LCD display is unharmed--then purchasing a new screen cover is practical. If the LCD display has been damaged (parts of the screen are black or rainbow-colored), however, your item is likely beyond repair and you will need to purchase a TV/phone/computer.

, You can usually find the specific model number on the back of a TV or phone, or the bottom of a laptop. You'll need this number to make sure you purchase the correct type of screen.


Make sure you have your manufacturer's name as well (e.g., Sony or Toshiba).

,, Higher price doesn't always correlate with higher quality, so look through your results carefully before deciding on a screen replacement.


For a more focused search, go to Amazon or eBay and type the same thing in.

, You may find that you're better off buying a new item anyway--if the combination of their services and the screen's price ends up being as much as a new TV, for example, you should consider just purchasing the new TV.

,, Most tech departments (e.g., Best Buy) will replace your screen for you, though they often charge a considerable fee--another reason to purchase a mid-range screen replacement rather than the most expensive one.


Replacing your own screen cover is not recommended.

, Your screen should now be safe from future scratches!

No response - Click here if you can't hear any fans starting and can't see anything on the screen, or the computer starts for a moment and then freezes or turns off.

Beep code or POST failure message - Click here if your computer doesn't pass the POST (Power On Self Test). This is usually indicated by the lack of a beep and a failure message, or by a series of beeps to indicate an error code.Operating System Not Found or BOOTMGR is missing - Click here if your computer completes its startup sequence but fails to load Windows.

, It may seem simple, but double-check that the power cable is plugged in and the outlet is working.


Plug the computer directly into the wall to see if your surge protector or power strip is the cause of the problem.
If you are using a laptop, make sure that the power adapter is securely connected.

, You can run your laptop without a battery inserted as long as you are plugged into a power source. If your laptop turns on when the battery is removed, something is wrong with the battery and you should contact the manufacturer for a replacement.

, If your computer is starting up but you can't see anything, there could be something wrong with your monitor. Double-check the monitor's connection, and try plugging in a different monitor if possible.

, In order to check the connections inside and to test the power supply, you'll need to open the case. Click here for detailed instructions.


Remember to ground yourself with an antistatic wriststrap or by touching the exposed metal of the case before touching any internal components.

, Ensure that the cables that connect your power supply (the box that your power cable is attached to) to your motherboard are securely connected.

, Old power supplies have a tendency to fail, but testing them is a relatively straightforward process. Power supplies are the most common cause for problems with a computer's boot sequence. Click here for detailed instructions on testing your power supply.

, If your power supply doesn't work after testing it, you'll probably need to replace it in order to get your computer working again. Click here for detailed instructions.

, If a screw has come loose in your case, it could be causing your motherboard to short out. Gently rock your case back and forth and listen for metal rattling. Either use your fingers or a long pair of tweezers to remove the screw from the case.


Look for any cables that have lost their protective coating, as exposed wiring may be causing a short as well. Replace any cables that have decayed too much.

, If you're ""lucky"", your computer will issue a series of beeps when it fails to turn on. Look up your motherboard's manufacturer and find the beep code translations. Knowing what the codes mean will make tracking down the problem much easier.Beep codes are unfortunately different for every manufacturer, so you'll need to search for them yourself.

Click here for instructions on identifying your motherboard.

, If you can, try entering your BIOS settings menu as soon as your computer starts. Typical BIOS setup keys include F2, F10, F11, and Del.

, Your BIOS will display all of your connected hardware in the MONITOR, HARDWARE, or SYSTEM section. Check to see that your hard drive is displaying properly.


If your hard drive is not showing up, try replacing the cable inside the computer.

, In order to check the various components inside the computer, you'll need to open the case. Unplug everything from the back and remove the side panel to access the internal components. Click here for detailed instructions.


Remember to ground yourself with an antistatic wriststrap or by touching the exposed metal of the case before touching any internal components.

, Open up your computer and reseat your graphics card, RAM modules, and all of your cable connections. If anything has come loose, there's a chance that it's disrupting the POST sequence.


You can try reseating your processor as well, but this is usually a much more difficult task, and likely isn't the cause of the problem. It also increases the chances of damaging the processor, which will render your computer completely inoperable.

, There's a chance that a bad memory module is causing your computer to not boot. Try removing memory modules one at a time and booting your computer to try to isolate a bad memory stick.


You can run a utility like Memtest86 to help determine which of your memory modules is failing.

, If you have a dedicated graphics card, try removing it and plugging your monitor into your motherboard's display connection. A malfunctioning graphics card can cause your computer to not boot.



This article on installing graphics cards will give you detailed instructions on removing your graphics card.

, Try booting your computer up with only the most basic hardware attached. This means disconnecting your graphics card, additional drives, PCI expansion cards, and extra RAM. After you've removed everything, try turning your computer on.


If your computer works with only the essential hardware installed, add pieces back one at a time, testing each time to see where the problem lies.
If you still cannot pass POST with just your essential hardware, then you'll need to either swap out the essential hardware with spares, take your computer to a repair shop, or upgrade to a new one.

, If you are having problems loading Windows, you can try to fix it using Startup Repair. This is accessible from the Advanced Startup menu if you are using Windows 7 or later. If you are using Windows Vista or XP, you'll need to boot from the installation disc to access the Startup Repair tools.You can open the Advanced Startup menu by repeatedly pressing F8 as the computer starts up.
If you can't access the Advanced Startup menu, you may have a problem with your hardware. See the above sections for troubleshooting your boot issues.

, You will have to wait a few moments while the necessary files load.

, You will be prompted to log in before you can start the repair process.

, Windows will scan for problems related to booting the operating system and will attempt to fix them automatically. Your computer will likely reboot during this process, possibly multiple times.


If Startup Repair fixes something, it is highly recommended to run it at least two more times before trying to boot normally. Chances are it will fix something else when it runs again., Startup repair may suggest performing a System restore, or you can select it from the main Repair menu. System Restore will provide several dates that you can try rolling back to.


Always try the most recent date available first, and the move backwards until you find a working restore point.

, If none of the repair options work, your only remaining option may be to reinstall Windows. This will erase everything on the hard drive, so it is only recommended as a last-ditch option.

Upstream: This means away from you and towards the internet and your internet service provider. Your cable modem is connected to a coaxial cable that leaves your house. Think of wherever that goes as upstream.

Downstream: The opposite of upstream. This means information coming down from the internet to your modem.

SNR: Signal to Noise Ratio. Quite simply, this is a number that represents how much signal there is on the line versus noise. Signal is what you want: encoded, understandable information from the internet. Noise is bad and can come from electromagnetic interference (from other electronic devices and radio signals) and thermal noise. Knowing what those two things are isn't too important right now. Just know that you want a better signal and less noise.

Frequency: When you tune your radio or change your TV channel, you are telling the device to listen at a different frequency. Channels are also used to send information destined for the internet over the cable network in pretty much the same way that TVs do.

Headend/CMTS: Where your cable modem and the modem of other people in your town/city connect to. This is a piece of equipment operated by your ISP that manages all the cable modems and connects them to the internet. From here, network engineers can check the health of your modem as well as reboot it remotely and push configuration changes to it.

FEC: Forward error correction. Data doesn't always transmit through cables perfectly, there are often some errors in the bits (1s and 0s). For instance, a 0 might be flipped to a 1 or vice versa. In order to correct those errors, some extra data has to be attached to every codeword that goes out (a codeword is just a fixed chunk of data). If it can fix the error, then everyone's happy. However, sometimes codewords have too many incorrect bits and the error correction algorithm (called Reed-Solomon, if you're interested) can't fix it. If more than 1% of your codewords are uncorrectable, you will start to encounter some issues (especially with VoIP).;
, Most modern modems do have such a feature to aid people with solving technical problems. For many modems, this is ""192.168.100.1"". For others, this may differ so contact your ISP or research it in the owners manual that came with your specific modem. (e.g. Many Linksys modems listen at 192.168.1.1). You'll need to enter that into your web browser's address bar. If you're not sure, look up your modem's brand and model number followed by ""diagnostics page"" to find what address it should be located at. If your modem does not have a web page, you won't be able to follow this article — contact your ISP for help with diagnosing your connection if you're having issues.


If you have more than one Internet connection, to get this local IP address, make sure that you are connected to that particular connection before typing in the address into your browser.
For only some issues, even if your modem is connected to your computer, you can still check your server settings despite the inability to check any other page. However, a more complicated setup may require a visit from a technician.

, These modems will have the login settings written in the book.


For some Linksys modems (especially wireless modems), you can stick pretty much anything in the username box (even gibberish) and place your current network password into the password box.

, These are all important and if one does not match up with what you expect you may need to dig deeper to figure out why.



Acquire Downstream Channel: This should say ""Locked"", ""OK"" or similar. This means your modem found the frequency with which to receive information from the internet. There should always be at least 1 channel acquired with a DOCSIS 1.1 or 2.0 modem. If you have a DOCSIS 3.0 modem, you should be acquiring up to the maximum your modem supports (8 or 16).

Connectivity State: This should be OK or Operational.

Configuration File: This should show the name of your configuration file. If not, just see if it says ""OK"" or similar. This file is downloaded from your ISP and tells the modem how it should behave.

Security: This should always say ""Enabled"" or ""BPI+"" in all cases.

, These are classified into two types, upstream and downstream. You'll have some downstream channels and also some upstream channels. Each one has separate power levels and SNR listed for it. Downstream power levels should be between -10 dBmV and 10 dBmV. Ideally, it should be as close to zero as possible. Many line technicians aim for the even more stringent +/-5 dBmV range. As long as it's within these ranges, they should be okay. Many modems are even rated to +/- 15 dBmV. Too low means your signal is weak, and too high means the signal is strong - possibly too strong (and will need to be corrected with an attenuator or splitter).
Upstream power levels should be between 40 - 50 dBmV. Think of this measurement as how loud your modem has to scream to be heard by the CMTS. If you are transmitting less than 40 dBmV, your upstream SNR will degrade (If you're whispering and the CMTS is shouting at the same time, they'll have trouble hearing). If it's higher than about 50 dBmV, your cable modem may intermittently go offline or have a high number of uncorrectable codeword errors.
One of the most common causes of upstream power problems is splitters. If possible, your cable modem for your internet should be on the first splitter attached to the line that comes in from your house. Further splitters will degrade the signal quality — TVs can handle it, but you will see more noticeable problems with the internet.

, Typically, you will only see the downstream SNR value as it can be more accurately measured. Your ISP can see what your upstream SNR would be from their end. With this value, the higher the better. You want this number over 30, although you might not experience any problems 25 or above. There is no real maximum to this number, but it rarely goes higher than 40 dB on most installations because there is inevitably some noise in the line.

, A lot of the events in here are usually unimportant, however if you have been experiencing internet issues then some of them may be relevant. Look for any thing with a status code of ""Critical"" or similar, and ignore those that say ""Notice"". Here are some examples of errors you might encounter.



No Ranging Response received - T3 time-out: The cable modem's knocking at the door, trying to find your ISP. Alas no one's home or it can't hear them if they are. This is usually indicative of an upstream noise problem, so check your upstream power level to see if it's too high (perhaps > 55). If so, call your ISP for help. SYNC Timing Synchronization failure - Failed to acquire FEC framing: FEC means forward error correction. Possible causes include too much noise, low signal, or a bad cable modem.

Resetting the cable modem due to docsDevResetNow: Normally a reboot issued by your ISP, due to a firmware update, provisioning your modem, or other upstream maintenance. It's not usually something to worry about. If it happens frequently, you should ask your ISP what's going on — there might be an outage in your area they're trying to fix.

, Wait a few minutes and then plug it back in. Your modem should attempt registration with your internet service provider again. You should see status indicators on the modem to let you know its progress. If it fails to register, it reboots and starts from the beginning. If you continue to experience issues, you'll need to contact your ISP to send out a cable technician to look at your line. It's also possible your modem is faulty and will need to be replaced.

Keep the room cool.,

Allow for monitoring.",How to Design a Server Room," Physical space needs must be decided before any further details are incorporated into the server room. There needs to be enough room for the servers, wires, cables, and other necessary equipment. Data should be kept away from an exterior wall, if possible.;
, For space maximization, utilize cabinets and shelving to store the physical machinery and other computer inventory in the server room. Telco racks are popular in many operational spaces, and a single rack can hold hundreds of 1U high servers and blade servers.

, A proper server room needs to stay cool and dry to keep all of the equipment from overheating. One option is to install a raised floor to distribute cooling. Another option is to use in-row cooling units, which do not require a raised floor and move the compressor to the roof. You may want a ceiling that is at least 12 to 18 feet (3.7 to 5.5 m) high. Keep a thermometer in the room to ensure the temperature is moderate. A dehumidifier may be necessary if the room gets too humid.

, A server room should have enough space under the floor to run electrical cables. Have an electrician install power whips from 1 central electrical panel. This cuts down on the electrical services being routed to each individual fixture.

, The server room should be restricted to only the people who need to go there to do work. Keep it locked, or install a handprint or fingerprint recognition system. A secure server room is essential for data protection.

, The server room should be monitored around the clock. All activity coming over the network servers should be scanned for abnormalities. Software exists to allow for notifications to pagers, or cell phones and emails if the monitoring reveals anything alarming.

Connect to the wireless network on your wireless devices.",How to Create a Local Area Network (LAN)," When setting up a LAN, you'll need to know how many computers will be connecting to the network via Ethernet. This will determine the number of ports you'll need.


If you have four or less computers that you need to hardwire, you'll just need a router. If you have more than four, you'll likely need to get a switch to extend the number of ports available on your router.;
, If you want to allow devices to connect wirelessly, you'll need a router that can broadcast a wireless network. Most routers you'll find at the store or online have wireless capabilities.


Network switches do not allow wireless devices to connect, and can only be used for hardwired LANs or to extend the number of ports available to the router.

, If you want all of the connected devices to have access to the internet, you'll need a router to handle the connections. If you don't need the devices to have a network connection, you can just use a network switch.

, This isn't much of an issue in most homes, but network cables cannot run longer than 100m (328 ft). If you have to run cable farther than this, you'll need switches in between.

, If you're filling all of the ports on your hardware, consider future-proofing to allow for more devices in the future.

, To create a LAN, you'll need a router or switch, which will act as the hub of your network. These devices route information to the correct computers.


A router will automatically handle assigning IP addresses to each device on the network, and is necessary if you intend to share your internet connection with all the connected devices. It is highly recommended that you build your network with a router, even if you're not sharing an internet connection.
A network switch is like a simpler version of a router. It will allow connected devices to talk to each other, but will not automatically assign IP addresses and will not share an internet connection. Switches are best used to expand the number of LAN ports available on the network, as they can be connected to the router.

, You don't need to do much to set up a router for a basic LAN. Just plug it into a power source, preferably close to your modem if you plan on sharing the internet connection through it.

, If you're sharing the internet connection from your modem, connect the modem to the WAN/INTERNET port on the router. This is usually a different color from the other ports.

, If you're using a switch to expand the number of ports available on the router, plug an Ethernet cable into any LAN port on the router and any LAN port on the switch. This will expand the network to the rest of the LAN ports on the switch.

, Use Ethernet cables to connect each computer to an open LAN port on your router or switch. It doesn't matter what order the ports are connected in.


Ethernet cables cannot reliably transfer data at lengths larger than 100m (328 ft).

, If you're only using a switch as your network hub, setting up one computer as a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server will allow all of the connected computers to easily obtain IP addresses.


You can quickly create a DHCP server on one of your computers by installing a third-party utility.
The rest of the computers on the network will obtain IP addresses automatically once the server is running, as long as they are set to do so.

, After each computer obtains an IP address, they'll be able to talk to each other on the network. If you're using a router to share your internet connection, each computer will be able to access the internet.

, Once your network is up, you won't see anything on other computers unless that computer has shared files. You can designate files, folders, drives, printers, and other devices as shared so that anyone on the network, or just specific users, can access them.

, When you're setting up a wireless router, you'll need to keep a few things in mind:


For easy troubleshooting, the router should usually be placed close to your modem.
It should be located centrally to allow for maximum wireless coverage.
You'll need to connect a computer to the router via Ethernet during the setup process.

, You'll be using your computer's web browser to configure the router's wireless network.

, You can use any web browser.

, You can typically find this printed on the bottom of the router, or in your router's documentation. If you can't find it, there are a couple things you can try:


Windows - Right-click the Network button in the System Tray → click Open Network and Sharing Center → click the Ethernet link → click Details → find the Default Gateway entry for your router's IP address.
Mac - Click the Apple menu and select System Preferences → click Network → click your Ethernet connection → find the Router entry for your router's IP address.

, You'll be prompted for the login information for your router. The default login information varies depending on your router model, but the username is often ""admin"" and the password is often ""admin,"" ""password,"" or blank.


You can look up your router model at https://portforward.com/router-password/ to find the default login information.

, The exact location and wording of this section varies from router to router.

, This may also be called ""Network name."" This is the name that appears in the list of available wireless networks.

, This is the most secure option currently available on most routers. Avoid WPA and WEP except when explicitly required by older, incompatible devices.

, This password will be required in order to connect to the network. The field may be labeled ""Pre-Shared Key.""

, Depending on the router, you may have to check a box or click a button at the top of the Wireless menu to enable the wireless network.

, This will save the changes to your router.

, It may take a minute for the router and network to come back online.

, Once the network is back up, it will appear on the available network list on any wireless devices in range. When connecting to the network, users will be prompted to enter the password you created.


Computers connected to the router via Ethernet will not require a password.

If you don't find such a documentation maybe you are lucky to find a colleague that wants to give you details. You can have the surprise to find people that don't want to share information with the rest of the team: sad situation but real.
;
, If you want to create yourself a network documentation from scratch you probably understand the necessity and usability. You need to establish the format in which you will store the documentation and other aspects such as people who will work and access and update it.

, You must understand how your network works in order to establish what information you will need to help you when trouble arise.

, If you want something simple, you can download a network documentation software from the internet and you need to make sure that you have the proper access to install the software and to access the servers and subnets on the network. After you will run the software you will gain a drawing which will have a scheme of servers, computers and other network devices connected. Key words for this step could be: proper rights and permissions to install / run this network documentation software.

, If you work in a network with many servers and other network devices you can use this software, but if you have a simpler and smaller network it's good to create some schemes yourself.

, That's necessary because let's say a server is down and you don't know the reason for that and one reason could be that after applying some updates (for example) something goes not quite well. You can also have hardware failures (other example) and of course one can find a list of other reasons for that.

, If you have a good network diagram you can prove compliance with policies, security standard and that will help not only you but by proving compliance with policies your managers will be much more confident in the IT department.

This usually isn't required on a new router, but if you suspect the router was returned and resold to you, it may not function as expected without resetting first (this is also the only way to access the setup page if you forget the login username and password). Consult the manual for the location of the reset button, as it varies depending on model - but is usually found on the rear panel near the power jack.,, If 192.168.1.1 will not load, try 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.2.1 instead. The manual will provide the default IP address for the router if the router fails to produce a login page. This can also indicate a router that has not been restored to factory defaults via reset procedure detailed above.


, The SSID must match that of the primary router and the channel must be different than that of the primary router (Channel 1 for primary router and 6 or 11 for secondary router are good choices as they are separated enough by frequency).

, Use of your cell phone number can be a good security key choice, as these numbers are not listed in any directory, etc. Save the settings.

, I set mine to the highest number in my network: 192.168.0.254. This puts the access point ""out of the way"", so to speak. Note: Some network routers are set by default to ""start"" in the high range (xxx.xxx.xxx.254), so if your network is like this, set the new wireless device to a lower unused number. 192.168.0.253 will do.

, There only needs to be a single DHCP server on most small networks or subnets. The original, main router (either a stand alone type or one built into your provider's cable modem or DSL modem) will provide IP addresses to all devices connected to it - including those that connect thru the access point just created.

Get a USB-to-USB bridging cable.It’s important to use the right type of USB-to-USB cable, as there is more than one variety.,
Install the software on both computers.Do this before plugging the cable into the computers.,
Plug each end of the USB cable into a USB port on each computer.,
Launch the transfer software on both computers.,
Browse one computer’s files from the other.,
Share files.",How to Connect Two Computers Using USB1," The only USB-to-USB cable that should be used to connect two PCs is a called a “bridging cable,” sometimes also referred to as a “USB data transfer cable,” “USB networking cable,” or “USB link cable.” The correct cable has an electronic circuit at the center (you’ll see the bulge) and male USB connectors at both ends.;
, The cable likely came with a CD or DVD containing software. Insert the disc and run the installer when it appears on the screen. If it doesn’t launch automatically, press ⊞ Win+E to launch the File Explorer, then navigate to your CD/DVD ROM drive on the left side of the screen. Double-click on the file called “setup” or “installer.”


If the cable didn’t come with software, go to the manufacturer’s website and look for a section called “Software” or “Drivers.” Download the software made specifically for your cable. Do this on both computers.
If you are given the opportunity to select a “mode,” select “link” mode (may be called “bridge” or “transfer” mode).

, Try not to stretch the cable out too much. If the cable must be pulled taut to connect the computers, move the computers closer to one another to avoid breaking the cable.

, No matter how the software was installed, there should be an entry for it in the Start menu. Click “Start,” go to “All Programs” or “All Apps,” and select the software from the menu. From this point, you won’t need to keep switching back and forth between computers to transfer files—everything can be done from one computer.

, Notice that the software looks like a file manager with two windows (called “local” and “remote”)—one for each computer. The Local window displays files on the computer you’re currently using, and Remote shows the files on the other computer.

, If you’d like to copy something from the remote computer to the one you’re using, drag the desired file from the Remote window the desired destination in the Local window. You’ll also be able to drag files from the local computer to the remote computer the same way.

Gather the necessary accessories.Macs cannot technically connect to one another via a USB cable—the closest you can get to a USB-to-USB connection on a Mac is to run a cable from one computer’s USB port to the other computer’s Ethernet port.,
Connect the USB adapter into a USB port on Computer 1.,
Plug one end of the Ethernet cable into the RJ-45 port of Computer 2.,
Plug the other end of the Ethernet cable (connected to Computer 2) into the USB adapter.,
Open the Sharing preferences on both computers.,
Use Finder on one computer to connect to the other.,
Copy files back and forth between computers.",How to Connect Two Computers Using USB2,"


USB-to-Ethernet connector: These connectors are universal, meaning you don’t have to buy one specifically made for Apple computers. One end of the adapter has a male USB connector, the other a female RJ-45 port for the Ethernet cable.
10/100BASE-T Ethernet cable: This cable is standard, has RJ-45 connectors at either end, and can be purchased at any electronics store.
See How to Transfer Files Between Two Macs for simpler ways to get files from one computer to another.

, If only one of the computers has an Ethernet port, plug the USB adapter into that computer. Otherwise, it doesn’t matter which one you plug into first.

, This port is likely on the side or back of your computer.

, The wiring is complete.

, On each computer, open the Apple menu, click “System Preferences,” and then select “Sharing.” When the Sharing preferences appear on the screen, you’ll also see the name of the computer you’re on.

, It doesn’t matter which computer you use to begin this process. On one computer, open Finder, select “Go,” then “Connect to server.” Click “Browse” to show a list of possible computers to connect to. When you see the name of the second computer appear in the results, double-click it, then enter your password (if prompted).

, You should now see a list of the files on the second computer from the first computer. Drag and drop files between computers within this Finder window.

Connect the two routers.",How to Connect Two Routers1," This will be the router that your modem is connected to. Generally, you'll want your newest and most fully-featured router as your base router. If you have two of the same router, it doesn't matter which one you pick.;
, This will be the router that is extending your original network. This will usually be your older router. This router will control the secondary network if you are creating a LAN-to-WAN network (see below).

, During the configuration process, you can keep the routers near your computer so that you can easily access them. You can set them up in their permanent locations later.

, A LAN-to-LAN (Local Area Network) connection extends your network size, allowing more devices to connect. Devices can share files and resources to any other device on the network. A LAN-to-WAN (Wide Area Network) connection creates a secondary network (LAN) inside the main network (WAN). This allows you to place restrictions on a subset of devices that are connected to the smaller network. The downside is that they cannot share files or resources with the main network.


Setting up a LAN-to-WAN network allows you to modify the DNS for just the secondary network, affecting what sites can be visited. The secondary network also makes it extra difficult for hackers to access any devices connected. This is great for parents that want to monitor and control their childrens' internet access.

, Configure it as you normally would to set up the network. Since this router will be handling the connection to the internet, set it up as if you were only using a single router.


Most routers can be accessed by entering the address 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1, or 192.168.0.1

Note router's IP address and subnet mask. The IP address is the same one that you used to access the router's configuration page. The subnet mask is typically 255.255.255.0.
If you are creating a LAN-to-WAN network, set the primary router's DHCP service to give out addresses between 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.50. If you are creating a LAN-to-LAN network, you can leave the DHCP settings at their default.
Disconnect the computer from the router when you are finished configuring it.

, Open the configuration page. If you are making a LAN-to-LAN network, change the IP address so that it matches the first router, except increase the last digit by one (e.g. 192.168.1.1 becomes 192.168.1.2). If you are making a LAN-to-WAN network, change the IP address so that it matches the first router, except increase the second-to-last digit by one (e.g. 192.168.1.1 becomes 192.168.2.1). Ensure that the subnet mask is the same as the primary router.


If you are making a LAN-to-WAN network, change the secondary router's WAN IP address to 192.168.1.51.
If your router have the option UPnP disable it on the second router.

, If you are creating a LAN-to-LAN network, the DHCP service should be turned off on the secondary router. If you are creating a LAN-to-WAN network, the DHCP server on the secondary router should hand out addresses between 192.168.2.2 and 192.168.2.50., If both routers are wireless, you will want to manually set the channels so that signals do not interfere with each other. Set your primary router to channels 1-6, and set your secondary router to channel 11.

, Now that everything is configured, you can place your routers wherever you need. Keep in mind that you will need to run Ethernet cable between the two routers. You can run Ethernet cable through the wall if you need to reach another room. For convenience, you'll probably want to place your primary router near your modem.

, Plug one end of the Ethernet cable into any LAN port of the primary router.


If you are creating a LAN-to-LAN network, plug the other end into a LAN port of the secondary router.
If you are creating a LAN-to-WAN network, plug the other end into the WAN port of the secondary router.

If you are a single administrator you can use a paper notebook if you prefer that or a Tablet PC or a PDA.,
You can create an electronic journal.,
You can use for that a folder shared on a file server or you can use an internal website for IT department (an intranet website) or you can use collaborative software that connects in a section, only those administrators.

,
Also we can consider the possibility that 2 administrators access at the same time that journal to edit it.,
Now the content: you need a calendar where you could write about important events, meetings, invitations related to network administration, when the hardware and software support expires, when you plan to upgrade the hardware on servers or on workstations (new applications or new operating systems might require upgrade for hardware and software), when you plan to execute backups or test backups in a test environment to see if you can rely on backups and that the restore process goes well and to be confident you and the other administrators that when problems will occur everyone of you will be able to restore the critical servers and network applications, so downtime will be small.

,
You can place in this calendar daily tasks, weekly tasks, monthly tasks and create a table to track if and how those tasks where executed.

,
You can use sections for each server / types of server roles and write any change you make and the reason for that change.,
You can have a section about licenses.,
You can have a section about updates, about testing updates for operating systems and applications before deploying those updates in the network and the result of those tests.,
You need a contacts database, contacts with hardware and software partners.

,
You need another section to note about every problems occurred and the actions made to solve those problems and of course the things you learned from that unpleasant experience.

,
You can have a section to write about training sessions offered by specialized training centers for administrators and a schedule for that.

,
You can have a section to note about feedback with suggestions, ideas from users and administrators or people that offer helpdesk.,
You can write about complains from users or administrators and about their suggestions.

",How to Create a Network Administrator Journal," You can sync your notes on your PC and use databases, note taking software or something else.;
, If there are many administrators they need a place to store that journal so that every administrator to be able to access and edit it; that way the journal can be easily secured and you can set a schedule for backup.

,, For this reason it is better to use software that can manage multiple versions for files or other collaborative software where conflicts don't occur.


Note: This journal is not a network documentation. It must help everyone who see it to have a complete view of the updates that where made in hardware or software after the network was created, updates made by the administrators.

,,, You can place that information in tables. Any new role added to a server must be documented. If someone wants to see details about a server, a server role, an application and other aspects related to that subject in this journal you need a search option, maybe an instant search for quick access to data.

, Also you need to track licenses not only on physical but also on virtual machines.

, You can note the results of a research on the Internet to see if other people had problems with those updates.

,,,, This journal is not a knowledge base but you can create one when you need that.

Determine if your equipment is compatible.,
Place both routers near your computer.,
Set up your primary router.,
Open the configuration page on the secondary router.,
Enable Bridge Mode.,
Specify the secondary router's IP address.,
Enter a unique SSID.,
Place the secondary router.",How to Connect Two Routers2," In order to wirelessly bridge two routers, your secondary router must have ""bridge"" or ""repeater"" mode capabilities. This is not common for most retail routers. If your router does not support bridge mode, you may be able to flash DD-WRT onto it, a custom open-source firmware that enables bridge mode.Your router's documentation will let you know if it has bridge mode. You can also look your router's model up online.
Not all routers support DD-WRT. Check the DD-WRT website to see a list of compatible routers.

, During the setup process, it will be easier if you have quick access to both routers, as well as the modem. You can place the routers in their permanent locations when you are done configuring them.

, Plug the primary router into the modem and then connect your computer to it via Ethernet. Your primary router will be configured as you normally would for a wireless network. Make note of the router's IP address, DHCP range, and subnet mask.


Your primary router should be the router with the strongest antennas. This will allow you to set up the secondary router further away.
Disconnect your router after you have finished configuring it for a wireless network.

, Connect the secondary router to your computer with an Ethernet cable and open the configuration page. You do not need to connect it to the modem. Find the ""Internet"" or ""Wireless"" setup page once you have logged in.

, Select ""Bridge Mode"" or ""Repeater Mode"" from the ""Network Mode"", ""Wireless Mode"" or ""Connection Type"" menu on the Wireless page. If you are using DD-WRT, select ""Repeater Bridge"".If there is no menu to select these options, then your router likely does not support bridging.

, Enter in an IP address within the primary router's range. For example, if the primary router's IP address is 192.168.1.1, enter 192.168.1.50 or something else inside the DHCP range of the primary router.


Ensure that the subnet mask is identical to the primary router.

, This will help you know which router on the network you are connecting to. For example, you might have the primary labeled ""Den"" and the secondary labeled ""LivingRoom"".


Ensure that the security is the same type (WEP, WPA, WPA2) and the same password.

, Once you have the secondary router configured, you can place it where you want it to repeat the signal. In order to maintain a good connection, it should be placed in a location where it gets at least 50% signal strength from the primary router.

Requires 512MB of memory to even run, 1GB minimum to run comfortably.
Vista comes pre-configured with User Account Control, a security monitoring system. Any time that an action is about to be performed that requires Administrator status (installing a program, writing to or deleting system files, changing critical system settings, etc.), the user will be asked to allow or deny the action, and must respond to the prompt to continue. This can become quite annoying. User Account Control can be turned off, but that defeats the purpose of the security system.
Vista is sometimes unstable with the current release. The majority of consumer reports call it ""unreliable,"" or ""...just simply the worst operating system for...its complexity."" New patches are being created to fix some problems, and hopefully these concerns will be addressed in the first Service Pack.
You may also have problems especially with printing, the printer doesn't seem to print out your work, photos etc (this problem makes the program bad for the use at schools).

, In the top bar, you will see that iOS has three available protocols: L2TP, PPTP, and IPSec. If your VPN is provided by an employer, then they will most likely inform you as to which protocol to use. If you are using your own hosted VPN, however, then be sure to use a form which is supported by your provider.

, This could be anything you want. For instance, if this is a work VPN, then you could describe it as ""Work."" If you plan to use this VPN for watching an out-of-country Netflix, then you could call it ""Canadian Netflix.""

, This information should have been given to you either by your VPN provider or your employer.

, This field refers to your username which you most likely created when purchasing your hosted VPN or was created for you by an employer.

, To turn this on, tap on the gray button. When it turns green, this feature is turned on. RSA SecureID comprises either a hardware or software mechanism which produces keys to verify a user over periods of time. Most likely, you will only have RSA SecurID in a professional setting.


To turn on RSA SecurID in IPSec, tap on the button for ""Use Certificate"" so it turns green. After choosing ""RSA SecurID,"" click ""Save.""
IPSec will also allow you to use CRYPTOCard, or any certificates in the raw formats .cer, .crt, .der, .p12, and .pfx.

, Your password was most likely provided at the same time as your username. Consult with your employer or VPN provider if you do not have this information.

,


A ""secret"" is used to further authenticate your account. Much like the ""key"" of an RSA Secure ID, the ""secret"" is typically a series of letters and numbers given to you by a provider or employer. If it has not been provided to you then you either may not need to enter anything in that field or you may need to contact your provider or employer in order to obtain the secret.

, Again, this would be given to you, so if your employer or provider have shared this information with you then enter it in this field. If they haven't, then, most likely, you may leave the field blank.

, Click the button next to this field and ensure it is highlighted in green if you want all your internet traffic to go through the VPN.

, At this point, your VPN is connected.


You may turn your VPN connection on or off from the main ""Settings"" page by clicking its corresponding button. If the button is green, then you are connected. If the button is gray, then you are not connected. It will appear directly underneath ""Wi-Fi.""
Also, when your phone is using the VPN connection, an icon will appear in the upper left-hand side of your phone consisting of the capital letters ""VPN"" inside a box.

Reflect on your feelings.,

Ask for guidance or advice.,
Ask for what you need.,
Confide in your closest friends.,
Talk to an older sibling.,
Speak to a mentor about your feelings.",How to Tell Your Parents That You Like Other Girls or Boys," Start by considering the purpose of your conversation with your parents. What do you hope to accomplish by talking to your parents about your feelings? Are you hoping to simply share your feelings for the girl or boy with someone you trust? Are you looking for advice on how to act on your feelings? Or maybe you just want to know that your parents will accept this part of you? Think about the motivations you have for speaking to your parents and what you hope to get out of the conversation.;
, You should take time to organize your thoughts on paper. Jot down notes on what you plan to discuss with your parents. You may also make an outline of your thoughts and what you plan to say in your talk. Organizing your thoughts on paper can make you feel nervous or awkward during your conversation with your parents.


You may also try using a writing prompt to get you thinking and do a freewrite to get your thoughts down on paper. You may use the prompt, ""I hope to tell my parents..."" and then do a timed freewrite for five to 10 minutes (or as long as you need) to get your feelings and thoughts down.

, You may practice what you plan to say by talking to yourself in the mirror and pretending you are talking to your parents. Or you may practice with a friend or a sibling so you are prepared when it comes to talking to your parents about how you are feeling.

, Of course, the hope is that your parents will react with love and understanding, but it is possible the conversation may not go as smoothly as you hope. Hope for a positive reaction, but know how to care for yourself if they react with shock, grief, disappointment, shame, guild, or blame.If you have friends, family members, or teachers who already know, ask them to be available so that you can call or get together after you speak with your parents.Tell yourself that, no matter their reaction, you will be okay. Your parents may initially have a negative reaction, but often things get much better with time.If there is a chance you might get kicked out of the house and you are dependent on your parents, make sure you have a safe place to stay, either with a friend or another relative.
Allow your parents time to adjust. You may be disappointed if they don't immediately react in a positive way, but give your parents some time to get used to the idea. It likely took you time to totally process and accept your feelings, so give your parents some room to process, too.Guide your parents to some resources where they may educate themselves and learn how to support you. Websites for organizations such as PFLAG (Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People), and GLSEN (Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network) can help your parents learn more about how to support you. Your parents may want to look for a PFLAG meeting to connect with other parents.If your parents have ever threatened to hurt you if they found out you like people of the same sex, if they regularly say homophobic things, or if you feel you would be absolutely devastated by a negative reaction, you may wish to hold off on telling them., You should start by choosing a spot for the discussion that is quiet and private. This could be in the living room of your family home, on the couch, or at the kitchen table. You may also choose to have the talk in your backyard or on the porch. Choose a place where you feel comfortable and at ease, as this will make the talk feel less awkward for both you and your parents.If you think you might be more comfortable having the discussion away from home, make sure you are in a space that is private and quiet. This could be a park near your home or a favorite spot in your city or town that you like to go to with your parents.

, You may not have the same relationship with your mother as you do with your father, or vice versa. This is natural and common among young people. You may be closer to one parent and feel more comfortable talking to him or her about your feelings, or you may feel good talking to both parents at the same time. You should confide in the parent you feel most comfortable with, as this will allow you to be honest and open.Talking to one parent may also be less overwhelming for you and allow you to address one person instead of two. You may also get different perspectives on your feelings for this boy or girl, based on which parent you speak to. Regardless, you should go with the parent that you feel will be the most supportive and honest with you.

, You should start the conversation by using “I” statements, as this will show your parents that you are speaking honestly and from the heart. Try to be clear about your emotions and how you are feeling. If you are confused about your feelings, be okay with expressing your confusion to your parents. Say “I feel…” or “I think…” when you talk to your parents to show them you are speaking from your perspective.For example, you may say, “I think I am developing feelings for this girl at school,” or, “I feel like I have feelings for this boy in my class.”
If you are unclear about your feelings, but still want to talk to your parents about your emotions, you may say, “I am confused about my feelings for this boy at school,” or, “I am unsure why I feel so emotional when I’m around this girl.” These statements will communicate to your parents that you want to talk to them about your feelings and unpack them, even if you are unsure why you are feeling a certain way.

, You should also try to maintain body language that is open and relaxed during the talk with your parents. This will allow you to appear calm and collected, even if you are feeling emotional. It will also encourage your parents to feel comfortable and calm during the talk, which could lead to a more meaningful discussion.Maintain eye contact when you are speaking to your parents and sit or stand up straight. Keep your arms relaxed at your sides or in your lap and lean forward, towards your parents, to show them you are engaged in the conversation.
Try not to fidget or pick at your clothing or jewellery when you speak. Speak your thoughts clearly and with conviction so your parents know you are sincere about your feelings.

, Once you share your feelings with your parents, they will likely have a few questions. You should be prepared to field their questions and answer them to the best of your ability. Be honest and thoughtful in your answers, as this will lead to a discussion that is useful and meaningful for both you and your parents.For example, your parents may ask, “Why do you like this person?” or “What interests you about this boy or this girl?” They may ask questions about your crush’s inner qualities and values.
Try to answer these questions with thought and honesty. You may respond by saying, “I think I like him because he is friendly and nice to everyone,” or, “I like her because she is kind and funny.” If you are not sure how to answer these questions, you may say honestly, “I don’t know,” or, “I have to think more about that before I can answer.”

, You may end your conversation with your parents by asking for feedback or advice on your feelings. Getting an adult perspective on your feelings can help you better understand them and process them. Your parents have likely had experience with romantic feelings and crushes before, so they may offer some sound advice that you can use.You may ask your parents, “What do you think I should do about my feelings?”, or, “How would you handle this situation if you were in my shoes?” You may also ask your parents for advice on specific things you might do to address your feelings, such as “Do you think I should go on a date with her?”, or, “Do you think I should spend more time with him, one on one?”
Your parents may also offer you more advice or guidance once the conversation is over. You may update your parents on how you are feeling about your crush and talk to them about your feelings as you process them. Keeping your parents up to date can help you feel supported as you deal with your emotions.

, If the main reason for this conversation is to get validation and reassurance from your parents, it's okay to ask for it outright. If you really just want to know that your parents will accept you when they have this new information about you, you can say something like, ""I know you might be surprised, but I need to know that you still love me and accept me if I like girls/boys.""

, You may decide to share your feelings with other people besides your parents to get a different perspective on how you are feeling. Sharing your feelings with your closest friends can help you acknowledge them better and process them. Plus, getting another perspective on your feelings from peers that are your age could be beneficial.You may talk to your friends about your feelings for a specific person, especially if the person is a mutual friend or in your friend circle. You may simply confide your feelings in a close friend or ask for advice on what to do about your feelings.
Keep in mind some kids get teased for having a crush or a romantic interest in someone. Try to only share your feelings with friends who are mature. You may talk to a friend who is a little older than you or a friend who has experienced crushes before, as they could better relate to what you are going through.

, You can also reach out to an older sibling for advice and guidance on how to deal with your crush. You may feel more comfortable talking to an older sibling rather than a friend, as she may have experience with romantic relationships already. If you are close to a particular sibling who is older, ask her if you can have a one on one chat or bring up the topic of your feelings when you two are alone, hanging out.Try to talk to an older sibling who has already had romantic partners or is currently in a romantic relationship. She may be able to offer better advice and guidance, as she has experienced crushes and romantic feelings first hand.

, You may also reach out to an older mentor in your life, such as a coach, a teacher, a guidance counselor at school, or an older family friend. Sharing your feelings with a mentor you trust can make you feel supported and less alone.You may speak to the mentor one on one about your feelings with a particular boy or girl and ask him for advice on how to address your feelings. Be honest and open to your mentor and accept his feedback, as he likely has experience in this area.

Do not hide a relationship from your family.",How to Tell Your Mom You Like a Guy," You may feel nervous opening up to your mom about a crush. It can feel weird to talk about something so private with a parent. You may also worry that your mom will be upset about you growing up. Try to relax going into the conversation.It’s natural to be nervous about approaching this subject with your parents. It can feel strange to bring this subject up. Your mother has lived an entire life up until the moment you were born, so she most likely has some great advice for you. Parents generally like it when their kids seek advice from them, so you could be opening up a chance to feel closer with your mom.
Your mom probably had crushes herself growing up. She probably remembers what it's like to be your age. She understands you need an adult's guidance sometimes, so don't be shy about talking.
Remember, your mom may look concerned or worried while you're talking to her. She may have a lot of questions or concerns. Don't take this as a sign of disapproval. Your mom is simply trying to make sure you're safe and happy.;
, You want to make sure your mom is not busy or distracted. Work on finding a time and location that works with your mom's schedule.You can talk in a public place, if you feel comfortable, but it may be easier to talk in private. You can talk in your bedroom, for example, or in a quiet room in your home.
Keep your mom's schedule in mind when deciding when to talk. If your mom is always busy Wednesday and Thursday nights, do not talk during these times. Instead, pick a weeknight when she's usually home.

, Brainstorming a little beforehand can help you manage your stress about the conversation. Take some time before approaching your mom to plan what to say.It can help to make lists. Write a long list of everything you want to discuss, as well as the feelings you're having. You can also compose your feelings in a letter or in your journal.
If you feel extra nervous, practice talking in front of the mirror, or practice saying what you want to say out loud by yourself. It may feel silly, but it can help you prepare.

, Approach your mom and let her know you need to talk. If you're nervous, take a few deep breaths beforehand.Starting the conversation does not have to be complicated. You can begin by letting your mom know you want to talk.
Say something like, ""Mom, can we talk?"" or ""Mom, there's something I want to tell you.""

, Do not withhold information. You want to build a relationship based around trust, especially if you're hoping to gain permission to date. Being honest will make your mom more likely to trust and believe you.Tell her about the boy you have a crush on. Let her know how you know him and what he's like. If there's anything you worry she may not like about him, let her know anyway. It's better she finds out from you than discovering down the road.
Keep in mind, your mom may have reservations about the boy for a variety of reasons. While this can be frustrating, it's always best to be honest. You could end up damaging your relationship later if you lie now. If there's something you're nervous about telling her, say something like, ""I know you might not like this, but Mason is two grades ahead of me.""

, Actually getting your words out can be hard, so stay calm. Tell your mom how you're feeling about the boy and why you like him. Being direct is always for the best.Take a few deep breaths if you're nervous. Say something like, ""Mom, I've been thinking about Mason a lot lately. I think I have feelings for him.""
The conversation will run smoothly if you don't make your mom do guess work. Do not beat around the bush. Simply state you like the guy.

, You may assume your mom does not remember what it's like to be your age, but this is not the case. Even if your mom does not tell you exactly what you want to hear, listen to what she has to say.If you disagree, try to see your mom's side. For example, maybe you're a freshmen and the boy is a senior. Your mom may have reservations as the boy may be older and more experienced. She also may worry about your feelings. If the boy goes away to college next year, for example, you may end up heartbroken.
Try to listen as much as you talk. Avoid interrupting, even if your mom is saying something you do not like.

, Kids and parents do not always agree about dating. If you want to date the boy you like, your mom may have certain rules. Pay attention to what your mom says so there are no misunderstandings between the two of you.If you're still in middle school, your mom may not want you dating at all. If she does allow dating, there may be strict rules. For example, you may be allowed to go to school events, like dances and sports games, with the boy. You may not be able to go on one-on-one dates with him.
If you're still in elementary school, your mom may not want you dating at all. While this can be frustrating, keep in mind your mom has your best interest at heart. You are still very young, and still have a lot of growing up to do.

, You and your mom may not agree about dating. For cultural, religious, or personal reasons, there may be strict rules regarding dating in your home. If your mom says no to dating, see if a compromise can be reached.See if your mom would allow you to hang out with this boy in supervised settings. For example, maybe he could come hang out at your home. Maybe you could go to public places with him, where others are around.
You could also ask if you could pursue a friendship with this guy. Maybe your parents would be open to allowing you to make new friends, as long as you hold off on dating for now.

, If you are considering becoming sexually active, then it is a good idea to talk to your mother about sex first.Even if you are just curious about sex and not planning to become sexually active, it is a good idea to talk with your mother and ask questions. Your mother will likely be able to answer your questions and may even be impressed by your willingness to ask her about it.


Try saying something like, “I am considering becoming sexually active, but I have questions. Would you mind if I asked you some of them?” or, “I am not planning to become sexually active, but I have questions about it. Would you mind if I ask you some questions about sex?”

, Your parents may have different rules for you and your siblings. All children are different, so do not be surprised if you are treated differently. If your brother is older, for example, he may be allowed to date while you are not.Avoid getting defensive. Don't say, ""But you let Mark date. Why can't I?"" This may make you come off as argumentative, which can frustrate your mom.
Try to leave siblings out of the discussion as much as possible. Focus on your relationship with your mother, and leave brothers and sisters out of it.

, This is likely to frustrate your mom. It will not help you find a solution to the problem. In the event your mom is unwilling to compromise on certain rules, try to let it go and move on.Arguing does not help smooth over a situation. Even if you feel your mom's rule are unfair, baiting her into an argument will not help her see your side. If anything, she may become more frustrated. She may think you lack maturity, which could result in harsher rules.
Instead of arguing, try to be mature. Say something like, ""Okay. I don't agree, but I respect that you feel that way."" In the future, you can try raising the subject again. Your mom may change her mind down the road.

, Compromise is possible, but you need to keep your expectations in check. If your parents are very religious and do not allow dating at all, for example, you can't expect them to abandon that rule completely. However, there may be a more realistic ways to work things out.Be mature. Try saying something like, ""We're definitely not seeing eye to eye on this. How do you think we should proceed?""
See if there's a way to change rules slightly. Say you're 13 and your mom does not want you dating until you're 16. You can request that she maybe allow you to start dating at 14 or 15 instead.

, It's possible your mom won't like your crush. There are a variety of reasons your mom may disapprove. In this situation, there are things you can do to cope.Try to understand your mom's point of view. She comes from a different time than you, and has different values as a result. If she criticizes your crush, do not criticize her viewpoint.
Avoid taking a side. It's okay if you like someone your parents do not like. Relationships, especially when you're young, may be somewhat fleeting. There's no need to take a firm side in the situation. Simply acknowledge your mother's feelings, while still accepting you like the boy.

, This is a bad idea. Your parents will want to know who you're seeing. They will feel shut out if you're hiding things from them. Even if your mother disapproves, you should still tell her if you like someone and want to date him."

Do your homework.,
Greet her warmly.,
Bring a small gift.,
Pay attention to your appearance.,
Have good manners.,
Avoid PDA.,
Remember that she is probably nervous, too.",How to Win over Your Boyfriend's Mum1," Ask your boyfriend to tell you about his mum. Find out her background, her hobbies, conversation suggestions, what to avoid talking about… everything you can learn about her! Go into your first encounter knowing what to expect. Here are some things you might want to find out:Where she grew up
What she does/did for a living
Hobbies and interests
Food preferences (if your first meeting will involve a meal)
Definite conversation no-nos (don’t bring up dogs if she recently lost her beloved pet);
, Say hello with a pleasant smile and a friendly tone of voice. Make good eye contact when you greet her — don't look at the ground or avoid her gaze. Shake hands (or even give her a hug, if she’s the hugging type), but do not feel compelled to do anything you are not comfortable doing.

, It does not have to be anything fancy, nor should it be anything too personal.If you bring a food item, make sure she doesn’t have any food allergies. Some ideas include:


Flowers
Chocolates or candy
A bottle of wine (find out from your boyfriend beforehand if she drinks alcohol)
A regional food specialty unique to your area
Homemade baked goods
Something you made, if you are crafty or artistic

, Dress appropriately. While you shouldn't try to hide who you are, it might be a good idea to dress on the conservative side when you first meet her. You shouldn't feel like you're being fake or hiding too much of your personality — if you are proud of your tattoos, don't feel you need to cover them up — but try and present yourself in the best possible light.Keep your makeup simple and subtle, if you wear it.
Make sure your hair isn’t in your face. You will look more confident.

, While good manners aren’t necessarily memorable, bad manners will stand out. Smile, be polite, and make sure your table manners are on point. No chewing with your mouth open!Watch your language. The first meeting is not the time to let your boyfriend’s mother know you curse like a sailor!
Pay compliments. While you don’t want to come across as insincere or ingratiating, a well-timed, genuine compliment will be appreciated. For example, if his mum has a beautiful home, you can compliment her taste and say, “I think Greg is a great decorator, too. He must have inherited your good taste!”

, Public Displays of Affection are not appropriate for the first time you meet a parent. Remember that PDA might make his parents uncomfortable, just as seeing his parents' PDA might be uncomfortable for you. This time is for you to begin developing a relationship with your boyfriend’s mum, not about you and your boyfriend. Hands off for a few hours!, She is meeting her son’s significant other and likely wants to make a good impression on you. Smile and help her feel at ease.

Ask lots of questions.,
Make sure you’re not talking too much.,
Find common interests.,
Be agreeable.,
Ask her about your boyfriend.,
Remember that she has known him longer.,
Watch your sense of humor.",How to Win over Your Boyfriend's Mum2," Most people enjoy talking about themselves. People tend to have a better impression of the listener when the listener gives them lots of opportunity to share their stories.Find out about her background and let her tell her favorite stories.She will likely enjoy retelling a favorite story for a new audience.

, When some people get nervous, they have a tendency to blab on and on. If you are one of those people, find a way to keep yourself in check.


For example, you may want to have your boyfriend pay attention to your conversation, and come up with a signal (coughing, pulling his ear) if you are talking too much.
You can also keep an eye out for behavioral gestures that indicate the listeners is losing interest, such as looking away, or gestures that indicate the listener can't get a word in, like them opening their mouth to says something but then stopping.

, Learn about her hobbies ahead of time from your boyfriend. If you have something in common, come prepared with some stories of your own.


Do you both love to travel? Have her share some of her trips with you, and ask for her advice. For example, “Mike told me you went to Italy last year. I’ve never been there. Which cities did you visit?”
If you both enjoy watching football, talk about your favorite team or recent games.

, Now is not the time to be the authority on everything. Do your best to keep the peace and maintain a positive impression.


Stick to neutral topics. Now is not the time to bring up religion, politics, or your ex-boyfriends, for example.
Try building on the statement you disagree with in order to continue the conversation. Maybe you don’t agree with her assessment that “everyone is glued to their phones these days.” Instead of disagreeing and letting her statement hang there, you could say, “I always feel like I need to have my phone with me. I have so much important information on it!”
Change the subject if you are worried you will get into an argument.

, She’ll enjoy telling stories about him, and as a bonus, you both share a common interest!


Have her tell you stories about what he was like as a child.
Ask her about family traditions, like holidays and favorite recipes.

, Don’t be a know-it-all when it comes to your boyfriend. She’s known him his whole life, and you’ve known him for a few months.Don’t correct her about his preferences. If his mother serves him scrambled eggs, and you know for a fact he only likes his eggs poached right now, don’t say anything. He can let her know.
Keep your nose out of your boyfriend and his mother’s relationship. They have their own dynamic and their own ways of relating. You might not like her nitpicky criticism of her son, but that is up to him to address with her, not you.

, Make sure it is not directed at her and that it doesn’t cross the line into inappropriate territory. You will have to figure out her sense of humor and how far you can stretch yours.


Jokes about sex, religion, and politics should be avoided. Jokes that are overly sarcastic or put people down will likely not leave her with a favorable impression.

"
"
Invite her places.,
Think of her.,
Continue to share your common interests.,
Ask her advice.,
Offer to help.,
Invite her over for dinner.",How to Win over Your Boyfriend's Mum3," Ask her to join you and your boyfriend for brunch, a trip to a museum, or another non-romantic date. She may not accept, but it always feels good to receive an invitation!

, Keep your eyes open and look for ways to further develop your relationship with her. For example, if she loves art, and you see a notice for a special exhibit, let her know about it.

, She’ll appreciate the effort you are putting into the relationship to further your conversations. Go with whatever common ground you can find, even if it’s something as small as a mutual love of a TV show.


For example, “So have you started rewatching Downton Abbey? I think I’m going to; I miss it so much! Who was your favorite character on it again?”

, People love to be needed and helpful. Learn her areas of expertise and ask for help in them.For example, if she is a terrific baker, ask her to suggest an easy recipe you could learn so you could improve your baking.
If she loves gardening, ask to see her garden and for suggestions for plants you could grow.

, Do the dishes after dinner at her house, bring a side dish to a family meal, or take out the trash. She may say you don’t need to do anything, and if so, take her at her word.If you are having a hard time talking to her, doing a chore may also get you a break from your conversation!

, Invite her to your place for dinner with you and your boyfriend. You do not need to serve an elaborate meal — you could even order food in — but put a little effort into making a nice, cozy evening for her.

"
"
Address the tension.,
Apologize.,
Make changes going forward.,
Talk to her privately.,
Enlist your boyfriend’s help.,
Let it go.",How to Win over Your Boyfriend's Mum4," If you feel coldness or distance in the relationship, chances are she feels it, too. Don’t let resentment build up between the two of you. After all, you may be in each other’s lives for a while. Do your part to clear the air.


For example, you could say, “Cindy, I think we got off to a bad start. I respect you and want to have a good relationship with you. Could we try again?”

, Take responsibility for your behavior. If you did something to fall out of favor with your boyfriend’s mother, own up to it and apologize. Make sure you acknowledge the pain or anger you caused.For example, “I know I was rude when I was making fun of your driving. I know it wasn’t funny to you and it hurt your feelings. I’m so sorry.”

, Figure out what you can do to improve the relationship. It may be changing a small behavior, or it may mean changing up your environment.


For example, If you got drunk and were obnoxious around her, do not drink around her anymore. Do your best to curb an annoying behavior.
Maybe she is a picky eater and isn’t impressed by your culinary skills or restaurant choices. Maybe she has cat allergies and your cat was climbing all over her when she came over. You may find that her grievance disappears if she is simply in a more comfortable place.

, You may want to have a conversation with her without your boyfriend present. This will help keep the two of you from trying to get him to choose sides.

, Have your boyfriend address the problem if you do not feel like you are getting through to her. He may find it easier to talk to her, given his history and better understanding of her personality.This is something you should do only if you have not been successful in talking to her yourself. It is much better to handle things with her directly if you can.

, If all else fails, you don’t need to bend over backwards to placate her. Changing who you are for her will only make you resentful.It’s okay if you do not become best buds. Just make sure you always remain polite and respectful to her; she is still an important part of your boyfriend’s life.

Bring out your birth chart to look at and refer to.,
Look over to Venus to begin with.,
Look up your favourite books or websites for the delineations (meanings attributed) for each of these.,
Repeat this process with your Mars and your Moon, and, if they haven't already come into the picture, with your fifth, seventh and eighth houses.,
Bring what you've gleaned altogether to form your best method for attracting positive mates.,
Look to Venus.,
Look to Mars.,
Use the list to help bring the awareness of both Mars and Venus into your body.,
Add to the picture by looking up your Eros (433), Cupid (763), Amor (1221), Lilith (h13 - BML) and Priapus (h22).,
Go back to the Moon list and look to see what it says about what needs you seek to get met by others (Moon in Cancer: nurturing, emotional closeness).,
In putting these together, even though this approach is looking from the Moon first, it works best if you give Venus and Mars more expression.,
Look to your eighth house and the sign on the cusp, as way to enhance feeling comfortable getting intimate for the first time.,
Go out and find that partner.",How to Use Astrology to Attract a Mate (or Even a Soulmate)," If you don't already have one you can generate one for free online.;
, We all know the symbol for Venus - the circle with the little cross underneath. What zodiac sign is she in? Which house (1 to 12)? and identify any aspects that other planets are making to her. For advanced astrology sages look to the fixed stars and asteroids as well.

, Jot down some keywords for your Venus.


For example, you might have Venus in Gemini in the 5th house, Neptune is opposite (at a wide orb) and Saturn squares her closely. You would be jotting down things like: variety, fun, self-expression, mental stimulation, ""the courtesan"", pleasure. These would be for Gemini and the fifth house. For Neptune opposition and Saturn squared you'd have: illusion/delusion/vision, faith, spirituality, duty, honour, maturity, blockages, hardship, enforced waiting vs. patience. All of a sudden Venus isn't as simple as she first seems!
For those who want to, go ahead and add to your list what the books and sites say about the signs and houses that the planets aspecting Venus are in. For example my Saturn is in Virgo in the eighth (as if Venus didn't already have enough trouble) so we would see words like: sex, health, bonding, technique, intimacy, service/servants. With Neptune, you would continue along the same lines. With all that, for just Venus alone, you have built an intricate and revealing picture - but we are just getting started.

, The first, fourth and sixth houses are important in relationships but we are primarily dealing with how you attract, what you want to attract and what fits your idea of a mate.


For the Venus notes write above them ""What I value and bring to me."" For Mars write ""What and how I go after and how my passions emerge"". For the moon write ""My needs and how I feel safe.""
For the fifth house write "" What fun looks like to me"". For the seventh house ""Who and how I am prepared to commit long term."" For the eighth ""Qualities that attract others to me / how the stage is set for sex / how I form intimate bonds with my mate."" (The eighth house is complex)

, Let's start with the Moon. You want to start here because if your needs aren't being met and you don't feel safe and comfortable, basically, you can't flirt efficiently - your mind and body will be too busy trying to find ways to make the moon happy instead.


Example: your Moon might be in Gemini in the fifth house with the same aspects as your Venus. You have to be out having fun in a mentally stimulating environment that addresses my Saturn in Virgo need for cultivation, class and civilisation. You also need to have a clean house (that Saturn in Virgo has more say than the sign of Gemini!).

, When you look in the mirror do you see her? If not buy some clothes she would like etc. Layer this on top of your Moon's needs. For example a Moon in Aquarius needs to feel youthful and up with the times, or ahead of them if possible but Venus in Virgo needs simplicity purity, visual peace - its good times for this pairing with all the natural fabrics against fluorescent colours. (PS This is for men too, men need to activate Venus)

, Bring him in at the same level as Venus (we are all reaching for gender neutrality to some extent these days.) The Mars list will highlight how you can put your animal self out there. Going with the above example, Moon in Aquarius, Venus in Virgo, Mars in Leo - add a bit of getting noticed into the mix. For more, look to the house mars is in. In the second? Choose the expensive bag and watch. In the tenth? Make your appearance relevant to your industry or life purpose.

, Venus is centripetal energy, drawing in. Connecting with her will bring others towards you. Example Venus in Aries (""I'm the best!"") in the seventh house (""Because I'm looking at you!"") opposite Pluto (""Looking deep into you!"").


Mars in centrifugal energy stepping out into the world, going after what it wants. This is desire and to connect with it will allow you to take action without thinking it out and the action will work out for you. Example, Mars in Aquarius in the first house conjunct Jupiter: responding to the environment like a surfer to the wave, based on exactly what you want and done in a big way.

, The first three give your more details in the picture of how you fall in love and what makes you attractive and the last two are more about your primal needs and tendencies. You could also add to your lists Juno who shows you what you absolutely need from someone in order to commit to them.

, Look to your Venus to see what you find visually appealing (Venus in Taurus: sensuous, touchable). Look to your Mars as to what sexual approach you respond easily to (Mars in Leo: someone who is not shy of romancing you).

, If they don't get activated, attraction can't happen. In this article we haven't worried about looking to 'his' or 'her' Venus or Mars - if you know yours well and are in tune with them then coming to you will be the person whose Venus and Mars tickles yours the right way.

, For example Capricorn a mature setting or even at work (for Sagittarius Sun perhaps) could make you feel like you are in the right place to take your clothes off.

, Using your birth chart to discover how you attract positive mates is especially helpful in those times when you seem to be beating your head against the dating and mating wall. We are all individuals - some of us aren't even all that monogamous - and all it takes is a little self knowledge and a lot of self acceptance and we can feel open to love and intimacy.

Make sure you're compatible beyond your signs.",How to Woo a Scorpio," Before making assumptions about the person based on their sign, take some time to get to know a little about them and see which, if any, Scorpio traits they have. Even if you are an avid believer in astrology, you know that no two people under the same sign are alike (astrology is more complex that just the date you were born, but rather takes into account things like the exact time and year of birth). Get to know the person as an individual so you can find out if they are a ""typical"" Scorpio and, more importantly, if they have the traits you find desirable in a mate.


Try talking to any mutual friends about the person's interests and personality.
Use social media to your advantage and see what you can find out on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. A peek at the Scorpio's LinkedIn account may reveal them to be career-driven, which is a common trait of their sign. Or you may learn that their career isn't really their top priority.
Other common Scorpio personality traits include being honest, private, passionate, mysterious, honest, stubborn, jealous, moody, hot-headed, and loyal.;
, Scorpios tend to attract a lot of people. Chances are, any eligible Scorpio has many suitors at any given time. A typical Scorpio is independent and career-driven by nature. They tend to look for mates who can match them. Instead of throwing yourself at a Scorpio, focus on yourself. Independence and ambition will be more likely to attract a Scorpio than coming on too strongly.Make sure you know your own life goals. A Scorpio is unlikely to be attracted to someone who they perceive as a slacker. Before meeting up with a Scorpio, reflect on your career and your passions so you can provide a solid answer to, ""What do you do for a living?""
You want to look like someone who knows what they want and is actively pursuing that. Scorpios will be drawn to those who can match their ambitions.
At the same time, don't fake it. Scorpios — and most people, for that matter — value honesty. Don't pretend you know what you're doing if you don't. This might, however, be a good opportunity for you to try and figure it out!

, Notice if the person has many people vying for their affection. You may need to be a little bold when approaching a Scorpio. Find ways to stand out.As Scorpios often have many different lovers, it may be difficult to get a Scorpio to notice you; therefore, don't be shy about making the first move.
Allow yourself to be bold and outgoing. Show the person that you are also passionate and enthusiastic. Mention your hobbies and interests. A Scorpio will admire someone with a lot going on.

, Notice if this Scorpio seems curious and interested in the mystical. Is the person unlikely to accept the status quo and generally question everything? This is ideal if you also have an interest in mysterious topics, like UFOs, ghost sightings, and unexplained mysteries. This will give you a lot to talk over with a Scorpio.You can watch movies and documentaries on such topics online. You can check out books on these topics at a local library.
If you haven't met a potential Scorpio yet, going to places catered around mysterious interest may help you find a Scorpio. You may, for example, encounter a Scorpio at a tarot card shop.

, Scorpio's are very sex-driven. When meeting up with a Scorpio, wear something that highlights your best features; however, Scorpios love mystery. Find a balance between sexy and modest. You do not want to dress like you're going to a job interview, but you also want to avoid dressing too provocatively.At the same time, don't change your style because you think it might impress this person. If your style is a little risqué, then let the Scorpio see that is part of who you are. The most important thing is to dress in a way that makes you feel comfortable and confident.

, Scorpios are highly ambitious and can be intense about their work, and it's never a good idea to interrupt someone when they're very busy and can't focus on you. If you want to make contact with a Scorpio, wait until they have a free moment to strike up a conversation.If you work with a Scorpio, for example, avoid approaching them when they're engaged with a task. Wait until a Scorpio is taking a break before attempting conversation.
If you're unsure if someone is working or not, read the signs. If the person seems preoccupied as you try to talk, they may be engaged in a task on their phone or may be thinking over a problem. If a Scorpio seems preoccupied, it's always best to walk away.

, Authenticity is an important part of pursuing a romance. Changing who you are, doing things that are against your morals or values, or behaving in a certain way just because you think the other person wants you to behave that way — these are not ways to form a lasting connection. It's more important important that you stay true to who you are — your interests, your traits and quirks, your values and personality — than that you fit the mold of what you think someone might want.


Keep in mind that if someone doesn't like you for who you are, then they are not the right person for you.

, Scorpios like a partner that keeps them guessing. As you begin a romance, do not give away everything right away. Maintaining some mystery is key to wooing a Scorpio.Don't reveal too much about yourself right away. Withhold certain details about your life, hobbies, and passions. You want to keep a Scorpio guessing for a bit. If they know there's more to discover, they're more likely to continue pursuing you.
However, never be deceitful. Reveal information gradually, but never lie or misrepresent yourself. Scorpios (and most people) dislike deception. You can be mysterious without outright lying to a Scorpio.
Remember, if you're a ""heart-on-your-sleeve"" type, don't pretend that you're not. If you like to lay it all out on the table, then go ahead. Don't pretend to be mysterious if that's not who you are.

, Scorpios tend to be very honest, about themselves and others. If you feel the inclination to compliment a Scorpio, keep it realistic. Too much flattery or excessive compliments may make a Scorpio suspicious. Only compliment a Scorpio on traits you genuinely admire.


Try to observe how the person accepts compliments. Sometimes they truly make a person uncomfortable, and sometimes they can make the person's day. Don't miss out on an opportunity to give someone a genuine compliment based only on their sign.

, If you and your Scorpio love learning and mystery, then plan dates that appeal to these interests. This will keep your Scorpio engaged and interested in you.


If you go to the movies, choose a movie with an intricate plot. Scorpios love movies that are a challenge to follow.
Museums can help Scorpios learn new things, so a date to a museum can be a great way to woo a Scorpio.
Games or sports are also much appreciated by Scorpios, as they love the challenge. A game of chess may not seem romantic, but a Scorpio may appreciate it.

, Scorpios can sometimes take time to commit to a partner. Scorpios are unlikely to engage in anything they are less than passionate about, so don't be surprised if things move slowly. It will take time to earn a Scorpio's love. Once you do, however, you will have a highly loyal romantic partner., Notice if your Scorpio loves a little competition. If you are also competitive, then you can plan activities that allow you to compete regularly (although be warned they do like to win). Play games, like chess and board games. Engage in sports or place bets. A good way to keep a Scorpio actively engaged in keeping a sense of competitiveness alive in the relationship., Classic Scorpios are very sex driven, but it's very important that you make no assumptions in this area. Regardless of the person's sign, you will want to focus on reading their signals and even have a talk about individual preferences. Having a conversation about preferences and physical boundaries trumps any typical sign advice.


A typical Scorpio is unlikely to be interested in casual sex.
Sex may be intense with a Scorpio. They may expect a lot of intimacy before and after sexual activity.

, Scorpios do not tolerate a person breaking their trust. They tend to be the jealous type and also expect a high amount of integrity from those around them. If you are not trustworthy or faithful, you can tank your relationship with a Scorpio.


Talk to your partners about their boundaries and what you expect from each other in the relationship. For instance, harmless flirtatious behavior may not feel serious to you, but your partner may find this very hurtful or a violation of trust. It is important that you discuss what loyalty and trust means to you both.
Scorpios expect honesty and tend to give it in return. Lying to a Scorpio, even a white lie, is a bad idea. Never do anything that could potentially break a Scorpio's trust, as it is hard to win back.

, A classic Scorpio may need a lot of alone time. They can be mysterious by nature, and may be secretive and private about odd things. A Scorpio, for example, may never let their partner read their emails or use their laptop. This does not mean a Scorpio is hiding something. They just have a strong need for privacy. If you want the relationship to work, you should respect this boundary., Scorpios are very driven people, and need a partner who will support them. Allow your Scorpio partner to pursue their passions. If you get between a Scorpio and their dreams, your relationship is less likely to work out.Remember, never disrupt a Scorpio at work. There may be times when a Scorpio is engaged with a task for a prolonged period of time. Let the Scorpio have this space to work and think.

, Put your signs aside for the moment and ask yourself if you and this person are compatible based on who you are as individuals. Do you share common values, beliefs, interests? Can you trust each other, get along, and be vulnerable with one another? Can you be yourself around this person? If you are compatible in these ways, then you have a better chance of a longterm relationship.


If you also want to take your signs into account, you can find out which signs are thought to be most compatible with a Scorpio. Capricorn, Pisces, or other Scorpios, are thought to have a better chance of a long-term relationship.
If you're a Taurus, Gemini, or Cancer, you may have good chemistry with a Scorpio. You may have a fun short term love affair, but things may not work out long term.
If you're an Aries, Leo, Sagittarius, or Aquarius, it may not be a good idea to date a Scorpio.
Again, don't let your sign compatibility interfere with how you and the Scorpio match up when it comes to values, personality, and beliefs.

Notice if the person has the qualities of a Pisces.,
Talk about your dreams and fantasies.,
Explore your spiritual side.,
Share musical tastes.,

Pisces are thought to be dreamers, compassionate, artistic, intuitive, romantic, spiritual, melancholy, tolerant, and forgiving.Do a little investigating to see if your love interest has the traits of a typical Pisces.


Check out the person's social media for hints — see what the person's interest are, what music they like, their style, if there are any particular causes they support (it would be very ""Pisces"" to support ecological organizations), and so on. This can help you figure out if the person has the qualities of a Pisces and, more importantly, if this is someone with whom you share interests and values.
A typical Pisces will also likely spend a lot of time near the water; they could be a swimmer or just love going to the beach.
Music is very important to a typical Pisces. Notice if the Pisces is always posting online or talking about new bands, going to concerts and festivals, and so on.
Don't try to fit into a mold or be someone who you aren't because you think it's what a Pisces wants. Most people respond to honesty and authenticity — no matter what their sign is.;

If you are interested in spirituality, philosophy, and religion, you will likely have a lot to discuss. Again, a Pisces won't shy from very personal and deep conversation, so think about your own spirituality so that you feel comfortable talking about it in a conversation.


Be careful talking about spiritual concerns too soon. If this individual is not particularly spiritual (regardless of their sign), then this may be uncomfortable or off-putting. Better to follow conventionally appropriate conversation topics when in doubt.

, Pisces are artistic in general, but they may be particularly interested in music. Talk about what kind of music you like and ask what your Pisces is into. Offer to make the person a mix of music they may not have heard before, or ask if they want to hang out and listen to records (this may appeal to the hippie-ish nature of a typical Pisces).

, Pisces are gentle, sensitive, and kind. Someone who is insensitive, harsh, or manipulative is likely not a good match for a classic Pisces. You will pique the interest of a Pisces if you are involved in social causes, volunteer, and show compassion for animals, your fellow man, and the earth. If you're someone who is mostly focused on yourself and your own well-being, that's fine, but you may not be a great match for a Pisces.

Let them have control over themselves and be patient.,
Make physical contact.,
Try to kiss her when the time is right.",How to Seduce a Scorpio2," Scorpios are curious and like solving puzzles.The more you hold back about yourself, the more she will want to find out about you.

Be genuine. Lying to a Scorpio woman is a betrayal of her trust, and she will have a hard time forgetting about it.

, Scorpios are highly private and do not like to be poked and prodded about their past. In fact, pushing her too hard to reveal details about her past will turn her off. When talking to a Scorpio, let the conversation flow organically, and allow the Scorpio to open up when they are ready.


Acting accusatory about the past of a Scorpio could ruin any relationship you’d have with her.
Try to keep conversation on what you are currently doing, and your aspirations for the future, not what you’ve done in the past.

, It can infuriate a Scorpio woman when someone else tells them what to do. Try to limit how much you are trying to take control, and let them be independent. Similarly, they don’t like to be rushed or hurried, especially when it comes to intimacy or a romantic relationship, so let them get comfortable on their own terms.

Don’t dismiss your Scorpio when it comes to physical attention. If you withhold it from her, it can have negative effects., If the conversation went well and you are both in a private setting, there’s a good chance she may want to kiss you. The important thing is to make sure that she wants it. Make sure that you have already established light physical contact like holding her hand or putting your arm around her shoulder. Wait for a lull in the conversation and look deeply into her eyes, while you move your face closer to hers. If she moves closer to you, and does not look down or away, try to give her a kiss.


NEVER try to kiss her if she doesn’t implicitly show that she wants it.
It may not be as effective, but if you are truly unsure, you can ask her if she would like to be kissed first.

Find out what your Pisces really likes.,
Express yourself through your clothes.,
Invite them to a concert.,
Go to a museum.,
Plan something romantic and off the beaten path.",How to Seduce a Pisces2," Before you assume the Pisces will want to go to a three-day music festival based only on the person's sign, ask the person some questions about what they really enjoy. This will help ensure you both enjoy yourselves. If you want to take the person to a museum, for instance, ask if there's a museum they particularly enjoy or have wanted to visit. Though a classic Pisces might want to spend hours at the art museum, another Pisces might prefer to check out the natural history museum — or they may no be into museums at all!

, Pisces are considered a very artistic sign, so feel free to express yourself through your clothing choices. Pisces are very accepting, so dress in whatever makes you feel comfortable. A classic Pisces might have a flowy, vintage vibe, but don't feel you need to change your own style or match this. Being authentic and true to yourself is more important to a Pisces than how you dress.


As a water sign, a Pisces may be drawn to blues, violets, and greens.If your clothes have a story attached to them (the skirt you're wearing belonged to your mother and she wore it to Woodstock, for instance), it’ll make for good conversation if there’s a lull in the seduction process.

, Because a typical Pisces will likely be very into music, live music may be the perfect date. Find out what type of music the person likes, then buy tickets to a concert. If your Pisces loves Motown, see if there's a bar or club that has a special Motown night and take them out dancing.


When you dance together, you’ll have a chance to engage each other physically and emotionally. Try to feel the tempo of the music, and really move with the person's body and the beat. Doing this will ensure that you will connect with one another on a higher level.
If live music isn't your thing, try inviting the Pisces over to listen to music. Or put on a favorite album while you are hanging out and ask the person to dance with you.

, If your Pisces fits the bill of an artistic dreamer, they will likely be thrilled to join you at an art museum. See if there are any interesting exhibitions featuring artists or styles that the person might enjoy. If you're not really into art, that's okay and you don't have to force it, but this may be an opportunity for you to broaden your interests a little.


Other possible dates that would interest a classic Pisces might include tickets to the ballet, going to see an arthouse film, a poetry reading, or a gallery opening.

, Continue to appeal to your Pisces' artistic nature by planning an unusual, romantic date, like taking a pottery class together. After the class, take your Pisces to a rooftop picnic you've planned, complete with candles, blankets, wine, and rich foods. Or take turns painting each other's portraits and then go out for an intimate meal at a tiny bistro.

Be complimentary.,
Make a romantic gesture.,
Talk about your romantic fantasies.",How to Seduce a Pisces3," While spending time getting to know and date the Pisces, watch for clues about what seems to make your date feel cared for, valued, loved, beautiful, appreciated, etc. Did your date light up when you complimented their sense of humor? Or when you held their hand or gave them a little memento of your first date? What made your date laugh? What made your date smile? Some people may love receiving compliments, while they may make other people squirm. Keep that in mind while considering advice about a typical Pisces — if the person doesn't appear to share the Pisces trait of loving compliments or romance, then find other ways to make that person feel special.

, A sensitive, caring Pisces will likely be very receptive to compliments. Make sure they come from the heart, and tell the person what you really appreciate about them. Pull your Pisces close and whisper in their ear, letting them know just how amazing you think they are.


Pisces are intuitive, so they will likely know if you are being insincere. Don't say nice things just to try to manipulate or seduce the person — be honest and real.

, A typical Pisces will go for sincere, romantic gestures. Think candles, wine, chocolates, flowers, and poetry. Write a song or poem for the person, draw their portrait, pick a bouquet of the person's favorite flowers — the price tag of these things shouldn't matter; rather, you want to concentrate on the sentiment behind them.


Reciting a line from a famous poem at the appropriate time is another way to impress a Pisces. Or buy her a book of romantic poems
If you aren’t the artistic or romantic type, try reading write a love poem, write a love song, or be romantic. This doesn't mean you have to change your personality if you're not a romantic person, but if your love interest responds to romance, it will help show that person how much you mean to them.

, Ask your Pisces about their fantasies in the bedroom. A sensual, dreamy Pisces might respond very well to role playing — ask if this is something they might like. A classic Pisces will also likely prefer for you to take charge — but it's very important you don't make assumptions here. Communicate clearly about what turns you on and what your partner wants sexually. A Pisces may be very sexually adventurous, but it's important you have their consent before trying something new.


Some role play ideas include dressing up like a French maid, nun, construction worker, or something similarly subdued, but sexy.
Pisces may be very into foreplay, perhaps even more so than the actual sex. Consider long, steamy make out sessions and taking things slow, really building up to sex.Seduction of a Pisces is not a one date deal. You may have to go on multiple dates until they feel comfortable with getting physical with you.

You may also keep the date interesting and challenging by doing something together you know the Gemini will enjoy, such as going on a hike together if you know the Gemini is into the outdoors or taking a boat ride together if you know the Gemini enjoys being by the water.

, Once you have attracted the Gemini, you should show off your playful side and let her chase you a little. Geminis enjoy a challenge, especially a romantic challenge, and will usually respond well to chasing after someone they find attractive.Make sure you give the Gemini your full attention and work hard to get her interested. Once you seem to have her interest, you should pull back a little. This will leave the Gemini intrigued and she will likely seek you out for attention.
Keep in mind, though, that playing games like this can turn some people off or can be confusing or hurtful. Don't pull back too far or give her the cold shoulder if you do this — try just being a little less available than you were before.

Be loyal and honest.,
Be willing to try new things.,
Be adventurous in bed.",How to Seduce a Gemini2," Geminis value communication and honesty in a partner. He will appreciate that you are willing to be honest and upfront about how you are feeling and what you are thinking. Geminis also need to feel valued and trusting with their partner. Being honest will make you a more attractive partner to a Gemini.You can demonstrate this by not hiding your feelings or thoughts when you speak to a Gemini. You can also show honesty by being true to yourself — don't try to be someone you are not just to attract a Gemini.
You can show a Gemini that you are loyal by sticking up for a friend in a tricky situation or by supporting a family member during a difficult time. Showing the Gemini you are loyal can show him that you are willing to stand by your friends, family, and partners.

, Geminis are an adventurous, fun loving sign. Your Gemini may be playful and interested in learning new things. If you want to succeed in seducing a Gemini, you may need to demonstrate your adventurous side and show her that you can try new things with enthusiasm.This may mean ordering a strange dish on the menu at dinner or being willing to try a new drink at the bar. You may also suggest something off the beaten path for your date with a Gemini, like hiking to a waterfall for a picnic or going on a ghost tour and getting a tarot reading, to show her you are interested in new, exciting experiences.

If you aren't sure if your partner is adventurous, but he's a Gemini, that doesn't mean you should just try something crazy in bed without asking him if it's okay. Be respectful and communicate about trying new things.
You may try basic sex toys if you have never used them before, such as a sex toy for clitoral stimulation or vibrating pleasure beads. You can also try a vibrator or a couple's ring in bed.It may also be fun to try role playing games in the bedroom in which you act out your fantasies together in a safe space. You may tell each other your fantasies and work together to act them out. You should establish limits and boundaries for the role play and then get into character with costumes and props."

Find out if you are compatible with your Gemini.,
Know the signs thought to be compatible with Gemini.,
Note the signs that are not good matches for Geminis.,
Look at the signs that are wild card matches for Geminis.",How to Seduce a Gemini3," Take some time to look inward and analyze your personal preferences, your personality, your values and lifestyle. More important than an astrological sign is whether or not you and this person have similar values and lifestyles, if you can communicate and get along well, and other determinants of compatibility. It's fine to take astrology into account, but remember to do it with a grain of salt.

, Investigate your own astrological sign and read about the characteristics of that sign. You may find you fit the description of your astrological sign, or you may not (just like your Gemini may or may not have the characteristics of his sign). Geminis are most compatible with the following signs:]


Libra, September 23 – October 22: Geminis and Libras are compatible because of their ability to communicate and socialize well. They also share a love of art, culture, and adventure.

Scorpio, October 23 – November 21: Scorpios tend to enjoy privacy. This can clash with a Gemini’s need to be social and outgoing with others. Geminis also have a light-hearted approach to life, which can be counter to Scorpio’s intense and private nature. However, for highly intelligent Gemini, Scorpio may be the perfect partner as the Scorpio can engage in enriching, deep discussions, talk openly about sex without judgement, engage in playful sex as the expert sex sign and most loyal sign of the Zodiac, and is an expert at flirting with the mysterious play and openness Gemini craves. Scorpio and Gemini share the arts, sexual adventure, strong needs for loyalty, and intelligence. The twin nature of Gemini -- the social, public side and the private, intimate side, is just the mystery Scorpio adores and respects.

Aquarius, January 20 – February 18.: Aquarius is a good match with Gemini because both signs thrive on variety and change. Both signs are also good at socializing and communication. Many Aquarians and Gemini signs end up becoming close friends and romantic partners.

Aries, March 21 – April 19: This is a good match because both signs are full of drive and energy. Aries have a flare for leadership that will complement Gemini’s resourcefulness. Both signs also have a passion for knowledge and learning.

Leo, July 23 – August 22: Leos tend to be outgoing, dramatic, and bold. They are a good complement to the creativity and intelligence of a Gemini. Both signs tend to feed off of each other’s energy and enjoy making others, and themselves, laugh., You should also be aware of the astrological signs that are not considered compatible with Geminis. This does not mean you cannot or should not seduce a Gemini if you are non-compatible sign — remember, this is all in fun. The following signs are considered incompatible with Geminis:


Pisces, February 19 – March 20: This water sign tends to be very sensitive and do not do well when they are paired with the fickle traits of a Gemini. Often, Pisces get hurt easily by Geminis and can be too sensitive and brooding for the playfulness of Geminis.

Virgo, August 23 – September 22: Virgos do not do well with change or flightiness, making them a poor match for Geminis. Virgos also tend to have high, specific standards and expectations, and may end up criticizing the more open, playful ways of a Gemini.

, There are two signs that can be potentially good matches for Geminis, with a little work and focus. These wild card matches have the potential to work out if both parties learn how to communicate and interact with each other in healthy ways. These two signs are:Gemini, May 21 – June 20: Pairing a Gemini with another Gemini can lead to a relationship full of good conversation, adventure, and fun. But both people will need to focus on building stability and commitment into the relationship for it to work.

Sagittarius, November 22 – December 21: Sagittarians tend to be understanding and patient, so they can be a good match for Geminis. Both signs also have a love of knowledge, variety, and sexual activity. But neither sign is very grounded, so both people will have to work on staying grounded and committed to each other.

Be patient.,
Court her.,
Help her feel secure.,
Don't be flaky.,
Let her show off her creative side.,
Please all her senses.,
Choose quality over anything else.,
Show your stability.,
Go for loads of foreplay.,
Know that she's an Earth sign.,
Understand that she's not super emotional.,
Realize that she can seem quite traditional.,
Don't play with her emotions.,
Be as faithful and devoted as she is.",How to Seduce a Taurus Woman," This Venusian Goddess of Love likes a sure thing. She won't let just anyone get near her. Because of this, you'll need to be patient. She can't be seduced with a meaningful glance and a particularly strong drink. To get this woman, you'll need to put in the time. She'll be worth it!


Don't worry about getting too deep into the friend zone. This is a necessary part of seducing her. You'll need to build a foundation of trust before you get near her bed. Would you really want your woman to be any other way?





;
, This is how you'll avoid the friend zone! Show her you want her in a gentlemanly way. Bring her flowers. Write her a letter. Kiss her cheek upon saying goodbye. Get her thinking about you. Get her all but begging for more. You know that stuff your grandparents talk about? Start taking notes.


When you're bringing her flowers, make 'em good. The Taurean woman likes her nice things. Find out what her favorites are and have them sent to her with a coy note. Spark her interest showing her your maturity, your pocketbook, and your intentions.







, This goddess has a few trust issues, to say the least. She wants a lover that she knows knows how amazing she is and is willing to tell her! So offer her compliments and flattery -- just make sure they're genuine! Letting her know how special you think she is will get her to open up to your faster.


Avoid being negative. You know that cat-and-mouse, hard-to-get stuff that some signs go for? Not Taurus. She much prefers a direct, you're-what-I-want attitude over mind games. And definitely avoid being condescending to make her feel emotionally vulnerable and yearn for your approval. That's an act that will get you booted outta the house.

, Feminine Taurus has a strong side -- she is very reliable, trustworthy, and sticks firm to her principles. If you flake out on her, she won't be having it. If you're running late, let her know as soon as you do. Play nice and she may not stick you with her horns.


And when it comes to your word, stick to it. If you say you'll do something for her, do it. If you say you'll do something for a friend of hers, do it. If you say anything that she might get wind of, do it. She's fiercely loyal to everyone in her circle -- betray their trust and you betray hers.







, This woman loves everything about the arts. She will bounce with energy, passion, and drive if you take her to a museum, the theater, a concert, or even a wine tasting. If there's even a semblance of quality and creativity involved, she's there.


So if you're looking for a good date, look no further. If it requires you to get a little fancy, great. If it involves food, great. If it involves her showing you her expertise in this realm, great. She'll be yours in no time.







, If you really want to be a shoo-in in her book, you'll bombard all her senses with pleasing stimuli. That means you gotta create a moment that's beautiful to her eyes and ears, pleasing to touch, taste, and smell. So cook her dinner, light some candles, and show her your silken sheets. Boom.


That cooking thing? That works for most women, but definitely works on Tauruses. That shows you can provide and have skills. Just make sure you're keeping it simple -- she's not a big fan of new, crazy things, food included.







, If you don't have dollar bills bulging out of your wallet, you may be facing an uphill battle. Ms. Taurus loves her nice things. They don't have to be the most expensive or the most trendy, but they have to be nice. Classic, vintage, or modern -- she loves it all if it's made well.


Bust out your fine china when you're cooking her dinner. Buy her the nicest flowers. Wear your cashmere sweater on your date and offer it to her when she gets cold. And definitely get your car washed before you pick her up.







, Lady Taurus wants a man who's a rock. He has money in his wallet, a nice car, a decent home, a decent job, and is emotionally stable to boot. She's not looking to take care of anyone, that's for sure. Even if you're not thinking long-term, these things are necessary to draw and keep her attention on you long enough to even be considered.


Don't be emotionally all over the place, flirting with her one minute and giving her the cold shoulder the next. She'll take that as you not knowing what you want. Just as much as you'd like her to be gung-ho to get with you, act the same. She may reciprocate!

, This is just good advice. Follow it. Always follow it. When you're finally close enough to kiss her (and she lets you), don't go in for the kill too soon. Keep it PG-13 until she's begging you to make it not-so-family-friendly. When both of you can barely take it anymore, go for it.


You want her wrapped around your finger, don't you? This isn't a one-night stand type of girl. You'll both be coming back for more, so be on your best behavior. If you aim to please, she'll aim to please and you'll both leave happy.







, The other options are Fire, Water, and Air. You can probably guess what it means by doing a little deducing. She's also fixed (as opposed to mutable), meaning that she's firm in her Earthy ways. A typical Earth sign can be described as the following:


Grounded, stable, and resistant to change
Reliable and sturdy and not prone to tempers or large displays of emotion
Not keen on taking risks and likes a sure thing
Known as the ""builder"" of the zodiac

, If you're looking for her to emerge from your bed claiming you're a sex god, while she may be thinking it, she won't be saying it. She lives in the logical, more rational world and can't get swept up in tears, hysterics, or visible ecstasy. Take this as a good thing -- no drama!


This does not mean she won't get attached to you or won't get mad when you don't call her back. Au contraire, mon ami, she'll headbutt you with those horns of hers. She'll hold a grudge through next Tuesday. She just won't show it. She'll give you the cold shoulder without saying a word.







, Her Earthy ways make most Fire and Water signs think she's rather conservative and, well, sometimes dull. That's not the case! Traditional does not equate to boring. What it does mean is that she's good at what she does and knows what she likes. While she may focus on meat and potatoes, she makes damn good meat and potatoes. Nothing wrong about that!


No, she's not super adventurous and no, she doesn't get caught up in fantasy land. What's wrong with that? She lives in the real world and has real things that matter to her. And if it works for her, she'll stick with it. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

, So, yes, she is dependable and reliable and nice and sweet and not super emotional -- but that doesn't mean you should mess with her. She's also very into respect, tact, and treating others as they deserve to be treated. So if you aim to manipulate or use, she'll show you the back door, no questions asked. Those horns of hers can be quite pointy! Ow.


If you're looking to seduce her and then put her in a cab, just be honest. You'll get a lot further that way than pretending to be something you're not. She has no patience for liars or hypocrites and is pretty good at spotting them, too.

, Once you've got her, try your hardest to treat her as well as she treats you. She'll be incredibly loyal, patient, and trustworthy. Pay her back by treating her in kind! You'll be the only one in her life, hands down. Now the question is: What in the world did you do to deserve her?


Odds are you went in with the intention of seducing her and found yourself being seduced. Funny how that works, huh? Ms. Taurus can be a long-term type of gal if you're a worthy suitor. Congratulations on taming that bull!

Simple acts of kindness can even provide mental and physical benefits for yourself.Help someone pick up a dropped item. You’ve seen somebody drop dozens of papers on a busy street before. People drop things all the time. Be a minute late and help someone out.
Allow someone to go in front of you at the grocery store. Offer someone with less items to check out in front of you.
Treat others with compassion. Don’t treat those working behind a register as being lower than yourself. Try avoid the robotic responses that are easier to say to those in the customer service industry. Be kind to everyone you interact with.

Become a teacher.,
Become a first response.,
Participate in non-profits and social justice.,
Work pro bono.,
Become an occupational therapist.,
Work as a registered nurse.",How to Help People3," Teaching doesn’t need to be limited to being a high school or elementary school teacher. There are many part time instructors that teach skills at the convenience of their schedule. Being a teacher can be a rewarding process for yourself while helping others. Being a “teacher” isn’t enough in school; you have to be a “great teacher” and it’s not for everyone. You can offer your services without becoming an accredited teacher in some of these fields:


Music lessons
Math tutoring
ESL instruction
Science tutoring

, Being a first response means being the first on the site of an emergency call. To become an EMT-B requires an extensive eight hour credit class and plenty of opportunities to work your way up to a paramedic. Firefighters are also part of a first response and possess much of the paramedic training. These jobs are potentially life threatening, but the reward of helping others in dire need makes it worthwhile for those interested.


Look into your local branches of firefighters and paramedics to see what type of requirements are needed. Most of the training can be done locally at a community college or certification program., Non-profit organizations are organizations that use their profit solely to profit their charitable or educational mission. Starting a non-profit organization can be laborious and expensive. Try your luck by volunteering or interning at one of your choice. Take a look at the following categories of non-profits to see if a particular area may appeal to you:


Arts and culture
Charity and foundation
Community development and advocacy
Educational research
Health services
Social or human services, If you are in a client based field and hold authority, consider not charging clients in need. Bring up opportunities to your supervisor if you don’t hold authority. Pro bono work is a noble decision that benefits the client in-need greatly.


You can save on your taxes for meeting qualifying expenses by working pro bono.
Consider a strict screening process to decide what clientele would qualify.
Consider reaching out to struggling communities as opposed to choosing an existing client. Many people in need will not come to you first. Typically the organization will need to start the discussion., Occupational therapists help people of all ages who might have physical limitations in everyday activities. Common tasks for occupational therapists are assisting children with learning disabilities and assisting those recovering from an injury. They assist with any action that could be considered to be an everyday activity regardless of why the client can’t perform the activity.You’ll need to complete a masters program and pass a licensing exam to pursue occupational therapy., There is always a need for registered nurses everywhere in the world. This career is also involved with helping others on a daily basis. The job requires you to be with people during their time of physical suffering and recovery. Registered nurses administer medications, inform patients of their treatment plans, and provide emotional support for both the patient and their family.


This is not a job for someone who is squeamish when it comes to bodily fluids and disease.
You can get a degree from an accredited associate's school or even receive a degree from a bachelor’s program."

Respect the way they grieve.,
Ask how you can help.,
Validate their feelings.,
Listen to your friend.",How to Help a Friend Move on from a Long Distance Romance1," You may not understand why your friend feels or thinks the way they do. Fortunately, it’s not your job to. Right now your role is to be there for them and know your boundaries. The last thing they need right now is criticism from you.


For example, avoid telling your friend that they are too sad or taking too long to get over the break up. Don’t chide them if they want to stay home and lie in bed instead of hitting the town with you. As much as it may hurt you to see them like that, it’s what they feel they need to do at the moment.;
, You may think you know exactly what you need to help your friend, but the truth is, you won’t unless you ask them. What you need during a break up may be completely different than what they need.


For instance, you could say, “Please tell me what you need right now and what I can do to help you.” It may be something as simple as sitting on the couch with them, or it could be to assist in the household chores, depending on how upset they are.
Once they tell you, do what they ask, and not what you think is best., No one wants to hear they shouldn’t feel what they feel, particularly after ending a long-distance relationship. Instead of trying to stop them from getting down, let them know it’s normal and acceptable to experience the emotions they are feeling. Validating their feelings will be more helpful to your friend than trying to change them.


Say to your friend, “It’s OK to be sad. No one understands just how hurt you are except for you, and I’ll be here whenever you need me.” Providing this sense of support can offer the comfort they need right now., Your friend likely has lots to say about their ex. Help them get what they need off of their chest by listening. Although you may not necessarily agree with what they say, it’s important to listen and not interrupt.


Although it may take a toll on you to hear the constant bashing of the ex or endless complaining, it’s good to remember that this is what your friend needs to do right now to heal.
It may take a huge amount of patience on your part to endure the same conversation over and over again, but it’s part of being a good friend."

If your best friend gets a new boyfriend/girlfriend, just try to be positive about it, even if you don't like the relationship.,
If your best friend and his/her new boyfriend/girlfriend start making you feel third wheel, know that that's not usually a good sign.,
If your best friend would rather hang out with his/her new boyfriend/girlfriend, don't sweat it at first but if your best friend continues to keep doing that for a while, you should be a little concerned and start thinking that the person you call your ""best friend"" is really your best friend!

,
If you trust your best friend with your darkest secrets, your most embarrassing moments or with your life, think again because your best friend will probably end up telling his/her new boyfriend/girlfriend your secrets and personal things, but remember that it all depends on how good your best friend actually is, because everyone has different friends and they all act different from others.

,
Know if your best friend is not talking to you as much anymore, or if you guys are just not talking/texting anymore.,
If the boyfriend/girlfriend is their first priority and they'd rather pick your best friend over you, don't waste your time getting mad over it or caring about it because, while they're off being ""in love,"" know that you can go and have fun, enjoy being single and maybe even meet a nice girl that you like or a cute guy that you're interested in.,
Hang out with other people or other crowds, or even go meet some new people!,
Be single.,
If you still feel third wheel, know that you have so many other people that care about you and that want to hang out with you!,
Just have fun living life, whether you are single or not!","How to Get Through Being Third Wheel when Your ""Best Friend"" Has a Boyfriend/Girlfriend"," This might help you out in the long run and possibly have you and your best friend not get into so many ""fights,"" but it really depends on how good your friendship is.;
, You know that they are making you ""third wheel"" if they they constantly start leaving you out of the conversation, your best friend's new boyfriend/girlfriend is going to their house or hanging out with your best friend more than you do, or they just start ""ditching you.""

,,, When your best friend starts doing this, you may start feeling that you just aren't as close as you were before, and that can be upsetting!

, And besides, depending on the age they are (ex.13-17), they will most likely just break up anyway so you know that the relationship is most likely not going to last if they are in between those ages! Thinking you're in love when you're in between those ages may sound ""awesome"" to you at the time, but in reality that's just ""puppy love.""

, They will probably make you a lot happier and won't make you feel left out! You can also try hanging out with a guy/girl of your opposite sex that you know is third wheel! Who knows, maybe you will make a new close friend or even score a boyfriend/girlfriend!

You also might gain a reputation for being a ""player.""

, Try being interested in what others find interesting, and you will probably make more friends!

, And, when you get a boyfriend/girlfriend and you have a best friend, just remember how you felt when you were third wheel, and, would you want your best friend to feel like that?

Point out improvements.,
Suggest new healthy activities.,
Encourage your friend to explore their new identity.,
Help them get back out there.,
Recommend that your friend receive professional support.",How to Help a Friend Move on from a Long Distance Romance2," Your friend is going through the ringer right now and is constantly reminded of their sadness. Pointing out any improvement you see in their condition, no matter how small, can give them the encouragement they need to continue on and keep their head up.


For example, you could say, “It’s great to see you dressed today,” or “There’s that beautiful smile. I’m so happy to see it today.” Giving them this sort of attention, instead of focusing on their grief, can inspire them to keep up the good work., Sometimes the best way to get negative feelings out is through exercise. When your friend is ready, suggest that they engage in physical activities that can make them feel better, both physically and emotionally. Offer to participate with them for encouragement.


Activities that your friend may benefit from include yoga, running, walking, joining a gym, or a team sport. Not only is your friend going to feel better, but it may strengthen your bond when you do it together.Invite your friend to go for a walk with you or offer to take them on a hike.

, Oftentimes, when a part of a couple, a person can lose touch with their own interests, style, and preferences. Inspire your friend to take advantage of singledom to rediscover their individuality.


You might suggest that they get a new haircut, test out a new wardrobe, or redecorate their apartment to reflect their own style. Making changes like this can distract your friend from the grief and help them fully commit to moving on., Close friends often serve as the spark to help a friend exit the moping stage and start re-experiencing life. Remind your friend to take time before entering a new relationship, but that shouldn't stop them from casually dating or filling up their social calendar.


Invite your friend to join you at gatherings or events. Introduce them to new friends or potential dates. Help them get re-acquainted with life as a single person.
Don't push them too hard. If they don't feel ready to start seeing someone new, then don't set up a surprise double-date. Let them set the pace and decide when they're ready.

, Experiencing a breakup is almost like going through a death. People who endure that experience suffer a deep loss and grieve as a result. A therapist may be able to help your friend get through this rough time and offer solutions to when times get really tough.


If you notice signs of depression, then it's important that you gently urge your friend to get help. Signs of depression include: isolating, decreased grooming and hygiene, difficulty completing normal tasks, increased irritability, mood swings, and significant change in appetite or sleep patterns.
To encourage your friend to seek therapy, you could say, “I know you are doing your best and trying to get through this rough time, but I think it may be helpful if you talk to a professional about this. They may be able to give you insight as to how to get through this situation better.”
They may be hesitant at first, but may see that it could actually be helpful, eventually."

Bring up the fact that they won’t run into each other.,
Point out that time zone differences are no longer an issue.,
Remind your friend why they broke up.,
Bring up the fact that your friend is now free to meet someone locally.",How to Help a Friend Move on from a Long Distance Romance3," Awkward and sad run-ins after a breakup make moving on difficult. Fortunately, when people live far away from each other, that likely won’t happen. They also may have fewer memories of spending time together at certain places, so they don’t need to worry as much about avoiding specific restaurants or other date locations., Living in different time zones can make communication difficult. People in long-distance relationships often have to plan their days around their significant other’s schedules, which can make living their own lives difficult. Pointing this out can help your friend see they are no longer tied down by their ex-partner’s schedule.


You could say, “Now you don’t have to worry about getting up extra early or staying up late so that you can talk. You don’t have to miss out on hanging out with your friends so that you don’t miss a call from your ex.” Pointing out this new-found freedom may help your friend to move on., Talk about how your friend doesn’t have to deal with the ex’s insecurities. When you’re not in close proximity during a relationship, insecurities you never knew you had can pop up all over the place. Unfortunately, this is also true for the other partner. If the ex was constantly projecting their insecurities on your friend, the break up can actually come as a relief. For example, you could say, “Now you can do what you want, and see who you want without any worry.”
Avoid bringing up negative things about your friend's ex or dwelling on their insecurities or bad behavior in the relationship will not help your friend move on. You want to help your friend focus on the future, not on the past.

, Perhaps the hardest thing about long-distance relationships is that you aren’t able to see your partner much. This makes for a particular kind of loneliness that can be worse than what you feel when you’re alone and single.


Make sure your friend is aware of this by saying, “If you started dating here, think of all the fun activities you two would be able to do together all the time. You could see each other as often as you like.” This may give them the nudge they need to start moving on.Again, it's not necessary to point out how your friend was always miserable and lonely in the long-distance relationship. Instead, talk about all the new possibilities that are now available to your friend.

Believe that you’re an expert on children.,
Remember your own childhood: Every adult on the planet was, at one time, a child.",How to Help a Child in Just a Minute1," All of us have children that we interact with. If you’re a parent, or a teacher, of course, you do so almost constantly. If you don’t have children of your own, you still might have youngsters in your extended family, or you may have friends who have kids. You may think you know nothing about children. But this is simply not true.;
, If you think you don’t like kids, it's possible you're dealing with pain from your own childhood. Wess Stafford, in his book Just a Minute, writes: ""The truth is, you deserve an honorary doctorate in 'childhood.' You have already done a minimum of eighteen years of ‘field research’ in this complex subject. Having been a child yourself, you’ve experienced firsthand all there is to know about childhood.” Use this reassurance to give you the confidence to help children.

"
"
Believe in the power of one positive word.,
Focus on the good.,
Take a balanced approach: While children need correction at times, try to “sandwich” your critique or correction with positive statements.",How to Help a Child in Just a Minute2," Kids respond very positively to encouragement or praise for their efforts. And who knows? You might change their life with just a word or two (especially if that child is facing difficult circumstances). A single word or a kind hug can make the difference for a child who is still trying to formulate his or her identity and trust in blossoming abilities.


In a simple minute, you can wipe away a tear, boost morale or just smile in encouragement.

, Whether with your own children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews or friends, try to “catch them doing good.”


Try to use this sentence every day at least once: “I really like the way you…” and then name something positive: …share your toys, helped your sister, listened while we read a story, whatever.
Or name character traits you see: if a child is behaving in a caring, generous, or kind way, tell them so.
Use a list of all that's good. Consider making a list every year for the child's birthday, entitled: “Ten Things I Like About You.” What a great way to take a moment and affirm a child. Often, if you tell a child he or she is kind, the child will be more likely to try to live up to that identified preferred behavior or expression of goodness.

, It only takes a minute to say something nice to a child, and your affirmation will help the child more than you can ever imagine.


Note that a child who is being naughty or acting out is often looking for attention and love. Giving such a child positive reinforcement often improves their behavior.

Help a child in poverty.,
Make a donation to a child welfare organization, or even decide to sponsor a child with a small monthly donation.,
Teach children how they can make a difference.",How to Help a Child in Just a Minute3," You may look around you and think that today’s children are over-indulged. In certain cultures, this is unfortunately the case. But even more unfortunately, there are millions of children in the world, in both developed and developing countries, who are not indulged at all. They’re hungry, overwhelmingly poor, sometimes orphaned or sick. The numbers of children in need can be overwhelming. But don’t let that stop you from doing something. Even in your own neighborhood, there may be families in need. In just a minute, without much sacrifice, you could bring a bag of groceries to a family, offer to babysit while a single mom gets a well-deserved break or tutor some students in a subject or skill you're brilliant at.


If you offer to help children through education, use your enthusiasm to guide theirs. If you love a subject or a skill, that enthusiasm will show through naturally and will spark the same excitement in the children too.

, You can’t eliminate the problem of poverty completely, but you could give one child hope. If every person in a position to help did so, the whole world would be changed. As British statesman Edmund Burke once said: ""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing."" So do something, no matter how small!


Decide where you wish to donate. Some people choose to support local organizations in their own area or country, while others like to sponsor children overseas. You may even find you can afford to do both, which can be a nice balance. Whichever way, you will be making a difference of great importance.
Organizations that you can sponsor a child through include Compassion International, World Vision, Childfund, Save the Children, UNICEF, etc.
Locally, look for welfare projects focused on alleviating childhood poverty that are run by churches, community groups, charities, etc.

, Share knowledge with children about how democracy works and how they can get heard in society. Teach them why it matters that they will vote some day and the importance of being an engaged part of civic life.


Explain to children how government works. Take a moment to show them who their local representatives are.
Use online government resources to teach children how to find legislation, government information and news. You don't need to spend long doing this––simply task them with finding out the answers to some well asked questions!
Suggest that they look at youth parliament/council, etc. projects online. This may encourage them to get involved too! Ask them for a quick summary of what they discover.

"
"
Slow down.",How to Help a Child in Just a Minute4," So often, the opportunity to help a child (or an adult) comes before us, and we miss the moment. Not because we’re blind, but because we are moving too fast. But what on your to-do list is more important than helping a child, especially if it only takes a moment? Instead of talking to yourself like Alice in Wonderland’s White Rabbit, (“oh no, I’m late, I’m late!”) just take a deep breath and focus. Believe you have all the time you need, and that interruptions may be opportunities. Use your time to help children realize their potential too.

Someone who feels threatened by death, possible complications in the case of surgery, or that is soon to undergo cancer treatments experience a variety of very strong emotions. You should be there to support them. Your priority is to take care of them while they feel like they are in in a scared, helpless state. Not all breast cancer patients behave like this, but it is not unusual.;
, Your friend might not know how they feel. A feeling of numbness can set in during the initial weeks of diagnosis, surgery, and treatment. Strange things may surface in their minds when they feel close to death, or they may imagine breast removal so horrible that they can never be a whole person again.

, Emotions may be uncontrollable. Understand that their priorities may change, as well as their behavior. It's not easy to talk when your mind is preoccupied. Assume they are scared and can be irrational and, if any fights arise, do what you can to resolve them and know that it isn't important and might not actually have anything to do with you.

, Be prepared and willing to help and comfort them when they need it, and to distance yourself when they need space. If their condition worsens, be ready for them to spend long nights in hospitals. Be willing to do tasks for them they cannot manage in their current state of mind. However, sometimes all that is needed is your presence, that's all.

, Try to make things simple. If you can promise them that nothing will be too much trouble, and that they can call you anytime, day or night. Make sure to clarify any limitations on this agreement due to children or other family obligations up front.

, If they have previously told you, listen to them. Do not take it upon yourself to start asking questions or asking them if they are scared. They are scared deep down, and in sharing this information with you, they are hoping you will share the burden and offer comfort and security.

, If you have a relative or family member who has been through this, let them know. Leave out disheartening information such as painful deaths, suicides, gruesome and rare side effects, or other tragic tales. There is a proven connection between a person's mental and emotional state and their physical health.

, When a hospital visit is necessary, everything should be organized. An overnight bag with several of their favorite items and some things to do such as knitting, reading, or drawing, are always a great idea.

, Stick to comfortable, soft clothes which button or have a zipper in the front. Exclude clothes or pajamas that are meant to flaunt or expose breasts or curves, as this is not the time.

, Doctors may need to ask you for information. Start a binder with all diagnoses, biopsy and test results, prescriptions, and instructions and add to it every visit.

, Do your best to insure that their kids are looked after. Have bags packed with things such as toys and snacks for when they visit their mom or dad in the hospital. Hospitals are boring and rarely sell food or snacks 24 hours a day. Most don't have facilities where kids can play or sleep or sit.

, Save as much as you can spare without punishing yourself. It helps to have cash late at night, when an ATM is not around. You may need the babysitter or nanny to pick up the kids, or a taxi and take the kids home, food, or any other unforeseen problem.

, If the hospital allows it, organize some well-made home cooked food, or get some ""take-away,"" food from any decent restaurant that you take home with you without sitting. Most restaurants allow this, even when not advertised, just don't confuse it with delivery.

, If you do bring chocolate, understand that they may be avoiding sugar, as it has been associated with tumor growth.

, Most rooms have only few chairs next to the bed, and with a group of five visitors, three people could be standing for hours. Everyone will be uncomfortable, tired, and stressed. However, five visitors shortly after surgery are probably too many. Anesthesia and pain medications could make the patient only semi-conscious for hours. If this many family and friends want to hold vigil at the hospital, take over a corner of the waiting room.

, Privacy is underrated in a hospital bed.

, This can be a will, regrets, apologies, gratitude, love, or a million other sentiments. They may not want to share their intentions with anyone so just leave the paper there next to the bed and don't ask about it. If it is a personal or private matter, they could address it to them on the envelope. Don't read their writing. Don't open letters in unsealed envelopes. Don't deliver any of these messages unless the patient asks you to, often just the writing down of these thoughts is part of the healing process. You don't want to compromise trust.

, Find out about all the medications needed. Learn everything you can. Bad stuff happens, and it's always good to know what pills to pick up when they run out of the ""white circle ones.""

, Sometimes, removal of the entire breast is not necessary, but any breast cancer patient will think about feeling incomplete and unattractive post-op. The truth is that there is also a lot of surgery to recover the physical shape and appearance of breast cancer related surgery. Even in the worst case of the most severe amputation, a new breast can be constructed near identical to the original, with the exception of being unable to lactate and breast feed.

If you can't think of anything to do, start by going out to a restaurant and eating.Take a book with you so you have something to do. It may seem counter-intuitive to take a book with you, but it could act as a conversation starter.Find a restaurant that has a bar you can sit at. Bars are great for eating by yourself, but they also put you with others who may also be eating alone. It may be easier to strike up a conversation if you are eating around other people rather than sitting in a booth by yourself.Explore your city. Start by finding the main streets and walk through some of the shops you find. Introduce yourself to the people there and let them know you are new in town. They may be able to help you find some things to do to get to know people.;
, See what kind of clubs and classes your new town offers. Whether it's a martial arts school or a yoga class, if you join a club, you're bound to meet someone you get along with.If you're still in school and trying to make new friends, joining a club is the way to go. You're more likely to meet other kids who enjoy the same activities as you do if you find a club to join. Common interests and goals are an excellent foundation for friendship.Groups that meet regularly offer consistency, making it easier to get to know people. Groups also offer a natural ice breaker. If you join a club or class, you will be forced to interact with people. This allows you to avoid all the stress of having to approach a new person and introduce yourself.Volunteer groups may also be a good way to meet people with similar interests. Volunteering is also an excellent way to practice social skills if you're having trouble meeting people.Websites like Meetup.com and Craigslist may be able to help you find groups in your area. If you can't find anything, you can always start your own., Check online for things that are happening in your city. Look for things such as concerts or sporting events. Get to know some of the venues in your town, and check their websites.Public libraries can also be a good source of information if you're looking for events in the area.When you go out to events, try to mingle a little bit. Make an effort to get to know other people at the event. Show an interest in other people rather than trying to make people interested in you., Approaching a complete stranger can be difficult. Even if you know you're likely to have something in common with someone, you may still struggle with introducing yourself. Look for talking points to start your conversation with someone new.If you're at an event, look around you. See if you can spot anything unusual in the room. If there is art on the walls, comment on it. If the food is good (or bad) use that as a conversation starter. Your opening line doesn't have to be anything grand, it just has to get the other person talking.Try asking simple questions such as, ""What brings you here,"" or ""How long have you lived here?"" Don't ask anything too personal, just aim for small talk in the beginning.Introduce yourself as soon as you get a chance. A simple, ""Hi, my name's ,"" followed by a handshake is a quick, easy greeting.
If you aren't sure if someone wants to talk to you, give a quick smile. If you get a return smile, walk over and introduce yourself.
You can usually tell if someone isn't interested in making conversation. If you try to approach someone and they give you quick responses, or they seem disinterested, leave them alone., If you're starting a new job in your new city, get to know your co-workers. If you hit it off with one of your co-workers, invite them out to lunch.Try not to fall into a routine of going to work and then going straight home. If you and a co-worker get off at the same time, put yourself out there and see if they want to hang out.See if your company has any carpooling programs. If they don't, see if anyone you work with is interested in sharing rides. Carpooling can be a great way to connect with people you work with., Once you meet a few people, you may be wondering how to make the transition from acquaintance to friend. When you interact with others, pay attention.Listen to what the other person has to say. Remember little details about what they like, what's going on in their life, and how they interact with others.Ask questions to show you're interested in getting to know them. Ask things like, ""What do you like to do in your spare time,"" or ""If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go?"" Try to ask open ended questions that inspire conversation.Give them your full attention when you hang out, but make sure they return the favor. If it seems like they other person is not interested in you, then don't try to force a connection., Don't base your friendship on what others think, or what your friendship looks like. If you feel better after spending time with someone, then you have a solid foundation for a good friendship.Don't spend your time with anyone who tries to control or abuse you. Friendship is about positivity. You don't always have to agree with your friends, but you should be able to respect each other., Part of being friends with someone is being able to trust them. You don't have to share your darkest secrets, but you have to be willing to open up.Do things with each other that put you outside of your comfort zone. Without some kind of vulnerability in your friendship, it may start to feel superficial., Meeting people can take a lot out of you, and you're not guaranteed to immediately make a friend. Don't waste your time looking for social interaction that doesn't improve your life.Don't fake an interest in someone because you are craving social interaction. If you aren't interested in being friends with someone, stop trying to connect with them., Strong friendships are full of shared experiences. The best thing you can do to nurture a friendship is to spend time doing things with your friends. Watch movies, go to the park, take classes together, or cook dinner. Anything you do, as long as you both enjoy it, will make your friendship more meaningful.If you're a teen and you're nervous about what to do with your new friends, talk to your parents about planning an outing. Try to get a few of your new friends together and go to the movies, or to the zoo. Ask your new friends for some suggestions. Think of activities that have a set beginning and end. Movies are great because you can relax, and you have something to talk about afterwards.As you get more comfortable being around your new friends, get more creative with your plans. Do things that give you the opportunity to bond with your friends, such as a weekend camping trip.

, You may feel too stressed or too busy to start all over making new friends. However, having friends can actually reduce your stress and lend you support. It takes time and effort to make friends, but it's worth it in the long run.Schedule time for your friends the same way you do for anything else. Make it part of your weekly routine to meet up with a friend. If you can't make a weekly hang out happen, try for a monthly hang out.When you hang out with a friend, don't let the get together end without making future plans. Set a date to hang out again, and stick to it., If you want to make friends you're going to have to put yourself our there, and that can be intimidating. Nobody wants to be rejected, but you can't let the fear of rejection control you.Don't treat rejection like it's the end of the world. Keeping rejection in perspective will help you overcome it. You won't like everyone you meet, and everyone you meet won't like you.When you encounter rejection, don't let it keep you from going out. See if there is anything you can learn from the experience., If they idea of talking to a complete stranger causes you to freeze up, you may have some stranger anxiety. Talking to everyone you meet may seem like an impossible task, but if you want to get over your anxiety, you'll have to make an effort to interact.Start with talking to people you interact with on a daily basis. For example, when you go to a coffee shop, talk with the clerk who takes your order. Ask something like, ""How's your day going?"" Get used to making small talk with random people you see throughout your day.If you're in school, try talking with some of your classmates before and after class. Ask about things you're interested in and see what kind of response you get. For example, you could ask someone, ""Hey, did you see that episode of last night,"" or ""Have you ever heard of ?"" Questions about pop culture are good ways to start small talk, and could lead to good conversation.
As you practice talking to people, speak with confidence and try to make eye contact. Even if it feels unnatural at first, keep doing it. You want to get used to this kind of behavior so that the next time you go out, talking to people will seem easier."
"
Bring your friends together.,
Make the necessary introductions.,
State why you wanted to introduce these two people.,
Stick around and facilitate the conversation.",How to Introduce Friends to Other Friends1," If you are at a party or some social gathering, bring your two friends together so that they can physically meet each other. You can have one friend stay put while you track down the other one, or have one friend come with you while you look for the other one. Regardless, try to take them to place where you are able to introduce them.If one friend is being hesitant, say something like “I really want you to meet my friend Bob. He’s the biggest Wings fan I know” or “I’m going to introduce you to this person that I think you’ll like.”;
, Once you have brought your friends together, introduce them to each other. You can choose to do the introduction and say their names, or let them do the introducing. However, it may be less awkward and more formal if you do the introducing.Say something like “Bob, this is Barnaby Smith. Barnaby, this is Bob Robertson.”
Use someone’s full formal name when making an introduction, unless they prefer a nickname.

, Your friends will likely be curious about why you thought it necessary to introduce them to each other. You should explain your reason and let them know why you thought they would be friends. This is helpful because it gives them a point of commonality and an easy starting point for a conversation.Say something like “I thought I’d introduce you to each other because you are such big fans of the TV show Wings” or “you’re both new to town so I thought I’d introduce you to each other.”

, Once you do the initial introduction and explanation, stick around to keep the conversation going. Meeting new people can be awkward, so you should stay and keep the conversation from fizzling out. If it slows down, mention other things that your friends have in common.Unless your two friends really hit it off and strike up a good conversation, do not leave right away. Be sure to stick around and nurse the friendship that you are trying to create.

Use different activities to meet new female friends.Introduce yourself and start conversations in any place you might be with women who have potentially similar interests. For example, you can meet women at work, a church, in your neighborhood or at activities both of you do like a running club.Listen to what each woman says to get a sense of her personality and if you two might “click.”;
, You may or may not know the woman with whom you’d like to be friends well, but introducing yourself can break the ice. This can help you form first impressions of each another that may lead to conversation and a deep friendship.Keep the introduction light and ask open-ended questions. For example, you could say: “Hi there, I’m Sophie and I’m friends with Teresa and have heard so many nice things about you. I’d love to hear more about your work with refugees if you have some time.”Talk to a woman casually if you’re a guy. Many women may think you’re hitting on them, so approach them slowly and as if you want to have a conversation and nothing else, in part by keeping yourself at a comfortable distance without touching her.You might want to say something like, “Hi, I’m Christopher, and I’ve seen you around work and was wondering what you do for our team.”
Find out something about her from mutual friends, colleagues, or acquaintances to help you start the conversation., Most women like others who take care of their appearance, though without overdoing it. Presenting your best self to your future friend can give her a positive impression of you and encourage her to get to know you.Avoid overdoing it with your appearance. Looking like yourself shows her that you are comfortable and can also put her at ease.For example, keep your clothing, makeup and hair simple. Anything elaborate can send the message that you are high-maintenance and may undermine your attempts to be friends with a woman. It can also send the signal of competition, which many women don’t like., Most women enjoy being around others who are confident and at ease in their own skin. Practicing being friendly, for example by having confidence and putting her at ease can help draw a woman into a friendship.Avoid being overly confident, which may make you seem pretentious. Stay calm, cool, and collected in your confidence.For example, don’t cross your arms or recline with your hands behind your head. In addition, maintain eye contact with your new friend. Sometimes even gently touching someone on the shoulder can reassure them that you are nice.
Show your real personality. Most women can tell when someone is being fake and your acquaintance may not want to pursue a friendship with you if you’re not being yourself., Ask about your acquaintance’s interests to show your interest in forging a friendship. Discuss your respective interests and make sure to mention mutual passions, which is a good basis for a friendship with a woman.Find ways to incorporate your interests in conversations, which may inspire her to invite you to do activities together.
Women enjoy a wide range of activities including shopping, hiking, photography, and running. Mentioning things in which you might think she is interested can help form a bond between the two of you.Ask her about her interests if you are not sure. For example, if you want to strike up a conversation in a yoga class you can say “I’ve seen you here a couple of times, what are your favorite poses?” This might help you realize that you like going to class at the same times.
Tell her about your interests, too. Friendship is a two way street, and it’s important for her to know about your passions.For example, if you’re talking about yoga poses, you can say “Oh, I like that one, too. Sometimes I have to modify it, do you ever have a hard time getting into it?”
This also lets your female acquaintance know that you are an interesting and dynamic person., Listen closely to what your acquaintance says, especially if you are a man seeking a female friendship. This demonstrates that you care and want to develop the friendship, and may also help stimulate conversation with her at juncture when they may be silence.Enjoying a balance of meaningful and playful conversations can help develop your acquaintance into a good friendship because women like to be able to talk about both serious and light subjects.Make sure to ask follow-up questions to show that you’re listening. Remember to do this can also help you to listen instead of thinking about how you’ll respond.
Compliment her on her interests to demonstrate that you understand what’s important to her.For example, if she volunteers for the Red Cross, say something “I really admire your work with the Red Cross and would love to know more about how you got involved with the organization.”

, As you get to know your acquaintance better, make sure to stay independent and not allow her to cloud your opinions. This can keep your friendship developing and also help keep her interest in you.

Use your brain and don’t dumb yourself down for your acquaintance. Show her you’re capable of forming opinions. Having meaningful exchanges and conversations keeps your friendship fresh.Avoid asking her too spend too much time together and don’t make yourself too available, either. This helps show her that other people are also interested in being friends with you., Your acquaintance may get to know you better if you demonstrate one of your talents for her and do activities of mutual interest. This could stimulate conversations or doing other activities, while showing her a side of you that many people may not see.Keep your demonstration simple so that it’s fun for both of you and doesn’t appear like competition. For example, cook for her. You can invite her for dinner by saying “I love to cook Italian food and would enjoy making us my infamous lasagna.”
Allow her to demonstrate her own talents to you, too.

, In all likelihood, you and your new friend don’t share everything in common. Be flexible in what you two undertake together, sometimes doing things you like and other times what she does.

This demonstrates your interest in and commitment to developing your friendship. For example, if she wants to go running one day and you prefer to have brunch, do what she wants and suggest you run and have brunch next time.

, Women enjoy being around others who positive and fun, which is especially true if she wants to be friends. She likely wants to enjoy time together and not immediately jump into how bad your life or the world is.Start off your conversation with good news and things that have happened to you. Squeeze in negative topics once you’re both into the conversation and have loosened the mood a bit.
Understand that everyone person has an occasional bad day. Talk to her about it and then move on, or else she might consider you a negative Nelly and not want to invest time in your friendship any longer., Once you’ve moved beyond the acquaintance stage, share feelings and other personal items with your friend. This signals that you trust her and consider her a friend.

Be sure to not overshare. There is a fine line between sharing feelings and personal information and giving away too much. For example, don’t share intimate details with your friends unless you are comfortable and you are sure she is also comfortable with it., Having your friend meet your broader circle of friends can help solidify your friendship. In many cases, if she and your friends get along, this can further develop your friendship.

, One of the hallmarks of a good friend is that she remembers important dates and events and follows up on getting together. Make sure to offer support and congratulations whenever either are due, and follow up with her to schedule time together.Send text messages, call her, or write cards to wish her good luck or congratulate her successes. Any gesture, no matter how small, is appropriate., As you get to know one another better and enjoy being together, increase the amount of time you spend together. Seeing each other on a regular basis can help deepen and solidify your friendship into something truly meaningful.Set up a regular “date.” For example, agree to meet for a run and brunch on Sundays. This will give you both a chance to stimulate endorphins and eat good food while enjoying time together.Remember to be flexible if she can’t meet. Ask if you can meet some other time during the week.

Next time you're invited to a party or out shopping by someone whose company you enjoy, challenge yourself to accept the invitation rather than staying home.;
, MeetUp is a great resource to use to meet others with similar interests or goals. You can join the community online, then become a member of a meetup group depending on the types of events you are looking to go to and find others accompany you. Some examples of MeetUp groups include those for ages 30-39, young professionals, hikers, tennis players, and many more.

, This is a great way to meet others with passions that align with yours, as well as to meet friends who are passionate and care about their community, characteristics that are important in friends. If you have have fun with someone will working and giving back to the less fortunate then it is likely that that fun will translate beyond a volunteering experience.


Look for volunteer opportunities that match your interests online or by using local community resources such as the library.

, Social media can be a very powerful tool in helping you connect with others. If you see friends of yours on Facebook who share a story or write a status about a topic of interest, comment that you agree or that you find what they shared funny or interesting. As time passes, it will be appropriate to message and ask this person to coffee or lunch to get to know each other better.

, Talk to the maintenance guy who's fixing the light bulb above your desk at work, talk to the woman in front of you at the vending machine, talk to the new guy at work. Opportunities for social interaction surround you in nearly every place that you go. Often times, you’ll find that most people enjoy being social and are looking for new friends as well.

, It’s likely that your existing friends likely have other friends that you could get along well with. Given that your friend likes you, they probably enjoy spending time with lots of other interesting people too. If you’re going to a party, barbeque or dinner and you don’t know many people, make an effort to introduce yourself. You’ll also appear very warm, welcoming and energetic.

, Have you ever met someone at a conference or networking event and just spent ages talking in the corner? Real connections can be made anywhere and don’t have to be constrained by the boundaries of “private life” or “work life.” Do you have a coworker who wants to go see a new movie that you're dying to see? Invite them to go with you! Work with someone who enjoys trying new restaurants? Ask them to go with you to the new Italian place you've been wanting to try.

, A strong friendship is most likely to develop between persons with commonalities or with similar hobbies. Many cities offer opportunities like book clubs and sports teams or spaces like churches or coffee shops that make it easy to meet and make new friends. If a club or organization doesn’t exist for a particular interest you have, consider creating one.

, As you get older, your schedule becomes more compact and you have more demands on your time, making any free time you have more precious. You are under no obligations to make friends, so think about who you would truly enjoy spending time with. For example, if you are a new mother, it might be a good idea to make friends with other mothers to share experiences and support.


Choose friends with similar values. Friendship groups should be diverse, but if you can respect each other's beliefs and values, it will avoid negative influence. Friends with similar values also hold each other accountable.
Choose friends who will balance you. It is a good idea to have friends who excel in areas where you struggle, as well as having friends who can appreciate your own talents. This mix of strengths and weaknesses creates fantastic synergy. If you are a little untidy, make friends with someone who is very organized. If you struggle to keep to an exercise routine, find someone who is passionate about working out. If you can utilize each other's strengths, then everyone wins., Treat the opportunity to make new friends as a positive experience that will allow you to grow. A mental attitude like this can make you seem very attractive and boost your confidence when meeting new people.

, Listen actively and engage with and respond to what other people are saying, avoiding unnecessary distractions like cell phone use. People become rapidly aware if someone is not listening to them, and lose interest in the conversation, making it difficult for you to develop a friendship with them.


Ask questions to show that you heard what someone said. This also allows you to clarify a point or develop and idea. It encourages people to open up and creates a more solid foundation for the discussion. For example, if someone mentions that they went shopping recently you might ask “what did you buy?” This will help continue the conversation and will show your interest.
Paraphrase pieces of the conversation. This is a great tool to show that you have listened to and understood a person. It involves repeating back what a person has said, perhaps with your own comment as a brief addition. For example, ""So Simon, what you're saying is that you'd rather spend more time with the family, rather than feeling like you always have to work?""
Respond appropriately. Nod and use appropriate gestures. Allow someone to make their point before you make yours. Reserve judgement and share your own opinions in a respectful manner. Be candid, honest and open in your responses., Body language demonstrates a great deal about who you are and the kind of relationship you are trying to create as well as your level of interest in the conversation. It influences how you feel and how people respond to you. Stand up tall, with your shoulders back, and take up space. Create a welcoming, comfortable persona.


Smile. When you smile at someone, you give the impression that you are approachable and trustworthy. Research indicates that we remember those you smile at us, and humans can spot a smile over 300 feet away
Reduce nervous gestures. When we are nervous, we pacify ourselves with self-touching, perhaps by playing with our hair or jewelry, fidgeting or adjusting our clothes. This can be rude or inappropriate in some contexts, and it also robs our statements of credibility. Take a deep breath and steady yourself when you feel tempted to engage in such gestures.
Maintain eye contact regularly. This shows that you are listening and helps you to keep focus. It also demonstrates that you find what the person is saying interesting. However, do not stare; take small breaks from making eye contact by looking down momentarily.
Talk with your hands and use open gestures. Talking with our hands can stimulate thinking, and it also shows you have nothing to hide. Keep your movements slow and relaxed, show the palms of your hands and use open-arm gestures., Doing this would indicate that you aren't really listening and care more about what you have to say than what they have to say. It defeats the point of successful communication.


Try not to finish other people's sentences. You might think this is an indication that you are developing a closer bond. However, you are actually disempowering a person by not letting them finish their thought. , Think about how much time you spent with friends in school or college. Those friendships grew gradually as a result of the time and effort you invested and the fun you had together. You need to make the time now because proximity is important. Try to think of new and exciting ways you and a new friend could spend time together, especially if you’re keen to avoid getting stuck in a routine. This might include:


Getting together at a new restaurant.
Having a weekly movie or poker night.
Volunteering together.
Doing some home improvement or gardening.
Booking a spa day.

, This can be a one-time experience or a new hobby. Sharing a novel experience with a new friend is a great way to connect and have a memory that will last forever. Meeting people who are interested in trying new things is a great way to connect and have things to talk about. You might want to try:


Cooking classes.
Learning a new language.
Playing a team sport.
Dance lessons.
Going to a concert or open-mic night.
Learning to paint, draw or sculpt.
Joining a craft group.
Getting involved in a drama group or choir.

, Does your new friend like to watch movies? Ask them if they would like to go to the movies with you. Friendships develop when both parties are able to explore their interests together.

, If you’ve been meaning to reach out to someone, now is the time to do it. If you feel that calling after so long might be a little intimate, get in contact via social media. Since you already have an established friendship with this person, you can forego much of the “getting to know you” segment of the friendship and proceed instead to catching up and deepening your friendship.

, Travelling alone can seem scary, but so many exciting connections are made on the road. No matter the length of the trip, travelling alone encourages you to open up. When you meet someone, a store of amazing memories and shared experiences is created.

Open up.,
Show your positive attitude and sense of humor.,
Mention common interests.,
Look for opportunities to spend more time with an acquaintance.,
Invite an acquaintance to an event.,
Take a class together.,
Establish a ritual.,
Be generous.",How to Make Acquaintances Good Friends1," Let your guard down, and share something about yourself that is real. Showing that you are willing to be vulnerable is a great way to bond with someone. With luck, they will reciprocate by sharing something personal with you. This will help deepen your friendship.When you take a risk and trust someone, they will often surprise you.
Not everyone will respond the way you want. Some people just won't get you, which can be very disappointing. But this is the way you find out whether an acquaintance has the makings of a true friend.;
, It's not necessary to fake being happy all the time, but when you don't know someone very well you should try to keep things light and positive. Try to see the humor in every situation and your would-be friend may enjoy being around you more.If you like to make people laugh, don't be afraid to make jokes. A sense of humor is an attractive quality!
Just be sure you're not making jokes about other people, which always comes across as meaner than you intended it to be.

, Point out things you both genuinely like – the other person may not realize that you have so much in common. It's okay to open with something like, “I heard you like 90s music...so do I. What's your favorite band?”


Don't pretend to like certain things just because your acquaintance does. This always comes across as fake, and it's a big turnoff to most people.

, The best way to deepen any relationship is to create memories together. Be inventive, and come up with a way to spend more quality time with your soon-to-be friend. As long as the activity is something you are genuinely interested in, this will be perfectly natural.

If your new friend belongs to a book club, chess club, or theater group, see if you can join.
If he or she participates in charity work, volunteer your time and help out.

, Your acquaintance may invite you to do something, but you will also have to take the initiative to invite him or her to do some things as well. Consider your acquaintance’s likes and dislikes to find something that he or she would really enjoy.


If one of your acquaintance's favorite bands is coming to town, buy tickets and invite him or her to go with you. He or she will probably be thrilled. If he or she can't go for some reason, you can always find someone else to take the other ticket.If you invite the person to go see a movie, have a specific movie in mind that you think the person might like to see based on his or her interests. This shows you've been paying attention to what the person likes.Watch for other possible opportunities to spend time with the person. Pay attention to upcoming events, especially things your acquaintance has expressed interest in. See if he or she wants to go with you to a game, a gallery opening, a flea market, or a big sale.

, Is there something that you and this person would both like to learn more about? Taking a class together is a great way to bond with your acquaintance and become friends. Try checking local event listings or your local community college to get some ideas about what classes are available.


For example, you and your acquaintance might enjoy learning a new style of dance, taking a pottery class, or learning to play the ukulele., If there is something that you and an acquaintance enjoy doing together – like seeing a movie, or going bowling – try to get into the habit of getting together on a regular basis. Go bowling on the first Saturday of the month, or see a new movie every weekend. People love rituals, and the predictability factor may make you feel that you are closer friends.

, One of the most unattractive qualities in a person is being stingy with your time, money, or emotions. Offer to help an acquaintance if you know he or she needs something – don't wait and force the other person to ask for help. Think about the people around you, and try to find ways to make their lives a little better. Small, sweet gestures often take people by surprise, and are always well received.

If you are heading to the vending machines, ask the people you are with if you can get them anything.
If you see that an acquaintance is struggling in a class that you take together, see if he or she would like to study with you sometime. Don't act like you're smarter than this person are; just say that you could use a study-buddy.

Suggest something for everyone to do together.,
Organize a social get together.,
Set up a friendship blind date.",How to Introduce Friends to Other Friends2," One way to have your friends meet is to invite both of them to something that you know that they will like. If both of your friends are into basketball, set up a pickup game and invite both of them. If they like music, go to a show and invite them both.


If you organize something ahead of time, it is harder for your friends to bail.

, An easy way to get your friends to meet is by hosting a party and inviting both of them. If they both show up, introduce them to each other. This takes the pressure off the introduction and, if your friends do not get along, there are other people around for them to talk with. This way you are not stuck awkwardly doing some activity with two people who do not like each other.


As a rule of thumb, be sure to invite people to the party that both friends know. If one friend does not know many people, this can be an opportunity for them to expand their social circle.

, Although you would normally want to be around to facilitate a friendship, it may be easier to arrange for your friends to meet each other without you. Make a time for them to meet at a public place like a bar or coffee shop. Tell them what the other one looks like so that they will be able to identify each other.You could also give your friends each other’s contact information and let them set up a friend date.
In general, try to introduce your friends in person. This will keep the situation from getting too awkward.

"
"
Let your friends know you are setting them up.,
Avoid gossiping.,
Let it go if they do not like each other.,
Take it easy if they become best friends.",How to Introduce Friends to Other Friends3," Before you introduce your friends, let them know that you have a friend that they should meet. Try not to spring it on them or trick them into meeting each other. This will more than likely make the situation more awkward. Foreshadow the introduction a little and tell each friend that you have another friend that they should meet.Say something like “Bob, you have to meet my friend Barnaby. I think he likes Wings as much as you do” or “Barnaby, I’m going to introduce you to my friend Bob. You two are the only people I know who watch Wings every day.”

, If you introduce two friends, avoid gossiping with them about the other person. If your goal is to create a budding friendship, talking behind each other’s backs will quickly put an end to that. Instead of having two friends who are pals, you may find that you have no friends., If your friends do not hit it off, you need to move on. You cannot take it personally. It is not your fault that a friendship did not blossom. Sometimes, people, who in theory should get along, simply do not like each other.Do not push it if they do not become friends. No one likes being bullied or forced into a relationship.

, On the flipside, you may find that your friends become closer to each other than with you. This can be painful because you may feel like you are left out or that they betrayed your initial kindness of introducing them. If this happens, try not to take it personally. It has more to do with them and their budding friendship than it does with you. In addition, they may come back around and start hanging out with you again once their friendship cools a little.Avoid being territorial or mean to your friends. This will only ensure that they exclude you.

Make eye contact.,
Smile at people.,
Compliment people.,
Show your interest.,
Avoid teasing or bullying behavior at all costs.",How to Make Acquaintances Good Friends2," While you don’t need to stare directly into someone's eyes when you first meet, making natural occasional eye contact can show that you are engaged and interested. This is especially important when you are having a conversation with someone. If your eyes are darting all over the place when someone is trying to talk to you, it might send a message that you are not interested in what he or she is saying.Try to make direct eye contact now and then, and hold it for a slow count of three.
Even when you are feeling shy and find it difficult to make eye contact, try to force yourself to do it.

, Smiling can boost your mood and make the people around you feel happier as well. Smiling can even cause your brain to release endorphins, which are chemicals that act like natural pain killers.Try to smile whenever you meet someone new. For example, you could smile at someone you pass on the sidewalk or in a grocery store.

, Try to find something you genuinely like about this person so that your compliment doesn't sound fake or forced. Obviously, there is something you like about this person, or you wouldn't want to become friends.Complimenting a person on their shoes, bag, or necklace is a safe bet. Just be sure you're not saying the same exact thing to them, every time you meet. For example, you might say something like, “Your shoes are so cool!” Or, “I love your dress! It’s so pretty!”
If there is something outstanding about this person, even better! “You have the brightest smile I've seen in ages.” “You are always so cheerful! How do you do it?”
If someone opens a door for you, you can say, “Chivalry's not dead!” to compliment their nice manners.
”You're so funny!” is always appreciated – everyone likes to think they have a good sense of humor. Just make sure you really mean it, and that you laugh! Saying this without laughing is the worst.

, In conversation, always be polite and listen to what your friend is saying. Acting bored can alienate people, and it may cause you to seem self-centered and narcissistic.If you find yourself stuck in a conversation that you can't contribute to, see if you can change the topic of conversation. Try not to interrupt, but when your friend gets to a stopping point, you can bring up something else.
Sometimes a friend will want to talk about something very serious or personal when you are in a hurry, or are too distracted by your own thoughts to really pay attention. Ask if you can talk about it later when you can give them your undivided attention.

, Never pick on someone out of spite, for any reason. Even if you think you are being funny, making jokes at the expense of others makes you appear untrustworthy and others may not want to become your close friend. Even if your acquaintances laugh along at the time, they may think you are mean-spirited. They may also wonder whether you will be making fun of them next, and they may not want to stick around to find out."

Give yourself a “personality makeover.” Be honest with yourself, and try to figure out a few things that you tend to do that put people off.,
Be authentic.,
Be willing to laugh at yourself.,
Behave appropriately for the situation.,
Avoid making everything about you.,
Don't keep score.,
Be reliable.",How to Make Acquaintances Good Friends3," Make a “wish list” of what you would do differently if a genie magically gave you the power to change anything. Then pretend to be that better person until the new you comes naturally.If you feel like you're too shy sometimes, go out of your way to be more outgoing in social situations – even if it is uncomfortable.
If you feel like you're unreliable at times, and let people down, make it a priority never to make promises you aren't completely positive you'll be able to keep. Then follow through on any plans you make with your friends, every single time.

, It's a cliché for a reason: it's important to be yourself. Don't try to become what you think your friend wants you to be. Pretending to be something you’re not can become exhausting, and your run the risk of your friends never truly knowing who you are. Besides, your friends like you because you are you – if you were any different, they wouldn't be your friends in the first place., When you make a mistake, own it. And if your friend teases you a little, don't take it personally. Accept that everyone does something embarrassing now and then, and just try to laugh it off. You don’t want your friend to feel like he or she is walking on eggshells around you because he or she is constantly trying not to hurt your feelings by accident., If your friend is sharing something important with you, don't try to lighten the mood by making jokes. If your friends are trying to relax and have a good time, save any heavy or overly-personal conversations for another time. If you are constantly changing the dynamic of the group, then they may feel that you don't really understand them., Don't brag about your accomplishments. If a friend is telling you about something he or she has done that he or she is proud of, don't try to “one-up” your friend. For example, if a friend tells a funny story, don't try to top it with a better one.

, If you always pay for everything, you might need to say something, but the last thing you want to do is act like you think your friend owes you something.Don't keep track of who paid for lunch last time, or who drove last weekend, or who has been chipping in more for gas money.
Don't keep track of how often you contact your friend versus how often your friend contacts you. Making a big deal about this may make your friend want to avoid you completely.
If it seems like you are constantly inviting your friend to things, and he or she is not inviting you to as many things – don't worry about it. As long as you are seeing each other, it doesn't matter who issued the invitation.

, Always follow through on plans you make, unless you have a serious emergency. If you need to break plans every rare once in a while, be honest with your friend and tell them why. But don't make a habit of this, or they will eventually stop inviting you to things altogether."

, Almost everyone has a Facebook and Instagram profile, but there are lots of other networks with more specific interests or focuses that you can join too. Or, just join groups within your existing networks to find more people near you that like the same activities or have similar values.

center]] Try LinkedIn to make professional friends. Pinterest is great for finding people with similar interests, like crafting or cooking.
Join online groups for games you like to play, like World of Warcraft or Minecraft.
Find Facebook groups for local religious meetings, informal sports teams, or activists. Post on the group’s page regularly to let everyone get to know you a bit more.

, Open up a conversation about what is going on around you.


After class, ask the person next to you, “What did you think of that lesson/test/discussion?”
In Spanish club, ask another person for a recommendation on the best tapas restaurant in your area. Or ask if they know a place you can go together to practice speaking Spanish with native speakers.
At a concert, ask your neighbor, “Have you seen this band before?” or ask for recommendations of similar groups they listen to that you might also like.
During practice for team sports or activities, ask a new acquaintance for tips on performing better.

, People like to be around others that look content, and smiling shows that you are interested in the conversation and in knowing that person better.


Smile with your whole face, not just your lips. Practice in a mirror if you aren’t a naturally smiley person to make sure you can tell you are smiling just by looking at your eyes.
Be genuine when you smile, not fake. It helps to be comfortable in your surroundings, which is why it is important to only seek out activities and groups you have a genuine interest in.

, Ask the person you want to befriend questions about themselves, instead of dominating the conversation. Show you are really interested in getting to know them better and they will most likely want to keep talking to you.Aim to listen to them at least three times as much as you speak. But don’t neglect to answer questions they ask you, too!
When it’s your turn to speak, offer insight into your personality or interests to give them a glimpse of who you are as a person.

, If you are on a sports team, maybe they would like to go to a professional game with you. After a concert, ask your friend-to-be to attend the next one you plan to go to. Invite your fellow Spanish speaking friend to that tapas restaurant they recommended.


If they say no, don’t give up, but also avoid pushing a “friend-date.” Wait until the next time you speak to invite them to a different outing.
Not everyone will want to hang out outside of the group you both attend. That’s ok! There are other people there too, so try a different person next time.

, Don’t let past experiences tamper with new friendships. Let go of any grudges or remaining negative feelings you harbor based on how others treated you in the past.


Know the difference between forgiving and forgetting. It’s always best to let go of negativity, but it’s important to remember lessons learned from past experiences so you know better who to trust in the future.
Give everyone a chance to show you what they can offer, regardless of whether they have different religious or political beliefs than most people you know. You don’t have to agree with these beliefs, but you might still learn from them.

, People want to hang around others that treat them nicely and make them feel good about themselves. Offer only nice and supportive statements to your friends, and learn to give any necessary criticism constructively so as to avoid hurting others’ feelings.If you find yourself feeling negatively towards your friend, re-focus your attention on their good qualities instead. Reflect the positive things about them back to themselves, instead of the negative ones.
Instead of chastising your friend for not showing up for plans, remind them how much fun you have when you are together and that you want to have more of those good times.

, Never speak negatively about someone behind their back, especially with mutual friends. Gossiping says more about you as a person than it does about them.


If one friend is gossiping about another, say something positive about the third party, like “She is really smart, though,” or “I don’t know much about , but he’s always been there for me.”
Gossiping is often a sign of envy and a negative self-image. If you have friends that spend a lot of time talking about others, you may want to evaluate whether these are people you want to hang around.

, Everyone needs help sometimes, but not everyone asks for it when they do. Whether your friend asks you for help doing something, or you know your help would make their task easier, offer to give assistance.


They will likely be there for you when you need help in return, and will appreciate the self-sacrifice you made for their benefit.Be careful not to spread yourself too thin, though! Don’t say “yes” to something you know you don’t have time to really help with, or to anything you feel uncomfortable participating in.

, Always be honest with your friends unless doing so would hurt them more than help them. Show gratitude for their friendship, especially when they do something selfless for you.Honesty leads to trust, so it's a very important aspect of your personality to offer to your friends.
Don't agree to do things you have no interest in or don't think you can handle.

, Follow through on your promises. Do what you say you will do and be where you say you will be. Consider plans you make with friends as important as school or work obligations.


Try not to cancel plans unless you have an emergency, especially at the last minute. Everyone has to cancel once in a while, but make this the exception and not the rule.
Write plans on a calendar or add reminders to your smartphone so you don’t forget!

, Don’t ever try to change your true self for another person. Try new activities and decide if you like them or not, but don’t keep doing something you don’t enjoy just to meet people. These thin bonds will not last once you stop trying to be someone you are not.


You can always change what you do or how you behave, but not your basic personality or moral beliefs.
If someone wants to you change your beliefs or act against your moral fiber, they are not someone you need or want to be friends with.

Getting a person’s attention through chatting can send the signals that you’d like to know him or her better.Use different means to start your conversation. You can approach the person or send a text or email. Keep it light to start and ask questions to which the person can respond. For example, you could walk up to the person and say, “Hi Sara, I really enjoyed your presentation today, especially the graphics. How did you do that?” If you’re texting or emailing the person, you could write, “Great talk today, Sara! I am really interested in how you did the graphics—would you mind telling me some more about how you put them together?”Remember to keep it casual and not broach personal subjects. Not only are personal subjects more appropriate when you know the person better, but some people may confuse this as you hitting on them.;
, People are more likely to want to get to know you better if you are positive and put together. This shows the person that you respect yourself—and your friendship.Pull together your appearance without overdoing it. Wear clean clothes, comb your hair, and avoid too much makeup or cologne. This signals the person that you are approachable and welcome to getting to know him or her better.
Stay positive and encouraging. While everyone has a bad day now and then, no friend wants to be around a person who is always negative and a downer. If you had a bad day, acknowledge it to your friend and then say something like, “But now we’re hanging out and I’m really happy to leave my bad day behind me.”

, Everyone enjoys being around others who are confident and at ease with themselves. Being positive, kind, friendly and open to the person you would like to know better can help draw them to you.


Maintain eye contact with the person and use open body language to show your interest and that you’re friendly.For example, smile, lean in with your body, and tilt your head towards the person.Avoid negative talk about other people because this may turn off the person you would like to know better. Negative comments may make the person ask, “What is she saying about me when I am not present?”, Getting to know someone can take a long time. Gradually increasing your interactions with the person shows mutual respect and interest. It also allows each of you to reveal your true and full personality, which can ultimately lead to a strong friendship.

, As a part of your conversations, talk about what types of things interest the person. Knowing what the individual likes and dislikes can better cue you into your friend’s personality.Pick up on comments about the person’s interests and incorporate them into your conversation. This may stimulate further conversation and help you learn more about the person. It can also lead to doing activities together, which can also deepen your relationship to the person. For example, say, “Did you just mention that you love Vietnamese food? I’ve never had it before—what are some of your favorite dishes?”Ask questions about the person’s interests. For example, if you want to get to know the person sitting next to you better say, “I noticed that really beautiful picture on your desk. Where did you take it?”
Mention your interests as a part of your conversation. This can help the other person get to know you better and shows your interest in having a dialogue with your friend. Consider using the person’s interests as a way to introduce yours. For example, if you’re talking about food you could say, “I am a huge fan of trying new cuisines and Mexican is one I just don’t know well. Can you tell me a little more about it and what types of dishes you like?”

, In order to pick up on the person’s interests and personality, listen and watch closely to what your friend says and does. This shows your interest and gives you a point from which to start a conversation or suggest getting together for an activity.Talk about a mixture of serious and more lighthearted subjects to get a better sense of the person’s personality. For example, talk about something such as pets for lighter topics. You could say, “What kind of dog do you have or want to get?” For more serious topics, keep it non-controversial at first so that you don’t offend the person. You could say, “Can you believe how mean-spirited the race for president has become?”
Ask questions about the person’s statements to show your interest in getting to know him.
Notice something about the person and compliment him or her on it. This is also a good way to keep a conversation going and show your interest in the person.For example, you could say, “Your ability to tackle anything thrown your way is really impressive! How do you do it with such grace?”
Watch the person’s habits. Does your friend always hold doors for others? This can show you that the person is polite and considerate.

, You may be tempted to spend a lot of time together as you get to know and become friends with someone, but it’s important to maintain your independence. This shows the person—and yourself—respect and may help you to get to better know your friend’s personality.Continue to assert your opinions, which may stimulate more meaningful conversations. Show your friend you’re capable of forming opinions. Having meaningful exchanges and conversations keeps your friendship fresh.Avoid making yourself too available. This shows the person that you are not clingy as well as that you are able to maintain other relationships.

, One of the best ways to get to know someone better is by doing different activities together. This can help you see new aspects of the person’s life or personality and also shows your interest in deepening the relationship.Consider starting off by doing something you both enjoy. For example, suggest going to dinner at a restaurant you’ve both wanted to try. You could also cook together.
Keep the time you spend together commensurate with how well you know the person. For example, you might not want to book a vacation together if you’ve only known the person for a few months. Instead, consider taking a day trip to do something both of you enjoy.

, No person has a one-dimensional personality. Part of getting to know someone better is realizing that there are positive and negative aspects of the person. Taking these ups and downs in stride can help you get to know the person better and forge a strong relationship.Keep your interactions as positive as possible. Begin conversations with good news or something positive that happened to you. This can relax the mood, allowing you or the person to broach negative topics, which can further cue you into their personality.
Be understanding the person seems to be having a bad day. No one is immune to a bit of negativity and watching how the person handles it can help you know him or her better. If you want, discuss what is troubling the person and then offer your help.

, There is no harm in telling a friend you’d like to get to know him or her better as a friend or have romantic feelings for the person. As a part of a casual conversation, mention, “I really enjoy talking to you and I hope we’ll have a chance to develop our friendship more in the future.” Be sure to highlight the platonic aspect by saying “our friendship” so that you don’t confuse the person. If you do have romantic feelings, you should also be clear about this. You could say, “You know, we’ve been spending a lot of time together and my feelings are developing beyond friendship. I hope you feel the same way, but I understand if you don’t.” These types of statements show interest without overwhelming the person with expectations.

, When you’ve had a chance to get to know the person more than superficially, you can start telling them personal information and feelings. This shows the other person you’d like to get to know them better and helps establish a bond of trust between the two of you.


Avoid sharing information or feelings that are too personal. Keep what you say commensurate with how well you’ve gotten to know the person. For example, don’t mention your sex life or ask about the other person’s. This type of information is something shared best within very close friendships and not with someone you want to know better.Instead, share bits such as, “I am about to have surgery on my knee,” or “My husband just got a promotion but his company expects us to move away.”

, In many cases, your friends may offer interesting perspective on someone you want to know better. Including your friend in activities with your other friends can help you see how the person acts with different people or even other parts of his or her personality.Remember to keep your invitation commensurate with how well you know the person. For example, avoid inviting someone out for a night of cocktails if you’ve just begun to get to know the person. Instead, consider asking the person to dinner with friends, which will give all of you a chance to talk and get to know more about each other.

, As you and the person get to know each other better, consider spending more time together. Having regular meetings or going on vacation with the person can help you get to know them very well.Consider having a regular “date” over something like dinner or cocktails. This allows you to pick up on conversations or discuss things happening in your respective lives.
Schedule day trips or vacations together. Being in close proximity to the person during a relaxing trip can help you really know who she is. Just remember that it’s acceptable if you want to have some “me” time during vacations, too.

A lot of people get nervous in social situations, but that doesn't mean that they avoid them altogether!The only way to get past your anxiety is to keep putting yourself in new situations that challenge you.
Keep in mind that no one else knows that you are not confident. If you swallow your fears and pretend to be confident, no one will have any idea that you were anxious in the first place. The more you smile and interact with others, the more confident you will appear.;
, If you will be attending an organized social gathering, try to find out who will be there ahead of time. The more you know about the other guests, the better prepared you will be to converse with them.If it seems appropriate, you could research the invitees to a corporate event online and read about their recent projects. If you're attending a dinner party at a friend's house, just ask her about the other people who will be there.
If you can't find out any specific information about the people you're likely to meet, think about what the people who are attending this specific event are likely to be interested in or involved in. You can use this information to think about questions you might ask people to break the ice. For example, if it is a social event at a university, you can ask people to tell you about their most interesting class.

, If you're worried about not having anything to say to someone, one of the best things you can do is to read the news and be informed about current events. If you know what's going on in the world and in your local community, you'll always have something to talk about, even if it's something as mundane as the storm you're expecting next week.Try to avoid being overly political with people you don't know at all. Some people do not want to talk about sensitive subjects, while others might be ready to get into a heated debate.

, This may sound easier said than done, but you really just need to be passionate about something in order to have a great conversation about it. Whether you're an avid world traveler or a movie buff, chances are you can think of a few interesting things to talk about.When thinking about interesting things to talk about, try to focus on things that most other people would be able to relate to in some way. You can test yourself by thinking about what kinds of questions you could ask to get them engaged in the conversation. For example, you could say, ""I really enjoy trying new types of cuisine. Do you have any favorite restaurants around here?"" This is a question that most people would have an answer to.
While it's a great idea to think about interesting things to talk about, resist the urge to plan out exactly what you will say. This will probably come across as overly scripted and awkward. You may also be caught off guard if the other person does not respond exactly the way you expected.

, Body language is extremely important, and the better you understand it, the more confident you will feel in social situations. Paying attention to body language will help you determine when it is appropriate to approach someone and when it is time to end a conversation.If a person is running around or has his hands full it's probably best not to approach him, unless of course you're offering to give him a hand.
If a person is disengaging from the group by reading, listening to music, or staying away from everyone else, there is a good chance that person does not want to be bothered.
If a person you are talking to is fidgeting, turning away from you, or not responding to you, it may be a sign that you should end the conversation or change the topic.
If a person is not returning your eye contact, it may indicate that he does not want to talk., The more approachable you look, the better your chances are that someone will strike up a conversation with you. Make sure your body language communicates that you are friendly and open to meeting new people.Make eye contact and acknowledge the other people in the room. Avoid looking at your phone or turning away from the crowd. Keep a lookout for people who return your eye contact, and be sure to smile at them.
Uncross your arms and legs.
Smiling, tilting your head, and raising your eyebrows slightly are all subtle cues that you are friendly and approachable., If no one has approached you to make conversation, you might have to take the first step. Depending on where you are and who else is there, you might approach someone who you have met in the past or a complete stranger.


If you have met the person before, even if your interaction was very brief, ask a follow-up question to show that you remember your last conversation. For example, you could say something like, ""I think you were moving when we last met. How's your new apartment?""
If you have not met the person before but have something in common, like a shared acquaintance, use this knowledge to break the ice. For example, you could say, ""Hi, you're Tom, right? My name is Jill. I heard that you've known my friend Jane for a long time.""If you are in a business situation, simply introduce yourself and tell the person what it is you do for work. The person will likely respond in the same way. If you want to continue the conversation, you can begin to talk about any career similarities you may share or ask for an opinion based on the person's professional expertise.Regardless of the situation, you can always strike up a conversation with someone by talking about any kind of shared experience, whether it is the school you both go to, a person you both know, or even the event you are both attending., If there's someone specific that you want to talk to at a social event and you're too nervous to introduce yourself, try asking someone else to do it. Depending on the situation, you could ask the host of the event to introduce you, or maybe a mutual acquaintance.

, A lot of people are absolutely terrified of the idea of starting a conversation with a complete stranger on the bus or at a cafe. This is probably because people assume that other people do not want to be bothered. In fact, recent studies show that most people are in a better mood after having a conversation with a stranger, so there's really no reason to be scared at all!The best way to get more comfortable talking to strangers is to do it all the time, whether it's with someone you're romantically interested in or just the person in front on you in line at the grocery store. The more you do it, the easier it will become, so don't worry if it doesn't always go well.If you know absolutely nothing about the person you're talking to, start the conversation by commenting on the weather or something else in your shared environment, like the nice renovation that was just done at the grocery store you're in, for example. You can also try asking for a simple opinion, like, ""What kind of fruit do you think I should buy to go with chocolate cake?"" or offering a compliment, such as, ""I like your coat. Where did you get it?"", Small talk may seem boring and uncomfortable, but it's a great way to learn some basic information about the people who you're talking to. Once you know a little bit more about the person, the conversation can begin to grow and develop.For example, you can start a conversation with someone by making small talk about hobbies. If the person mentions a hobby that you happen to share, you can begin a more in-depth conversation about it. While the small talk might have been awkward, you never would have learned that you shared a hobby without it.

, If you just want to be social and get to know people, you can let the conversation develop naturally. If, however, you want someone to talk to you about something specific, you will need to steer the conversation in the right direction.


Don't skip introductions and small talk, even if you have a specific purpose. The person will be more willing to talk to you if you come across as friendly and polite. Make sure to show some interest in how he is doing before you get to the purpose of your conversation.
Make sure the person you want to talk to has enough time to talk about the topic. If the topic you want to talk about is private in any way, be sure the setting is appropriate as well.
If you are not able to have the entire conversation, consider approaching the person, making some pleasant small talk, and then mentioning that you would really like to talk to him about something specific when he has a chance. Give the person a business card or exchange contact information so you can continue the conversation in the future.

, Let the person you are talking to know that you are interested in the conversation by continuing to make eye contact. If you are constantly looking in other directions, he might think you don't want to talk to him., People will want to talk to you if you show interest in their lives and what they have to say. Show them you want to get to know them by taking the time to listen closely and asking them to tell you more.If you're just getting to know a person, ask lots of questions about her work, her family, and her interests.Ask open-ended questions. The person might be shy, or just not a good conversationalist, so asking if she likes sushi could shut the conversation down with a simple yes or no, while asking what she thinks of this new sushi restaurant that you both happen to be sitting in is a path to a longer answer and more in-depth conversation. Good examples of open-ended questions are those that start with, ""What do you think of...,"" ""What's your opinion on...,"" or ""Why do you think...""Frame your responses in reference to the other person, not yourself. For example, if the person tells you about his busy schedule, say, ""So you must not have much time to just relax, then,"" instead of ""I know what it's like to not have any down time.""You can also show that you are attentive and interested by interjecting with affirmative phrases, like ""Uh-huh"" or ""Wow"" while the other person is telling a story.

, In addition to avoiding any controversial topics, you should also steer clear of talking about anything that might be a sore subject for your conversation partner. It's not always possible to predict this, but if you listen carefully, you may be able to avoid some blunders.For example, if the person says he was recently divorced, you should probably avoid talking about anything having to do with relationships. Instead, try to steer the conversation in a more positive direction.

, If you want people to enjoy talking to you, you need to make sure you have the right energy. Even if you're not feeling very positive, remember that the people you have just met do not want to hear about your complaints.Remember to keep smiling throughout the conversation. Laugh when it's appropriate.
If you can't think of anything positive to talk about, ask the other person an open-ended question like, ""What are you planning to do this summer?""
It's okay to talk about serious subjects in certain contexts. If, for example, someone who you both know is in the hospital, it is fine to mention that you are sad for her and you hope she will be better soon. Just try not to dwell on gloomy subjects, or people will be unlikely to want to keep talking to you.

, Whether you're trying to make friends or business connections, it's important that the people you are talking to get some sense of who you are. If you make an impression on them, they will be much more likely to talk to you the next time you see each other. Be wary, however, of oversharing details about your personal life or going on and on about your opinions.If you start to feel like you are dominating the conversation, look for a way that you can redirect it towards the other person. Try asking something like, ""What is your opinion on this?"" or ""How are things at your job?""
When you do talk about yourself, be sure to be humble. Even if you've done something amazing, no one wants to hear you brag about it.

, If someone isn't interested in talking to you, try not to take it personally. The person may be distracted or may have had a terrible day, so it might have nothing to do with you. If you walk away with a smile, you show class and confidence, but still leave the door open to talk to that person at another time or place if you need to., When you're ready to end a conversation, it is polite to thank the person for her time or express that you enjoyed talking with her. If you won't be leaving the event, give a reason for ending the conversation. You can say something like, ""I've really enjoyed meeting you, but I just saw someone I need to talk to. Maybe we can continue this conversation later,"" or ""I'm going to go get some food. It was so nice meeting you."""

Know a little random knowledge.,
Don't cuss.,
Don't assume that, because a geek spends 4+ hours on a computer daily, can Photoshop stuff, uses good grammar and has a 70 wpm typing speed, that they can't socially interact.,
Don't assume that glasses/braces=geek.,
If the geek is busy, don't interrupt.,
Geeks are human.,
If you want to befriend a geek or friend-friend a geek, this is fine too.,
BE NICE.",How to Interact With Geeks (and Appear Intelligent to Them)," Stuff like ""It is socially unacceptable to blow your nose in Japan but OK to pick it""... that fascinates geeks, who trade the facts around like bubble gum.;
, Please. This should go without saying but doesn't. It makes you sound like a dweeb by a geek's OR nerd's definition, and they'll avoid you. This says something, because geeks are usually pretty easygoing unless you're mean to them.

, The reason you don't see geeks chatting away with five people at once all the time is that they don't want or need to--not that they can't or are too shy to.

, Or nerd. Geeks and nerds are very proud of their intellect and unusual hobbies. There are a lot of idiots in this world who wear glasses or braces, and geeks and nerds hate to be associated with them. Possession of glasses or braces doesn't relate to geekiness at all, and having them doesn't magically cause a person to become a geek. Sometimes people even make efforts not to become a geek when they get glasses because they are afraid of being an outcast.

, If you're at school, don't EVER talk to a geek who is in the middle of a project, even if they talk to you first or continue talking while working on the __________. They're most likely doing this to be nice, because people don't seem to like being ignored in the middle of a conversation. Geeks do not like to be nagged to go somewhere the night before a test, especially finals for high schoolers. Ask once--they may have studied already, which is common--but tell them that you understand if they're studying and won't be hurt if they decline. (It had better be true.) Grades matter to geeks.

, You can invite them to stuff. It's OK.

, Don't expect a huge amount of conversation, because a lot of geeks are introverted as opposed to extroverted (they like to be by themselves). Some geeks only date other geeks, but most are very open to other people as long as the ""other people"" are intelligent. Some geeks may not want a boyfriend/girlfriend, because it draws a lot of attention, or because they're just not into romance. If you are rejected by a geek, it may not be an issue with you. In fact, it most likely isn't.

, Just like you are with everyone else. Geeks are humans. They have feelings, goals, and often a huge ego. They have their own likes and dislikes, and that set of likes/dislikes isn't shared by all geeks. Geeks are not something you watch in a natural habitat on Discovery, n'est-ce pas? They are people.

Be friendly and kind to everyone you meet.,
Present yourself nicely.,
Be your own self.,
Be more social.,
Be super kind and thoughtful of others.,
Do what is right.,
Join a sport or school club.,
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.,
Add everyone you know on Facebook.,
Stay in your comfort zone.",How to Get Friends and Become Popular," Show all people from the outset that you are really interested in what they do and who they are. People who see this behavior and recognize your kindness will be more likely to want to be your friend when they realize that your good nature could be a part of their lives for all times.
, This is simply part of the deal, looking nice and not scaring people off with clothing statements that confront people. Wear nice clothing that reflects the person you are. Keep it neat, clean and inoffensive. A little modesty is fine, although you'll also be keen to show off your athletic or well maintained self too, so find a decent balance.


Do the usual things to maintain good hygiene. Ask your parents for help if you've failed to adopt decent hygiene standards by this time in your life.

Be stylish without being a slave to fashion. Always have a flair that identifies the clothing you're wearing as your style. This might be done by the way you wear the clothes or the accessories that you add to them. Don't obsess over this though; being a good person trumps being a fashion victim.


, When people see that you are a leader and not a follower, they will respect that and respect the fact that you're not going to conform to other standards.

, Talk to people you don't know and ask them about their day. This will always catch their attention because they won't expect it. Smile at and greet everyone, even those you vaguely know. When you see people down the halls at school, or at work, just put on a quick smile and wave. This will tell people you are friendly and they may want to get to know you more.

, Keep your bad ruminations to yourself and avoid being a gossip. Nothing good comes of demoting other people in your mind and even less good comes from making it vocal.


Never bad mouth anyone! If you say mean things about any person, the person you are telling this to will automatically think that you also badmouth him/her. And it's very likely you will! Just get yourself out of any such bad habit.
Don't be a bully. Compliment people and tell them they are really cool to hang around with.
Don't get involved in other people's business. They might not want you in their business and won't want to talk to you.







, Don't rebel your way to the top, always do what is right people will respect you for that. If you're intelligent, or you're especially good at a particular skill, show it rather than hiding it. However, don't be a nerd or raise your hand to answer every question; remember to let others have their turn too. Never forget to do your homework, and don't talk back to the teacher. Most of all, don't get in too much trouble, and know when to back down.

, This will get more people to know you. Cheerleading, football, and other sports are fun, good exercise, and help to get a lot of friends.
, Be nice to the people who really don't like you, unless you absolutely can't bear them.

, Talk to anyone who you would consider a friend. Be fun, but if it gets awkward, make an excuse to leave.
, Don't date or hang around with people you don't like. People will think you're a player or just plain fake.

Don’t over-think your friendship.",How to Get Closer to Your Friends That Are Girls1," What hobbies do they have? Find something that you all have in common and connect through it.;
, Spend time together without anyone else interrupting you. Watch a movie, make dinner together, or just hang out. Savor the time you guys have alone.

, Asking for advice will show that you trust your friends, and they’ll likely return the sentiment. Be careful not to go overboard, though. You don’t want to seem clingy or whiny.

, The stress and excitement of being in a new place will give you a unique experience that you can reminisce about for years to come. Spending time together in that environment will bring you closer together.

, Help each other pick out clothes, bags, shoes, and accessories. Girls love doing that sort of thing and giving each other opinions. You can have a good old giggle too.

, You’ll be able to talk in detail about the date if it goes well, and you’ll be there for each other if it doesn’t.


Alternatively, or in addition, set each other up with blind dates. Debrief afterwards

, This will give you something in common and help you to relate to each other.

, Put your friends first—if one of them needs to talk, call or go over to her house as soon as you possibly can. Let them know that you’re someone to rely on and someone who will always be there for them.

, The fastest way to kill a friendship is to spread rumors or talk behind your friend’s backs. If they tell you a secret, keep it a secret. Even if the fact that it’s a secret isn’t explicitly stated, be sensitive to what’s private and what’s not.

, Let it flow naturally. It will keep the friendship from being forced.

Talk to them.,
Ask her for advice.,
Have fun with her.,
Tease her when she gets too serious.,
Help her when she needs it.,
Treat her like a girl.",How to Get Closer to Your Friends That Are Girls2," Girls love to talk, and talking will help you get to know each other. Most girls appreciate a conversation much more than they appreciate playing video games with you.

, Asking for advice will show that you trust your friends, and they’ll likely return the sentiment. Be careful not to go overboard, though. You don’t want to seem clingy or whiny. Start with something small, if she responds well then you can keep going.

, Treat her like one of the guys! Include her in activities, even if it is something stereotypically “boys only,” like Poker Night.

, Don’t go overboard - if she is really upset, teasing her will make her feel like you don’t care about her problems. However, if she is working too hard or seems lost in thought, tease her gently or tell a joke to pull her out of it and lighten the mood.

, Teasing isn’t the only answer when she gets too serious—sometimes she’ll actually need someone to help her out, be it on her English essay or coping with a death.

, Show that you still realize that she’s a girl. Don’t act like you don’t notice her feminine side or treat her exactly the same as you treat your male friends.


Flirt a little. Don’t go overboard—you don’t want her to think you like her, but a little bit of flirting is effective, especially at the beginning of a relationship.
Give her compliments. They don’t have to be big or super frequent, but a couple will help boost her self esteem.

Open the Library folder on your hard drive.,
Find the video file.,
Rename the extension.",How to Download YouTube Videos on a Mac (Chrome Method)," This method involves using Google's browser, which requires you to run Mac OSX 10.6 or later.

A video file will be sizable, somewhere between 20-40MB for an HD video, depending on the length and quality. When you've located your video file, right click, copy the file and paste it onto your desktop.


Check the size of the video in YouTube under the gear icon in the lower right corner of the video to give you some indication of the size. A 20 minute video in HD720p, for example, will be sizable. As you're scrolling, you can eliminate everything under 10MB very quickly until you find the file.

, To open the file in Quicktime or other video players, you'll need to rename the extension by clicking on the file name and adding .mp4 to the end. A window will pop up, asking if you want to add the extension. Click yes and rename the video something convenient so you'll recognize it. Then double-click on the file to play it.
