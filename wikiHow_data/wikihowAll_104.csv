For example, if you're trying to delete a picture or a text file, you will likely want to look in the default ""Documents"" folder, which typically holds those file types.


If you don't know where your file is, type its name into the Start search bar, right-click the file when it pops up, and click Open file location to go directly to the file.;
, Doing so will make the deletion process easier as you won't have to change the deletion location from within Command Prompt.


The exception to this rule is if you're trying to delete a file from the ""System32"" folder, which is Windows' system files folder. If that's the case, leave your file there.

, This will prompt a drop-down menu.

, It's at the bottom of the drop-down menu.

, The file's extension is listed near the top of the ""General"" tab in the ""Properties"" window, to the right of the ""Type of file:"" text. You'll need to know your file's extension in order to delete it using Command Prompt. Common extensions include the following:



.txt - Text files (files made in Notepad).

.docx - Microsoft Word files.

.jpg or .png - Picture files.

.mov, .wmv, .mp4 - Video files.

.mp3, .wav - Sound files.

.exe - Executable files (e.g., a setup file).

.lnk - Shortcut files. Deleting a shortcut will not remove the attached program from your computer.

, Once you know the file extension, you're ready to open and use Command Prompt.

, In this case, you'll want to avoid the ""Administrator"" (or ""Admin"") version of Command Prompt unless you're deleting a file in the ""System32"" folder. You can open Command Prompt in a variety of ways depending on your version of Windows:


Hold down ⊞ Win and press X, then click Command Prompt above the Start button.
Right-click the Start button in the bottom-left corner of the screen, then click Command Prompt in the pop-up window.
Type ""Command Prompt"" into the Start menu search bar (for Windows 8, hover your mouse in the top-right corner of the screen and click the magnifying glass), then click the ""Command Prompt"" icon when it appears.
Open the ""Run"" app from the Start menu, type in ""cmd"", and click OK.

, Doing so will change the location (or ""directory"") in Command Prompt to your desktop.


There are other ways you can change the Command Prompt directory if need be.
Opening Command Prompt in ""Administrator"" mode will change the directory to the ""System32"" file. For this reason, do not open Command Prompt in ""Administrator"" unless your file is in the ""System32"" folder.

, Replace ""filename.filetype"" with your file's actual name and extension.


For example, a picture file named ""icecream"" would become icecream.png, a text file named ""notes"" would become notes.txt, and so on.
For files with spaces in their names, place quotation marks around the entire file name: ""I like turtles.jpg"" instead of I_like_turtles.jpg or similar.
To delete all files on your desktop that share the same extension (e.g., all text files), type *.filetype where ""filetype"" is the extension (e.g., *.txt).

, You will see a new, blank line appear in Command Prompt. Your file is now gone.


Since the ""del"" command removes files directly from your hard drive, you won't need to delete the file again from the Recycling Bin.

When you run the Windows 2000 Server Setup program, you have to provide information about how to install and configure the operating system.,
Here are some of the most important things you should take into consideration when planning for your Windows Server 2000 installation:


Check your System Requirements
Check the Hardware and Software Compatibility
Determine its Disk Partitioning Options
Choose one of the Appropriate File System: FAT, FAT32, NTFS
Decide on a Workgroup or a Domain Installation
Complete a Pre-Installation Checklist

,
After you made sure you can go on, you can now start the installation process!

,
You can install the Windows 2000 Server in several different methods.,
Manual installations usually come in 3 flavors:

,
•Boot from a CD.,
•Boot from the 4 Setup Boot Disks, then insert the CD.,
•Boot from an MS-DOS startup floppy, go to the command prompt, create a 4GB FAT32 partition with FDISK, reboot, format the C partition you've created, then go to the CD drive, go into the I386 folder, and then run the WINNT.EXE command.

,
•You can run an already installed OS, such as Windows NT 4.0 Server.,
If you want to upgrade some desktop OS such as Windows 98 into Windows 2000 Professional, you can just follow the same procedure as above (However, you cannot upgrade Windows 98 into W2K Server).,
The setup process begins loading a blue-looking text screen (not GUI).,
Start the computer from the CD.

,
You can press F6 if you need to install additional SCSI adapters or other mass-storage devices.,
Setup will load all the needed files and drivers.

,
Select To Setup W2K Now.,
In case your server is a new one, or it is using a new hard disk that hasn't been partitioned yet, you'll get a warning message.,
Read and accept the licensing agreement and press F8 if you accept it.

,
Select or create the partition on which you will install W2K.,
•If the hard disk is not yet partitioned, you can create and size the partition on which you will install Windows 2000.,
•If the hard disk is new and you want to create a partition that will span the entire hard disk's size - press Enter.

,
•If the hard disk is already partitioned, but has enough unpartitioned disk space, you can create an additional partition in the unpartitioned space.

,
•If the hard disk already has a partition that is large enough, you can install Windows 2000 on that partition.,
•If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to create more unpartitioned space for the new partition.,
If you select a new partition during Setup, create and size only the partition on which you will install Windows 2000.,
Select a file system for the installation partition.,
Setup will then begin copying necessary files from the installation point (CD, local I386 or network share).

,
Note: If you began the installation process from an MS-DOS floppy, make sure you have and run SMARTDRV from the floppy, otherwise the copying process will probably last more than an hour, perhaps even more.,
The computer will restart in graphical mode, and the installation will continue.

,
The setup process reboots and loads a GUI mode phase.

,
It will then begin to load device drivers based upon what it finds on your computer.,
If your computer stops responding during this phase (the progress bar is stuck almost half-way, and there is no disk activity) - shut down your computer and begin removing hardware such as PCI and ISA cards.,
Click Customize to change regional settings, if necessary.

,
•Current System Locale - Affects how programs display dates, times, currency, and numbers.,
•Current Keyboard Layout - Accommodates the special characters and symbols used in different languages.,
If you don't need to make any changes just press Next.

,
If you do need to make changes press Customize and add your System Locale etc.

,
Note for Hebrew users: In W2K it is NOT SAFE to install Hebrew language support at this phase!,
Read the Install Hebrew on Windows 2000 page for more info.

,
Type your name and organization.

,
Type the product key.

,
Enter the appropriate license type and number of purchased licenses.

,
Type the computer name and a password for the local Administrator account.,
Choose which components to install or remove from the system.

,
Select the date, time, and time zone settings.

,
Setup will now install the networking components.

,
After a few seconds you will receive the Networking Settings window.,
Press Next to accept the Typical settings option if you have one of the following situations:


You have a functional DHCP on your network.,
Highlight the TCP/IP selection and press Properties.

,
In the General tab enter the required information.,
In the Workgroup or Domain window enter the name of your workgroup or domain.,
To successfully join a domain you need the following:


The person performing the installation must have a user account in Active Directory.,
Also, you need to have connectivity to the domain's domain controllers (only to the PDC if on an NT 4.0 domain) and a fully functional DNS server (only in AD domains).,
Enter the Active Directory domain name (in the form of xxx.yyy, for example: DPETRI.NET) or the NetBIOS name of the NT 4.0 domain (in the form of xxx, for example: DPETRI).,
A username/password window will appear.,
Next the setup process will finish copying files and configuring the setup.,
After the copying and configuring phase is finished, if Windows Server 2003 finds that you have a badly configured screen resolution it will advise you to change it and ask you if you see the new settings right.

,
Setup finishes and displays the finish window.,
Windows 2000 reboots and you should get the CTRL-ALT-DEL window.

,
That's it!",How to Install Windows 2000 Server," Thorough planning will make your installation of W2K more efficient. An understanding of the configuration options will also help to ensure that you have properly configured your system.;
,,, They are all valid, so it all depends upon your needs and your limitations.

,, No existing partition is required.

, No existing partition is required.

,, From within NT 4.0, go to the I386 folder in your W2K installation CD and run the WINNT32.EXE command.

,


It doesn't matter how you run the setup process, but the moment it runs - all setup methods look alike.

, In that phase you will be asked to accept the EULA and choose a partition on which to install W2K, and if that partition is new, you'll be asked to format it by using either FAT, FAT32 or NTFS.

,, If you do you will be asked to supply a floppy disk with the drivers and you CANNOT browse it (or a CD for that matter). Make sure you have one handy.

,, If you want, and if you have a previous installation of the OS, you can try to fix it by pressing R. If not, just press ENTER.

, Read it, and if you want to continue, press C.

,, Depending upon your existing disk configuration choose one of the following:

, Press C.

,,, If the partition has an existing operating system, you will overwrite that operating system if you accept the default installation path. However, files other than the operating system files, such as program files and data files, will not be overwritten.

, Deleting an existing partition erases all data on that partition.

, After installation, use Disk Management to partition the remaining space on the hard disk.

, After you create the partition on which you will install W2K, you can use Setup to select the file system with which to format the partition. W2K supports the NTFS file system in addition to the file allocation table (FAT) and FAT32 file systems. Windows Server 2003, Windows XP Professional, Windows 2000, and Windows NT are the only Microsoft operating systems that you can use to gain access to data on a local hard disk that is formatted with NTFS. If you plan to gain access to files that are on a local W2K partition with the Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows 98 operating systems, you should format the partition with a FAT or FAT32 file system. We will use NTFS.

,, With SMARTDRV (or if setup was run by booting from CD) the copying will probably last a few minutes, no more than 5 max.

,,, You don't need to do anything at this stage.

, If it works for you then later try to figure out how to make that specific piece of hardware work (it's probably not in the HCL).

,, Choose the locale that matches your location, for example, French (Canada).

, Your keyboard layout determines which characters appear when you press keys on the keyboard.

,,, Failure to adhere to this could result in ""????"" fonts appearing instead of words on programs such as some Microsoft Office applications such as, but not limited to, Microsoft Outlook.

,,,,, The local Administrator account resides in the SAM of the computer, not in Active Directory. If you will be installing in a domain, you need either a pre-assigned computer name for which a domain account has been created, or the right to create a computer account within the domain.

,,,, BTW, if you have a NIC that is not in the HCL (see the What's the HCL? page) and W2K cannot detect it, or if you don't have a NIC at all, setup will skip this step and you will immediately go to the final phase of the setup process.

,
You have a computer running Internet Connection Sharing (ICS).
You're in a workgroup environment and do not plan to have any other servers or Active Directory at all, and all other workgroup members are configured in the same manner.
Otherwise select Custom Settings and press Next to customize your network settings.







,, You must specify the IP address of the computer, and if you don't know what the Subnet Mask entry should be - you can simply place your mouse pointer over the empty area in the Subnet Mask box and click it. The OS will automatically select the value it thinks is good for the IP address you provided.

,


A workgroup is a small group of computers on a network that enables users to work together and does not support centralized administration.
A domain is a logical grouping of computers on a network that has a central security database for storing security information. Centralized security and administration are important for computers in a domain because they enable an administrator to easily manage computers that are geographically distant from each other.
A domain is administered as a unit with common rules and procedures. Each domain has a unique name, and each computer within a domain has a unique name.
If you're a stand-alone computer, or if you don't know what to enter, or if you don't have the sufficient rights to join a domain - leave the default entry selected and press Next.
If you want to join a domain (NT 4.0 domain of W2K/2003 Active Directory domain) enter the domain's name in the ""Yes, make this computer a member of the following domain"" box.

, This account does not need to be the domain Administrator account.

The computer must have an existing computer account in the Active Directory database of the domain that the computer is joining, and the computer must be named exactly as its domain account is named.

The person performing the installation must have appropriate permission to create a domain account for the computer during installation.





, Read the Joining a Domain in Windows XP Pro and Requirements when Joining a Domain pages for more on this issue.

, Press Next.

, Enter the name and password of the domain's administrator (or your own if you're the administrator on the target domain).

, You do not need to do anything.

,, Unfortunately, you must press Finish in order to reboot..

,, you're done!


Now you are finally finished!

Partition - This is a segment of the hard disk that is set aside and acts like separate physical hard drive. Each partition can have it's own file system and operating systems can be installed on them.
Volume - While ""partition"" and ""volume"" are used fairly interchangeably, there is a small but important difference. The ""partition"" is the space on the disk that is set aside, while the volume is the file system on the partition that makes it act like a separate disk.
Logical drive - This is a partition that can store data like normal, but cannot be used to boot an operating system. Each disk can support three primary (boot) partitions, and then all subsequent partitions are created as logical drives.

, While this process shouldn't affect your data, it's always a good idea to have a fresh back up of all your important files when making changes to the partitions. Click here for some ways to quickly back up your data before you begin.

Open the Disk Management utility.,
Select drive and volume that you want to shrink.,
Right-click on the volume and select ""Shrink Volume"".,
Select how much space you want to shrink the volume by.,
Find the new unallocated space.,
I get an error message when trying to open Disk Management.,
I want to undo the Shrink Volume process and add it back to the original drive.,
I can only select a small portion of my free space.,
My hard drive is advertised as being X big, but I have less space than that.",How to Create a Partition in Windows 72," This tool will, among its many features, allow you to shrink one of your existing volumes so that you can use that space to create a new partition. For example, if you have a drive with 200 GB of free space, you can shrink it so that the extra space is available to create a new 100 GB partition while leaving 100 GB of free space on the original volume. If you are creating partitions on a newly-installed drive, click here.


The quickest way to open Disk Management is to click the Start menu, type diskmgmt.msc, and press ↵ Enter.
You can also open the Control Panel, select ""System and Security"" and then ""Administrative Tools"", double-click ""Computer Management"", and then select ""Disk Management"".;
, When selecting a volume to shrink, keep in mind that it's always a good idea to keep about 20% free space on each of your volumes. This is especially important for the volume containing Windows 7.


For example, if you have a volume on your computer that is 100 GB in size and has 30% of its space free, you'll only be able to shrink it by 10 GB if you want to keep 20% free on the original volume. This may not be worth creating a new partition, so you'll want to pick another volume to shrink.

, You can right-click the volume in the list at the top or in the diagram in the lower portion.

, The space is measured in megabytes (MB), where one gigabyte (GB) is equal to 1024 MB. Keep in mind the 20% guideline. Click the Shrink button when you're satisfied.


Note that you may not be able to select all of the available space, as Windows allocates some of this for unmovable files. This can cause problems if these files are located in the ""middle"" of the free space, because you will only be able to shrink from the ""right side"" of the unmovable block. This can significantly reduce the amount of space available for shrinking, and then only way around it is by using special tools.
If you get a ""Convert to Dynamic disks?"" prompt, do not accept. Dynamic disks can cause Windows to not boot. You will need to use a partition tool to shrink your volume.

, Shrinking the volume will create ""Unallocated"" space equal to the amount it was shrunk by. This space cannot be used until it is turned into a volume and formatted. See the next section for details., This is usually caused because the Disk Defragmenter service has been disabled.


Click the Start menu, type services.msc, and press ↵ Enter.
Double-click ""Disk Defragmenter"" in the list of services.
Change ""Startup Type"" to ""Manual"".
Reopen Disk Management

, If you aren't satisfied with the amount you shrunk the volume, or you change your mind, you can add it back to the original volume as free space. You can only do this before you format it; if it's been formatted it will need to be deleted first.


Right-click on the original volume to the left of the newly-created unallocated space in the drive diagram.
Select ""Extend Volume"". Follow the prompts to add the space back. Usually your unallocated space will be automatically selected, but you may need to manually select it if there are multiple options available for extending the volume.

, This is caused by unmovable files preventing you from shrinking the drive. You can try defragmenting the hard drive to see if Windows can move them, otherwise you'll need to use a partition tool like GParted or Partition Magic to create your partition.

, Advertised space is not the same as space available, as hard drive manufacturers use a different definition of a gigabyte than Windows does. For example, a hard drive advertised as 500 GB will actually be about 465 GB in Windows.

, You can only create partitions from unallocated or free space on a drive. Newly-installed drives are typically all unallocated space.


Note that Windows 7 supports a maximum of four primary partitions on a single hard drive. Primary partitions act as independent hard drives, and can have operating systems installed on them. After the third primary partition, the fourth partition created will be an ""extended"" primary partition. This extended partition can then hold up to 128 ""logical drives"". Logical drives can be formatted for regular use, but cannot load operating systems., This will open the New Volume wizard.

, The total amount of available space will be displayed. By default, it should be set to create the maximum size.

, This is what will be used for the drive's file system. By default, Windows will select the next available drive letter for your system.

, There really isn't any reason to select FAT or FAT32 as the file system unless you are using the drive for legacy programs like MS-DOS. For regular Windows use or for sharing the drive on a network, select ""NTFS"".


If you're planning on installing another operating system on this drive later, you can select ""Do not format this volume"", as the operating system installation process will take care of that.

, You should only uncheck this if you suspect that your hard drive is suffering from errors.

, Review your formatting choices and then click Finish. Wait while the drive is formatted. Depending on the size, this could take a little while.


If you get a message ""The operation selected will convert the disk to dynamic... are you sure you want to continue?"", click No. This will likely keep Windows from booting properly.

, Once the format is complete, a window will open displaying the contents of your new volume. It will be empty for now, but you can start putting files on it immediately.



Click here for some guides on installing an operating system on your new partition.

Click here for instructions on setting up the new partition as a network drive.

, Windows will create your new partition as a logical drive if you already have three primary partitions on the disk. Logical drives can be used for storage and for installing applications, but they cannot be used to boot an operating system.


The only way around this is to remove one of your existing primary partitions, or to purchase another physical hard drive.
Most Recovery partitions installed by your computer's manufacturer will take up one of the primary partition slots.

, Unfortunately the only way to fix this is to reinstall Windows 7. Click here for instructions. If you have data that you need to recovery, click here.

, If you already have three primary partitions on your drive, and you have a logical partition to the right of the unallocated space, you won't be able to create a partition from that unallocated space. You will need to shrink the logical partition in order to create a new partition in the unallocated space."

Now shut down your PC and connect the new hard drive to the SATA cable of the old hard drive (If Windows won't start try to fix MBR by booting from Windows installation CD and using the repair function)


Windows should now start as nothing has been changed






If your new hard drive was bigger than the old one you will see that a partition has been made of the exact size of your old drive/partition.",How to Copy Windows 7 Image to Another Hard Drive With Ubuntu (Live Cd),",,,,


If you now start the command ""sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdc"" Ubuntu will start to copy the image of drive sda to drive sdc (all date on drive sdc will be lost). It starts directly after you start the command and it does not give you any information that it has started or how the status is.

Check the network connection.,
Check the NIC port's indicator light.,
Check the router.",How to Ping on Mac OS2," If you receive the ping report ping: cannot resolve example.com: Unknown host, it usually means that the you have misspelled the host name. Try another host name like “example.com”. If that reports “Unknown host,” then the problem is most likely the address of the domain name server.

, If the problem is the address of the domain name server, ping using the host’s IP address instead of its name (e.g., 192.0.32.10). If this is successful then either the address you are using for the domain name server is incorrect or it is unreachable or down.


If you receive the ping report ping: sendto: No route to host, this may mean the address of the gateway is incorrect or that the connection from your computer is not up and running.

, Ping 127.0.0.1 This is the IP address of your own computer. If this fails, the network configuration or the NIC (Network Interface Card) may be bad. Replace the NIC or add a new one.

, If you are connected directly to your router, check the cable from your computer to your router, especially if the connection worked previously. If the Ethernet cable came loose, it could be causing the connection to fail.


If you are connecting wirelessly, ensure that you are properly connected to the network, and that the correct security password has been entered.

, Most computer NIC ports have an indicator light that indicates a good connection and one that blinks as data is transferred. As the ping command transmits packets at about 1 per second, you should be able to see the data light blink.

, Check that the router’s indicator light is lighting up properly (and no faults), including the one that indicates a good connection to your computer. If a fault indicator is on, follow the cable from your computer to the router to make sure it is properly connected, then call your cable or broadband provider if necessary.

Check the Bluetooth connection issues.",How to Set a Default Sound Device on Windows 7," Before continuing forward, make sure that your sound device in plugged in properly (headphones, speakers, etc.)

If you are plugging in a sound device for the first time, you may need to make sure that the proper device drivers have been installed before continuing on to the next step.;
, Press and hold the Windows key, then press R. This should open a small box in the lower left-hand corner of your screen. Inside the given field, type or copy in “control mmsys.cpl”. This should open the Sound Devices page in a new window.

, Inside the new window, there should be at least one option listed. If you don’t see your device in this list, you will need to make sure that the device is plugged in properly and has the correct drivers installed. Inside the large white box, you should see an icon on the left-hand side. To the right of it should be 3 different lines describing the device. The top line is for the device type (speakers, headphones, digital output, etc.). The line under it will be the device brand name (example: Gioteck EX-05 Headset). The final description is important because this will say if the device is currently set as the default sound device. If it is, it should say “Default Device.” Once you know which device you would like to make the default, continue to the next step.

, Right-click on the device you would like to make the default. This will bring up a context menu. The fourth option down on the list should be “Set as Default Device.” Click this to select the device. The device you have chosen will now have a green circle with a white checkmark in the middle of it. This is now your default sound device.


Alternatively, left-clicking on one of the devices should activate a button on the bottom of the window that says “Set Default.” Click this to set the device as default.

, If you are running a wired headset, you may need to unplug the USB or MIC being used and plug it back in. If this doesn’t work, try plugging the device into a different USB port. If you are using a 3.5mm jack, you will want to make sure that it is pushed in all the way, and that there is no dust inside the port itself.

Note that it is a good idea to make sure that you are cleaning out your ports regularly with a compressed air can, for best performance.

, If you are connecting a device to your Windows device for the first time, you should hear a sound that plays when the device is plugged in. If you hear this sound, Windows should automatically start downloading you device drivers. If it does not do this, you will need to look up your particular device online to find the specific drivers.


Alternatively, your connected device could have come with a disc that contains its drivers. Check the connected devices box or manual for specific instructions for how or where to download these.

, Many times, users will simply pair their particular Bluetooth device with their PC and think that is all that is needed. However, if the PC has built-in speakers, or any other sound equipment is currently connected, you will have multiple devices listed in your sound settings. After you pair your Bluetooth device to the Windows PC, you still need to use the Sound Device menu to select it as your default sound device.

Low-Power Audio: Windows 7 will support the latest Intel HD Audio low-power specification, which introduces a new power state known as D3Cold to Dell Latitude D820 Battery.,
Timer Coalescing: Modern processors reduce power consumption by taking advantage of idle time between executing instructions, but many PPM technologies require a minimum amount of idle time before obtaining any net-power savings.",How to Save Battery Life in Windows 7," Idle efficiency in Windows 7 is improved by reducing resource utilization and enabling hardware to go into lower power states during long periods of battery inactivity. This includes the processor, disk, memory, and network activity on the computer. To demonstrate just how much power can be saved, CPUs consume nearly 0 watts when idle, but up to 35 watts at full power.;
, In Windows 7, certain services are only started when triggered by an event such as device insertion or an IP change. This makes it unnecessary to have services starting all the time and reduces the amount of background processes, then reducing your Dell D5318 battery.

, PPM allows Windows 7 to choose the appropriate processor performance state depending on the load and scale performance accordingly.

, Often times however, there are shorter periods of inactivity in between. To save additional power, ADB defines will allow dimming the display. ADB can also utilize hardware sensor technology to adjust display brightness accordingly to ambient light.

, This is the lowest unresponsive power state that a codec can go into. It can also further conserve power when an audio device is not in use. Windows 7 also supports selective suspend technology that extends to USB audio-class devices such as microphones and web-cams.

, Timer Coalescing increases the average idle period by letting the Windows kernel combine periodic software activity.

Set up your TV's preferences.",How to Share a Mac Screen2," An HDMI cable is a high-definition connector that allows you to hook devices such as computers, consoles, and receivers up to your TV. If you don't have an HDMI cable, you can buy a high-quality one from most technology stores or Amazon for under $20.

If you have an HDTV, it probably has an HDMI input.
Your Mac should have an HDMI port on the right side; if you have a recent model of Mac, it should say ""HDMI"" next to the port.

, Make sure the cable is facing the right way--e.g., the smaller part of the cable end is on the bottom.

If your Mac doesn't have an HDMI cable, you'll need to purchase an adaptor. In this case, you'll need a ""Thunderbolt to HDMI"" adaptor to plug into the left side of your Mac.

, Your TV's HDMI slot will look like your computer's., You'll have to set your TV's current channel to an input; if your TV has multiple HDMI outlets, you may have to cycle the TV's input to get the right one to display. Depending on your TV model, you can usually do this by tapping the ""Input"" button on either the remote control or on the display itself.

For example, if your chosen HDMI port is labeled ""HDMI 2"", you'll need to press your ""Input"" button until you see the phrase ""HDMI 2"" on your TV's screen.

, This may take a few seconds; once the connection solidifies, your Mac's screen should show up on your TV!, If you've never altered your TV's display filter, it may still be on ""Dynamic"" or ""Cinematic"" from the store. To achieve the highest-quality picture possible, your TV's display should be set to ""Normal"" or ""Standard"" (contingent on your TV model). Consult your TV's manual in order to complete this process.

Your TV may also have a ""Computer"" setting; if available, this setting is ideal for your purposes here.

Upgrade to Tiger.",How to Upgrade Your Power Mac G3 Blue and White," If you only have a few bucks, this is the first component you should upgrade. Opt for 1 Gb or SDRAM (the max that the motherboard can support). If you are not running OS X, you can squeak by with 512 Mb. Price: $15-$30;
, After that, trash the original CPU. Most likely, it is 300 Mhz... need I say more? Even if it is a higher-end model (i.e. 400 Mhz), that still sucks pretty badly. Solution? A G4 ZIF upgrade from Sonnet or XLR8. A simple ZIF card like the Encore series from Sonnet delivers a huge performance boost -- up to 1 Ghz. That still sounds pretty crappy. However, keep in mind that PowerPC is different from x86-64. In PPC, 500 Mhz is equivalent to ~ 1.2 Ghz on an Intel Pentium III processor (also now you have AltiVec velocity engine). Apple switched to Intel because they were cheaper than PowerPC. Anyway, since most companies no longer sell ZIF upgrades, you should scrounge around on eBay for a good deal. *Note: Any speed over 700 Mhz will downgrade the bus speed to 66 Mhz! I recommend you opt for a 600 Mhz XLR8 chip, because that keeps the original 100 Mhz bus which is much faster. Price: $50-$150

, The PMG3 B&W only has a PCI video slot... just warning you. The stock 16 MB ATI Rage 128 Pro is fine for Classic OS, but OS X users should move to an ATI or nVidia PCI card that is built to run on a Mac. An example (and best card probably) is the nVidia FX5200. This is the only card that supports Core Image and Quartz Extreme. Price: $50-$100

, Not gonna go into a whole lot of detail here, but you can get upgrade cards that fit into empty PCI slots. Knock yourself out. Price: $10-$50 per card

, You can add one :) The Apple drives are recommended, but I am using a Samsung DVD-ROM just fine.

, The original 6 Gb 4200 RPM drive fails for OS X. Opt for a 7200 RPM drive with at least 40 Gb. Caution: you may need a special driver for drives or 128 Gb.

, Finally, the OS X 10.4 operating system makes the most out of any G3/G4 Mac. Even if you still have a 300 Mhz processor, the Tiger OS is much faster than 10.2 or 10.3. OS 9 technically is quicker, but seriously? OS X 10.4.11 is still supported by Apple, and is cheap to obtain. Most apps run on 10.4, and will not run on anything earlier.

, If you always encounter freezes while opening a certain document or file, but other files work fine, then that file may be corrupted. Avoid opening the file, and delete it if possible. You may be able to recover some of the data, so check online for processes related to the file type.

, Make sure you are running the latest version of OS X, and that all of your installed software is up to date. You can update your OS X and Mac Store software by opening the Apple menu and selecting Software Update.

Audio CDs have a capacity of up to 80 minutes of music, whereas Data CDs have a capacity of up to 700 megabytes or 8 hours of music.

If your computer has more than one CD burner, click on the ""Next Drive"" link to select the burner you want to use. If Windows Media Player does not recognize your USB-connected burner, check the connection or close and restart Windows Media Player.
Find items in your music library you want to burn to the CD. In the main window of Windows Media Player, navigate to the music file or folder you want to burn to the CD. Click and drag these items over to the ""List"" pane on the right below the ""Burn"" tab. Drag and drop items up and down in the list if you want to change the play order. If you accidentally drag and drop a song you don't want, right-click the song and click ""Remove from List.""

Tomcat 7 is the latest version, though you can select earlier versions from the left menu panel on the download page.;
, Go down the page to find the “Binary distribution” folder under the “7.0.62” heading. In the folder, locate “Binary Distribution/Core” heading and click the “Zip” link to download the installer. #* The unitary file size of the zip package is around 8MB.

, Go to the “Download” folder of your computer and unzip the file with WinZip or WinRAR, or whatever unzipping program you have. Avoid unzipping the folder to the desktop, as you will find the path of the software files hard to locate later. The best option will be to unzip to “E:\myserver.” The unzipped directory will be “E:\myserver\tomcat-.0.62.”

, Check the installed directory to ensure it contains all the sub folders (bin, logs, webapps, work, temp, conf, and lib). These are the required subfolders for installing the server. If any of the folder is missing, download the zip file again.

, After checking the directory, you should create an environment variable called “JAVA_HOME.” To do this, go to Start >> Control Panel >> System >> Advanced System Settings. After reaching it, click the “Advanced” tab, then click Environment Variables >> System Variables.


Select the “New” button in the System Variables menu. In the “Variable name” field, enter “JAVA_HOME.” Enter “c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_{xx}” in the “Variable value” field. (Variable value is nothing but the JDK directory, you can always find this in program files.)

, To make sure that it’s working correctly, start a command shell and issue: set JAVA_HOME. To open the command shell, click the “Start” button and then “All Programs”. Type the following in the command prompt, “set JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06” and press enter. The JAVA_HOME is set. Type the following in the command prompt, “set JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06” and press enter. The JAVA_HOME is set.

, At times, you may need to set JRE_HOME instead of JAVA_HOME, like errors when using Java. If this is the case, JRE should be used. Create JRE_HOME the same way you created Java, but remember that the JRE installed directory will be different (C:\Program Files\Java\jre7).

, Locate the four configuration XML files of Tomcat in the “conf” sub-directory of the Tomcat directory (E:\myserver\tomcat7.0.40\conf). The four files should be context.xml, tomcat-users.xml, server.xml, and web.xml file.

, Before proceeding, make a backup of the configuration files. Because of file permissions with your backup/restore, you don’t want to restore the server with different file permissions than what was there originally.


To do this, go to Internet router >> Prompt, issue the Enable command by entering “Enable,” and provide the required password when prompted. A page will be displayed with your router settings. Entering “Enable” will change the prompt to Router#, which indicates that the router is now in privileged mode. Copy the running configuration file to the TFTP server.
Afterwards, open the configuration file with a text editor, like Textpad or Notepad. Search for and remove any line that starts with “AAA.” Copy the configuration file from the TFTP server to a new router in privileged (enable) mode, which has a basic configuration.

, Open the configuration file “web.xml” in a text editor, and change the directory listing by changing “listings” from “false” to “true” for the “default” servlet.

, Open the configuration file “server.xml” in a text editor. The default port number of Tomcat is 8080. Now you need to change this, since the same port number can be used by other servers like SQL Server. You may choose any number between 1024 and 65535.

, Open the configuration file “context.xml” in a text editor. Here, set reloadable=“true” to the <Context> element to enable automatic reload after the code changes.

, Launch the command prompt in Windows 7. Once launched, set the current directory to “<TOMCAT_HOME>\bin”. For example, E:\myserver\tomcat7.0.40\bin, and run “startup.bat”.


When you first start the command prompt, you will be located in your personal directory. This is typically C:\Users\username\. With the basic navigation commands, you can set the directory as specified in the above step.

, This will direct you to a new console window of the server. Read the messages that appear on the console. Look out for the Tomcat’s port number and double-check.

, Open any web browser on your Windows and then enter the URL “http://localhost:9999”. This will direct you to the Tomcat server’s welcome page. Once you are directed to the server page, you are almost done. Now try the URL “http://localhost:9999/examples” to view JSP and servlet examples.


, To do this, press Ctrl + C in the Tomcat console."

Launch Terminal.,
Open an application from anywhere.,
Open a file with a specific application.,
Include additional options.,
Add -F to open a ""fresh"" copy of the application.,
Open multiple instances of the same application with -n. This may be useful if you are comparing different access levels, or if the application only allows one window.,
Run an application inside Terminal.,
Find the application name.,
Understand absolute file paths.,
Understands relative file paths.,
Switch directories.,
Find the correct file name.",How to Open Applications Using Terminal on Mac," Look for Terminal in Applications → Utilities → Terminal. You can also open Terminal by using spotlight in the right hand top corner.;
, The open command normally requires you to input the full file path from your current directory. However, adding -a followed by the name of an application instructs Terminal to open that Application, no matter where it is located. For example:


To open iTunes:open -a iTunes

Use quotation marks if the application has a space in its name:open -a ""App Store""


, You can also use this command to override the default application for a file type. Just type in the file path followed by -a and the application name. If you're not sure how to enter file paths, see the Troubleshooting section below.


For example, you can open a .doc file with TextEdit:open Downloads/Instructions.doc -a TextEdit


, Enter info open to see a full list of options for modifying the open command. (When you are finished, press ControlC to return to the command line.) Here are a couple basic examples:


Use -e to specify TextEdit, or -t to specify your default text editor:open Downloads/Instructions.doc -e

Add -g to keep the application in the background, so you remain centered in Terminal:open -g -a iTunes


, This will destroy your unsaved changes, but may help if a document is causing the application to crash when opened:


open -F -a TextEdit

, For example, enter this command repeatedly to open multiple instances of an alarm clock program:



open -n -a ""Wake Up Time"" (Note: this is not a default OS X program.)

This may cause unexpected behavior in other applications that interact with the duplicate application.

, Instead of just opening an application normally, Terminal can host it. This is useful for debugging, as error messages and other console outputs will appear in that Terminal window. Here's how to do this:Locate the application in Finder.
Right-click the application and select ""Show Package Contents.""
Locate the executable file. Typically, this is in Contents → MacOS, and has the same name as the application.
Drag that file onto your blank Terminal command line. Hit Enter to launch that program.
Leave your Terminal window open while you use the application. Quit the application to return to regular Terminal operations.

, If Terminal displays the error message ""Unable to find application named...,"" find the exact name of the application by browsing an alphabetical list:Click the apple symbol  in the top left corner of your screen.
Hold down ⌥ Option and click System Information in the drop-down menu.
In the System Information window's left sidebar, click Software → Applications. It may take a couple minutes to load the list.

, If Terminal displays ""the file ... does not exist,"" you did not type the correct file path. An easy way to avoid mistakes is to drag and drop the file from Finder directly into your Terminal command line (after typing ""open,"" but before hitting Enter.) This will enter the absolute file path, which will always point to that file.


An absolute file path always begins with the symbol /. It describes the file path in relation to the root directory (usually ""Macintosh HD"").

, The start of your Terminal command line always displays the current directory you are located in. By default, this is your Home directory, named after your username. A relative file path begins with ./ or with no special characters, and describes the file's location in relation to your current directory.If you're having trouble figuring this out, follow these steps:


Enter pwd to check your current directory. The file you are trying to open must be within this directory, not at a higher level.
Find your current directory in Finder. Open a series of folder until you reach the file you'd like to open.
Type in the names of the folders you opened in order, separated by / symbols, then end with the file name. For example, open Documents/Writing/Novel/ch3.pdf. (You may start with ./ in front of Documents for the same result.)

, You can return to your Home directory with cd ~/, or switch to a lower-level directory with cd followed by the folder name — for example, cd Documents/Finances. Remember, the file you are trying to open must be inside your current directory, but you may use any application to open it regardless of location.

, Your file name must include the extension at the end of its name. If the extension is hidden, use any of these methods to find it:


Select the file in Finder. Press ⌘ Command+I. In the Info window, look for ""file name & extension"" to see the whole name.

Or switch directories to the folder that contains the file. Enter ls into your Terminal command line to list all files in your directory.

Or drag and drop the file into your Terminal window.

Convert your hard drive type to NTFS.,
Set priorities of programs.,
Disable GUI boot.,
Speed up browsing in Windows Explorer.,
Force context menus to load faster.,
Disable unnecessary services.,
Increase the speed of your hard disk by disabling Last Access Update.,
Improve Windows XP's shutdown speed.",How to Dramatically Speed up Windows XP3," If your drive is using FAT16 or FAT32, you can gain performance by converting it to NTFS.


To do so, press WinKey + R simultaneously to open the Run dialog, type CONVERT C: /FS:NTFS, and click OK. Follow the instructions and your drive will be converted to NTFS.

, Setting the priority of a program determines its importance to the computer and whether it will receive extra processing power from it or not. If you often use a program or a program freezes constantly when you use it, setting its priority to a higher state often helps. To set the priority of a program, open the program which you want to increase the priority of, press Ctrl+Alt+Delete simultaneously on your keyboard to open the Task Manager, click the Applications tab, right click the name of the program, click Go To Process, right click the selected process, click Set Priority, and either choose High or Realtime.

, When Windows starts, you might see the loading bar and the Windows XP logo. This is the GUI boot. However, this is useless and can lengthen the boot of Windows. To disable GUI boot, press the WinKey+R simultaneously to open the Run dialog. Type MSCONFIG into the Run dialog and click OK. In Microsoft Configuration Utility, click the Boot tab and check No GUI boot.

, Go to My Computer > Tools menu > Folder Options > View tab. Uncheck ""Automatically search for network folders and printers"" and ""Launch folders in a separate process"". Click Apply, then click OK.

, The context menu has a fade effect by default. The menu may take a long time to fade in or out, especially if there are many commands on it. Press WinKey + R simultaneously, type ""regedit"" in the Run dialog, then press Enter to open the Registry Editor. Now navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop in the Registry Editor, click Desktop, double click ""MenuShowDelay"" in the right pane, reduce the Value Data number to around 100 (but not too less), and click OK.

, Services are Windows processes which essentially run Windows. Think of them as the cogs of a motor. Services exist for various reasons like giving you the ability to search, access the internet, use your USB device, run your programs, etc. They might be helpful, but some services take up lots of your memory and are not useful to you or the computer. To disable services, press WinKey + R simultaneously to open the Run dialog, type services.msc, click OK to open Services, double click on the service(s) that you want to disable, and change the startup type to Disabled. Click OK once you're done. Following is a list of services that can be disabled on most machines: Alerter, Clipbook, Computer Browser, Distributed Link Tracking Client, Indexing Service, IPSEC Services, Messenger, Netmeeting Remote Desktop Sharing, Portable Media Serial Number, Remote Desktop Help Session Manager, Remote Procedure Call Locator, Remote Registry, Secondary Logon, Routing & Remote Access, Server (do not disable if you share folders with other Windows systems in your household), SSDP Discovery Service, Telnet, TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper, Upload Manager, Universal Plug and Play Device Host, Windows Time, Wireless Zero Configuration. (Do not disable Wireless Zero Configuration if you use a wireless network)


Do not disable services which you know may be vital for your computer or programs which you use.

, Lass Access Update updates the Last Accessed date in the properties of a file. This is not entirely useful and slows down the computer, so it is safe to disable. To disable Last Access Update, press WinKey + R simultaneously to open the Run dialog, type ""regedt32"" and click OK to open the Registry Editor, find HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem in it, select FileSystem, click Edit>New>DWORD Value at the top of the window, name it ""NTIS Disable Last Access Update"" in the right pane, then double click the new value and change the value data to ""1"", and save it.

, When Windows shuts down, it waits for background processes to close. Slow shutdowns are caused by faulty processes which fail to close. Eventually, Windows XP force-closes these processes. This tweak reduces the time that Windows XP takes before automatically closing any running programs when you give it the command to shutdown. To perform the tweak, press WinKey + R simultaneously to open the Run dialog, type in ""regedit"", and click OK to open Registry Editor. Find HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop, click Desktop, double click Wait To Kill App Timeout in the right pane, change the value to ""1000"", and click OK. After that, double click Hung App Timeout in the right pane, change the value to ""1000', and click OK. Then, find HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control, click Control, double click Wait To Kill Service Timeout in the right pane, change the value to ""1000"", and click OK.

Make sure to get files from all of the possible locations, including My Documents, Desktop, and any other folders you may have created and placed files in.
You should also track down your Windows Product Key in case you end up needing to do a complete reinstall. Your Product Key is typically located on the case that the Windows disc came in, or on a sticker affixed to your computer.;
, If you bought your computer from a manufacturer such as Dell, you may have a recovery disc instead of a Windows XP disc. Close out of the program that autoruns when you insert the disc.

, With the disc inserted, restart your computer. As the computer boots up, press the Setup key to enter your BIOS. The key varies from system to system, and will be displayed beneath the manufacturer's logo. Common keys include: F2, F10, F12, and Delete.


If Windows begins to load, the Setup key was not pressed in time and you will have to retry.

, Once you've entered the BIOS, navigate to the BOOT menu. It may be labeled slightly differently depending on your specific BIOS. You will need to change the boot order so that your CD/DVD drive is the first boot device, followed by your hard drive.


Normally, the hard drive is the primary boot device. This means that the system attempts to boot from the hard disk first, loading your installed copy of Windows. You want to change it so that it attempts to boot from your Windows disc before trying the hard drive.
Once you've changed your boot order, save your changes and restart your computer.

, After you computer reboots again, you will see the message Press any key to boot from CD.... Press any key on you keyboard to start the Windows setup program.


Setup will load the files necessary to install Windows. This may take a few moments.

, When the setup program first loads, you will be greeted with a Welcome message. At the bottom of the screen, you will see keys that you can press to navigate the options. DO NOT press the key for Repair; instead press Enter to continue.


Press F8 to agree to the Windows License Agreement.

, After the license agreement, you will see a list of your drives. One of them should be labeled ""Windows"" and will usually be highlighted automatically. The only time you will need to manually select it is if you have multiple operating systems installed.

, Once you have your copy highlighted, press R to start the Repair process. Windows will begin deleting system files. After the system files are deleted, fresh copies will be installed.


No personal files should be deleted during the repair.

, During the reinstallation, you will need to select your Region and Language options. You will also need to set your network settings. Most users can choose the first option, ""No, this computer is not on a network, or is on a network without a domain.""

, Once you've entered your preferences, you'll need to wait a few more minutes for Windows to finish copying necessary files. Your computer will likely reboot during this process.

, After installation is complete and your computer reboots, you will be asked if you would like to register with Microsoft. This is not the same as activation, and is completely optional. After that, you will be asked to create your user name and any other user names for people using the computer. You can add and remove users later if you wish.

, After setup is complete, you will be taken to your Windows XP desktop. The repair installation reverted Windows back to its initial state, which means any updates, patches, and service packs that were installed have been removed. You need to update your computer as soon as possible to ensure that you are protected from threats.

, If your problem has been fixed, then your repair installation most likely worked. If you are still experiencing problems though, you may need to take your repair efforts further and perform a completely clean install. This will involve wiping your hard drive of all data and starting over from scratch. See this guide for detailed instruction on performing a clean installation.With Microsoft ending all support for Windows XP in April 2014, this might be the perfect time for an upgrade. See this guide for upgrading to Windows 7 and this guide for upgrading to Windows 8.

,
Run your antivirus software.",How to Remove a Virus and Repair Windows XP for Free," Whether you know it or not, Windows takes a snapshot of your PC every so often – at least by default upon installation – and you can always restore your system to that snapshot. This effectively turns your PC back in time to before the virus existed, destroying it. If restoring back as far as you can doesn’t work, go to the next step.


Find it under the “System Tools” group of the “Accessories” menu under your “Programs” menu. Select “Restore My Computer To An Earlier Time” and then choose a date that your computer worked properly.;
, If you have problems with Internet Explorer, use Mozilla Firefox and/or Google Chrome. If none work, you’ll have to download whatever tools you need to a USB stick from a computer that does work and then move to the next step.



CNET in early 2014 recommended Kaspersky, BitDefender, and Panda Security, all of which still support Windows XP and have free and freemium versions.

, Not only is doing so thorough, it may not even be a virus you're dealing with: you could be a victim of a Trojan or another type of malware. A few good apps to try include AdAware, Norton Power Eraser, and Malwarebytes.

, If you have a Windows CD you can simply put the disc into the PC, restart it, and choose to boot from CD when asked. After that, follow the onscreen instructions, choosing to repair Windows instead of reinstalling -- this way you keep your existing files., If you've got your original XP install discs, a full install might help clear things out. This option will destroy your files and thus, unless you don’t care about your files, should be a last resort. If you have a Windows CD you can simply put the disc into the PC, restart it, and choose to boot from CD when asked. After that, follow the onscreen instructions, choosing to totally reformat your hard drive when presented with the reformat utility.


Virus repair of Windows XP is difficult and fraught with increasingly diminishing returns the older the operating system gets. Consider an upgrade to your operating system if all else fails or if you'd like to have fewer problems in the future., Some viruses require Internet access to be able to hide, so you need to cut off their Internet supply to find them.

, If the computer won’t restart normally, try Ctrl+Alt+Del or just force the restart by holding down the power button on the computer or by cutting off the power supply by taking out the battery for a laptop or unplugging a desktop computer.

, A menu appears with various options available. If the computer starts normally, restart it and try again.

,, If you have put the software onto a USB stick as mentioned earlier, you’ll have to install the antivirus software to your computer at this point and then run the software. Run a full scan; it may take awhile depending on your computer.

Select Next to proceed with the installation.,
Enter the names of your users.,
Run Windows Update.,
Install your drivers.",How to Reinstall Windows XP2," Formatting and reinstalling Windows will wipe your hard drive clean. Be absolutely sure that you have backups of all your important files before starting. Pictures, movies, documents, and music will all be erased.

, Make note of your Windows Product Key, you will need it during the installation. Boot from the Windows CD to start the setup program


Details for this step can be found in steps 1-4 in the first section of this guide.

, Windows will load the drivers for the setup program. Once this is complete, press Enter at the Welcome screen to start the setup. Do not enter the recovery console.

, Hit F8 once you are done reading the agreement to continue the setup process. Setup will load a list of your Windows XP installs. Press Esc to continue with a fresh install.

, You should see a list of your hard drive partitions. These are your C: and D: drives (The lettering is dependent on the way the system was set up).

This is your last chance to restart and back up any files you forgot. Once the partition is deleted, your data is gone.






Highlight the partition that contains Windows. This is commonly the C: partition. Press D to delete the partition. Confirm that you wish to delete that partition by hitting Enter.






You will get one more chance to back out. To really confirm that you want to delete the partition, press L.







, Select the unpartitioned space. Press C to create a new partition. Enter the maximum size possible and press Enter.


You can create smaller a smaller partition if you want to create other partitions in your hard drive later through Windows. There are multiple reasons why someone might do this, but for most users simply creating the largest partition possible should be fine.







, Once the partition is created, highlight it and press Enter to begin the Windows installation. You will be asked to format the partition. Select “Format the partition using the NTFS file system.” Choose NTFS over FAT, as NTFS is much more stable for Windows.

Formatting will begin. This could take up to several hours depending on the size and speed of your hard drive, but for most users it will take a few minutes.






After formatting, Windows will copy over the files it needs for the Setup process. This will take a few minutes and requires no user interaction.







, This is a mostly automated process that requires the user to enter some data at a few points. The first option that pops up is changing the default language and region. Click Customize… if the settings are incorrect for your region. Once the settings are correct, click Next to move on.


When prompted, type your name and organization. These will be used when labeling documents, and can be changed in Windows settings later.







, You will be prompted to enter your 25-digit product key at this time. Your Product Key should be found at the lower part of you Certificate of Authenticity.If you are installing from a Windows XP SP 3 disc, then you will not be asked for it yet.

, This is the name that will appear on the network to describe your computer. Windows auto-generates a name for you, though you are free to change it to whatever you’d like.


For XP Professional, you will be asked to enter an Administrator password that will be used to access the Administrator account.







, You will now see a calendar and clock that can be adjusted to your specific time. You can also select the correct timezone for your location.

, You will be asked if you want to install Typical or Custom network settings. For nearly all users, Typical is the correct choice. If you are installing in a corporate setting, check with your system administrator first.


When asked to enter a workgroup, most users will want to select the first option, and leave the workgroup label as default. If you are in a corporate setting, you may need to specify a domain. Again, check with your administrator.







, This will take several minutes and requires no input from the user. Once it is complete, your PC will automatically restart and load Windows XP.


If you had to change your BIOS to boot from CD, you will probably see the option to “Press any key to Boot from CD…” again. Don’t hit any key and wait for the screen to pass. Your computer will continue to boot from the hard drive and finish the Windows install.







, Windows will attempt to automatically change the screen size to make reading easier. Once the screen resets, you will be asked if you can read the new text box. If you can, click OK to continue. If you cannot, then hit Cancel or simply wait 20 seconds for the screen to revert to its original settings.

, The Welcome to Microsoft Windows screen will appear once the screen changes are made. This process will just take a couple minutes.

Windows will attempt to check your network connectivity. If you are planning on setting this up later, you can skip this screen.






Next Windows will ask you if you are connecting to the internet through a local area or home network, or if you are connected directly to the internet. If you are using a router for your network, then select the first option. If the modem is plugged directly into your computer, then select the second option.






You are given the option to register your product with Microsoft. Whether or not you do this is up to you, it is not required to use Windows.







, In this step, you can create separate logins for each of the users of your computer. You must enter at least one name. You can enter up to five users on this screen, but more can be entered through the Control Panel after installing.


After entering the names, click Finish to finalize the installation. Windows will work for a few moments and then you will be greeted with your new desktop.







, Your installation is complete, but you’ll want to run Windows Update as soon as possible. This will download the latest system updates from Microsoft. These are very important, as the patch system vulnerabilities and stability issues.

, Chances are you will need to install your drivers again now that the computer has been formatted. Depending on the devices you have attached to your computer, this could include your video card, your modem or network card, your sound, and more.


These drivers can be found on the discs that came with your computer, and can also be downloaded from their respective manufacturer’s websites.

Install from the recovery partition.,
Install from within Windows.",How to Reinstall Windows XP3," Many computer manufacturers ship their computers with a partition on the hard drive that contains the Windows installation files. In order to access it, you will need to boot into the recovery partition.

The most common key to enter the partition is F11. This will appear underneath the manufacturer log right after starting the computer.






Recovery partition boot sequences vary by manufacturer. Follow the steps on screen to enter the Windows setup program. Once setup has started, follow the steps in the above section starting at Step 3.







, You will need to use a file called winnt32.exe. This file is a Windows installer that can be run from inside Windows XP. To find it, open the Start menu and click Search. Select ""all Files and Folders"" from the left frame. Enter ""winnt32.exe"" in the search box.


Running winnt32.exe will reboot your computer into Windows setup. From this point, follow Step 3 in the above section. You will still need to enter a valid product key. Your data will be deleted as it would through a regular install.

",How to Make Your Windows XP Look Like a Mac Leopard," What you need to do is make a folder and rename it something like Secondary Hard Drive (Secondary HDD), then put all of the files from the desktop in it.;
, There are programs that emulate Mac's Finder Bar at the top of the screen. Well known and trusted programs include 'Finderbar' (a program made for emulating this sort of thing) and 'Stardock Objectbar' (but for this you need to download themes and skins and you can also use Objectbar as a Windows Vista/7 Gadget Sidebar.) http://www.download.cnet.com/ObjectBar/3000-2072_4-10069555.html?part=dl-80664

, Install Stardock Objectdock. This is not like many other Stardock programs where there are nag dialogs every startup and every hour, it will leave you alone so you can enjoy the ability to use the Mac style dock to the max. Another program would be RKLauncher. http://www.stardock.com/products/objectdock/

, Install Expose for Windows. It will allow you to swiftly put all windows in a grid or scatter. You can click on the window you want. http://www.otakusoftware.com/topdesk/

, Install ShockCaption V1.5 - a program that allows you to snap the window to taskbar size, then back to window size. Go to: http://www.docs.kr/entry/Download-Shock-Caption-en to download it.

, Install only limited programs in FlyAKiteOSX. Download FLYAKITEOSX and when installing only choose specific options such as 'Install the Icon Pack' and 'BootScreen' and 'Logon Screen'. Don't install the whole thing because it will massively slow down the computer. I should know, because my computer has 8GB RAM. http://flyakiteosx.en.softonic.com/

, Download TrueTransparency and install a Leopard skin. Don't worry if the buttons are switched around i.e. red, green yellow, because you can switch around values like ""Red X=0, Yellow X=22, Green X=40"". You can swap the values around so Green is X=22 and Yellow X=40. This will affect the commands as well, because the buttons will do the same things. I recommend this skin: http://asilaydyingdl.deviantart.com/art/iUnlimited-4-TrueTransparency-119863254 - Download TrueTransparency from here: http://www.crystalxp.net/dl/en.gal.5139.html or if that doesn't work: http://www.crystalxp.net/galerie/en.id.5139-truetransparency-lefreut-explorer-tools.htm

In the lower-left corner, you'll see the Start menu. Clicking this will allow you to quickly access your installed programs, connected devices, computer settings and more. In the bottom-right corner of the screen you'll see the System Tray, which houses the clock and a list of running programs designated by icons.

, In order to get online and browse the internet, you'll need to connect Windows XP to a network. If you are connecting to your network via Ethernet, plug it into your computer and Windows XP should connect automatically.

If you are connecting wirelessly, right-click the wireless network icon in the System Tray. You may have to expand the list of icons by clicking the ""▲"" button.
Select the wireless network you want to connect to. Enter in the password if it is a secured network.
See this guide for more details on how to connect wirelessly.

, Even though Windows XP is no longer being updated, you'll still want to ensure that you have all of the updates available. If you installed an older copy, make sure to download the latest Service Packs (SP3 was the last released), as well as all the available security and stability updates.


See this guide for more details on using Windows Update.

, It's your computer, make it feel like yours! Besides changing the background, you can change icons, cursors, and even install programs that completely change the way your Windows XP desktop functions.

, Since Windows XP is no longer being updated, any exploits found will not be fixed. This means XP is now an unsecure operating system, and you should take every precaution when using it to help prevent getting attacked. Creating a limited account and primarily using it will prevent malware from performing administrator actions if you get infected.This means you will need to log into your administrator account any time you want to install or uninstall software, or make changes to the system settings. It's a pain, but one of the best ways to ensure that your computer is secure as possible.

, Dump IE as soon as possible, as the Windows XP version is no longer updated and is not secure. Two of the most popular and secure browser replacements include Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.


Consider not connecting your XP computer to the internet at all. It will be inconvenient, but your chance of getting infected will go way down (you will still be vulnerable to threats from USB drives).

, Some versions of Windows XP will come bundled with an antivirus program trial. Uninstall this first, and then download and install a new antivirus program. This is incredibly important if you plan on spending any amount of time connected to the internet.


See this guide for details on installing an antivirus program.

Antimalware programs are important as well (Malwarebytes, Spybot, etc.)
Replace Windows firewall. Many paid antivirus programs come with firewall replacements. You should enable these instead of Windows Firewall, as they are more likely to be updated and kept secure.

, Since Windows XP will no longer be updated, it's important to ensure that your programs are running their latest version to reduce the chance of exploits. Some programs will check for updates automatically, while others will release updated versions on their websites.


If you are using Office 2003, you'll want to upgrade as soon as possible. Like Windows, it is now longer being updated, and Office is a notoriously exploitable program. Either update to a newer version, or install an alternative like Apache OpenOffice


, Managing your installed programs will help keep your computer performing well. You can uninstall programs using the ""Add/Remove Programs"" tool in the Control Panel. Remove any programs that you do not use.

, You can create shortcuts which you can place on your desktop or in other locations that can let you access files, folders, and programs without having to dig through your computer to find them.

, There are a variety of maintenance tasks that you should perform on occasion to keep your computer running in peak shape. Most of these processes can be set and then forgotten about, and the maintenance will occur in the background.



Defragment your disk. As you move files around and add and remove programs, pieces of files will get left behind, increasing the time it takes your hard drive to access information. Defragmenting will sort these bits so that your hard drive can read faster.

Use the Disk Cleanup tool. This tool scours your computer for old files and registry entries that are no longer used. The tool can free up a significant amount of hard disk space.

Create a restore point before making major changes. You can reset your computer to a previous instance of Windows by using a restore point. This will revert any changes made since the restore point, but will not affect your files and documents.

, If you ever have a problem with Windows XP, booting into Safe Mode can be a very important step for troubleshooting. Safe Mode only loads the essential files that Windows needs to run, allowing you to remove entrenched virus or fix corrupted settings.

, Programs have a tendency to attach themselves to your startup process, and if you have too many, your computer can slow to a crawl whenever Windows boots. MSConfig is a utility that allows you to see which programs are loading when Windows starts, and disable any programs you choose.

, Since Windows XP is not being updated any more, there's a good chance that it will become fairly unstable. This, along with the increased threats from viruses, means that you should always have backups of your important files and documents. You can backup your important files manually, or use a backup programs to automate the task.


You will need an external storage solution, such as an external hard drive or a cloud storage service, in order to back up your data.

, Windows XP will only get less and less secure. The sooner you can upgrade to a more recent OS, the more secure you'll be. You can upgrade to Windows 10, 8.1, or 7, or you can switch to Linux. The benefits of Linux include increased security and a free pricetag, but it can be a little more difficult for new users to get a hang of.

Windows XP won't boot after shrinking the boot partition.",How to Shrink a Windows XP Partition," Windows XP does not include a ""Shrink Partition"" function so you'll be using a third-party tool. This means that there's an increased chance that your data could be lost or corrupted. Backup all of your important data to another location before shrinking in case something goes wrong.



Click here for detailed instructions on quickly backing up your important files.;
, The free version can perform most basic partition tasks. There are a variety of free partition managers available that do the same thing. The benefit of MiniTool Partition Wizard is that you can use it in Windows.


You can download MiniTool Partition Wizard for free from partitionwizard.com/free-partition-manager.html.

, You will see a list of your installed hard disks and each of the partitions they contain. At the top of the list you will see the layout of your partitions on the disk. The layout determines how you can shrink the partition.

, You can shrink any partition that has been formatted, even your Windows boot partition. You won't be able to shrink unallocated space or unformatted space until it has been formatted with a file system.

, This will open a new window with a bar representing the partition's storage. Any data currently on the partition will be represented by a slightly darker color.

, You can shrink the partition from either side. Unallocated space will be created on each side of the partition depending on how much you shrink. You can't shrink the partition more than the amount of free space.


Choosing the correct side is important if you want to add that space to an existing partition. For example, you have a C: drive with your Windows installation and a D: drive with your data. To add space to the Windows partition (C:), you'll need to shrink the D: drive on its left side. This will create unallocated space between the C: and D: drives. You can then add it to the C: drive.

, Partition Wizard allows you to queue up multiple changes to be applied at once. You can use this function to perform several tasks at once.


The first shrink procedure in our example left unallocated space between the C: and D: drives. Select the C: drive, click ""Move/Resize"", and then use the slider to add the additional space on the right side of the C: partition. You now have two tasks queued up.

, Partition Wizard will warn you to close any open programs and to backup your data.


Partition Wizard will be able to perform the action immediately if the partition being adjusted in not in use. The shrink process shouldn't take more than a few seconds, but older computers or large partitions may take longer.
If a partition that you are adjusting is in use, such as your Windows partition, you will be given a couple of different options. Select ""Restart Now"" to restart your computer and perform the task. Partition Wizard will boot into a special interface and automatically finish the task. Windows will then continue to boot normally.

, Now that you've shrunk a partition, you can convert your new unallocated space into a partition, or add it to an existing one.Click here for instructions on creating a new partition.

Click here for instructions on extending a partition.

, You will encounter this error if you have four primary partitions. Each partition in the list will say ""Primary"" or ""Logical"" in the ""Type"" column. You won't be able to create any new ones until you set one of the primaries as a logical.


Select a partition that doesn't need to be primary. This is usually a data or program partition. Any partition that you boot from, such as your operating system or recovery partition, must be set as a primary one.
Click the ""Set partition as logical"" button in the left menu.
Try creating a partition from the unallocated space. You should now be able to create a partition.

, This could be caused by errors in the hard disk. Running the ""chkdsk"" command will attempt to repair your disk so that you can shrink the partition.


Click Start and select ""Command Prompt"".
Type Template:Chkdsk c: /r and press ↵ Enter. Replace c: with the drive letter that you need to scan.

;
, It is printed on a sticker on your software package or located on the computer itself. It is a string of 5 groups of characters (each 5 long), separated by dashes, resulting in 25 characters in all. You need the product key to complete installing Windows.

, Before inserting the CD, you'll need to set your computer to boot from a CD instead of from the hard drive. This will allow you to load the Windows XP setup files before your computer boots to its installed operating system. You can change the boot order from the BOOT menu in your BIOS.


To enter the BIOS of your computer, you usually press F9 or DEL when your computer starts or notifies you that you can enter ""setup"". Click the green ""BIOS"" link for more information. In the BOOT menu, set the order so that your CD/DVD-ROM drive is set as the 1st Boot Device.
If you are installing Windows XP from a USB drive, make sure that the USB drive is set as the 1st Boot Device. You may need to have the USB drive inserted for it to appear as an option.

, Once your Boot Order is set, insert the Windows XP CD into your drive and Save and Exit from the BIOS. Your computer will reboot and you will be presented with the message: Press any key to boot from CD. Press any key on your keyboard to start the Setup program.


Setup will load files necessary to begin the installation, which may take a few moments. Once the loading is complete, you will be taken to the Welcome screen.

, Once the loading is complete, you will be taken to the Welcome screen. You are given several options, but if you are installing or reinstalling Windows XP, you’ll want to press ENTER to start the installation configuration.

, This document tells you what you can and can’t do with Windows, and your rights as the consumer. After reading, press F8 indicating you agree to the terms.

, You will see a list of available partitions on your installed hard drives. If you are installing Windows XP on a new hard drive, you should see only one entry labeled ""Unpartitioned space."" If you have a previous version of Windows or Linux installed on your computer, you will potentially have multiple partitions.


Installing Windows XP will erase all of the data on the partition that you choose. Select a partition that is empty or that contains data that you do not care to lose.
You can delete your partitions with the “D” key. This will return them to “Unpartitioned space”. Any data on the partition will be lost when it is deleted.

, Select the Unpartitioned space and press “C”. This will open a new screen where you can set the partition’s size from the available space. Enter the size in megabytes (MB) for the new partition and then press ENTER.


By default, the partition will be set to the maximum amount of available space. Unless you plan on creating multiple partitions, you can usually leave this at its default.
Windows XP requires at least 1.5 gigabytes (1536 MB) for its installation files, but you will want more than this for programs, documents, downloads, and other files. 5 gigabytes (5120 MB) is a good baseline amount for Windows XP, with more if you plan on installing a lot of programs.
You can create multiple partitions on a single drive. This can allow you to separate your programs from your movies and music, or to install another operating system. Windows XP can only be installed on one discrete partition.

, Once you’ve created your installation partition, you will be returned to the partition selection screen. Select your new partition, usually labeled ""C: Partition 1 "" and press ENTER.

, NTFS is the preferred method, supporting a larger amount of disk space per partition than FAT, and including security features at the file system level. NTFS also includes system level compression. There are almost no situations anymore where choosing FAT would be preferable.


If your partition size is larger than 32 GB, you will not be given the option to choose FAT.
It is highly recommended to avoid Quick Format, as this skips an important process that checks the hard drive for errors or bad sectors. This scan is what consumes the majority of the time taken when performing a full format. If there are errors on a disk at the physical level, it's best to catch them now rather than later.

, The system will now format the partition. The length of time this process requires depends on the speed and size of the drive. In general, the larger the partition, the longer the process will take.

, Windows will now start copying files from the installation disc and prompt you to reboot the computer when the process is completed. Press ENTER when prompted to reboot, otherwise it will do so automatically after 15 seconds.

, You will see the message asking you to press a key to boot from CD. Ignore it and allow the computer to continue booting from the hard drive. You will see the Windows logo as the Setup program loads.

, After the Windows logo goes away, you will see a list of steps remaining on the left side of the screen, and tips for using windows on the right. The time remaining for the installation will be displayed below the list of steps remaining.


It is normal for the screen to flicker, turn on and off, or resize during this process.

, During the installation process a dialog window will appear, asking you to choose your Regional settings. Select appropriate settings native to your area. Click the Next button when that is completed.


Enter your full name if you want. This will be set as the “owner” of Windows, and will be attached to certain things, such as Document creation.

, You will not be able to complete the installation process without a valid Product Key. Click ""Next"" to continue.


Some versions of Windows will not ask for the Product Key until installation is complete.

, This will be the name that represents the computer on a network. Windows sets a default name, but you can change it if you would like. You can also set a password for the Administrator account. This is optional, but recommended for public computers.

, Ensure that the date/time are correct. Click ""Next"" to continue.

, Almost all users installing Windows XP on a home or personal computer can leave ""Typical Settings"" selected for Network Setup. If you are installing Windows XP in a corporate or academic environment, check with the system administrator, though Typical Settings will most likely work.


In the next window, nearly all users can select “No, this computer is not on a network, or is on a network without a domain.” If you are in a corporate setting, ask your system administrator which you should choose.
You can typically leave the workgroup name set to default.

, This will only take a few minutes, and the computer will reboot when it is finished installing. Once the computer reboots, you will be taken to the Windows XP desktop. At this point, installation is complete, though there are a few things left to do before Windows is completely usable..

, Once Windows loads, you will be told that Windows will automatically configure your display. Click OK to start the configuration. Your screen will flash a couple times, and then you will be asked if you can read the box that appears.

, If your computer is connected to the internet, select your connection type. Press Next to continue.

, If connected to the Internet, Select ""Activate Now."" Windows will connect to the activation server and automatically authenticate your copy of Windows.

Click on the ""Start"" bar, usually found on the lower lefthand screen. Click ""Control Panel."" On the control panel, click ""Troubleshooting"" and then ""Hardware and Sound."" From there, select the option ""Troubleshoot audio playback."" Your computer will ask you a series of questions that will help the troubleshooter determine the cause of your volume issue. In most cases, a volume issue can be fixed using Windows built-in troubleshooter., A sound card is a device you need to install in a windows computer in order for the computer to play sound. If your volume is not working, check to make sure your device has a sound card and that it was installed properly.


Access the search bar on the lower right hand of your computer's screen. Type ""Device Manager"" into the search bar. This should pull up the Device Manager, which you can use to check your sound card.From there, click ""Sound, video and game controllers."" If a sound card is listed, you have a sound card installed. Your volume issue is being caused by something else. If no sound card is listed, you may have to purchase and install your own sound card. Your device's manufacturer's instructions should provide advice on how to do this., Check the cables connecting your speakers, headphones, microphones, or other devices to your computer or laptop. It's not uncommon for cables to become jostled or loose as you're using a computer. If a cable has come unplugged, this is likely the cause of your volume issue. Reinsert a loose cable and see if the volume on your computer improves., It's possible the volume is very low or the power is turned off. This can make it very difficult to hear sounds from your computer.


Once again, access the search bar on the bottom right corner of the screen. Type ""Adjust speaker volume"" in the search box and tap the icon that comes up. Move the slider to increase the volume and see if you can hear better.You may have to check the volume control for several devices. Windows Media Player has its own volume control, as do any external speakers your'e using. Some websites, like YouTube, also have their own volume control. Check to see if the volume on any of these devices is muted or turned very low., Sometimes, your sound card may be incompatible with Windows software. In this case, installing any necessary updates can help address the issue. There are several ways to install updates.


Windows Update, a feature that updates software to fix errors and bugs, is probably the easiest way to install updates. You can simply click ""Install updates"" when prompted. You can also manually check for updates by accessing Windows Update through the control panel. This should keep your software up-to-date and fix any sound issues.In some cases, you may have to manually install a driver or sound card. If you bought the device from an outside manufacturer, you will usually have to install and update it on your own. The manufacturer's instructions for that specific sound card should provide information on how to install., If sound is not playing from your computer, this may be because the wrong playback device is selected. For example, if the computer is set to play sound through headphones, sound may not come out of external speakers. To check the output device, click ""start."" Then type ""sound"" into the search bar.


Click on the ""Playback"" tab. See what playback device has been selected for your computer. If it's something other than the device you're using, this is likely the cause of your loss of sound.Simply select the device you're using as the playback device. Sound should resume."

First, check your speakers. Make sure your speakers are properly connected to the computer. If cables are loose, this can affect sound.Check where your speakers are plugged in. There are several jacks on the back of a computer where you plug in speakers. Choosing the wrong jack can lead to crackling sounds. Try switching which jack you're using and see if you notice any change.If your speakers are optional, try disabling them and just using your computer's built-in sound system. Your speakers may not be of the right quality or simply not be compatible with your computer or laptop.Check to make sure your cables are not damaged. Damaged cables may cause distorted sound and need to be replaced.

, Your sound card may not be compatible with the version of Windows you're running. You can go to the Windows Compatibility Center. This website provides an extensive list of software and devices. You should be able to see which versions of Windows a particular sound card works with. If your sound card is not compatible, you may have to invest in a new one. Remember, you can make sure a sound card is installed by going through the Device Manager., Sometimes, Windows may fail to recognize a sound card. In this case, there are several ways you can troubleshoot this error.


Try using Windows Update, which you can access through your control panel, to update your software. Normally, Windows Update updates your software once a week. However, check for updates manually by searching for ""Windows Update"" in the control panel. If it says you have updates to download, this may be the cause of the sound issue.
You should also download any discs and software that came with the driver. Certain software may be necessary to install for your sound card to work., If you're having trouble getting a microphone, speaker, or other audio device to play sound from your computer, this may be due to which sound jack you're using. Most computers and laptops have several different sound jacks you can use to plug in audio devices. Plugging a device into the wrong jack will affect volume, so try switching the jack. If this doesn't work, see if the jack is muted.


You can see if the jack is muted by clicking on the ""Start"" tab in the lower lefthand corner of your computer. Then, click on the control panel and type in ""sound."" If you're checking a microphone, click ""microphone."" If you're checking another jack, click ""line in"" or ""line out."" The line-in jack is blue and the line-out jack is green.
You can then click on the levels tab. There should be a small button with a picture of a megaphone. If there's a red cross going through the megaphone, the sound is muted. Click on the button to un-mute the sound."

Know why a hard drive gets fragmented.,
Learn how fragmentation affects performance.,
Know how to prevent fragmentation.",How to Defragment a Windows XP Computer1," When a hard drive is freshly formatted, the system files are located at the beginning of the drive, and the rest is a large block of free space. This space is optimally filled as new data is added to the drive. As files are altered, deleted, and moved around the hard drive, pieces of data and small blocks of free space get left behind.

, As the amount of fragments increase in the drive, performance starts to deteriorate. The drive will take longer to find files, and free space on the drive will be misreported.

, Many modern file systems are built to limit the amount of fragmentation that occurs. If you notice your system starting to slow down, defragmentation could increase your hard drive’s read speed.


Solid state drives (flash memory) do not require defragmentation, as there is no mechanical read mechanism. Defragmenting a solid state drive will actually cause it to fail sooner, because data can only be written a certain number of times.

"

, There will be a list of drives that are attached to your computer. Select the drive that you would like to defragment. This is typically the C: or D: drive. Click the Analyze button to see if the drive needs to be defragmented.


You can compare the graphs below the list of drives to see how defragmenting the drive will affect its space allocation. If you see a lot of red lines, that means you have a significant amount of file fragmentation.






You must have at least 15% free space in order to defragment the drive. This is because files will be moved around in order to optimize the drive, and the system needs a place to temporarily put files that are being reorganized.

, Select the drive and click Defragment. Confirm that you wish to start the process in the pop-up window. After the process is complete, you will receive a report in a new window. This report will tell you which files were moved, and which couldn’t be moved, as well as your new free space readings.


Avoid using your computer during the disk defragmentation process. If you alter any files, the defragmenter may have to start over.
You can watch the process by following the status bar at the bottom of the window. This will show you how far the process is, as well as what is currently being moved. The “after defragmentation” graph will adjust during the process as well.

, To start the defragmentation process, enter the following command into the command line. Replace the “C”: for whichever drive you would like to defragment:defrag C:


You can force the defragmentation by adding the parameter /f to the end of the defrag command.

As the defrag process is working, the system will display a blinking cursor. After the process is complete, a report will be displayed. You can write the report to a text file by starting the defrag process with the following command:defrag C: /v >filename.txt..
You can interrupt the defrag process by hitting Ctrl+C.

Turn the computer back on to initiate the bootup sequence.;
, The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) of your computer allows you to change the settings of your computer including the CPU (Central Processing Unit) fan speed. During the bootup sequence of your computer, you will have to hit one of the function keys, either F2, F8 or F10 depending on your manufacturer to get to the Setup Menu.


If the computer is pre-built, check the user’s guide on how to activate the BIOS Setup Screen.
You may also see the function key to press on the BIOS splash screen during start up.
Try pressing the key repeatedly during the startup sequence to activate the menu.

, When you activate the BIOS setup screen, find the listing of the CPU fan speed by navigating to the ‘’Hardware Monitor’’ using the arrow keys on your keyboard then pressing ↵ Enter. The BIOS may show an alert if the fan speed is too slow. If there is no warning, identify what if the CPU fan speed is. Ensure the BIOS is set to automatically change the fan speed.


BIOS settings will vary for most motherboards, refer to your computer or motherboard's manual for where the settings are located.

, In the hardware monitor, use the arrow keys to navigate to the CPU fan settings. Press ↵ Enter then use the arrow keys to change the fan profile information to match automatic or optimal settings then press ↵ Enter again.


Verify the recommended fan setting in the user guide of your motherboard or computer.
If the CPU fan speed is set at the recommended setting and is operating normally, the issue may be related to the graphics driver.

, You can also try controlling your fan's speed outside of the BIOS using a third party application such as SpeedFan if your computer supports these programs.Ensure that your computer is compatible with fan controlling software by checking with the compatibility documentation on the developer's website.
You may not be able to use these programs within Windows as the BIOS will likely override any settings.
If using a pre-built computer, check the user's guide or support to see if there are any programs dedicated to controlling the fans from pre-installed software.

, If the fan is damaged or is not achieving appropriate speeds identified by the computer, it may need to be cleaned, repaired or replaced.


You can attempt to overclock your CPU which will cause the fan speed to speed up from within the BIOS, however this will cause more wear on your CPU and give it a shorter lifespan.

Enter the code provided by Microsoft to activate Windows.,
Install your drivers.",How to Downgrade Windows 8 to Windows 7," ""Downgrade rights"" are designed for businesses and allow you to revert to Windows 7 for free. In order to use the downgrade rights, you'll need to meet a few requirements. The first of these is that you're running Windows 8 Professional. The computer has to have come with Windows 8 Professional installed out of the box.Press ⊞ Win and type winver to see the version of Windows you are running. If you are using any version of Windows 8 besides Professional, you don't qualify for downgrade rights. You'll need an unused Windows 7 retail key to downgrade.
If you upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 8 Professional, you do not qualify for downgrade rights. You'll need an unused Windows 7 retail key to downgrade.
There are no downgrade rights for retail versions of Windows 8. If you installed Windows 8 on a computer that used to have Windows 7 (or other older version), you do not have downgrade rights. You'll need an unused Windows 7 retail key to downgrade.;
, Whether or not the key you obtain needs to be unused depends on if you have downgrade rights:

If you don't have downgrade rights, you'll need a valid Windows 7 product key that is not currently being used by any other computer. If you upgraded from Windows 7 and are downgrading back to it, you can use your original Windows 7 key. If you bought a computer with Windows 8, you can purchase Windows 7 keys for fairly cheap from various resellers online.
If you have downgrade rights, you'll need a real Windows 7 Professional product key, but it doesn't have to be a new key. The key can be currently in use by another machine. It doesn't have to be your own key either. You'll just be using it to get past the activation screen.

, If you bought the computer with Windows 8 installed, it may not be fully compatible with Windows 7. You'll need to check the drivers for all of your hardware to ensure that it will all work when you downgrade, since Windows 7 drivers may not be available:If you have a prebuilt computer (HP, Dell, Acer, etc.), visit the manufacturer's support site and look up your computer's model. You can usually find the model printed on laptop keyboards, or on a sticker affixed to the bottom or back of the computer. In the ""Drivers"" or ""Downloads"" section of the support site, check for Windows 7 compatible drivers. If there are no Windows 7 drivers available, your hardware may not work correctly after downgrading.
If you built your own computer, or have a custom-built computer, you'll need to check each piece of hardware manually. Press ⊞ Win and type devmgmt.msc to open the Device Manager. Go through your list of hardware and visit each one's support site. Check for Windows 7 drivers for the piece of hardware you have from that manufacturer. If Windows 7 drivers aren't available, that piece of hardware may not work when you downgrade.

, If you want to save yourself some time after the downgrade, you can put all of the Windows 7 drivers you'll need on a USB drive and then set it aside until you're finished. This will allow you to quickly install all of your necessary drivers. The most important driver to include is your network adapter, as this will ensure that you can get online and download any other drivers., You'll need this disc to downgrade to Windows 7. It doesn't have to be your disc, as any Windows 7 Professional installation disc will work. If you don't have a disc, you can make one using software available for free from Microsoft:

Visit the Microsoft Windows 7 download page and enter the key from the previous step to download the ISO file.
After downloading the ISO file, insert a blank DVD or 4GB+ USB drive.
Download and install the Windows USB/DVD Download Tool.
Run the tool and select your Windows 7 Professional ISO as the ""Source."" Choose either your blank DVD or USB drive as the ""Destination."" The tool will then copy or burn the ISO, creating an installation disc or drive you can use.

, Downgrading to Windows 7 is essentially like installing a fresh operating system, which will delete all of the data on your drive. Make sure all of your important files are safely backed up to a USB drive or the cloud before you start the downgrade process. See Back up a Computer for more detailed instructions on backing up your data efficiently., This is required for computers that came with Windows 8 installed, but not for computers that were upgraded to 8 later. The UEFI is the interface that controls your computer, and is the modern version of a BIOS. Windows 7 doesn't support UEFI, so you'll need to set your UEFI settings to support the older BIOS method. The process is a different depending on your computer, but generally you can do this:

Press the ⊞ Win+C or swipe in from the right side of the screen to open the Charms bar.
Select ""Settings"" and then ""Change PC Settings.""
Click ""Update and recovery,"" then select ""Recovery."" Click ""Restart Now"" underneath the ""Advanced Startup"" header.
Select ""Troubleshoot"" when your computer reboots, then ""Advanced options.""
Click ""UEFI Firmware Settings"" and then click ""Restart.""
Find the ""Legacy boot"" or ""BIOS mode"" in the UEFI settings and enable it. Its location will vary by manufacturer.

, You'll see the traditional BIOS startup screen after rebooting, since you enabled it in the UEFI settings., The process for this will vary depending on your computer. Many computers will display a ""BOOT"" key during startup that will allow you to select a drive to boot from. If you don't see this, you'll need to press the BIOS or SETUP key. This will open your BIOS/UEFI menu. From here you can select the ""Boot"" menu and then choose your installation disc or drive., Press a key on your keyboard when prompted to begin the Windows 7 installation process. It will take a little while to load the initial setup., Choose your language and region settings in the first few Windows that appear., During the installation process, you'll be prompted to select a drive to install Windows 7 on. Choose the drive that currently has Windows 8 installed on it. Remember, this will delete everything that is currently stored on the drive., Towards the end of the installation process, you'll be prompted to enter your Windows 7 product key. Enter the key you obtained in the first section. If you have downgrade rights, this key does not have to be an unused key., After entering the key, Windows 7 will finish installing and you'll eventually be taken to the desktop. If you are using your downgrade rights, there's a good chance that you'll receive an ""Activation Failed"" message after Windows loads., Windows 7 will attempt to automatically activate when you load the desktop for the first time and you're connected to the internet. If you used an unused Windows 7 key during installation, activation should happen automatically without issue. If you are using your downgrade rights, your automatic activation likely failed.

If the Activation window doesn't appear, click the Start menu, type ""Activate,"" and then click ""Activate Windows.""

, When you're using your downgrade rights, you'll need to call the Microsoft activation hotline and provide your Windows 8 Pro key to prove that you are allowed to downgrade for free., if Microsoft is able to verify that you are entitles to downgrade privileges, you'll be given a special code to enter into the Activation window that will activate your copy of Windows 7.

If you're downgrading multiple computers, you can use the same key during the installation of each, but you'll have to call Microsoft to activate each one individually.

, Once you're activated, you can focus on installing your drivers. If you made a driver disk earlier, plug it in and start installing the drivers on it. If you didn't make a disk, run Windows Update and allow it to check for and download any available updates. Once this is finished, you can go back to the Device Manager and manually update any lingering hardware by right-clicking it and select ""Update Driver Software."""

,
Install Belvedere and open it up from your system tray, it will run on boot from now on automatically.

,
Under the Folders tab on the left, click the + to add a folder to monitor for incoming .torrents (your web browsers download folder, ie.,
Create rules for Belvedere to follow on the right side in the same tab.,
For description, name it ""Copy Windows 7 .torrents"".,
Repeat the process adding a new rule.,
Name it ""Copy Windows XP .torrents"" for the description.,
Repeat the rule one more time to make a third copy to the ""C:\Torrents\Orig"" folder created earlier, you will see why this is important later.,
Write another rule that will delete the .torrent from your Downloads folder so you won't build a huge messy stockpile and your web browsers download folder will be clean.,
Making each rule recursive will make sure that these actions are done in order and not all at once (otherwise it may delete your file before it copies to the other 3 locations).,
Now you're almost done!,
Open uTorrent and under Options/Preferences/Directories check the box ""Put new downloads in:"" and browse to your Downloads folder you made in the first step, not the one in your User folders.,
Remove any .torrents you currently have in your Downloads folder.,
Repeat all the same steps exactly in XP, only this time point uTorrent to automatically load .torrents from the other ""C:\Torrents\XP"" folder.,
By having uTorrent delete .torrents as they load, it will be easy to determine which OS needs which .torrent added, and that way if you delete a torrent and its data in one OS, it doesn't try to re-add it over again when you switch.",How to Download and Seed the Same Torrents Across a Dual Boot Windows XP and 7," ""C:\Downloads""). This may be on either OS or on a separate drive/partition.;

, It is an auto-scripting program that makes setting rules and actions for certain files a breeze. You can find it here:

,,, C:\users\YOURNAME\Downloads)

, Click the + button.

, Check the box Recursive. From the drop-down menu choose ""Extension"" ""is"" and type ""torrent"" in the blank field without the quotes. Under Do the following select ""Copy file"" to folder and browse to your ""C:\Torrents\7"" folder you created earlier. Finally check the Overwrite box to stop duplicate .torrent files just in case. Hit OK

, Only this time, make another copy for Windows XP to use., Choose Recursive, ""Extension"" ""is"" ""torrent"", ""Copy file"" to folder and browse to your ""C:\Torrents\XP"" folder you created earlier. Overwrite. Hit OK

, Name it ""Copy original .torrents"" with all the same settings.

, Name it ""Delete .torrents"", ""recursive"", ""extension is torrent"", only now under Do the following choose ""Send file to Recycling Bin"". Hit OK.

, Order them with ""Copy Windows 7 .torrents"" on top using the up and down arrows, followed by Copy XP, Copy Orig, and lastly ""Delete torrent"" on the bottom.

, Belvedere will sort your .torrents the instant you download one, but now we must tell uTorrent to monitor the torrent folder you made that corresponds with what OS your in now (ie. 7)

, Now check ""Automatically load .torrents from:"" and browse to the folder you made for the OS you're currently in (ie. C:\Torrents\7) and check ""Delete loaded .torrents"". Leave everything else unchecked and hit OK.


This setup requires uTorrent to start with Windows and be open when you download your .torrents, which can be changed under Options/Preferences/General.

, Go back into Belvedere and enable each rule, making sure delete torrents is last on the list. Test your setup by downloading a .torrent file. If all goes well, it should immediately disappear from your default download location and copies should be in all three Torrent folders, then just as quickly the .torrent in your ""7"" folder will disappear too, leaving a copy in the other OS's Torrent folder and in Orig. Open uTorrent and you will see it is already downloading.

,


Belvedere and uTorrent starting with both versions of windows, with uTorrent looking in its respective OS's Torrent folder, will push any .torrents you may have downloaded in XP into Windows 7's queue and vice versa, automatically loading them and continuing the download/seeding exactly as it was before when you switch OS's.

, The Orig folder is where you can go to get copies if you need them, while the rest stay empty."

Inside the given field, type or copy in “control firewall.cpl”. This will open the Windows Firewall page in a new window.;
, On the left-hand side of the page is a pane with a bunch of different options available. The fourth option down is the one you're looking for. It should say “Turn Windows Firewall on or off.” Click this to proceed.

, On this page are two different types of connections that you can manipulate. These are “Home or work (private) network location settings” or “Public network location settings.” These are worded slightly different in the different operating systems (OS), but they control the same things.

, If you want to disable your firewall only when you are at home or work, you will want to fill the “Turn off Windows Firewall (not recommended)” option, by clicking on the blank circle to the left of the option.


To turn off the firewall for “Public network location settings,” go back to the previous menu and select this option. Then select “Turn off Windows Firewall (not recommended)” in the next window.
Please note that disabling your Windows firewall, whether at home/work or in public networks, is not recommended as this can cause your device to be vulnerable to attacks. If you are going to disable it, you should make sure that you have an alternative firewall in place for protection.

, There are a lot of different firewall, and security suite, options out there, but you still need to check for the highest rated option. The reason for this is that a lot of antivirus and firewall options come packed with annoying ads and notifications that, because they are free, will pop up over and over.



PC Magazine has a reliable list of the top free firewalls available. Please note that some of these will have paid options, or may only be free trials. Also they may or may not contain pop ups or notifications.

, Whenever you install a piece of security software on your device, it is important to make sure that it can work without restriction. In order for you to do this, you will need to disable your current firewall or, in some cases, completely uninstall and replace your current security software. The reason for this is that one piece of software can think that the other is a virus trying to take over the system. This has led to a lot of worried users, so don’t be one of them. It is just best practice not to run different security suites at the same time (for instance, Norton AntiVirus and McAfee).

, As in all security, it is important to note that no piece of software is perfect. Because of this, you need to have security as a frame of mind. If you are online, try to stick to websites that you know and trust. Don’t download files from people or places you don’t know. While this may mean you can’t download that “early release” of Avengers: Age of Ultron, or whatever movie is currently popular, you are also making sure of the safety of both your device and the money you invested in it.

, In order to create a bootable disc from your Windows folder, you will need to have an i386 folder on your computer. You can find it at the root of your Windows installation hard drive. The typical location is C:\i386\.


Copy the folder to the WINXP folder you created in the first step. Make sure that you copy and not move the files. To ensure this, right-click on the i386 folder and select copy. Navigate to the WINXP folder, right-click, and select Paste. The files will begin copying. Depending on the speed of your computer, this could take a few minutes.
After copying, you should have an i386 folder in your WINXP folder. The directory should look like C:\WINXP\i386\.

, Navigate to the WINXP folder and right-click in the window. Select New, and then Text Document from the submenu. This will create a new text document in the WINXP folder. In the text document, type “Windows” without the quotes, and add a single space after it. Hit the Enter key once.


Click Save and set the filename as “WIN51”. Include the quotes to make sure that the file is saved without an extension.

, Depending on which version of Windows you originally installed, you will need to make specific copies of the file you just created. All the files that you create should be located in the WINXP folder.


XP Home: Make a copy of the file named WIN51IC.
XP Home SP1: make the above file plus one named WIN51IC.SP1
XP Home SP2: make the above files plus one named WIN51IC.SP2
XP Home SP3: make the above files plus one named WIN51IC.SP3
XP Pro: Make a copy of the file named WIN51IP.
XP Pro SP1: make the above file plus one named WIN51IP.SP1
XP Pro SP2: make the above files plus one named WIN51IP.SP2
XP pro SP3: make the above files plus one named WIN51IP.SP3

, If you have ever upgraded your Windows XP installation with a Service Pack, then you will need to upgrade your installation. This is because even though the system is upgraded when a Service Pack is installed, the installation file is not.

Click Start, press ""Run"" and type ""diskmgmt.msc"".,
Important precaution: In the following steps, you're going to change the active partition of your hard drive, sometimes called the ""boot partition"".,
Download HxD, a Hex Editor.,
Start HxD, click ""Extras -> Open Disk"", uncheck ""open as read-only"" and open your hard drive where Windows is installed on.,
Do not be afraid of what you see, it's easier than you may think.,
You have now set your new partition as the active partition (or ""boot"" partition as it's called sometimes).,
Reboot your computer, and it should boot from your new active partition.

",How to Change the Active Partition in Windows XP," It will look like this (image to the right). Look for the Hard Disk on which your system is installed on and remember the disk number (disk 0, disk 1 and so on). Then, look at the disk's partitions which are listed from left to right, and remember the partition number which you want to be the active partition (the left most partition is number 1, and so on).;
, Before you do that, make sure that you have installed Windows XP on the partition to be activated. If you set a new active partition and there is no Windows XP installed on that partition, the Windows XP boot loader will look for an operating system on the new active partition, but will fail to do so and your computer will not boot at all. In this example, I had already installed Windows XP on the partition to be activated. It's also possible to just copy your Windows XP installation from the old active partition to the new active partition, but not while that Windows XP installation is running.

, I cannot link to it here because wikiHow doesn't allow the download link for whatever reason, so just do a Google search for ""hxd"". You can download the portable edition which does not need to be installed. You can use any other hex editor you like, but it needs to be capable of opening system drives.

, You should have remembered the correct disk number from step 1 (note that HxD starts counting disks at 1 not 0 like the diskmgmt.msc).

, Let's go! What you see here is the first sector (sector 0) of your hard drive which contains the boot loader code, the master boot record and the partition table. Look for the last 5 lines of the first sector (sector 0). The sector ends with ""55 AA"". This is where the partition table is stored. It starts at offset 1BE and ends at 1FD. We need to change the ""bootable"" flag of our partitions. It can only have two states: ""80"" means bootable, and ""00"" means non-bootable. The bootable flags of the four primary partitions are located at offset 1BE, 1CE, 1DE and 1EE. Look at the image to the right where I highlighted the bootable flag of the four primary partitions. In my example, the first partition is bootable because the bootable flag says ""80"", while the second, third and fourth partitions are not bootable because their bootable flag says ""00"". So you may have already guessed what to do now, overwrite the old bootable flag with ""00"" and change the new partition's bootable flag to ""80"". Do not set two partitions as bootable, this is not allowed and may lead to a non-booting system. Only one of the four partitions may have the bootable flag set. DO NOT reboot your computer yet, you have to finish the next step first!

, Now there's one important thing left. When your computer boots and runs the Windows XP boot loader, it will look for the Windows XP startup bootstrap files. If these files are missing on your new active partition, your system won't boot. If you have installed Windows XP on different partitions on the same hard drive, the startup bootstrap files might only be present on the current active partition. So you'll have to copy these files from your old active partition to the new active partition. Have a look at the image to the right, where the needed files are highlighted (8 files). Do not include pagefile.sys, this is NOT needed. Copy these 8 files to your new active partition. In my example, I copied the 8 files from C: to D:. Again, important note: Windows XP has to be installed on your new active partition in order for this to work. If it's not, your system will not boot.

Download and install the EASEUS Partition Master (Free).,
Once installed, run the program.,
Depending on what partition you wish to change, the next steps may vary.,
Right click on the F: drive, and choose Resize/Move partition.,
Once the Resize/Move window is open, you can choose how much you would like to change the size of the partition.,
Press OK, and you will now notice a small box of grey at the end of the drive, labelled Unallocated.

,
To add that space to the E: drive, you must first move the Unallocated space beside the E: drive.,
Now that the Unallocated space is in the proper position, the E: drive can simply be dragged over until it meets the beginning of the F: drive, and all of the Unallocated space will be assigned to the E: drive.

,
You will notice on the left side of the screen, that there is a list of pending operations.,
Once the resize has been completed, check your drives to make sure the new sizes are shown.

",How to Change a Partition Size Using Easeus Partition Manager," Go to http://www.partition-tool.com/download.htm to download the latest home edition. There are professional editions that have more features and cost money, but the home version is free and is more than capable for resizing and moving partitions.;
, You should see a screen similar to this one:

, For this example, 2GB will be taken from the F: drive and added to the E: drive. Note: The unallocated space that is already there is only 7.8 MB, if that were a larger space then that could be used without changing the size of the F: drive at all.

, Note: You can also resize the partition by simply grabbing the right side of the bar and dragging it, but this is less exact. By opening the Resize/Move window an exact amount can be entered.

, For this example, the F: drive will be made smaller by 2GB, so the partition size is changed from 56282.4 to 54282.4, and then the Unallocated space is updated to 2000.0 MB.

,, To do this, simply click and drag the F: drive to the right, and the Unallocated space will be put in its place (between the F: and E:).

,, All of the operations that we require for this task have been completed, so we are now able to move forward and perform the partition resizing. To perform the operations, click on Apply in the bottom left of the screen, and answer yes to both prompts. Note: Clicking apply will restart the computer, so make sure you have no open programs or unsaved documents.


The actual process of changing the partition sizes and moving data may take longer depending on how much data is contained in that partition. For this example, the F: drive had 33GB to be moved and it took about 15 minutes.

Your personal files (Documents, Pictures, Downloads, any folder that you created, etc.) will be preserved. All of your computer's settings will be preserved as well.


If you upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1, refreshing will revert you back to Windows 8. You will need to download the Windows 8.1 update again after the refresh is complete.

, Windows allows you to create a custom refresh image that it can use instead of the default one. This image will keep all of your installed programs, including any you've downloaded or installed from a disc. This is an optional step, though some users that have upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 may need to do this to create a valid refresh image. This is a useful step to perform every time you install a new program, or after reinstalling Windows.Press ⊞ Win+X and select ""Command Prompt (Admin)"".
Type mkdir C:\recoveryimage and press ↵ Enter. You can change the name and location of the folder to whatever you'd like.

You may want to create the folder an external drive or USB drive.
Type recimg -CreateImage C:\recoveryimage and press ↵ Enter. Change the location if you changed it above.

, If you're still having the same problems after refreshing, you may need to perform a factory reset. Click here for detailed instructions.

, A corrupt registry could be causing problems with the Refresh tool. This fix will let you access the recovery tools, but you'll only be able to perform a full factory reset after doing so; the Refresh tool will not start at all.

For example, if you add someone from Facebook who has included his birthday in his profile, you will get a notification on this person's birthday. If you joined this person's birthday party event on Facebook, you would also see this notification here.

, Clicking the large ""What's new"" button on the main People screen will take you to a screen where you can see a selection of posts made by your contacts recently on social media. You can even click on each post individually to see who's commented on it and respond with a comment of your own.


These posts will be from any social networks you've imported contacts from. You may see posts from Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and more — all in one place.

, On the main People screen, you'll see a button that says ""Me"" in the top left next to your profile picture. Click this to see your personal feed for the social networks you've connected to through People. From here, you can post status updates by clicking in the corresponding boxes and typing your thoughts.

, Open the ""What's new"" screen from the main People screen. If you've connected to more than one social network, you will see a small downward-pointing arrow next to the title at the top of the screen. Clicking this will display a list of the social networks you're currently receiving updates from.

, If there are a few people that you're more interested in seeing updates from than others, pinning them to the Start menu will make it so that you don't have to open People to see their updates. To do this:Open the page of the contact you want in the contacts list.
Right click to bring the options tab up. If you have a touchscreen, you can also swipe up from the bottom of the screen.
Click the ""Pin to Start"" icon in the bottom right.
Click the second ""Pin to Start"" button to finalize. You can type in the text box to give this contact a nickname if you'd like. If you don't, People will use the real name.
You will now be able to see this person's icon in the Start menu. To remove it, right click on it and select ""Unpin from Start.""

, As mentioned above, each each individual contact's page will have options to start a Skype call if this person is already one of your Skype contacts. Look to the right of the person's name and picture for these options. ""Call"" starts a voice call. ""Send message"" starts a text chat. ""Video call"" starts a video call.

If you don't see the option to call your contact on Skype, you'll need to add him or her on Skype first. See our relevant article on adding contacts in Skype for Windows 8 for more help.

Select the ""Update and recovery"" option, and then Windows Update.
Click ""Check Now"" to check for any available updates, and install any that appear.;
, You can only download Windows 8.1 through the Windows Store (not through Windows Update). You can access the Store from the Start screen.

, It should be prominently displayed in the Store screen if you haven't updated yet.

, Your computer will reboot after the installation is complete.


Windows 8.1 actually lowers the amount of space that Windows takes up, so you may notice a slight increase in your free space after installing.

, Windows 8.1 comes with a built-in tutorial program that can explain how to navigate and find your way around the Windows 8.1 interface. This is great for Windows 8 newcomers and old pros alike.

, Select the ""Help+Tips"" app from the list of search results. You can also open the Apps screen and select it from the ""H"" section.

, Each category has some helpful text along with pictures and videos to show you how to get the most out of Windows 8.

, At the end of each tutorial section, there will be links to the Windows Support website. You can use these links to learn more details about how to use Windows 8 effectively.

, By default, Windows 8 boots to the Start screen, which is great for tablets but less useful for those looking for a standard Windows experience. Windows 8.1 allows you to set your computer to boot directly to Desktop mode, bypassing the Start screen.


Windows 8.1 Update, an automatic update available to all Windows 8.1 users, handles this process automatically by detecting a keyboard and mouse.

, Click the Navigation tab.

, Click Apply to save the changes.

, Now that you've made the change, every time you log into your Windows account or close all full-screen apps, you will be taken to the Desktop mode.

, Windows 8.1 adds the Start button back to the Desktop interface. While it won't open a traditional Start menu, it will quickly open the Windows Start screen., This is one of the most useful features added to Windows 8.1, as it allows you to quickly open the Control Panel, the Command Prompt, the Power Options, Disk Management, and a host of other utilities. If you are a power-user, this menu will prove invaluable.

, Besides quick access to utilities, right-clicking the Start button allows you to quickly log out of Windows, or shut down and restart the computer.

, If you switch back and forth between Desktop and Modern (the UI that Windows 8 uses), you may want to pin your most used Modern apps to your Desktop's taskbar. This will let you easily open them while in Desktop mode.

, You can pin any of your Live Tiles, or move down to the All Apps screen and pin any of the apps listed.

, This will add a shortcut to the app on your Desktop taskbar.

, This is especially useful if you want to get rid of the Store button that appears on the taskbar after updating to 8.1.

, With the Power button added to the Start screen, you can quickly access the Shutdown, Sleep, and Restart commands.

, While you could always start typing when on the Start screen to search, the Search button makes the tool much more obvious.

, Live Tiles allow you to see important information at a glance, but the default sizes of some tiles can make it difficult to organize your Start screen to your liking. You can resize any tile so that it takes up more or less space.


Right-click on the tile you want to resize and select ""Resize"". If you want to resize multiple tiles at once, hold down Ctrl while selecting them.
Select Small, Medium, Wide, or Large.

, By selecting multiple apps from the Start screen, you can delete them all at once, saving you a lot of time.


Hold down Ctrl and right-click on each app you want to delete.
Select ""Uninstall"" to remove the selected apps.

, If you move back and forth between your Desktop and the Start screen often, it can be jarring to have the background change each time. You can set your Start screen to share your Desktop background to help make switching between them a more seamless experience.Right-click on the taskbar in Desktop mode and select ""Properties"".
Click the Navigation tab.
Check the ""Show my desktop background on Start"" box and click Apply. Your Start screen will now have the same background as your Desktop.

, When you install apps in Windows 8.1, they are no longer added as tiles to your Start screen. This helps cut down on clutter, but can make them difficult to find at first.


Click or tap the Down button at the bottom of the Start screen to open the ""Apps"" screen. Your newly installed apps will be displayed first, with all of your installed apps displayed alphabetically after that.

, The Modern UI allows you to have multiple apps open on your screen at once by snapping them to the sides. Windows 8 only allowed two apps to be snapped side-by-side, but 8.1 allows you to snap up to four apps at once.

, You can even snap the Desktop view to one side and a Modern app to the other.

, This will allow you to place another app between them.

, Note that the number of apps that you can snap at once is dependent on your screen's resolution. Low resolution screens may not be able to snap more than two apps.

, Some apps will not work without enough screen space.

, Windows 8.1 can integrate the Bing search engine into your Windows Search utility, which can add a lot more functionality to your searches.


Open the Charms bar and select ""Settings"".
Click ""Change PC settings"".
Select the ""Search and apps"" option.
Toggle ""Use Bing to search online"" on.
Determine whether or not you want Bing to use your location when searching. Enabling this will allow Bing to deliver location-specific search results.

, You can click the ""Search"" button from the Start screen or simply start typing when the Start screen is open.

, Windows will search for any files or documents that match your search terms, as well as pull information from online that relates. You may find videos, images, biographies, and similar search terms that you can pick from.


The search function will also search any files that are stored on your OneDrive account.

, Windows 8.1 adds lots of useful settings options that you can change without having to open the Control Panel. This is especially useful if you just have a touchscreen device.

,, The Settings menu has seen lots of additions since the Windows 8.1 update.


PC and devices - You can adjust a lot of settings that were previously relegated to the Control Panel, including the display resolution, your connected devices, power options, and disk space.

, You can change how your files are synced and whether or not you want to save documents to OneDrive by default.


Open the Charms bar and select ""Settings"".
Select ""Change PC settings"" and then ""OneDrive"".

Right-click or swipe files to select them.
Use the menu that appears at the bottom to manipulate the files. You can move, rename, copy, paste, delete, and perform other basic file management tasks.
Click the ""OneDrive"" button at the top to switch to your local files. You can then perform the same actions on all of your local files and documents.

, Libraries were added in Windows 7, and they allow you to quickly locate your files that are spread out across a variety of folders. They were carried over into Windows 8, but the Windows 8.1 update hides them from view. They're not gone though; they just need to be re-enabled.You can open the File Explorer by clicking the File Explorer icon in the taskbar, or by pressing ⊞ Win+E


,, Your libraries will now appear beneath ""This PC"" in the sidebar.

, You can create as many custom libraries as you want, and add folders from your computer and even removable drives. Click here for tips on getting the most out of Windows libraries.

, While you're waiting for Winabler to finish installing, you'll want to navigate to the greyed-out Windows Activation box if you don't still have the menu open.

, Do so by double-clicking the Winabler icon--it should be in the location you chose during setup.


Winabler installs to your desktop by default.

, Doing so should unlock the button.


The button may appear grey, but you should be able to click it after dropping the crosshairs onto it.
If the box remains unclickable, try checking the Repeatedly enable objects that continually disable themselves box in the Winabler window and trying again.

,, Doing so will save your settings and prevent the Windows 8 activation messages from popping up.

, The only long-term fix for those pesky Windows activation messages is to verify your version of Windows 8.
