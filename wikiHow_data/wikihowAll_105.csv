If you received your copy of Windows 8 as a downloadable ISO file from Microsoft, you can skip to the next section.;
, Open your new burning program. Look for an option such as “Copy to Image” or “Create Image.” If prompted, select your DVD drive as the source.

, Choose an easy to remember name and location for the file. The ISO you make will be equal in size to the disc you are copying. This means it can take up several gigabytes of space on your hard drive. Be sure you have enough storage available.


Creating the ISO can take a long time, depending on the speed of your computer and DVD drive.

, This is available for free from Microsoft. Despite its name, this tool works with Windows 8 ISOs as well. You can run this tool on virtually any version of Windows.

, This is the ISO that you created or downloaded in the first section. Click browse to navigate to the file. Once you’ve selected it, click Next.

, The download tool will allow you to create either a DVD or USB install. Click the USB Device.

, Make sure that your flash drive is connected correctly. You will need at least 4GB space on your flash drive to copy over the Windows installation. Click Begin Copying.

, The program will format the USB drive to boot and then copy the ISO file onto the drive. The copying process can take up to 15 minutes to complete, depending on the speed of your machine., To boot from the USB drive, you will have to set the BIOS to boot from USB first instead of the hard drive. To open the BIOS, reset your computer and hit the displayed key to enter Setup. The key varies by manufacturer, but is usually F2, F10, F12, or Del.

, Change the 1st Boot Device to your USB drive. Be sure that it is inserted, or you may not be given an option to choose it. Depending on your manufacturer, it may say Removable Device or list your flash drive’s model.

, If you set the boot order correctly, your Windows 8 installation will load after the manufacturer’s logo disappears.

, Once the Windows 8 installation begins, you will be prompted to select a language, time and currency format, and keyboard layout. Once you select these, click Next.

, This will begin the installation process. The other option is for repairing an existing Windows installation.

, This is the 25 character key that came with your purchased copy of Windows 8. It may be located on a sticker on your computer or underneath your laptop.


You do not need to enter the dashes between the groups of characters.

, Once you have read the agreement, check the box signifying that you accept the agreement and click next.

, You will have two options to install windows. Picking Custom will allow you to do a complete installation of Windows 8. Selecting upgrade can cause performance problems in the long run. It is highly recommended that you do a clean Custom Install.

, A window will open asking where you would like to install Windows 8. In order to perform a clean install, you need to delete the old partition and start with a clean slate. Click “Drive options (advanced).” This will give you the ability to delete and create partitions.


Select the partition of your existing operating system and click the Delete button.






If you are installing an operating system for the first time on this hard drive, then there will be no partitions to delete.






If your hard drive has multiple partitions, be sure to delete the correct one. Any data on a deleted partition is lost for good.
Confirm the deletion process., There is no need to create a partition before you install Windows 8, this is done automatically.

, The percentage next to Expanding Windows files will steadily increase. This part of the process can take up to 30 minutes.


Windows will automatically restart your computer when finished.







, After the computer reboots, you will see the Windows 8 logo. Beneath it will be the text “Getting devices ready” followed by a percentage. Windows is collecting information on the hardware installed in your computer.


When this is done, the text will change to “Getting ready”.
Your computer will restart one more time.

, Once the computer finishes rebooting, you will be asked to pick the color scheme for your installation of Windows 8.


You can change the color at any time in the Windows 8 settings.

, This is the name that the computer displays on the network. Any other device on the network will see your computer listed with this name.

, If you have a wireless-enable computer or device, you will see a menu asking you to choose a network. If you haven’t installed the driver for your wireless card yet, this step will automatically be skipped., The most common option is Express Settings, which will enable automatic updates, Windows Defender, and error reporting to Microsoft, among other things.If you’d rather set these yourself, choose Customize instead of Express Settings.







, To log in to Windows, you will need an account. Microsoft recommends using a Microsoft account, so that you can make purchases in the Windows store. If you don’t have a Microsoft account, entering a valid email address will create one for free.


If you don’t have an email address, click the “Sign up for a new email address” link to create one. This requires an internet connection.






If you’d rather sign in the old way, without using a Microsoft account, click the bottom link. This will create a login similar to previous versions of Windows.

, Most laptops are not able to run Metro apps as the screen resolution is not high enough. This is true of many netbooks, therefore it is better to uninstall any apps you do not use. But remember,even if you cannot run the Metro apps,you will still be able to run all of the software you use on Windows XP and Windows 7, and access all of the computer settings.

Best practice is to run with a limited user account and turn UAC on so that an alternative username and password with administrative rights is required for any process requiring core system access.

The hard drive will be empty and need to be either initialized by another operating system for storage or have an operating system installed on it.


This will delete everything on the drive, so make sure anything you need to save has been properly backed up. You will not be able to use data recovery software on the drive afterwards to retrieve anything you forgot.
If Windows 8 is your only operating system, you won't be able to use the computer until you install a new operating system or reinstall Windows 8.
Do not use this method if you have a solid state drive (SSD). If you are formatting an SSD, the best way is to simply reinstall your operating system on it. Do not use traditional data-wiping methods when trying to completely format an SSD. These can drastically reduce the lifespan and may not actually remove any data.

, DBAN is downloaded in ISO format, which is a disc image file. This allows you to burn it to a disc so that you can boot your computer from it. You can use a free burning tool like ImgBurn to burn the ISO to a disc. Click here for detailed instructions.

, There are several settings you can change, but most users can simply leave everything at default.


Press P to open the ""PRNG"" menu. This stands for Pseudo Random Number Generator, which is the algorithm used to wipe the drive. There are two different algorithms to choose from.
Press M to open the ""METHODS"" menu. These are the number of passes that DBAN will make over the drive. More passes means a more secure erase, but also significantly increases the time it will take. If you're just wiping the drive to reinstall, you can choose one of the lighter-security methods. If you're wiping to erase sensitive data before recycling the drive, select one of the more secure methods.
Press R to set the number of ""ROUNDS"". This is the number of times the wipe process will be run. More rounds means a more secure wipe.

, DBAN will use the methods you picked to begin overwriting all of the sectors on your drive. You will be able to see the time remaining in the upper-right corner., Now that your hard drive is wiped, you can move on to doing whatever it is you want to do with it.


If you want to reinstall Windows 8 or install another operating system on it, click here. This will format the drive and install the operating system. If you wiped your only hard drive with an operating system installed, you'll need to install an operating system before you can use it again.

The columns have the following headings (from left to right): “Drive,” “Media type,” “Last run,” and “Current status.” Highlight the drive you want to optimize by clicking/tapping on it.


For each drive listed, you will see its Current Status in the last column, which tells you how fragmented your drive is and advises you on what to do (“OK,” meaning “no need to defrag,” or “Needs Optimization”).

, Click/tap the Start button which is located at the bottom left-hand corner of your desktop to open the Start menu. Hitting the Windows key on your keyboard has the same effect as clicking the Start button.

Clicking “Properties” opens the Properties dialog box in a separate window. You will see several tabs, one of which is labeled Tools. Click the Tools tab then click the “Optimize” button in the Tools tab.

, This will analyze the extent of fragmentation of the drive. After a few minutes, the Current Status column opposite the drive you are testing will show you (in percentage) how fragmented the drive is. It is recommended that you optimize your drive only if it is 10% or more fragmented.


If the fragmentation is less than 10%, click/tap the “Close” button at the bottom right side of the window to exit Optimize drives. It is not advisable to defragment your drive too often as this will contribute to the wear and tear of your hard drive.

, The defragmentation will take some time (several minutes or even hours) depending on how large the capacity of your hard drive is, how many files are in your hard drive, and how fragmented these files are. The Current Status column will give a real-time report on the progress of optimization.


You will know if the defragging process is finished when the running progress report stops and the entry in the Current Status column becomes “OK.” Enclosed in parentheses beside “OK” is the percentage of defragmentation (0% if your hard drive is not too full).
If your hard disk is large and there are many files and many of these files are fragmented, the defragging process may take hours to complete. In this instance, it would be better to start the defragging process and do some other things: read a book, do housework, take a nap, etc.

, When the defrag process is finished, click the “Close” button at the bottom right hand of the window to exit Optimize Drives.

Press ⊞ Win+X or right-click on the Start button and select ""Power Options"".
Open the Charms bar, select Settings, then ""Change PC Settings"", and then click Control Panel. Select Power Options from the Control Panel menu.
Press ⊞ Win+R, type powercfg.cpl, and press ↵ Enter.;
, This is located in the left frame of the window.

, You may be prompted to enter the administrator password.

, This will enable the Hibernate option when you open the Shutdown menu. Click Save changes

, By default, the Power button on your computer will completely shut the computer down, and the Sleep button will put it into Sleep mode. You can change either of these buttons to ""Hibernate"" by using the drop-down menus.

, See the first step in the previous section for instructions on opening this menu.

, Your active plan will have the selection button highlighted.

, This will open a smaller Power Options window.

, This will allow you to change your Sleep settings.

, There are three basic sleep options you can choose from: Sleep, Hibernate, and Hybrid Sleep. The one you choose will depend on your power and resuming needs.Sleep - Sleep mode stores all of your open programs in the computer's RAM and then enters a low-power mode. You can quickly resume your computer within a few seconds. If you're using a laptop, this will still drain your battery, though much slower than if the computer was use.
Hibernate - All of your open programs are stored to the hard disk and then the computer is completely shut down. This will draw zero power, as opposed to Sleep mode which has a small power draw. You'll still be able to resume your week like Sleep mode, but starting up will take a few seconds longer.
Hybrid Sleep - This is a combination of Sleep and Hibernate, and is designed for desktop computers that are always plugged in. The open programs and documents are stored to both the memroy6 and the hard disk, and then the computer is put into a low-power state. In the case of a power outage or interruption, you can still resume because the data was stored on the hard disk.

, This will let you set how long your computer will idle before it switches to Hibernate.


If you don't see the ""Hibernate after"" option, click the ""Change settings that are currently unavailable"" link at the top of the window. You may be prompted for the administrator password.
Consider using Hybrid Sleep if you have a desktop instead of Hibernate. Your desktop will reboot faster, but it will take slightly more power than Hibernate. You can enable Hybrid Sleep by expanding the ""Allow hybrid sleep"" option.

, These two will conflict with each other, so expand ""Sleep after"" and set it to ""Never"" if you enabled Hibernate in the previous step.

, After your computer has been inactive for the time you specified, your computer will perform the Sleep or Hibernate action you set.

, Some video cards do not support all of the Sleep options in Windows. Usually updating your drivers will enable these functions, but if your card is older you may not get the option.


Visit the video card manufacturer's website. You can determine the manufacturer by typing dxdiag into the Run box (⊞ Win+R) and selecting the Display tab.
Download the latest driver for your video card. Both Nvidia and AMD have tools on their websites which will automatically detect your video card and download the newest drivers. You can also search the website for your specific model, which you can find in the ""dxdiag"" window.
Run the installer and follow the prompts. The update process will be mostly hands-off. Your screen may shut off or flicker during the installation. Click here for more detailed instructions on updating your video drivers.

, The availability of your Sleep options is determined by your motherboard's BIOS settings. Normally, these are all enabled, but on some motherboards you may have to enable the functionality yourself. The following method of accessing your BIOS only refers to computers that came with Windows 8 installed. If you installed Windows 8 on an older machine, click here for details on accessing the BIOS.


Open the Charms bar and click Settings. Hold ⇧ Shift and click on the Power button. Select ""Restart"".
Click the ""Troubleshooting"" option in the Advanced Startup menu.
Select ""UEFI Firmware Settings"". Find the options that allow you to enable the various Sleep modes (locations vary by manufacturer).

Most, if not all, of these buttons should be blank with a + icon in the middle. Clicking on a + icon will pop up a menu with a few different app options on it. The number of apps will be different, depending on how many you have downloaded and installed. Simply click on an app to add it to the Quick Status. Keep doing this for as many as you like. You should see the + icon replaced with the icon for the app you have selected.

, Once you have completed your selection, you will want to test and make sure that you have the number of apps that you would like and that they display properly. You may need to remove some of the apps you have added to your list. To test and see how everything looks, go ahead and press and hold the Windows key on your keyboard, and then hit L. This will take you to your lock screen, where you will be able to see your Quick Status apps.


You will need to enter your password again to log into your account.

, If you have found that you would like to remove some of the apps that you have added to your Quick Status list, you can easily remove them. Simply go back to the Lock Screen settings (Start>>Settings>>Personalization>>Lock Screen). Scroll down to the bottom, and click the icon of the app you would like to remove. From the pop-up menu select either “None” at the top of the list, or the app you would like to take its place.

, It can be easy to just select some apps and just leave them there, but remember that things change over time. You will no doubt download more apps, so make sure to check your Quick Status from time to time. That way you may just find that an app you use more often, like Crackle for example, would fit better in the Quick Status. In order to check this, when you click the + icon, or current app icon, you should see a list of available apps. Select the new app by single-clicking it from the list, and there you go! Enjoy your new Quick Status apps!

, From the list given, click the “Accounts” option. You should now see a new page with a series of five different menu options down the left-hand side of the window.

, When you first log into Windows, you have the ability to log into a Local account or a Microsoft account. Most all Microsoft accounts will be an email address “@live.com,” “@outlook.com,” or “@hotmail.com.” Local accounts will simply have a username, and these accounts cannot sync between devices.


The same account will be used to sync all the information between each of your devices, so don’t forget which email you used.

, From the given list back on the Accounts menu, go ahead and click the bottom option, which should be “Sync your settings.” You should see your Microsoft account email listed at the top of the window. It should say “Sync Windows settings to other devices using “youremail@hotmail.com,” where “youremail@hotmail.com” is the email address of the current account that is logged in.

, Under the heading “Individual sync settings,” you should see a series of six different options to enable or disable. These are Theme, Web Browser Settings, Passwords, Language Preferences, Ease of Access Settings, and Other Windows Settings. Each of these are pretty straightforward in showing you what they will be syncing; however, the last one is a bit different. “Other Windows Settings” syncs settings from mouse, printers, File Explorer, and perhaps Taskbar position. By default, each of these should already be activated.


If you would like to disable an option, simply click the white dot. It should change to black and be labeled “Off.” Once you have selected the options you would like, the settings should automatically be saved.
Please note you must have Internet access in order for your settings to be transferred to a different Windows 10 device.

, Once you have another Windows 10 device in front of you, you will need to log in with the same Microsoft account you used above. When you first created a new account on your Windows 10 device, all sync settings would have been turned on by default, so everything should be synced automatically.


If you have made any changes to your sync settings on another device, you will need to make sure that the settings you just enabled on your other Windows 10 device are identical on this Windows 10 device as well.

This will open the “Settings/Personalization” menu. The “Personalization” window is divided into two panes: the left pane contains the things you can personalize and the right pane contains personalization options available for what is highlighted in the left pane.


Another way of accessing the “Settings/Personalization” menu is to click/tap the Windows icon at the bottom left of the desktop. Select “Settings” from the Start menu. This opens the “Settings” window. From the “Settings” window, choose (by clicking/tapping) “Personalization”. This will open the “Settings/Personalization” menu.;
, By default (because it is the first on the list in the left pane), the “Background” section is highlighted when you open the “Personalization” menu. If the “Background” section is not highlighted, click/tap on it so that “Background” is highlighted.


When you choose (highlight) the “Background” section, the options for setting or changing the desktop background appears in the right pane. At the top of the right pane, you will see a preview of the desktop background. This changes as you choose the background you want.

, Below the preview pane is a choice box labeled “Background,” from which a drop-down menu of background types will appear. Click/tap this “Background” choice box and choose “Picture” from the drop-down menu that will appear. When you select “Pictures,” the “Choose your picture” option will appear below the choice box.

, Below the “Choose your picture” label are four thumbnails (small previews of larger pictures). These are either the sample pictures provided by Windows 10 or the most recent pictures that you used as desktop background. Clicking/tapping one of these will set that picture as your desktop background. You will notice that when you choose a picture, the preview pane will reflect your choice and your desktop background is changed to the selected picture.

, If none of the sample or recent pictures is the one you want, click the “Browse” button located below the thumbnails in order to look for and select a picture you have on file. A dialog box labeled “Open” will appear. By default, the “Open” dialog box opens to the “This PC >> Pictures” folder. If the picture you want is not in the “This PC >> Pictures” folder, navigate to the folder where your preferred picture is located using the folders on the left pane and/or double-clicking (or double-tapping) the folders on the right pane.


When you have located your preferred picture, click on it and then click “Choose picture,” which is located at the bottom left part of the “Open” dialogue box. After you click “Choose picture,” the “Open” dialog box closes, and your desktop background will be changed to the picture you selected.
If you are satisfied with the fit of your picture with respect to your desktop (that is, the picture is not pixelated or distorted when made as a desktop background) you only have to close the “Personalization” window and you’re done. If you are not satisfied with how your selected picture looks like as a desktop background, you must determine how the selected background picture will fit into the desktop screen.

, Digital pictures (photos, images, patterns) come in different sizes, proportions and dimensions. So do computer or tablet screens. Thus, in some cases, pictures will look distorted or pixelated when used as desktop background. Windows 10 allows you to choose how the picture will fit into your desktop screen. To do this, click/tap the choice box labeled “Choose a fit,” which is located below the “Browse” button.


If you choose “Fill,” your selected picture will be resized so that it will fill up the whole screen. The picture will not be distorted as it will be resized proportionately. Note that “Fill” is the default fit.
If you choose “Fit,” your selected picture will be resized proportionately until either its height or width reaches the boundaries of the screen.
If you choose “Stretch,” your selected picture will be stretched to fit the screen with no regard to proportion. “Stretch” will cause distortions to pictures whose dimensions differ significantly from that of the screen. “Stretch” can work with certain patterns and images (for example, an aerial view of a forest or clouds in the sky).
If you choose “Tile,” the size of the picture will not be changed. Instead, the picture will be multiplied and put side by side until the entire screen is covered. “Tile” works particularly well with small patterns.
If you choose “Center,” your selected picture will be placed at the center of the screen without the picture being resized. If the size and dimensions of the picture is smaller than that of the screen, the space around the selected picture will be surrounded by a solid color.
“Span” will place one portion of the picture in one monitor and continue it in the other monitors.

, Once the picture background is set the way you want it, just close the “Personalization” window. To do this, click/tap the “Close” button (×) at the upper right-hand corner of the window. That’s it. You have successfully changed your desktop background to show a preferred picture.

“Alternate Shell” loads Windows without its graphical user interface. You will have to work with the text-based command prompt. Needless to say, this option requires advanced knowledge of the Windows operating system.
“Active Directory Repair” loads machine-specific information found in Active Directory and is used to restore your computer’s stability by storing new or repaired information in the Active Directory. Using this safe mode option requires advanced computer knowledge.
“Network” loads Window’s graphical user interface with networking enabled. This is best used when Windows becomes unstable and you need to download or upgrade a driver or a patch. In Network safe mode, you can connect to the Internet or your network. You can also backup your data on your local network before you do any troubleshooting.

, This can help you identify what's on this disc later. Including the date in the name can help organize your discs.

, There are two options when it comes to burning a data disc: Live File System or Mastered.


Using the Live File System allows you to add, edit, and delete files on the disc as long as you're using it with other Windows computers. If you select this option, the disc will be formatted before you can start adding files to it. This formatting process may take a few minutes.
Mastered finalizes the disc when you're done adding files so that it can't be changed, but will allow you to use the disc in any computer or device that supports data DVDs.

, Once you've selected your disc format, you can start adding files to the disc. Single-layer DVDs can fit 4.7 GB of data. There are a couple of different ways that you can add files to your blank disc:


Click and drag files into the blank DVD's window.
Right-click on a file or folder and select ""Send to"" and then your disc drive.

, If you're using the Live File System format, the files will be burned to the disc as soon as you copy them. This may take a few moments for larger files.

, When you're done adding files to your disc, you can finish the process by either closing the session (Live File System) or by burning the disc (Mastered).


Live File System - Click the Close session button at the top of the disc's window. This will finalize the disc which allows you to continue using it like a USB drive in other Windows computers.
Mastered - Click the Burn to disc button at the top of the disc's window. You'll be given the opportunity to name the disc again and select your recording speed. The burn process may take several minutes to complete. At the end of the burning process, you'll be given the opportunity to burn the same data to another blank disc if you need copies.

, You can continue to add files to your burned DVDs as long as there is still free space available. You can do this regardless of which format you created the disc in. Follow the processes above to add more files.


Live File System - Every time you open a new session on a disc, you lose about 20 MB of usable space.
Mastered - Files added to an already-burned disc cannot be deleted.

, DVD-RW discs are rewritable, and can be erased even if you chose the Mastered format. To erase the disc, insert it and open Windows Explorer. Select your DVD-RW in your list of devices, but don't open it. Click the Erase this disc button at the top of the window."

Drag and drop your video file into the bottom frame.,
Edit your menus.,
Burn your DVD when you're satisfied.",How to Burn a DVD in Windows 72," If you want to burn a movie file so that it plays on any DVD player, you'll need special ""DVD authoring"" software. There are lots of these programs available, but DVD Styler is free and open-source. You can download it from dvdstyler.org/en/downloads.Chrome may report the DVDStyler installation file as malware. If you get this warning, use a different browser to download the installer.
Pay attention when installing the program. As of 6/6/2015, the Windows 64-bit installer did not bundle any adware, but this may change in the future. Read every installation screen carefully.

, When you launch DVD Styler for the first time, you'll be taken to the New Project window. There are a few settings you can adjust here before adding your video file(s):


Disc label - This is the name that will appear when the disc is inserted in a computer.
Disc capacity - Most DVDs are DVD-5 (4.7 GB). If you have Dual Layer (DL) discs, select DVD-9 (8.5 GB).
Video/Audio bitrate - This affects the quality of the video and audio. Most users can leave these at their defaults.
Video Format - Choose PAL if you live in a PAL region (Europe, Asia, Brazil) or NTSC for NTSC regions (Americas, Japan, Korea). You will be prompted to change this if you add media that is in a different format.
Aspect Ratio - Choose 4:3 if you're going to play the DVD on a standard definition television. Choose 16:9 if you're going to play the DVD on an HDTV. Note that this will not affect the aspect ratio of the actual video file.
Audio Format - You can choose between AC3 or MP2. Most users can leave this on AC3.

, DVD Styler comes with several menu templates that you can choose from. You can also select ""No template"", which will just start playing the video as soon as the disc is inserted.

, This will add the video to your project. DVD Styler supports most video formats so you won't need to convert before adding.


The bar at the bottom of the window will display how many minutes of video you have used and how many you still have free.
Depending on the type of video you're adding, you may be able to add multiple files. For example, you can usually fit 4-6 episodes of a TV show onto a single DVD, or a single full-length movie and some extras.

, Once you've added your video files, you can edit your menus to your liking. Double-click on any of the elements to edit them, and you can click and drag objects to move them around the menu.


Double-clicking on button objects in the menu editor will allow you to change their navigation commands.

, Once you've set all of your options, you can start burning the DVD. Insert a blank disc and click the ""Burn"" button at the top of the window. This will give you several different options. Click Start when you're ready:


""Temp directory"" - You can set the folder that you want DVD Styler to store the temporary files during the burning process. These will be deleted once the burn is complete. You will need enough free space for about twice the size of the disc.
""preview"" - Check this box if you want to preview the disc in your media player program before burning it.
""just generate"" - This saves the project to your hard disk in the DVD Folder format, which can then be burned later.
""create iso image"" - This saves an image of the disc to your hard drive in ISO format. You can then burn or share this ISO file.
""burn"" - This will burn the project to a blank DVD. You can then use this DVD in any DVD player that supports DVD-R/RW discs.

Right-click on the ISO file and select ""Burn disc image"".,
Select the drive that contains the blank disc.,
Click .Burn to begin burning the ISO.,
Use the burned disc.",How to Burn a DVD in Windows 73," ISO files are disc image files. These are essentially exact copies of a disc, and burning them to a DVD will make the DVD act as if it was the source of the ISO. ISO files cannot be burned as data files if you want the disc to be a copy.


Windows 7 has ISO-burning capabilities built-in.

, This will open the ""Burn Disc Image"" window.

, If you have more than one disc drive, make sure that the correct one is displayed in the ""Disc burner"" drop-down menu.

, You can choose to verify the disc after burning, but this will take extra time and there's nothing that can be done with a disc that doesn't work anyway. The burn process will likely take a few minutes, depending on the size of the ISO and the speed of your burner., Once the ISO has been burned, the disc will act as an exact copy of the source of the ISO. For example, if the ISO file is for a Linux installation disc, your burned disc will now be bootable and can be used to install Linux or run it from the disc.

To navigate deeper into the hard drive, use the ""change directory"" command by typing ""cd.""
For example, if your files are stored at ""C:\myfiles,"" then you should type ""cd \myfiles.""
To go directly to the directory, hold down shift and right click on the folder in explorer. Then select ""Open command window here"".

, You will need to run the jar.exe utility to create a JAR file, and that file is located in the bin directory.


Use the ""path"" command to specify the JDK bin directory. For example, if you installed JDK to the default location, you would type: ""path c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_09\bin""
If you aren't sure of the exact directory, navigate to it in Windows Explorer and take note of the directory's full path.

, The format of the command line for creating the JAR file looks like this: ""jar cf 'jar-file'.jar input-file(s).""


The ""jar"" portion refers to the jar.exe program, which compiles the JAR file.
The ""c"" option specifies that you want to create a JAR file
The ""f"" option means that you want to specify the filename.
The ""jar-file"" portion is where you should type the name that you want the file to have.
""Input-file(s)"" is a space-separated list of all the files to be included in the JAR file.
For example, you might type ""jar cf myjar manifest.txt myclass.class."" This would create a JAR file with the filename ""myjar.jar"" which would include the files ""manifest.txt"" and ""myclass.class.""
If you add directories to the JAR file, the jar.exe utility will automatically add their contents.

Avoid adding too many folders to the index. The purpose of the index is to speed up searching by checking your most-used files and folders first. If you add too many, the index will slow down, defeating its purpose.

To do this, open the Run dialog (Windows key + R) and type “msconfig”. This will open the System Configuration box. Click the Boot tab, and then check the “Safe boot” box. This will allow you to select what kind of Safe Mode you would like to use. The most common choices will be Minimal and Networking (see next step)., After hitting F8, you will be taken to the ""Advanced Boot Options"" screen. At the top of the list will be three different ways to load Safe Mode. If you set Windows to boot directly to Safe Mode, you won’t see this menu.


Safe Mode - This is the best option if you aren't sure what you should choose. This option will load the fewest drivers necessary to boot Windows 7. You will not be able to connect to the internet. This is the “Minimal” option when setting Windows to boot to Safe Mode.
Safe Mode with Networking - This option loads all the drivers and files that the first option does, but also loads any processes that are needed to allow networking. Choose this option if you think you'll need to get on the internet or your local network while troubleshooting.
Safe Mode with Command Prompt - This mode loads the same processes as the first option but gives you immediate access to the command prompt. This option is suited for advanced users who need to do troubleshooting from the command line. The Windows graphical environment will not be loaded.

, The next screen will show every file that is being loaded. You don't need to do anything while this is happening unless the files do not all load correctly. If the screen freezes at this point, make a note of the last file that successfully loaded and then search the internet for troubleshooting tips based on that information.

, When the login screen appears, log in to an account with administrator privileges. If you only have 1 user account on your computer, it is likely that it has administrator privileges. If you only have one account and no password, you will most likely be logged in automatically.

, You will know if your computer is in Safe Mode because ""Safe Mode"" will be written in all four corners of the screen. Safe Mode is a great place to run virus and malware scans, uninstall troublesome programs, and edit the registry.


When you are finished in Safe Mode, reboot your computer to return to a normal Windows 7 session.
If you set your computer to boot into Safe Mode through the System Configuration box, you will need to open it again while you are in Safe Mode and uncheck the “Safe boot” option in the Boot tab. If you don’t, your computer will continue booting into Safe Mode when it restarts.

This can be done by typing Settings in your Window's search bar and then accessing Settings > System > About. It is here you will find the system type.;
, Click green Download Anaconda button and scroll down to download options for Windows OS. Double clicking on system type – 32 bit or 64 bit – will begin the installer download. Be sure to download the latest version of Python!


Anaconda is a Python distribution, with installation and package management tools. It comes with Spyder IDE which is a software for debugging, visualization and code development. 

, After the installer has downloaded (.exe file), open the location of the file and double click it to begin installing Anaconda. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Anaconda into a known folder ex. C:\Anaconda2\.


Depending on your user settings your path may include a user's name as well. ex. C:\Users\Numra\Anaconda2\. In this case the proceeding path names should match this.







, After installation, you can access Spyder by locating your Anaconda2 folder and accessing the Scripts folder (ex. C:\User\Numra\Anaconda2\Scripts). Locate and double click the Spyder application to open it.

, To get used to Python, you should create a very short program that allows for user input and produces an output in order to test your code in Command Prompt.


Begin by creating a new file by clicking the ctrl and n key simultaneously on your keyboard. You may also use do this by accessing the menu bar and going to the ""File"" tab and hitting ""New File...""

, To prompt the user to input a string while concurrently obtaining the inputted data, use the command: var = raw_input. For example, var = raw_input (""Please enter something: ""). You may replace what is between the quotes with whatever you choose., To print the inputted data, use the command: print. For example, print ""you entered "", var. Again, you may replace what is between the quotation marks with whatever you wish to be displayed.

Note: “var” simply represents a variable and may be changed as long as you change it in every instance where it occurs in the code.

, Click File > Save As and save the file into an easily accessible folder.

Avoid using spaces when naming the file; instead you may use underscores or hyphens.

,, Type Control Panel in Windows' search bar. Then access: Control Panel > All Control Panel Items > System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables > System Variables > Path. Then click Edit.

, This can be found on the top bar of your Spyder Editor.



Exclude file name, in this case “Say_Something.py”.

,, Type command prompt in Windows' search bar. Then click on its icon to access it., Type cd, hit the spacebar, then enter name of the folder where your Python code is saved. Next click the ↵ Enter key. This allows you to access the folder housing your code.


Note: If your code file is within multiple folders, start by typing the outermost folder; then repeat the process until you are in the main folder housing your file.

, Now you will run the Python file by typing python then hitting the spacebar and then entering the name of your file with “.py” added to the end. Then click the ↵ Enter key. For example, your line may read C:\Users\Your_Name_Here\.spyder>python Say_Something.py.

Note: If your file requires an input prior to producing any output to the user, add a space after your file name and the “.py” , then enter your input before clicking the ↵ Enter key.

, When installing DOSBox, you may find it easier to change the installation location to C:\DOSBox instead of using the default location.


Change C: to whatever drive letter you want DOSBox installed on.

, Games that you download will be placed here. This folder will be mounted as a virtual drive in DOSBox.


For example, if you installed DOSBox at C:\DOSBox\, create a folder in the same location like C:\DOSGAMES


, There are tons of sites that host old DOS games that can be downloaded free and legally. Search for ""abandonware"" sites. ""Abandonware"" are programs made by companies that no longer exist and that have no retail means to purchase. Place the downloaded files in their own folder inside the games folder you created in the previous step.


You can also copy the files from old installation disks you may have lying around (if you still have a floppy drive).

, You will be taken to the virtual command prompt Z:\>., It is not safe to mount your entire hard drive in DOSBox, so instead you'll be mounting your games folder as a virtual drive. The games folder will act as a hard drive.


Type mount C C:\DOSGAMES and press ↵ Enter. Type C: and press ↵ Enter. Your input will change to C:\>.
For Macs, change the locations as appropriate (e.g mount C ~/DOSGAMES)

, Insert the CD into your computer's disc drive. Type in the following mounting command:


Type mount D D:\ -t cdrom and press ↵ Enter. Replace D:\ to the drive letter of your disc drive. Type D: and press ↵ Enter. Your input will change to D:\> and you can navigate through the CD's files.

cdrom needs to be lowercase.

, If you have an ISO file for the game CD you want to play, you can mount it as if it was an actual disc.


Type imgmount D C:\ImagePath\image.iso -t iso and press ↵ Enter. Replace C:\ImagePath\image.iso with the actual location and filename of the ISO file.

, If you have a BIN/CUE file for the game CD you want to play, you can mount it as if it was an actual disc.


Type imgmount D C:\ImagePath\image.cue -t iso and press ↵ Enter. Replace C:\ImagePath\image.cue with the actual location and filename of the CUE file. The BIN file needs to have the same name and be in the same location.

, If you have a floppy disk drive installed in your computer, you can mount it so that DOSBox can access it.


Type mount A A:\ -t floppy and press ↵ Enter.

, To save yourself some time when you start DOSBox, you can set it to automatically mount the drive of your choice. To do this, you'll need to open the dosbox.conf file in a text editor like Notepad.Windows - C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\DOSBox\dosbox-version.conf
Mac - /Macintosh HD/Users/username/Library/Preferences/DOSBox version Preferences
Add the following lines to the very bottom of the configuration file and then save it:



 MOUNT C C:\DOSGAMES
 C:



, If you've mounted your DOSGAMES folder, each of your games will usually be contained in their own folders. Type dir to list all of your game directories. If you mounted a disc or disc image, a list of all the files and folders on the disc will be displayed.

,,, Most games start by running an EXE file, though you may need to run a COM or BAT file. This is mainly for older games.


The EXE file will often have a name similar to the game. For example, Prince of Persia may be called POP.EXE.

, Type the name of the EXE, COM, or BAT file, including the extension, and press ↵ Enter.

, There are several keyboard shortcuts that can be used to adjust the performance of your game. These commands can be useful since a lot of old games will not perform properly on modern systems.



Ctrl+F8 - This increases the amount of frameskip. Frameskip prevents DOSBox from rendering certain frames, which can improve performance but leads to some visual problems.

Ctrl+F7 - This decreases the amount of frameskip. 0 frameskip means that DOSBox is rendering every frame possible.

Ctrl+F12 - This will speed up the game by allocating more processor power to DOSBox. You can monitor your processor by pressing Ctrl+⇧ Shift+Esc and selecting the ""Performance"" tab. If you still need performance increases after maxing out your processor, increase the frameskip.

Ctrl+F11 - This will slow the game down by reducing the amount of processing power.
Not all games will run smoothly on DOSBox, even after tweaking performance settings.

, If you want the game to take up your entire screen, press Alt+↵ Enter. You can exit full screen mode by pressing the same keys again.

, If using the command prompt seems a little too complex, you can download a frontend program. These programs use a Windows interface, allowing you to load, start, and adjust games without ever using a command prompt.


One of the most popular front ends is D-Fend Reloaded, available for free from dfendreloaded.sourceforge.net.
D-Fend Reloaded includes the DOSBox files.

, Once it has been installed, you can start D-Fend reloaded to manage your games. Your installed games will be sorted in the left frame.

, You can easily add DOS games by dragging and dropping an archive file containing the game into the open D-Fend Reloaded window. The game archive will be automatically extracted and the files will be placed in the right place.

, Double-click a game from the list to begin playing it. Your Windows color scheme may change temporarily while the game is running to support old DOS colors."

, None of these will really blow the socks off your friends. If you really want to impress them try ""tree"" and wait for results. ""Color 0a"" is good for this. What ""tree"" does is it makes a graphical directory. For those who don't know what that means don't worry. It is very cool. However, if you are using a school computer, or anything like it, the tree will probably be small and stupid. It won't be cool.

, And finally, the last basic command for a beginner - ""help"". It looks cool opening, and is very useful. It will provide a lot of room for experimentation.

Set a profile as the system default.",How to Change Color Management Settings in Windows 8," Windows' color management feature ensures that all of your devices display similar colors. This is necessary because different devices display color in different ways. Your printer and your monitor, for example, both produce color with very different methods. Color management ensures that these colors match up as closely as possible. Most users should not have to make adjustments to their color management settings.


You'll typically only need to adjust your color management settings if you have a device that comes with a specific color profile. Some devices may come with specialized profiles, and some may not. For example, a printer may have multiple color profiles for different types of paper. Many devices install their color profiles automatically.;
, You'll need color profile files in order to add them to the Color Management utility. You may be able to find these on the device manufacturer's support page, or on enthusiast websites. Windows supports ICC, ICM and CDMP format files for color profiles.

, There are two main ways to quickly open this tool:


Press ⊞ Win and then type ""color management"". Select ""Color Management"" from the list.
Open the Control Panel from the Start menu. Click the ""View by"" menu and select one of the icon options. Click ""Color Management"" in the list of Control Panel options.

, This will display a list of all the color profile files currently installed on your computer.

, This will open a file browser.

, Browse your computer for the new color profile file.

, The Color Management tool assigns color profiles to your devices that output color. These devices could include your monitor, your printer, and your scanner.

, Use the drop-down menu at the top of the window to select the device you want to adjust.

, This will allow you to make changes to that device's color profile settings.

, This will open a list of all of the color profiles installed on the computer.

, Scroll through the list and find the new profile that you added earlier. Select it and click OK.

, If you want the device to use your new profile as the default one, select it in the device's list of profiles and click ""Set as Default Profile"".

, If you want a color profile to apply to all users, you'll need to set it as a system default. This requires being logged in with an administrator account.Click the ""Advanced"" tab and then click ""Change system defaults"". If you aren't logged in as the administrator, you'll be prompted for the password.
Follow the same steps above to choose a device and set the default profile. This will apply to all users on the computer unless they manually change them later.

See How to Create a Recovery Disc in Windows 7 for more details.;
, You'll be booting from the installation disc instead of loading Windows 7 as usual.

, This key varies depending on your computer's manufacturer. The key will be displayed on the screen that appears as the computer first boots up. You'll need to press this key before Windows loads. Loading the BOOT menu directly instead of the BIOS menu will be quicker, but not all computers support this.


Common keys include F2, F10, F11, or Del.

, If you loaded directly to the boot menu, select the drive that contains the Windows 7 installation disc. If you loaded to the BIOS menu, navigate to the BOOT section using the keyboard and then change the boot order so that the drive containing the Windows 7 installation disc is listed first.

, If you were in the BIOS, save your changes and exit to reboot the computer and boot from the installation disc. Press any key when prompted to start Windows Setup.

  ren utilman.exe utilman.exe.bak
  copy cmd.exe utilman.exe


, Allow Windows 7 to load as it normally would.

, This would normally load the Accessibility Manager, but the commands you entered earlier renamed the programs so that the Command Prompt loads instead.

, All of the users on the computer will be displayed.

, You can use the net user command to change any user's password to whatever you'd like. Type the following command and press ↵ Enter, replacing username with the user you want to crack. If the username has a space in it, surround it in quotes. Enter the new password twice when prompted.


net user username *
For example, to change the user John Everyman's password, you would type net user ""John Everyman"" * and press ↵ Enter.

, After changing the password in the Command Prompt, you can immediately use the new password to log in on the Windows Login screen. Just select the user that you changed the password for and then enter the new password.

, Now that you've changed the password and successfully logged in, you'll want to revert utilman.exe to its original state in case someone needs the Accessibility Center. Open the Command Prompt from the Start menu and perform the following commands in order:C:\

Remember, sheer length is far superior to a shorter but random mix of numbers, letters, and symbols, which will be difficult to remember.;
, Develop a password using the first letters of a sentence or phrase that means something to you - like your national anthem or a slogan you have seen somewhere. ""Don't shop for it, Argos it"" would become ""DsfiAi.""

, Choose one letter of the first word and one letter of the second word, and repeating this until you get to the last letter of each word. An example could be:


Say your most important possessions are house & plane

Password: hpoluasnee


, Length can be a huge advantage to memorization. If your typing is fairly accurate, consider large phrases from a book, speech or movie, such as:


""It was a dark and stormy night!""
""My fellow Americans!""
""Houston, we have a problem.""
The length can provide security even if special symbols are not used. This can help with sites that prevent the use of symbols.
Make good use of punctuation and capitalization to make a secure pass phrase that complies with common password rules.

Take a word or phrase and remove the vowels from it.,
Shift your fingers one key out of your normal typing position.,
Use the current year and first three letters of the current month.,
Combine a date component inside a larger password.,
Choose a favorite passage out of a book and use a word from the passage.",How to Create a Password You Can Remember2," For example, ""eat the cheeseburger"" becomes ""tthchsbrgr"".

, If your password doesn't use the Q, A, or Z, you can hit the key to the left of your password. Or to the right if you don't use the P, L, or M. ""Speed racer"" goes to both sides, but ""wikiHow"" can become ""qujugiq"" or ""eolojpe"". You could also shift up and to the right or left. ""wikiHow"" becomes ""28i8y92"" or ""39o9u03"".

, Then add three letters from, say, your name. In this case, your password might read 2013mayBob. Next month, change it to 2013junBob. It's impossible to have the same password twice or to forget it.

, This helps when the password needs to change from time to time. But, remember to never use only a date - date-only passwords are at higher risk to being cracked than other choices.

, For example, if your favorite book is ""The Eye of the World"", by Robert Jordan, and your favorite passage is the second paragraph on page 168, use a word from that passage. You can use the word Draghkar. So you would put 2Draghkar168. 2 is the paragraph number and 168 is the page number.

Create your password using one of the above methods.,
Double the password without using a space.,
Consider doubling an easier password.",How to Create a Password You Can Remember3," Find a password that you like that incorporates either phrases or codes.

, Just write the password twice without using a space and you'll be all done. Doubling the password will increase its strength, and it won't be any harder to remember than the original password. All you have to remember is that you doubled it!

, Length can help the strength of a password, so if you want to use the doubling method, you may be able to choose a slightly easier word and then double it. You'll have less to remember and your password will still be strong!

"
"
Pick a memorable word or name as well as a number that is the same length as the word.

,
Reverse either the number or the word and combine them by alternating letters and numbers into one password.",How to Create a Password You Can Remember4,", This is similar to doing a bridge shuffling with cards.


For example, say your word is kitty and your number is your ZIP code, 56789. Just start with the letters and reverse the number, placing them alternately. Thus, k9i8t7t6y5.
Alternatively, you can make the first letter a capital for greater security.
You don’t really need to have the letters and numbers the same length; you can just have the letters or numbers in sequence at the end. For example, a shorter number (like your area code or birth year) might look like this, K8i1t8ty or a shorter word like your name “Bob” would look like B9o8b765.

echo Invalid password. If you want to write additional text you can. If you want to have time between the first line of text and the second line of text add a line that says 'ping localhost (number)'. This designates the amount of time between each line of text. Put it between the second and third line. If you want your program to run slowly and give people time to use each line of text, make the ping localhost time longer. The pause in between each line of text that shows up from the code would be the ping localhost time. If you want the program to say 'Hello' and then say 'how are you' five seconds later, you would write ping localhost 5

You can use the following workaround to make the window take up the whole screen, but it won't be true full-screen.


Windows 10 allows you switch the Command Prompt to full-screen by pressing Alt+↵ Enter.
You can disable your video card drivers, but you'll lose the Aero theme in Windows and your screen resolution will max out at 800 x 600. See the next section for details.

, Cheap or second hand or reconditioned laptops are cheaper than new laptops.But often they are not as good as a brand new more expensive laptop.And bear in mind that second hand laptops have been used before by someone else and so may be faulty. So a good new laptop is likely to last longer or forever if you look after it.

, That way if your computer does wear out and you end up being forced to buy a Windows 8 laptop. You can install Windows 7 on the Windows 8 computer. After you have wiped off Windows 8 by formatting the hard drive. Also if you have Windows Vista and Windows XP installation CDs you can install that on the Windows 8 computer or laptop if you prefer.

, Now buy as many Windows 7 and Windows XP laptops as you can,10 or maybe 20 computers. While you can still get them in the shops now.And put them away in a cupboard somewhere.Then when the laptops you are using now wear out,you will have enough Windows 7 laptops to last you for the next 20 years. And you will never have to go on Windows 8 or be in a situation where you will be stuck with Windows 8.

, Many people are unhappy with Microsoft's decision to keep the Metro theme. And feel if there must be a Windows 8, it should have a normal desktop and start menu like Windows 7. Not the Metro theme. So if enough Windows users complained about this. Then maybe Microsoft will back down and make Windows 8 with a normal desktop and start menu.

, This will enable you to use the ""copy and paste"" function in the command prompt window.

It is also recommended that you select ""Discard Old Duplicates"".

, You will see two sets of options: ""Window size"" and ""Screen buffer size"".



Window size controls the size of the window you're working with.

Screen buffer size controls what's kept in your computer's buffer memory while you're running the command prompt, which can be up to 9999. It can be viewed using the scroll bar on the side of the window.

, A width of 80 and height of 300 is a common buffer size.





, As you will see, there's an additional frame where you can edit the colors more specifically by their numeric values. For example, you can choose a darker green than you already have access to by plugging in: red:0, green:100, blue:0.

, This is where you choose the font you would like to use. You will see two fonts: Raster fonts (as default) and Lucida Console. With this initial step, however, you only have these two fonts available to you. But don't worry, the next step allows you to add new fonts.

, For the next values, just enter a ""0"" each time. For example, the third value should be named ""000"" and so on. Please note that you have to name them exactly as shown; otherwise, the function won't work.

,, You should be able to see the new font(s) under the ""Font"" tab in the properties window the next time you run command prompt.

, This means that all changes will be gone as soon as you close the current command prompt.
""Save properties for future windows with same title"". Selecting this option will save your changes for all command prompt windows running from the same shortcut. In other words, this is the proper option to set the properties for this specific shortcut.

, Using this window, however, will affect every command prompt, no matter where it's running from.

Know which command to use.",How to Copy Files in Command Prompt1," There are several different ways to copy files using the Windows Command Prompt. All the commands can copy files from one place to another, but there are several cases where you may want to choose one command over the others.



COPY - This is the basic copy function. It will allow you to quickly copy files from one location to another. You can also use this command to concatenate files.

XCOPY - The xcopy command allows you to copy files and directory trees. This makes it much more suitable for copying folders. xcopy also has many modifiers which gives advanced users more control over the copying process. xcopy has been deprecated in favor of robocopy, but still works.

ROBOCOPY - This is the newest copy command available in the Windows Command Prompt. It requires Windows Vista or later. Windows XP users can install the Windows 2003 Server Resource Kit Tools pack to use it. robocopy is designed to mirror files and directories while maintaining permissions and other attributes. It also allows for better logging and more reliable copying of large amounts of data.

"
"
Copy a single file.,
Copy all of the files in a folder.,
Copy files when the file or folder has a space in the name.,
Combine (concatenate) text files.",How to Copy Files in Command Prompt2," The copy command is best used when copying a single file. To use the basic copy command, you'd type copy source destination. For example, to copy the file Example.txt from C:\Users\desktop to D:\backup, enter the following:copy C:\Users\desktop\Example.txt D:\backup\Example.txt





You need to enter the file name for the copied file as well. You can use this to change the name of the copied file if you'd like.
To copy a file from your current working directory, just type the filename for the source part of the command. For example, If performing the command above while already in the C:\Users\desktop folder, the command would look like copy Example.txt D:\backup\Example.txt
;
, Use the *.* wildcard to copy all of the files from a folder at once. For example, to copy all of the files from the C:\Users\desktop\ folder to D:\backup, enter the following:





copy C:\Users\desktop\*.* D:\backup





The copy command will not copy hidden files. Use the xcopy or robocopy command instead for hidden files.
You can copy all of the files from your current working location by typing *.* as the source. In the above example, if already in the C:\Users\desktop\ folder, type copy *.* D:\backup.

, If your source or target location or file has a space in the name, you'll need to surround it in quotation marks. For example, to copy all of the files from C:\Users\My Documents to D:\2015 Backup, enter the following:





copy ""C:\Users\My Documents\*.*"" ""D:\2015 Backup""




, One of the ""hidden"" functions of the copy command is its ability to join multiple files together. This is most useful with plain text files. The content from the first and second text files in the following command will be combined, in order, into the new file:copy file1.txt+file2.txt newFile.txt





This command assumes that file1.txt and file2.txt are located in the current directory. You'll need to add the path to the beginning of each file name for files in other locations.

"
"
Use COPY for single files.,
Use ROBOCOPY if you're creating backup scripts.,
Copy a folder to another location.,
Use xcopy to copy hidden files.",How to Copy Files in Command Prompt3," You're better off with the copy command for single files. The xcopy command does not allow you indicate whether you are setting a directory or a filename as the destination., Xcopy has been deprecated and will likely be phased out of use in the near future. Robocopy can do everything xcopy can. It is also more flexible and reliable. Creating scripts with robocopy will future-proof them.

, xcopy's main function is to copy folders or the contents of a folder from one location to another. For example, to copy all of the contents of the C:\tools directory to the new folder D:\backup\tools, enter the following:





xcopy C:\tools\* D:\backup\tools /e /i






/e tells xcopy to copy all of the subdirectories in the source location as well. This includes any empty directories.

/i tells xcopy to assume that the destination is a folder. This will force it to create the new folder during the copy process.
It is most useful when copying files from a CD or DVD. It will remove the Read-Only attribute automatically during the copy process.

, One of the big advantages of xcopy over the copy command is its ability to copy hidden and system files. Add the /h modifier to copy hidden files as well.





xcopy C:\tools\* D:\backup\tools /e /i /h




"
"
Use robocopy to easily copy folders.,
Mirror a directory.,
Enable restarting.,
Log the copying process.",How to Copy Files in Command Prompt4," The robocopy command replaces the xcopy command. It can quickly copy entire folders without having to worry about defining the contents. For example, to copy all of the contents of the C:\tools directory to the new folder D:\backup\tools, enter the following:





robocopy C:\tools D:\backup\tools /e





The /e modifier tells robocopy to include all subdirectories. This includes empty folders.

robocopy will automatically copy hidden and system files. It will create new directories if they don't exist at the target location.

, Mirroring a directory is great for making backups. The mirror option of robocopy will copy all of the contents from the source to the destination. It will then delete anything at the destination that doesn't exist at the source. This ensures that your backup only has the latest versions of your files. For example, to mirror C:\Users\My Documents to D:\backup\My Documents, enter the following:robocopy ""C:\Users\My Documents"" ""D:\backup\My Documents"" /mir





This function will preserve all permissions of the original files.

, You may want to include the ability to restart the process in case the connection is severed mid-copy.





robocopy ""C:\Users\My Documents"" ""D:\backup\My Documents"" /z




, robocopy allows you to create a log file. This can help you pinpoint problems or generate an archive of what's been copied.





robocopy ""C:\Users\My Documents"" ""D:\backup\My Documents"" /log+:<filename>.txt





The /log+ modifier will append the existing log file instead of overwriting it. If you'd prefer to just overwrite the old log file, use /log:<filename>.txt.

Type command prompt or cmd. Double click on Command Prompt from the list of results to open the command prompt. The command prompt will look like this: C:\users\Username>.;
, Use the mkdir command to create a new directory to work with. The command is mkdir -> directory name. In the example above, a new directory called wikihow was created by typing: mkdir wikihow.

, In order to move into the newly created directory, use the cd or change directory command. The command is cd -> directory name. In the example, cd wikihow was typed. Now the prompt looks like this: C:\users\Brian\wikihow> as shown above.

, In order to check the contents of the current directory, use the dir command. Simply type dir and press enter and a list of the directory contents will be displayed as shown. In the example the wikihow directory is currently empty.

, To clear the screen, use the cls command. Simply type cls and press enter to clear all of the contents of the screen. Only the command prompt will remain on the screen as shown above.

, In order to create a new file, use the type NUL > command. Type: type NUL> filename and press enter to create a new empty file. In the example above, type NUL> newfile was typed.

, Now repeat step 5 to create a second new file. Call this file newFile1. The new command is: type NUL> newFile1.

, Now check the directory contents using the dir command. The wikihow directory now contains two new files called newFile and newFile1 as shown above.

, To delete files, use the del command. Type del -> filename to delete a specific file. In this example, delete newFile using the following command: del newFile. Now, check the wikihow directory contents you can see that newFile has been deleted. Clear the screen using the cls command.

, In order to complete the next step, deleting a directory, first, leave the current working directory. To do this, use a version of the change directory command. Use the cd.. command to move into the parent directory without typing the directory name. In the example, type: cd.. as shown above. Notice the prompt is now back to C:\users\Brian> which means that this is no longer in the wikihow directory.

, To delete a directory, use the rmdir command. You can't be in the directory that you want to delete (see step 10 above). If the directory is empty, meaning it does not contain any files, you can delete it by simply typing rmdir -> directory name. In this example the wikihow directory still contains newFile1 so the rmdir command will not work in this case. If the directory is not empty you will receive an error message as shown above.

, To remove a directory that contains files, use a modified version of the rmdir command. Use the rmdir /s command. In the example, type: rmdir /s wikihow and press the enter key. You will be prompted to confirm that you want to delete the directory by typing Y/N. Type Y for yes or N for no as shown above. When you type Y the entire directory and all of its contents are deleted from the system.

Practice common sense.",How to Use Windows 8," When you start the computer, after passing the lock and sign-in screens, it will take you to the start screen. This screen replaces the function of the start button in previous versions of Windows. On your start screen, you will see several boxes in various sizes and colors. These are tiles. Tiles act the same as icons did in previous versions, in that clicking on them starts the program that they represent.


Some tiles will present basic information associated with that program. For example, the Store tile will show the number of programs, which have available updates (if any).
You can move the tiles by holding and dragging them. With the Windows 8.1 update, you can even batch move (as well as edit) tiles.;
, Live tiles are tiles, which change every few seconds to present you with various information. These can be helpful and give your start screen a more dynamic look but they are not available for every application. Using live tiles is especially helpful with things like News applications, which will flash headlines to keep you updated.

, There should be a tile on your start screen, which takes you to the traditional desktop view. You do not need to use Desktop view to do most tasks, but you may wish to default to desktop view until you become more comfortable with Windows 8.

, Once you are in desktop view, you may notice the traditional start button is a little different. While the button was missing in the original Windows 8, it was replaced with 8.1. However, the menu that it brings up is the metro or modern start menu and does not resemble the original. Selecting the start button from the charms menu will also bring up the start menu.


Just think of the start screen as a start menu that is big and more powerful.
If you are uncomfortable with the switch between the desktop and the start screen, with Windows 8.1 you are able to set the start screen to overlay the desktop, giving it a Windows 7 sort of quality.

, While using desktop view, you will notice that everything is the same. You can still organize your files in folders, start programs, and open and create files in the same ways as previous versions of Windows., You will need to understand that Windows 8 treats the desktop view as a single application. This will be important when viewing the taskbar and switching between programs.

, If you want to, you can change the settings to allow you to boot directly to the desktop, as of Windows 8.1. This option can be found under the Navigation tab, found in the accessed-as-normal taskbar Properties menu. , Access the charms menu by holding your mouse in the upper right corner and dragging directly down. This will bring up your system time, as well as a menu, which is used to control several function of the computer. It is a powerful and important menu and you will want to know it.Search is very similar to the All Applications button on the original start menu. However, for some apps pressing the search charm will search within that program, rather than searching the computer. Pay attention to this.
Share is used when doing tasks like viewing pictures. Share items to attach them to emails, place them in your OneDrive, or a number of other functions depending on the file.
Start returns you to the start menu.

Devices allows you to access things like a second screen, or to set up and use printers. What is available will depend on what you have and what program you are using.
Settings can access the current application settings in some cases, but will otherwise access the computer’s settings. This is how you turn the computer off or put it to sleep, connect to the internet, manage the sound, personalize the computer, and access the control panel, among other functions.

, Switch between windows, programs, or apps by holding your mouse in the top left-hand corner of the screen and clicking the left mouse button. This will cycle through the currently running programs. To navigate to a specific program quickly, hold your mouse in that corner and drag directly down to access the equivalent of the taskbar, which will show all open programs.


Remember that the desktop is treated as a single application, so you may need to open the desktop before being able to go directly to the program you wish to access.

, Open programs and applications by clicking tiles on the start screen or program icons in desktop view. You may wish to create tiles for programs, which you use often, which are discussed below. Programs can be pinned to the desktop taskbar similarly to previous versions.


To pin a program to the taskbar for which you cannot easily find the application icon in desktop view, find the program using the search charm and select “Pin to taskbar”. This is not available for all programs. Pinning to the start menu, however, should always be available.

, Close programs using the familiar ""x"" button at the top right corner of program windows. If this is not available, you can open the side taskbar by holding your mouse in the upper left corner and dragging down, then right clicking on the program you wish to close.


You can also press Alt + F4 to close a program, though this will only close the program you are viewing.

, You may eventually find that when you navigate away from, say, your internet window where a song is playing on YouTube, the music will stop. If you want to use two programs in Windows 8 at once, you will need to put the computer into the windowed mode.


Do this by having both programs open at once. Hold your mouse in the top left corner and the other program you wish to view should appear. Grab the image and then hold it at the edge of the screen until the side pops out. Let go and both programs will be open and running.
Windows 8.1 allows for having up to 8 apps running at once, but this number is determined by your screen size. Tablets, for example, can still only have two.

, If you have the newest version of the Office Suite which was designed to pair with Windows 8, you may notice that it has a much more sleek interface. The functionality is largely the same, however, to Office 7, so if you are acquainted with that version you should have an easy time switching over. Certain new features have been added to the various programs to improve functionality and you will likely find your Office experience much more productive and simpler to use.

, This is a useful application, which handles all of your email accounts by streaming them together into a single program. Sync the program with Hotmail, Yahoo, AOL, Gmail or Google, Outlook, and many other email services. You will be able to view, send, and organize all of your mail from this single program.


Add email accounts by clicking settings from the charms menu and then clicking Accounts and Add accounts.

, OneDrive is an application which allows you to store files on the internet, so they can be accessed from anywhere. You can keep these files private, make them public, or share them with particular individuals. You can create folders, upload files, as well as do things like refresh the screen and view details by right clicking in the background of the window.


Use of Microsoft OneDrive usually requires a subscription but some features may be available for free.

, The Windows Store is a helpful service that allows you to find and download new programs to use on your device. Some are free, while others will cost money. You can download games, productivity, social and entertainment, sports, reading applications, as well as various other programs.

, You may wish to access some of the programs previously contained in the accessories menu, such as Notepad or the Calculator. These programs and utilities are still included in Windows 8 and can be found by clicking the search button on the charms menu and generally scrolling all the way to the right.


These programs will generally run in Desktop view and are treated as a single entity.

, You will need to make sure you have set up a printer through the devices charm. For programs that run on desktop or have familiar interfaces, you can print in the same way you are used to printing. However, for apps with the “modern look” of the Windows 8 interface, you will need to find the print button within that program or you can use the hotkey Ctrl + P to open the print dialogue.

, You can create new tiles on the start menu by right-clicking the application icon in the search menu. You can also change how tiles look in the same way, by selecting the size (when available). Completely custom tiles can be created using third-party programs, which will allow you to set the image and text of a tile.

, You can install programs using disks, as before, or you can install programs using the Store, as discussed above. Programs can also be downloaded and installed from the internet, as in previous versions of Windows. There are varieties of programs available, but it is important to remember that not all programs will work (or work correctly) in Windows 8.


Check new software you buy or download to ensure that it runs with Windows 8. You can also use the Upgrade Assistant if you have not switched over yetor you can use Microsoft’s compatibility checker to find out how your programs will run.You can also run programs in compatibility mode or try downloading the latest drivers, to help them run better.

, You can uninstall some programs by right-clicking their tile or program icon in the search menu. You can also use the familiar Add or Remove Programs tool. The easiest way to access this is to open the search charm and type Add or Remove Programs into the search bar. The program will be under the Settings, which will need to be selected on the right if you're on Windows 8.


Understand that uninstalling a program is different that simply making the tile go away. If you would rather remove the tile, read the step below.

, Remove tiles by right-clicking on them and selecting “Unpin from Start”. This is different from uninstalling, as the program will still be installed and accessible, it just won’t be on the start screen.

, There are six basic settings accessible from the charms menu. These are Network options, System Volume, Screen Brightness, Notifications, Power, and Keyboard settings. These are largely self explanatory and will allow you basic control of your system.

, Change some of the more advanced settings by selecting “Change PC Settings” just below the main six settings. Here you can personalize your screen, change user settings, privacy and sync settings, as well as various other settings.


The desktop view can be used in the familiar way to change some settings.

, The control panel can still be accessed, most easily by searching using the search charm or by clicking Control Panel under the Settings charm. You can also access the Control Panel and several other settings by placing your mouse in the lower left corner and right-clicking.

, There are several different ways you can change the appearance of your device. This is a great way to give your device a personal feel. These settings can also be synced across devices, if you wish, which will make sure you always see the same screen, no matter what device you use.


Personalize the start screen. Personalize the start screen background and color scheme by selecting ""Settings"" from the charms menu and then Personalize. This is only available from the start screen. The option exists, in this menu, to make the start screen an overlay of the desktop, instead of of a vastly different looking screen. This also means that you can, in a way, set a custom image as your start screen background.
Personalize the desktop. Right-click the background of the desktop view and select “Personalize”. Set the background image to whatever picture file you have access to or chosen from a preset image.
Personalize the lock screen. Personalize the lock screen background by selecting “Change PC Settings” from just below the main six settings. From there, click on “Personalize” and “Lock Screen”. It is possible to get custom background images by clicking “Browse”.
Change your account pictures. Personalize your account picture by selecting “Change PC Settings” from just below the main six settings. From there, click on “Personalize” and “Account Picture”. You can upload an existing picture or take a new one if you have a webcam.

, You can enable the use of a second screen (if you have one) easily by selecting “Devices” from the charms menu. Click Second Screen and follow the prompts to decide the settings.To change how the taskbar works with two screens, you will need to right click the taskbar in desktop view and choose “Properties”.

, Add new users for the device by selecting “Change PC Settings” from just below the main six settings, in the Settings section of the charms menu. From there, click on “Users” and “Add a user”.

, You can create tiles to shut down or reboot the computer if you would find that to be easier. Start in desktop view, right-click and choose “New” and then “Shortcut”, type shutdown /p into the location field, and then click next. When that’s done, right click the new shortcut and choose “Pin to Start”. You can similarly create a reboot tile by typing in shutdown /r /t 0 instead of shutdown /p., You can access the task manager, which has been given a badly-needed overhaul, by right-clicking in the bottom left corner of the screen, by navigating all the way to the right in the search menu, by right-clicking in the taskbar, or by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Delete or Ctrl + Shift + Escape.

, Parental controls exist in Windows 8 and are easier to use than ever, however, they’ve been renamed to Family Safety. You can get activity reports (sent straight to your email!), set up filters and restrict apps, and create time limits, among other features. Family Safety will need to be turned on when creating the user account.
Open the control panel, select “User Accounts and Family Safety”, “Family Safety”, and then choose the user for whom you would like to change the safety settings.

, You can sync settings between all your Windows 8 devices by simply attaching the device to your Microsoft account, and allowing syncing in your settings. Change the setting by selecting “Change PC Settings” from just below the main six settings, in the Settings section of the charms menu. From there, click on “Sync Your Settings” and turn it on., Hotkeys are key combinations that, when pressed together, cause certain effects. These can open and close programs or windows, as well as several other functions. Some hotkeys are the same as previous versions of Windows and some new hotkeys have been added. There are many hotkeys, but here are a few useful ones:The Windows key or the Windows button will bring you to the start menu.
The Windows key+typing will allow you to start searching for applications, programs, and files.
Escape will cancel many actions.
The Windows key + X will allow access to many user commands.
The Windows key + L will allow you to lock the screen on your account, so no one else is able to use the account. If there is a password set up for the account, a password will be needed to unlock the account.
The Windows key + C will open the charms menu.
Alt + Tab will switch between applications.
The Windows key + E opens the program File Explorer.

, The included virus and malware protection service, Windows Defender, is a strong, capable program which should serve well to protect your computer. However, if your computer came pre-installed with a third-party service, Defender may be turned off. Open it using the search menu to ensure that everything is operational.

, You can set up a picture password, which combines an image with a hand or mouse gesture, to allow you to log-in, rather than using a typed password.It is maybe not the best idea for touch devices, as grease marks may make it possible to guess the picture password, but this is up to you.


In your user settings, click “Sign in options” and “Create a picture password”.

, BitLocker is an inherent encryption tool within Windows 8, used to make your drive more secure. Set it up by going to the Control Panel, then System and Security, then BitLocker Drive Encryption.Make sure to store your recovery key in a safe place, as losing it would possibly mean the loss of your data.

, While it is useful, syncing devices poses a large security risk. If someone gains access to your credentials, they can access your files from any Windows 8 device. Weigh the pros and cons and decide what is right for you., Some apps will ask for security permissions that you would rather not give, or have settings which automatically store more of your data than is perhaps wise. Make sure you pay attention to app permissions and don’t download anything shady. Always download apps directly from the store when you can, as this will be safer than downloading them from third-party sites.

, A new operating system doesn’t mean that you should stop using common sense. If a website seems suspicious or something seems off, avoid it. Don’t open emails from weird people, avoid downloading email attachments from people you don’t trust, and avoid websites with many pop-ups and downloads (like video).

Use programs that you can download from the Mac App Store so that you are downloading a trusted and verified file that meets the standards of the App Store.


To make sure that you delete any application bundles or additional, read this article on how to uninstall files on a Mac.;
, It may sound obvious, but clearing out the trash regularly will help your computer run smoother.


You may need to restart or shutdown your computer for the space you've reclaimed to properly show on your hard drive.

, Maintenance programs like XSlimmer checks which code your computer needs for a given program and removes the rest.This will reduce the space taken up on your disk and get your computer running faster.

, Provided your files aren't already compressed, compressing them will make them dramatically smaller, freeing up extra space on your hard drive. In order to find out how to compress files on a Mac, click here.


Once your files are compressed, move them to an external hard drive, USB thumbdrive or CD for storage. Keeping files you don't regularly use on your computer will slow it down.

, Your system should automatically run UNIX maintenance scripts, but some earlier versions of Mac OSX only run these scripts between 3 and 5 AM, during which time most computers are either asleep or shut off, depriving your system of regular maintenance.Download a free app like OnyX to do scheduled maintenance and clean up system logs and temporary files.
If you want to clean up system logs and temporary files manually:

Access terminal by navigating to Applications → Utilities → Terminal

In Terminal, type in ""sudo periodic daily weekly monthly"" and hit Enter
Type in your Mac admin password
Wait for your system to run the maintenance, after which you'll be returned to Terminal



, An iPod, iPhone, or iPad will automatically run a backup on specific files when you plug the device into your computer. Trashing older, obsolete backups will help free up space on your computer.


To access the backups, navigate to Home → Library → Application Support → MobileSync → Backup folder. Locate the newer backups and the older backups. Delete the older backups.

, Drag unneeded files to the Trash. Apps like to save here, and this can result in used space, so be vigilant about what gets put in here.

, These files are often unnecessary and take up valuable space on your device. Get rid of them if you no longer need them.


Deleting DMGs: DMG files are disk images. Once you've mounted your disk image and installed your app, you're free to eject and trash your DMG. To eject, simply drag the mounted volume to the trash.
Deleting IPSW: Navigate to Library → iTunes → iPhone Software Updates and locate any unused bundles.

, Most of the time dragging software to the trash will still leave files from that program on your mac.


Open the Finder window and locate a hard drive icon on the left sidebar
Once selected, you should see a folder titled ""Library."" Select it.
Once selected, locate the folder titled ""Application Support"" and see the list of program folders that did not get deleted by the Trash.
Drag any folders of programs you uninstalled into the Trash. Empty Trash.

, It is accepted knowledge that the installing and uninstalling of programs on macs over time can lead to changes in permissions for programs. Sometimes this gets obsolete and causes unnecessary processing. Think of your local DMV office. This won't affect the size of space taken on your hard drive. But it will increase efficiency which equates to increased speed.


Open Disk Utility (Finder --> Applications --> Utilities (folder))
Select your hard drive and select ""verify permissions"" (if you do 1/month, should take 9 minutes. If it's your first time in 2 years, may take 30mins).
Once ""verify permissions"" is complete, select ""repair permissions"" (the time it takes applies like above).

, Some changes take effect immediately. But others only process the change when the computer turns off and starts up again. So give your computer the refresher it needs if you have a tendency to keep it running 24/7.

, This can be either an external hard disk or a pen drive, although larger files will usually require an external.


If you plan on using with other computers, reformat the media device first using Disc Utility.
For use on Mac only devices: choose Mac OSX Journaled
For use on Windows/Mac: choose exFAT (older mac OS's may not have this option and can choose MS-DOS (FAT), which has a filesize limit of 4GB. So if you have files over that size, you cannot transfer them. exFat has no size limitation).

, Some backup programs will save the huge files from virtual memory. This is potentially dangerous. Avoid backup programs which back up the disk in sector by sector mode.

, Dropbox is a cloud-based file-saving utility, letting you access files from multiple devices anywhere there is internet. Dropbox will save you space on your hard drive by not forcing you to download multiple copies of files across several different platforms.


Clear out your Dropbox cache regularly. Dropbox's cache is hidden and stores deleted files.Instead of downloading information to Dropbox's servers, it saves deleted files in the cache so that it can retrieve them if you happen to change your mind. Delete files that are no longer necessary to keep.

, It maps your disk and shows you the sizes of files and folders using a graphical visualization called ""treemaps."" Look at what files are taking up space on your computer relative to how much you are using them. Delete, compress, or archive any files you don't regularly use.

, CCleaner clears about 200MB of disk space per use by getting rid of junk files and invalid Registry entries., Local backups have their obvious advantages, but if you're trying to converse space on your hard drive, it can be costly, in terms of space, as well as unnecessary. Disabling local backups can clear up 100GB to a terabyte of free space. After executing it, wait about 20-30 minutes (just to be safe) and you should see the difference. To disable Time Machine local backup storage:


Access terminal by navigating to Applications → Utilities → Terminal

Type in ""sudo tmutil disablelocal"" and hit Enter
When it prompts you for a password, just enter your user admin password

Compare the cost


Apple BootCamp is a free utility that is pre-installed on all Macs running Mac OS X.,
Evaluate the differences in technology


Apple Bootcamp allows you to run operating systems natively, i.e.,
Examine the differences in user experience and Mac OS X integration


The obvious difference in user experience is the fact that Parallels allows you to instantly switch between Mac OS X and another operating system.,
Consider the impact on system resources.,
Compare the setup process.",How to Choose Between Apple Bootcamp and Parallels," This means the only cost associated with using this option is the cost of the operating system license you plan on installing.
The current Parallels software, Parallels Desktop 6 for Mac, is priced at $79.99 or $49.99 to upgrade from a previous version. You can, however, download and try Parallels for 14 days free of charge through their trial offer.;
, giving it access to system resources such as full access to the CPU, Graphics, and all other system resources. This may be crucial for certain tasks such as playing games that require a lot of system resources. However, this means that you will only be able to boot into one operating system at a time, and cannot utilize both Mac OS X and the other operating system simultaneously.

Parallels will allow you to create a virtual machine for your operating system. This will allow you to run the operating system in a window within Mac OS X, allowing you to essentially run both operating systems simultaneously.

, Bootcamp, on the other hand, forces you to choose one or another when booting your system.
Parallels is highly integrated with Mac OS X, allowing you to transfer files from an operating system installed through Parallels such as Windows to Mac OS X and vice versa via drag and drop. You can also access folders stored on your Mac through an operating system installed in Parallels and vice versa. These are features that aren’t possible with Bootcamp.
The startup time associated with Parallels is typically much faster than using Bootcamp. Launching an operating system through Parallels is comparable to opening an application. Launching an operating system through Bootcamp is similar to booting an OS such as Windows installed natively on a PC.

,


When running an operating system in Parallels, it is sharing your system’s resources with your currently installed version of Mac OS X. You may experience sluggish performance even if your system meets the minimum system requirements for the application and operating system. If you are planning on running resource intensive applications such as games or video rendering software, it is probably best to utilize Bootcamp. This will allow you to have access to all system resources as if the operating system was installed natively.

,


Setup of operating systems in both applications is done via detailed onscreen instructions and takes approximately 5 to 15 minutes. Installation of the actual operating system after the initial setup process is complete will be done using its own procedure. For example, when installing Windows, the installation process will be the same as if you were installing Windows natively on a PC.
The Apple Bootcamp installation requires a utility that comes preinstalled on all Intel-based Macs called “Boot Camp Assistant” that will allow you to partition your hard drive, and provide you with a virtual CD containing all of the necessary drivers for your operating system.
Installation of an operating system through Parallels will walk you through the process of preparing the drive and creating a virtual machine for the OS. You will also be able to specify how much RAM is allocated to the operating system. One benefit of this installation process is the ability to select the “Expanding” disk format. This will allow the disk image to grow as more data is required, allowing you to only use as much disk space as necessary.

Have fun!",How to Choose a Paint Program for Your Mac1," Kids have tremendous imaginations, and the right paint program will not just let them play, but will actively inspire them to create and tell their stories. For kids, the main things to look for are easily understood and accessed features, a playful interface, and intuitive enough so that you don't have read a 200-page manual to help them figure it all out. Here are a couple alternatives:



KidPix. This venerable paint application has been around since 1989. It started out as a ""rubber stamp"" kind of paint program. For example, click on the ""cow"" stamp, then click on your document, and there was a cow. Today, KidPix offers the original 2D version, and a new 3D version with animation and voice recording capabilities—still wrapped in a fun interface. It's not free, but for about $40USD, you can get the 2D version, and for about $50USD, you get the deluxe 3D version.

Tux Paint. This is another application targeted towards kids. The interface is easy to grasp, and useful if you want to learn how to use the mouse and draw lines. It features lots of fun graphic effects like ""Confetti,"" which sprinkles the screen with colored dots, ""Distortion"" which messes up the lines, ""Flower,"" which lets you draw flowers of whatever height you like, and much more. It does it all with a variety of stereo sound effects and the occasional penguin ""voice."" Best of all...it's free!;

There are also versions available for iPad, iPhone, and older Macs

, Admittedly more interesting than useful, the amazing graphic options and crazy sound effects within this application will keep you entertained for hours on end. One caveat with this is that Beautiful Dorena will not run on Mac OS versions 10.7 or later.

GIMP.,
Painter.,
Photoshop.,
Photoshop Elements.",How to Choose a Paint Program for Your Mac5," Free is good, right? Right! GIMP is an open-source application, which means it's free, and open for anybody to add things or change things as they see fit. While it features many Photoshop-like buttons, the interface is not as streamlined, so the learning curve can be pretty steep. With it's feature set and editing power, this is a favorite application for those who either don't have the money for Photoshop, or don't have the desire to follow the crowd.

, Painter is an amazing application with tools that mimic their physical counterparts: paper and canvas, brushes, palettes, pencils, chalks, oils, acrylics, and more. For the artist who loves to work with the digital analogs of traditional media, it's at the very top of the list. Retailing at $289USD, it's not the cheapest option going, but for the serious artists, it is worth every penny.

, If you are into graphics, you know Photoshop. Photoshop, as the say, is the mac daddy of all paint applications. It has grown from a nifty little photo editing tool into an incredible (some may say notorious) digital editing powerhouse that is so ubiquitous it's even become a verb! It features the most comprehensive array of tools available, and still maintains one of the cleanest, most intuitive interfaces of all the applications. It weighs in at $699USD.

, If Photoshop is a little too much for you to take in, you can get much of the power at a much lower price point with Adobe Elements. This is primarily a photo editor, ideal for cleaning up photos from your digital camera, with an array of tools to help you crop, clean, polish, and share your photos. It retails for $99USD, so if you take a lot of photos and want them to look great, Elements is a good option.

Call your phone.,
Text the phone.,
Take safety measures if you meet to exchange the phone.",How to Find Your Stolen Phone1," If you’ve lost a traditional (non-smart) phone that does not have internet connectivity, you won’t be able to track the phone online and will have to use other methods. Begin by calling the phone. If you’re lucky, the person who stole your phone may answer. Alternately, if your phone has simply been misplaced (e.g. on a taxi seat or a subway car), someone may answer who can meet you at a location to exchange the phone.If you call your phone and someone answers, say “Hello, this is , and you’re holding my cell phone. The phone is important to me and I need to get it back; is there a location where we could meet and exchange the phone?”;
, Even if no one answered when you called your phone, it’s still worth texting it. The thief may eventually change their mind, and decide to return the phone to you, its owner. Send a brief text that provides your contact information and asks for the phone to be returned. If you think it would help, you could also promise a reward to the individual if they return your phone.To do this, you’ll need access to another cell phone. Ask a friend to borrow theirs. If you’re not near a friend, a kind stranger may allow you to borrow their cell phone to text yours.

, If someone—whether or not it’s the thief who initially took your phone—agrees to meet with you to give your phone back to you, take safety precautions. Arrange to meet with the individual in a public place—such as a city square or transit station—during daylight hours. If possible, don’t go alone; bring a friend with you for the sake of companionship and safety. Ask your friend to bring their phone, so that they can call the police if anything illicit happens.

Even if the individual returning your phone sounds friendly over the phone (or over text), you should still plan to take precautionary measures.

"

Check gas stations and convenience stores.,
Search inside of transit hubs.,
Look for local government and community centers.",How to Find a Pay Phone1," Though pay phones are disappearing from these locations as well, many still have them.;
, Public transit stations and centers in many towns still have a pay phone or two. However, these are sometimes not in good condition due to heavy use and neglect by their owners.Subway stations and the largest local bus terminals often have pay phones.
The stations of interstate bus companies, especially those of Greyhound, often still have pay phones.Greyhound stations are worth mentioning in particular because, in many larger cities, they are open 24 hours and have several pay phones that are in good repair.
Major airports, and most smaller ones as well, usually have some pay phones around. Airport managers seem to realize that people traveling often leave certain vital things at home. International travelers are also in need of pay phones if they have not purchased special ones for the country they are traveling to. As a result, airports still have large numbers of pay phones.

, Government buildings, such as the county's courthouse, often have payphones. Every county in the United States has their own courthouse or some form of office, which are generally home to pay phones which are accessible to the community. Because people in courthouses often have important messages that they need to share with family members, there seems to be an understanding that pay phones can provide a needed service. Outside of courthouses, you might also want to try these:


Post offices frequently have pay phones. Again, these are public use facilities, and pay phones can be a useful connection in such places.
Public libraries often have pay phones as well, and most of those that do not usually offer internet service. If they do not have pay phones, you can at least use resources there to find one.

"
"
Contact the authorities.,
Alert your service provider.,
Look for the phone in person.",How to Find Your Stolen Phone2," If you inform the police that your phone has gone missing, they may be able to provide limited assistance locating it. Call 911, or the non-emergency police number, to contact your local police office. Local law enforcement will likely ask you for the serial number for your phone. The Android ID number functions as a serial number; you can find your Android ID by removing the battery from the back of your phone and looking beneath. The Android ID will be a series of numbers preceded by the identifier “IMEI” (International Mobile Equipment Identity).When you reach out to the police, say something like, “Hello, I believe that my cell phone has been stolen. It went missing roughly 10 minutes ago, and I first realized the phone was gone when I was outside of the public library on Main St.”

, If you’ve called your phone and looked for it without results, you need to call your phone service provider and inform them that your phone has been stolen. The service provider may be able to run a GPS search to locate your missing phone.If a GPS search is not an option—or if the results are fruitless—ask your service provider to suspend service to your phone. This will prevent the thief from making phone calls and potentially racking up an expensive phone bill.

, Think back to where you may have been when your phone was stolen, and then retrace your steps in that area. The thief may have quickly changed their minds after taking your phone and, if you’re lucky, may have dropped the phone within a few hundred yards of where they stole it.Walk through places where you spent time before your phone was stolen, and continue calling your phone while looking for it.

Enable your smartphone’s tracking app.,
Enable Lost Mode.,
Track your phone online.,
Lock your phone.,
“Ring” your phone.,
Download a tracking app from the Google Play or Apple store.",How to Find Your Stolen Phone3," On iPhones this will be labeled “Find My Phone,” while on Android devices, it’s called the “Android Device Manager.” This program will track your phone’s location and relay this information to the cloud. It’s important that you set this feature up while you still have your phone with you, as there is no way to enable Find My Phone if your phone has already been stolen. Find My Phone is a component of Apple’s cloud-based server, iCloud, which backs up and stores your phone’s data. If you have not yet set up an iCloud account, you won’t be able to use the Find My Phone app. Set up an iCloud account through your phone’s “Settings” menu, then locate “iCloud” and tap the “Account” to sign in.In order for the Device Manager to locate your stolen phone, you’ll need to have the GPS-tracking “Location” setting turned on.

, You can turn Lost Mode on remotely: you’ll need to login to your iCloud or your Android Device Manager account, and can turn on Lost Mode from there. With Lost Mode turned on, whoever stole your phone will be unable to login and shouldn’t have access to any of your phone’s data or apps.Once you’ve recovered your missing phone, you can turn off Lost Mode by entering your passcode on the phone’s home screen.
Even if your iPhone or Android is offline (not connected to the internet), you can still remotely lock the phone. You’ll do this through logging in to your online account. Any settings that you change on your device will take effect the next time the phone is online.

, If your iPhone has been stolen, you can track its physical location online at www.icloud.com/find. This will bring up a map showing the current location of your phone. The map will show real-time movements, so if your phone is on a bus or subway car, you’ll be able to follow it along the map.If your Android phone has been stolen—or you prefer to setup your account on a computer rather than on your phone—you can access the Device Manager online at: www.google.com/android/devicemanager. Logging into this website will show you your missing phone’s location.Once you’ve located your missing phone, you can have the device play a sound to draw attention. While this won’t help if someone has deliberately taken your phone, it could be useful if your phone is near you and has simply been misplaced.

, From the iCloud or Android Device Manager website, you can click a button to Lock your phone. This will disable the login mechanism, and make it so that the individual who stole your phone will not have access to any of your personal data or contact information.The Device Manager will ask you to input a new device password for your phone. Once you have recovered your lost or stolen phone, you’ll be able to disable Lock mode by typing in this password.

, From the menu on the online phone tracking page, you can choose to “Ring” your phone. This will cause your phone to ring at its maximum volume for 5 minutes, unless you choose to turn off the Ring setting before that. The Ring function is useful if you suspect that someone may have taken your phone by accident or that the loud ringing will help you or another individual find your phone nearby., If you prefer not to use the Android Device Manager function to track your phone if it goes missing, you can also download one of many available tracking apps from the Google Play Store. These apps will allow you to connect to a website where, if your phone has been stolen, you can find the phone’s location remotely.

An app like Lookout—among many others available on both the Apple Store and the Google Play Store—will allow you to sound an alarm, lock your phone, and remotely wipe your phone’s data."
"
Use a website to find pay phones near you.,
Ask local people where a pay phone can be found.,
Use a website to look up pay phones by their number.",How to Find a Pay Phone2," If you have access to the internet you can search certain websites for information about pay phones near your. There are now a number of websites that list pay phones in most states of the United States, as well as a few places overseas. These websites are creations of a community of online users who want to create catalogs of useful information--sounds familiar, right? That is both the advantage and disadvantage of these sites; in places where many users want to make information accessible, they are often quite good, but where there are few people engaged with this sort of online activity the quality is lacking. Still, you are looking for options, and so here are a few examples:


The website Payphone Directory offers a list of pay phones by city and state. The search options on the sight are a bit limited, but the list of phones is extensive.Waymarking.com is a site that is great for finding information on things near your location. If you are searching for something nearby--including a pay phone--just type the name of the item in the main search box and then add the name of your location. A list of options will appear, and a map will show you where they are located., Because of the increasing scarcity of pay phones, you may have your best luck by simply asking the people who know the area well. For rural areas where the population tends to be older and internet connections are harder to have at home, there will be little information about payphones on any website. If you are in an emergency or have an urgent call to make, you will probably have to ask people for help.

, If instead of looking to make a call you are hoping to find out who is calling you, then you need a different kind of website. If you are receiving harassing phone calls and you find out they are coming from a pay phone, you can sometimes look up the location of the phone by using the number.


Mcpayphone is an example of one such site. It lists pay phones throughout the U.S. with a focus on the phone number of that pay phone. There are also physical addresses on the site, and this can be especially useful if you are trying to identify the location of a stalker.

Get an Private Branch Exchange (PBX) account.,
Find a SIP trunk provider.,
Subscribe to at least one DID (Direct Inward Dialing) number.,
Access the SIP trunk provider's configuration creator.,
Modify the configuration code.,
Set up Call Forwarding.",How to Find the Number of a Blocked Call1," One option is Asterisk, a free, open source software. Another is Switchvox.A PBX converts your computer into a telecommunications device and will allow you to manipulate incoming call data to identify blocked callers.


Before embarking on this method ensure that you thoroughly understand the technical challenge it presents and the potential financial burden it incurs.;
, A SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunk provider is a way to get a phone line via the internet instead of through traditional phone lines. In order to access all the information you'll need you must subscribe to an enterprise-level SIP provider, for instance Flowroute or Cisco's CallManager, Your SIP Trunk provider will offer phone numbers for you to control and monitor. Call data monitoring requires one such phone number.All the call data coming in to this number will include the ""masked"" identity information from blocked numbers.
Once set up properly you will be able to forward your normal phone number to the SIP trunk provider phone number (to get the identity information you want) then forward it back to your normal phone line.
Any VoIP (Voice over IP) phone number can work with a PBX like Asterisk to ""unmask"" the blocked number but enterprise level SIP trunk solutions offer the most flexible ability to access and manipulate your incoming data., Work within your SIP trunk provider account to generate lines of configuration code and implement through your PBX software., The configuration from your SIP trunk provider needs to be altered in order to display blocked caller identities. This is achieved by removing a few lines of privacy ""masking"".If you're still confused, check the references for more specific information.

, Adjust the configuration code by inserting your normal phone number. Calls will now forward to the DID number, get ""unmasked"" by the software hack, and then forward back to your normal line, automatically identifying blocked callers as they come in.

Back up electronic data.,
As much as possible, disassemble your gadget.,
Clean every piece.,
Cover your gadgets.,
Keep them in the right environment.",How to Efficiently Store Electronic Gadgets," Before storing it, be sure to back up all data that your device contains to an external hard-drive. You would surely want these data ready-to-use in case of emergencies or should mishaps will occur to your item in storage. Be reminded that a minor misstep may leave you without a device and without all the information the gadget contains. Treasured family photos, music or videos may be gone. So take that extra time and effort now in order to avoid regret later.
, A lot of electronics contain a wide variety of pieces that are important parts of the main device. Prior to storing, you have to pull the pieces apart and store them individually. Also, you have to keep plugs separate. Moreover, you must remove any CDs, DVDs, tapes or game cartridges, and keep them apart so as to avoid items getting stuck in drives or perhaps damaged over time., Similar to any item, be sure to give them a thorough clean first before placing them inside the storage unit. When it comes to electronics, you have to air out your items with a compressed air duster. These dusters will blow a thin stream of air into hard-to-clean places in order to clear out debris and dust that accumulates in electronic fans and ports., This will prevent the accumulation of dusts in your gadget. In case you have the original packing materials, you must place your devices in those. You must now wrap your items in plastic since this can make your items susceptible to moisture build-up. In turn, this will greatly impact your device’s functionality.,  Every condition and element can lead to extreme consequences for electronic kept in a storage unit for some time. You have to avoid storing items in conditions that are very hot, humid, cold, and windy. Climate-controlled storage units can control the specific humidity and temperature levels your device will need."

Some ""do not call"" agencies allow for you to file a formal complaint after having your phone number registered for a period of time and still being disturbed by sales calls., In many instances, simply telling marketers to remove your phone number from their company's list can stop at least some percentage of the blocked phone calls you're receiving. If you'd like more information check out Ask Telemarketers to Stop Calling.

, Depending on the situation, your telephone provider may be able to give you helpful advice about how to identify a blocked caller, get your phone number off other existing call lists, or to aid you in ""unlisting"" your number in their own records.

Keep detailed notes.,
Contact your telephone service provider.,
Give your records to law enforcement.,
Work with law enforcement to trap the culprit.,
Consider pressing charges.",How to Find the Number of a Blocked Call3," Note the time and date the blocked call was received, and any other details you have about the call. If you end up needing assistance from either your telephone service provider or from law enforcement, both will be more willing to help if you can a establish a pattern and offer detailed records.


Keeping a record of what is said during blocked phone calls is also important. Heavy breathing and hangups should be noted, along with any background noises.

, This can be a 3-digit number if you are using a cell phone or a 1-800 number for general customer service.


Your telephone service provider will help advise you and may even help you trace the call. In most cases however you will have to engage local law enforcement to determine the number.
Consider using a smartphone app designed to search, identify, and block many different kinds of callers. Truecaller is one such option available on all major platforms like iOS, Android, and Windowswhile Facebook's Hello is another., If the situation is serious enough and the telephone provider cannot provide a full solution to the issue, inform and work with local law enforcement to identify the caller and to remedy the situation

, Once law enforcement is involved they may request your help in identifying the offending caller. Cooperating with law enforcement fully is your best bet to solve the issue safely and effectively.


Sometimes for a call trace to occur, you will be required to keep the blocked caller on the line for an extended period. During the call law enforcement should be on another line to help identify the individual making the call.

, Consult your law enforcement contact and if still unsure consider seeking your own legal counsel. While pressing charges can be costly, it is sometimes the only way to end ongoing harassment.

First, skim through your photos and choose your best five.,
Next, open Adobe Photoshop and open your chosen photos.

,
Provide photo information.,
Adjust image size.,
Change image mode to CMYK color.,
If the lighting could be better, adjust the levels.,
If needed, crop the photo.,
Sharpen the image.,
Save every photo as a .PNG or .JPEG in a folder, possibly named ""art"", on your publication’s server.",How to Edit a Photo Fit for Print," Expand this to your best 15 if the Sun is running a slideshow online. Maintain variety: some close-ups of fire victims, broader shots of the burning building, and action photos of a fireman rushing out of the fray. If the photos are blurry, too dark, or simply lack to tell the story, cut them out.;
,, Choose File > File Info. In the window, enter your name in the “Author” entry. Write a brief caption in the “Caption” section describing where and when the photo was taken, what’s going on in the photo if it is not obvious, and the names of people in the photo if possible.

, In the top menu, choose Images. In the drop menu, click on Image size. Check the width and height in the “Documents” box (third and fourth entries) to be sure neither number is greater than 10 inches (25.4 cm) – adjust accordingly. Then, change the resolution (fifth entry) to 200.

, In the Images menu, hold the mouse over Mode and select CMYK from the menu. This may change the color composition slightly.

, Go to Images > Adjustments > Levels. You will see three arrows along a horizontal line. The one on the far left adds more shadows, while the one on the far right brightens highlights. The one in the middle adjusts mid-tones. While looking at the photo, move the arrows from right to left accordingly to create just enough contrast in the lighting without being overly dramatic. Err on the side of light, since printing presses tend to run colors slightly darker than what appears on the computer screen.

, In the toolbar on the left, select the square crop tool. It should look like a square object with a line going through the middle. Click and drag the object over the desired area, removing extraneous material. Adjust the cropping area by dragging any of the four corners from this selected area. When satisfied, hit ENTER. Avoid cutting off people’s limbs or cropping a location that could leave out important contextual information.

, Go to Filter > Sharpen > Unsharp Mask. In the window, maintain “Threshold” at 0, “Radius” between one and two, and the sharpening amount around 75 percent. While looking at the photo, adjust the sharpening amount by dragging the arrow just below it to the right or left. The trick is to sharpen the image as much as possible without appearing too grainy.

, After clicking File > Save As, go to the Art folder on the server. Look for drop menu with the file format and change it to .PNG or .JPEG. Name your photo with the original name and a suffix so that it is organized and obvious what image it came from and what its purpose is. For instance, your photo named ""DSC_001.JPG"" or ""DSC_001.CRW"" (Canon RAW) or ""DSC_001.NEF"" (Nikon RAW) after being edited will be saved as ""DSC_001_PrintEdit.JPG"" or ""DSC_001_PrintEdit.PNG"". Make sure you don't overwrite your existing photo if you chose to save in the same folder you imported your original photo to. Now, hit “Save.”

, Remove the working phone and it's cord from the jack.

, Plug the phone that wasn't working into the same jack that the working phone was using. Use the same cord that the non-working phone used.

, If the phone has a dial tone after being plugged in, then the original wall jack is the culprit. If the phone still doesn't have a dial tone, then the phone itself is likely broken, or the cord isn't working.

, Before writing off the phone, try the working cord from the phone that did have a dial tone. If this gets your original phone working, then the problem was a faulty cord, which can easily be replaced. If this doesn't work, then you'll need a new phone.

, If the phone works on the other jack, then the original phone jack is likely faulty. Most carriers will not pay to repair this, which means you'll need to either fix it yourself or pay for a technician to come and check the wiring.

A lightning strike while you're holding a phone could be fatal. If your service goes out because of a storm, you'll need to wait for the carrier to repair the lines that went down.

, If none of the phones in your house have a dial tone, the carrier may need to fix your service. If some of the phones have a dial tone, but others don't, the wiring in your house may be faulty and need servicing. This is not covered by most carriers, so you'll have to either do it yourself or hire a technician.

, If one of your handsets was left off the hook for too long, your line may have been locked. Check all of your phones, and if you find one that is off the hook, you may need to wait a few minutes before your line is unlocked again.

, Each time you unplug a phone, wait 30 seconds and check for a dial tone on another phone in the house. If you hear a dial tone, then the last phone or device you disconnected was causing the problem. If you don't hear a dial tone, reconnect the phone or device and move on to the next one., This is a box that was installed by the phone company when service was first installed on the house. The NID may be located outside where the cables come into the house, or may be located inside of the house in a utility area.Outdoor NIDs are typically located near your power meter or at the location that cables from the street come into your house. It's usually a gray box, but may be painted the same as the house.
Indoor NIDs are more often found in apartments and condos, usually in the kitchen. They look like a larger, more complex phone jack.

, You may need a flathead screwdriver to open it.


Indoor NIDs do not need to be opened to access the test jack.

, This jack is usually labeled as ""Test Jack,"" though it may be unlabeled. Most NIDs only have one jack in the customer access area. In outdoor NIDs, you can usually find it in the upper-left corner of the box after opening it. In indoor NIDs, the test jack is usually located along the bottom edge. Remove the cable that is currently plugged into it.

, Connect a phone and cord that you know work to the test jack. If you're not sure if you have a working phone, ask to borrow one from a neighbor.

, After connecting the phone to the test jack, pick up the handset and listen for a dial tone.


If you can hear a dial tone, then something is wrong with your house's wiring.
If you can't hear a dial tone, you'll need to contact your carrier and request a technician visit, since something is wrong with their equipment or wiring.

, Make sure to replace the cable that was connected to the test jack after you're finished testing, or you won't get service anywhere in your house., Carriers typically don't cover repairs to the wiring inside your house. If you're feeling confident, you can try to repair the wiring yourself. This is a large undertaking for many people, but may save you from having to hire a technician to come and rewire your house. You'll need to check the connection from the NID to the wiring that leads to all of your jacks, as well as the jacks themselves.


One malfunctioning jack can cause the others in the house to malfunction as well.
See Install a Residential Telephone Jack for instructions on repairing and replacing the phone jacks in your home.

, If you can't get a dial tone while connected to the test jack, you'll need to get a technician from your carrier to repair the line. This should be covered in your phone plan, though you may have to wait a while until someone shows up.


If you don't have a way to contact your carrier because your phone line is down and you don't have a cell phone, you'll need to borrow a neighbor's phone or use a public phone.

Move or disable interfering equipment.",How to Diagnose Landline Phone Problems3," The first thing to do when troubleshooting static is to methodically disconnect each piece of equipment that is connected to your phone line. This includes other phones, answering machines, DSL modems, fax machines, computers connected via dial-up, and alarm systems.

, Each time you disconnect a piece of equipment, listen for static on the line. If the static stops, then the last piece you disconnected is likely causing the interference.


Try plugging the offending piece of equipment into a different jack if possible.

, It's possible the jack itself is causing the interference, and not the device that was connected. If the static returns after plugging in a different phone or device, you'll need to replace the jack. See Install a Residential Telephone Jack for instructions.

, If you're experiencing static or other interference on your cordless phone, there may be too many signals on the frequency. Look for a Channel button on your handset or on the base station. Change channels until you find one clear of interference.

, Certain electronics impede on the frequency used by cordless phones, and moving or turning off this equipment may help your signal.Try to keep cordless phones out of your kitchen, as microwave ovens will often disrupt the signal.
Home wireless networks running on 802.11b/g are operating on the same frequency as your cordless phone (2.4GHz. You may need to upgrade your router to one that supports 5GHz wireless. See Choose a Wireless Router for more information.

, If you are using Windows 7, 8, or OS X, you can right-click on the ISO and select ""Burn disc image"". If you are using an older version of Windows, you will need to install a burning program such as ImgBurn.



Click here for detailed instructions on burning ISO files to DVD.
You can use the free USBWriter utility to turn a USB drive into an Arch Linux installation drive if the computer you are installing on doesn't have a disc drive.

, Installing Arch Linux (or any operating system) will erase all of the data on the hard drive partition it is installed on. If you are only using one partition on your computer, Arch Linux will erase all of the data on it.



Click here for detailed instructions on backing up data.

, Reboot the computer.

, On most newer computers, this is F12, though the exact key should be displayed on the screen during boot up. If there is no key to change boot order, press the BIOS Setup key (usually F1, F2, F10, or Del).

, If you are in the BIOS Setup menu, there is typically a Boot menu that allows you to set the order. You will want to set the drive that contains your Arch Linux installation media as the primary drive.

, If you don't see this option, or your computer boots to your existing operating system, then you likely did not select the correct boot drive.


If you are booting in UEFI Mode, the menu option will read Arch Linux archiso x86_64 UEFI.

, Arch Linux will attempt to establish a connection to the internet during the boot process. You can test to ensure it worked by pinging a website. For example, enter the following to ping Google: ping -c 3 www.google.com.


If you aren't able to establish a connection, ensure that your Ethernet cable is securely connected or you are close enough to your wireless router to get a good signal.

, For simplicity's sake, this guide will explain how to install Arch Linux from a blank disk without booting two operating systems. Type sgdisk --zap-all /dev/sda and press ↵ Enter. This will erase all of the data on the hard disk, so make sure anything important is backed up first.


If you want to install Arch Linux as a second operating system alongside Windows, you will need to install Windows first. The above command will delete everything on the disk, including any Windows installation.

, Type efivar -l and press ↵ Enter. If the UEFI entries in the results are filled in, then you are using UEFI mode instead of legacy BIOS. This is important when it comes time to make new partitions.

, The process for both will be explained below.

, This tool will allow you to create GPT partitions for UEFI systems. You will need to create an extra EFI partition as well. In this example, we will be creating a Root partition, a Home partition, and an EFI partition. If you need to create MBR partitions, skip to the next step.


Start cgdisk by typing cgdisk /dev/sda and pressing ↵ Enter.
Select New and then press ↵ Enter to select the first sector. Type the size you want to make the Root partition (e.g. 20G for 20 gigabytes). Press ↵ Enter two more times to create the Root partition.
Press ↓ until the remaining free space is selected. Press ↵ Enter to select the first sector. Type in the the size you want to make the Home partition. Make sure to leave about 500 MB for your EFI partition. Press ↵ Enter two more times to create the Home partition.
Press ↓ until the remaining free space is selected. Press ↵ Enter to select the first sector, and then press ↵ Enter again to select the remaining free space (should be around 500 MB. Press ↵ Enter two more times to create the EFI partition.
Select Write to write the new partitions to the disk. Type yes and choose Quit to exit cgdisk.

, These partitions are required if you are using legacy BIOS boot. In this example, we will be creating a Root partition and a Home partition.


Start fdisk by typing fdisk /dev/sda and pressing ↵ Enter.
Type o and press ↵ Enter to create the partition table.
Create the Root partition:

Type n and press ↵ Enter to create a new partition.
Press ↵ Enter when prompted to select the partition type.
Press ↵ Enter when prompted to select the partition number.
Press ↵ Enter when prompted to select the first sector.
Type the amount of space you want to create the partition for (e.g. +20G) and press ↵ Enter



Create the Home partition:

Type n and press ↵ Enter to create a new partition.
Press ↵ Enter when prompted to select the partition type.
Press ↵ Enter when prompted to select the partition number.
Press ↵ Enter when prompted to select the first sector.
Press ↵ Enter when prompted to select the amount of space you want to create the partition for. This will create the partition with all the remaining free space.


Type w and press ↵ Enter to write the changes to the disk.

, Creating the partitions only allocates space on the disk. You will need to format this space so that Arch Linux can be installed and access the space. The following commands are for the example above, so if you set up your partitions differently, adjust the commands accordingly.


Type mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1 and press ↵ Enter to format the root partition.
Type mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2 and press ↵ Enter to format the home partition.
Type mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda3 and press ↵ Enter to format the EFI partition (GPT only).

, Once your partitions are created and formatted, you'll need to mount them so that Arch Linux can point to them. Again, these instructions are based on the example above, so adjust your commands accordingly.


Mount the root partition to /mnt by typing mount /dev/sda1 /mnt and pressing ↵ Enter.
Create the directory for your home partition after mounting root by typing mkdir /mnt/home and pressing ↵ Enter.
Mount the home partition in the new directory by typing mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/home.
Create a directory for the EFI partition (if necessary). Type mkdir /mnt/boot and pres ↵ Enter. Mount the EFI partition to the new directory by typing mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/boot and pressing ↵ Enter.

, The mirrors are servers that allow you to download packages required to install Arch Linux. it is a good idea to change your primary mirror to the closest physical mirror available.

, Visit archlinux.org/mirrorlist/ on another computer and use the tool to find the closest mirror to your physical location. Copy the address down. It may help to write down a few mirrors in case one is offline.

, You can add additional mirrors underneath in the order you want them to try to connect.

, Type pacstrap -i /mnt base base-devel and press ↵ Enter. This will load the essential files onto the root directory. The process may take a few minutes.

, This file allows Arch Linux to identify your partition's file systems. Type genfstab -U -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab and press ↵ Enter.

, Type arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash and press ↵ Enter.

, This file will determine what monetary units and time format to use. Type nano /etc/locale.gen to edit the Locale file.


For US users, remove the # in front of the en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 entry. Users from other countries should remove the # for their specific format.
Type locale-gen to create the file using the settings in the locale.gen file.
Type echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf to set your language as the system-wide language. Replace en_US.UTF-8 with whatever you chose above.
Type export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 to finish the location setup.

, After setting your location information, you'll need to configure your timezone to get the correct time.


Type ls /usr/share/zoneinfo/ to view all of the available timezones. There will be directories with subzones available.
Create a link to your chosen timezone by typing ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Zone/Subzone /etc/localtime. For example, to set the timezone for new York, you would type ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime and press ↵ Enter.

, Arch Linux recommends setting your clock to UTC, which is different than the clock standard used by Windows but less buggy. It won't display in UTC unless your locale displays UTC. To set your clock to UTC, type hwclock --systohc --utc

, This is the name that your computer will display when connected to the network. Replace myhostname in the following commands with whatever you'd like.


Type echo myhostname > /etc/hostname and press ↵ Enter

Type nano /etc/hosts and press ↵ Enter to open the hosts file. Add your myhostname to the two localhost.localdomain entries.

, If you have a wired network connection, enter the following command. If you have a wireless network connection, skip down to the next step.


Type ip link and press ↵ Enter to determine the interface name of your network adapter.
Type systemctl enable dhcpcd@interfacename.service and press ↵ Enter, replacing interfacename with the name you retrieved using ip link.

, If you have a wireless network, enter in the following commands to enable it.


Type ip link and press ↵ Enter to determine the interface name of your network adapter.
Type pacman -S iw wpa_supplicant and press ↵ Enter to install the necessary software.
Type pacman -S dialog and press ↵ Enter to install the Wi-Fi menu.
Type pacman -S wpa_actiond and press ↵ Enter to install the software that allows you to automatically connect to known networks.
Type systemctl enable netctl-auto@interfacename.service to turn on the auto-connection service for your wireless adapter.
Next time you reboot, type wifi-menu interfacename to access the wireless menu for your adapter. After you connect to the network for the first time, you will be automatically connected for subsequent boots.Do not enter this now, or you will lose access to your network.

, Type passwd and press ↵ Enter to set your root password. You will need this password whenever you make changes to the root.

, This is the software that loads the operating system when the computer start. One of the most popular and easy-to-install bootloaders is GRUB. The procedure varies slightly depending on whether you are using a UEFI or legacy BIOS motherboard.


UEFI:

Download Grub: Type pacman -S grub and press ↵ Enter.
At this point, you'll need to install UEFI Boot Manager. If you do not install EFI Boot Manager, you would face problems while installing boot loader.
Type pacman -S grub efibootmgr then ↵ Enter.
Install Grub: Type grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=arch_grub --recheck and press ↵ Enter.
Type grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg and press ↵ Enter.


BIOS:

Type pacman -S grub and press ↵ Enter.
Type grub-install --target=i386-pc --recheck /dev/sda and press ↵ Enter.
Type grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg and press ↵ Enter.



, Type exit and press ↵ Enter. Then type reboot and press ↵ Enter.


Be sure to remove the installation disc before rebooting the computer.

If you just started hanging out with this guy for a couple weeks, it will probably sound like a date to him. If you've been friends for a couple years, then it shouldn't be a problem. If your friend isn't single (or if you aren't single), make sure your boyfriend and his girlfriend know that it's platonic.;
, Don't just outta the blue ask your friend to go with you in an hour. Call him when you know he will be home or will answer the phone and ask him at least 2 or 3 days in advance. If you know he can't go with you, then don't ask! When you call have an idea of what you want to do. Don't plan the whole thing without him though, make sure you ask him what times, etc. would be good for him.

, Keeping plans with a guy can be hard sometimes, but you have to be flexible. In your mind, have two back up plans just in case. And remember that this is not a date, so if he cancels on you --- don't get too bent out of shape! Be open to the idea of other people coming with you. Don't plan a double date or try to even out the playing field. If two of his friends end up coming and you are the only girl, don't make it seem like a big deal. You're friends so you should feel comfortable around them and not need to even the playing field.

, It's not a date, so don't expect him to pick up the tab! Even so, you were the one who asked him out. On a date, the one who asks pays, so expecting him to pay wouldn't be fair anyway. Since this is not a date though you should each pay your own way, or make an agreement beforehand.

, Was your best friend busy and he was the only one around? Have you all not seen each other in awhile? Does he owe you? Just make sure he knows it's not a date.

, Show him that you do not devote all your time to him. Don't be rude, but since it's not a date, you don't have to call him and thank him. You don't have to email him either. Next time you see him say, ""Yea thanks, that was a lot of fun!"" or something else that you would tell to a friend. Do not say, ""We should do it again sometime!"" That is a line that may give the wrong message. Since you are friends, you probably will hang out again, but you don't need to tell him this.

, A relationship isn't necessarily sexual, passionate,or romantic. Don't spend too much time with your friend, and don't go out with him too often. Spend equal amounts of time with all your friends! Avoid too much contact. You don't have to call, text, email, or IM him all the time. He probably doesn't want to talk to you that much! All things are good in moderation...

Give the person space.,
Make sure that the person is really ignoring you.,
Think about why the person could be mad at you.,
If you're stuck, ask friends for help.,
Don't let it consume you.",How to Get Someone to Stop Ignoring You1," If the person is ignoring you, then the worst thing you can do is call, text, and Facebook message the person every five seconds, or even follow the person around asking, ""What's wrong? What did I do?"" Though you may want to be as proactive as possible when you find that someone is really ignoring you, it's the worst thing you can do if you want to repair the relationship. Instead, take a step back to let the person cool off or just get some distance from you, and think about the situation before you proceed.


It's natural to want instant results, and to want to fix a problem the second you see it appear. But life isn't like that. You need to give the person some breathing room so you can both think about what happened instead of jumping into a conversation you're not ready for.;
, Paranoid much? Are you certain that the person is really ignoring you instead of just being too busy to answer your calls the second he or she hears from you? Maybe the person is in a terrible mood or a bad situation and thinks to ignore everyone is the best way to deal. Maybe the person has just been acting weird toward everybody. Before you proceed, it's important to make sure that the behaviour is directed toward you.


Watch the person with other people. Is he or she chatty, friendly, and his or her usual self around others? If so, then yeah, maybe it is you. But if the person seemed a little off and withdrawn in general, then you may have been assuming too much.

, Okay, so if you've decided that the person is ignoring you, then it's time to dig deep and figure out what you could have done to make it happen. In some cases, it will be easy -- maybe you hurt the person by not inviting him or her to a party, maybe the person heard you were gossiping about him, or her, or maybe you just said something hurtful without meaning to and the person is upset about it. Once you've pinpointed the reason, you can figure out how to talk about it.


Figuring out the reason gives you more ammo when you go into the conversation than just asking the person why he or she is ignoring you without knowing why. You'll be more prepared about what to say -- and more ready to defend your actions.
This is not to say that all of the reasons why the person could be mad at you are great. Maybe the person thinks something you did that was harmless was really meant to be hurtful. Even if you don't believe that you were in the wrong, it's helpful to know what the person is actually thinking.

, If you're really sure that the person is ignoring you and can't for your life figure out why then you may have to turn to some mutual friends for help. Maybe they'll know exactly what you did because they talked to the friend about it. It could be something so harmless, or something you didn't think the person knew about, that you would never figure it out on your own. Pick a friend who cares about both of you and wants to fix the situation and see if he or she can shed some insight and help you out.


Obviously, don't go around asking every person you both know why that person could be mad at you. This could get back to the person and may make him or her even more annoyed.

, Yeah, nobody likes to be ignored. It can especially hurt if that person is your best friend or your significant other. If you're used to spending a lot of time with that person or just hanging out in the same social circles as that person, then yeah, it's no fun to suddenly be given the cold shoulder. This may drive you crazy, make you feel bad about yourself, or even feel embarrassed if the person is purposefully doing it in front of other people. However, no matter how unpleasant the situation is, you have to stay focused on your life and your goals and the things that make you happy -- don't let the person see that your happiness is based entirely on your relationship.


Of course, you're going to be frustrated about it, but life has to go on. Tell yourself, ""I'm going to get mad about how my friend isn't talking to me from 5 pm to 5:15 pm, and then I will get back to my life."" Thinking about it over and over isn't going to make you feel better.

You can also use it to find everything that matches part of the file name. For example, if you have a lot of documents related to wikiHow, you could find them all by typing ""*wiki*"".

, If you're getting lots of search results, it can be difficult to sift through them. Use the | character and send the search results to the ""less"" filtering program. This can allow you to scroll through and filter the results much easier.





find /home/pat -iname ""*.conf"" | less




, You can use modifiers to only return specific types of results. You can search for regular files (f), directories (d), symbolic links (l), character devices (c), and block devices (b) by using the right modifier.





find / -type f -iname ""filename""




, If you have lots of files with similar names, but know the size you are looking for, you can filter our results by size.





find / -size +50M -iname ""filename""





This will return results that are 50 megabytes or larger. You can use + or - to search for greater or lesser sizes. Omitting the + or - will search for files exactly the specified size.
You can filter by bytes (c), kilobytes (k), megabytes (M), gigabytes (G), or 512-byte blocks (b). Note that the size flag is case-sensitive.

, You can use the -and, -or, and -not operators to combine different types of searches into one.find /travelphotos -type f -size +200k -not -iname ""*2015*""





The command will find files in the ""travelphotos"" directory that are greater than 200 kilobytes in size but do not have ""2015"" anywhere in the file name.

, If you are trying to find a specific file owned by a user, or files with certain permissions, you can narrow the search.





find / -user pat -iname ""filename""
find / -group users -iname ""filename""
find / -perm 777 -iname ""filename""





The above examples will search the specified users, groups, or permissions for the query. You can also omit the filename query to return all of the files that match that type. For example, find / -perm 777 will return all of the files with the 777 (no restrictions) permissions., You can combine the find command with other commands so that you can execute them on the files that are returned by the query. Separate the find command and the second command with the -exec flag, and then end the line with {} \;





find . -type f -perm 777 -exec chmod 755 {} \;





This will search the current directory (and all subdirectories) for files that have 777 permissions. It will then use the chmod command to change the permissions to 755.

Talk to the person.,
Apologize if necessary.,
If the apology doesn't work, then back off.,
See if it's even worth it to keep trying.",How to Get Someone to Stop Ignoring You2," Once you've given the person a bit of space and have an idea of why the person may be mad at you, then you should try to initiate a conversation. Don't confront the person in public or in the middle of the day when the person is likely to be busy or easily frazzled; instead, ask the person if you can meet later and pick an appropriate place and time to have a conversation. If the person really doesn't want to engage with you, then you can pick a time when the person will be alone and when you can talk without making too much of a nuisance of yourself.


Tell the person that you've been hurt that you've been ignored and that you want to talk about it. Let him, or her know how much the relationship means to you, and how much you want to be able to talk to the person again.
If you're genuinely confused about why it's happening, then you can ask the person. Say that you both will feel better if the reasons the person is ignoring you are out in the open.
If it's someone you like romantically, be prepared for the fact that the person just may not like you anymore or may not return your feelings. Sure, this will hurt, but it's better to know than to wonder what the person thinks.

, If you know or have been told why the person is ignoring you, then make eye contact, look serious, and tell the person that you're sorry about what you've done. Tell the person that you regret what you did and that you'll never do it again. Show that the relationship means a lot to you and that you've done a lot of thinking and wish that you hadn't done it. Don't be distracted, let the person see the pain on your face, and show how sorry you are.


If the person is upset about something that you did, but you don't think it was a big deal or that it warrants an apology, then you have to decide. Do you want to stick to your guns and not apologize because you don't think you've done anything wrong, or would you rather just apologize so you can return to your relationship instead of being ignored?

, Okay, so you've apologized, and the person isn't budging, or he or she is just still hurt. If you've done something pretty hurtful, like cheating on the individual, gossiping, or just making the person feel bad, then an apology won't magically restore your friendship. Maybe the person tells you that what you did was so unforgivable that you can never return to your relationship; maybe the person says that he or she still wants to be friends, but that he or she needs some time to heal. Whatever you hear, you need to respect the person's needs and back off.


Of course, you may just want to jump right back into the friendship, even if the person says he or she needs space. But that's not going to make the person heal any faster. In fact, it'll only prolong the process.
No mountain of ""I'm sorry"" can undo what you did to make the person mad at you. Now it's time to give the person time and space to figure it out. This won't be fun, but it's the best way.

, Maybe the person is stubborn. Maybe he or she is mad at you for a ridiculous reason. Maybe the person just doesn't feel like being your friend or significant other. If you feel like the person is the one with the problem and that you've done everything you could to try to win him or her over and nothing has worked, then maybe it's time to move on without caring about the person anymore. That may sound harsh, but if you get the feeling that the person is just trying to cause you harm, then why bother with trying to fix things?


You have to do some careful thinking here. If the person isn't worth your efforts, then you'll know it in your heart.

Install the .locate functionality.,
Update your .locate database.,
Use .locate to perform simple searches.,
Limit your search results.",How to Find a File in Linux2," The locate command generally works much faster than find, because it works off a database of your file structure. Not all Linux distributions come with the locate functionality installed, so enter the following commands to attempt to install it:


Type sudo apt-get update and press ↵ Enter.
You can install it in Debian and Ubuntu like this: Type sudo apt-get install mlocate and press ↵ Enter. If locate is already installed, you'll see the message mlocate is already the newest version.
In Arch Linux, use the pacman package manager: pacman -Syu mlocate

For Gentoo, use emerge: emerge mlocate


, The locate command will not be able to find anything until its database has been built and updated. This happens automatically daily, but you can manually update it too. You'll need to do this if you want to start using locate immediately.Type sudo updatedb and press ↵ Enter.

, The locate command is fast, but it doesn't have as many options as the find command. You can perform a basic file search in much the same way as the find command.





locate -i ""*.jpg""





This command will search you entire system for files with the .jpg extension. The wildcard character * functions the same way it does with the find command.
Like the find command, the -i ignores the case of your query.

, If your searches are returning too many results to handle, you can trim them down using the -n option, followed by the number of results you want displayed.





locate -n 20 -i ""*.jpg""





Only the first 20 results that match the query will be displayed.
You can also use the | pipe to send the results to less for easy scrolling.

"
"
Use the .grep command to search for strings of text within files.,
Cut out the extra text.,
Hide error messages.",How to Find a File in Linux3," If you are looking for a file that contains a certain phrase or string of characters, you can use the grep command. A basic grep command is formatted as follows:





grep -r -i ""search query"" /path/to/directory/





The -r sets the search to ""recursive"", so it will search the current directory and all subdirectories for any file that contains the query string.
The -i indicates that the query is not case-sensitive. If you want to force the search to pay attention to case, omit the -i operator.

, When you perform a grep search as above, you'll see the file name along with the text with the matching query highlighted. You can hide the matching text and just display the file names and paths by including the following:





grep -r -i ""search query"" /path/to/directory/ | cut -d: -f1




, The grep command will return an error when it tries to access folders without the correct permissions or runs into empty folders. You can send the error messages to /dev/null, which will hide them from the output.grep -r -i ""search query"" /path/to/directory/ 2>/dev/null

Don't assume that you understand someone's habits just because you see how large they are.,
Ask why you want to change their habits.,
Never criticize someone's weight, implicitly or explicitly.,
Accept them as they are.",How to Get Your Friend to Lose Weight1," A heavy person might play sports and eat a balanced diet, while a thin person might thrive upon junk food and late-night internet browsing. People of any size may have a disability affecting their ability to exercise or eat certain food groups. You can't see someone's habits just by looking at their weight.;
, Look beyond ""fat is bad:"" what is the real reasoning you want to push someone to make such drastic changes? Why do the particulars of their body matter so much to you?


You want to take on the role of saving them from themselves
You are physically disgusted by their weight, or by fat people in general
You are embarrassed to be seen with someone fat
You don't care about their weight; you just want them to be happy and treat themselves well

, If your friend is on the bigger side, they know. In fact, people probably won't stop telling them. Heavy people are at greater risk for mental health issues and low self-esteem, and reminding them how fat they are is not going to make it any better.


You are their friend, not a critic or a personal trainer.
Criticizing their body won't help them. It's hard to take good care of something you hate, so don't encourage them to hate their body.

, A good friend likes their friend for whom they already are, not for whom they might someday become. Focus on accepting the whole package, including their weight. What is good about your friend: their sense of humor, their compassion, their skill at theater?

Be open-minded.,
Change your routine.,
Try a sport.,
Join an activity you like.",How to Get a New Friend (Girls)1," When making new friends, the best way to start is to look at the places you already know. You probably have people in your everyday life that you haven't really met or talked to. To make a new friend, you need to seek out those people you haven't talked to yet. It's important to think outside the box. You may not have talked to someone because you didn't think you would like them, but to make new friends, you need to be open to a wide variety of people.Remember, people aren't always what they seem. You may think someone may not make a good friend just by looking at them, but you don't know what that person is like until you get to know them.;
, Making new friends means opening yourself up to new possibilities. You have to change things up. Try sitting somewhere new at lunch for instance. Sitting with a new group of people is ideal, but even just sitting in a different part of the cafeteria can make a difference.You could also try a different hang out spot. If you usually hang out in the library after school, try moving to the gym or the courtyard, for instance.

, Joining a sport can help you make friends. You'll be on a team where you have to work together to play a game. Working together can help you make friends, as you're all working towards a common goal. Your school should have a wide variety of sports available.You could play basketball, volleyball, or soccer.
You don't have to join a sport at your school. Your community should also have sports and other athletic activities for kids your age, including dance.

, Clubs are a great place to meet new people. You'll find people there who like something you do already, whatever the club is about. See what your school offers. Don't decide by what's the most popular. Instead, join one that sounds interesting to you. That way, you'll find other people there with common interests.You could join a chess club, art club, marching band, or school choir. It doesn't have to be a club or even something associated with your school. You could join community clubs or classes, too.

Eat healthy snacks when you invite them over.,

Find ways to be active at home.,
Help them see their body not in terms of what it looks like, but what it can do.,

Get outdoors together.",How to Get Your Friend to Lose Weight2," Instead of pulling out the chips, try a snack that incorporates some healthy foods. Consider fruits, nuts, and vegetables.


Celery sticks and peanut butter
Carrots in ranch
Trail mix
Apple slices with caramel

, Good self esteem helps them love and take care of their body, and be happier in general. Help them see themselves as awesome, regardless (not in spite) of their weight. Make it clear that you're their friend because you think they are a great person.


If your friend is insecure about their appearance, it never hurts to compliment their looks or pick out clothes for them while talking about how awesome they will look wearing this.

, Consider backyard sports and other games that get you both moving. It can be as simple as playing catch or as in-depth as setting up a soccer field in your front yard.


Keep sports equipment around, like footballs, volleyball nets, badminton rackets, etc. if you have a yard to play in
Dance Dance Revolution and Xbox 360 Kinect have games that involve moving.

, Their legs can run, their arms can dance, their hands can draw beautiful pictures or play wonderful songs on the piano. Help them appreciate their body's talents. If they love their body more, it will help motivate them to treat it well.

, Have plenty of water available to stay hydrated, and don't get too exhausted. If your friend isn't used to exercise or has a disability, they might hit their limit before you hit yours. This is okay: let them take a break or stop. Exercise, especially exercise with friends, should be fun.

, Sunlight can improve people's mood and general mental health, and being outside often involves some form of exercise. Find fun things to do outside so you both can get moving and enjoy the day.

Start a conversation.,
Be approachable.,
Act friendly.,
Find common interests.,
Ask questions about your new friend.",How to Get a New Friend (Girls)2," Begin by smiling at the person. Smiling makes you feel happier and more confident. It can make it easier to walk up to someone to start a conversation. Plus, when you smile, the person you're smiling at automatically wants to smile back. Then, introduce yourself by saying ""Hello"" and giving your name.Start with, ""Hello, I'm Jessica. What's your name?""
Bring up a topic to begin the conversation. In a conversation, both you and the person you're talking to need a chance to say something. You're exchanging information to learn about each other. For example, you could ask them about their favorite singer or what their favorite color is.You could also start a conversation about what's going on around you. For instance, if you're in math class, you could say, ""Is there a lot of homework this year?""
If you're at lunch, you could say, ""So what's your favorite food?""

, Smiling at people is a good way to show people you're open to friendship. You don't always need to be the person who says ""Hello."" Sometimes, other people will come up to you if you look approachable. Approachable just means you look like someone nice that another person could have a conversation with.In other words, try not to cross your arms or look angry if you want someone to approach. Try to look happy and interested in other people.
If someone comes up to say ""hello,"" ask her to sit next to you. You could say, ""I'm so glad you came over! Would you like to sit next to me?""

, When you're meeting someone new, you have to be able to hold a conversation. That means you need to both ask questions about the other person and answer their questions in return. It's a way of getting to know one another. It involves both giving to the conversation and actively listening to what the person has to say.You could ask them, ""What's your favorite food?"" If they say, ""Pizza!"" you could say, ""Pizza is my favorite, too! We made it at home last week.""
That way, you're offering something about yourself (what your favorite food is), as well as offering them something to respond to (""We made it at home last week."") They might say, ""Really? I've never made pizza before. Is it hard?""

, Many friendships are based on the fact that you have common interests. That doesn't mean that you like all the same things. However, it does mean that you share some things that you both like. As you're talking to the person, try to figure out what things you both like. That way, you can develop those interests.For example, you discovered you both have a love of pizza. That's a common interest! You could get pizza together, or you could even invite them over to your house to learn how to make pizza.
You could say, ""Since we both love pizza so much, maybe you'd like to come over sometime and make pizza with me.""

, Use what you know about the person to ask questions about their life and interests. If you don't know very much about the person, ask questions to get to know them better.


For example, you could ask, ""I saw you're on the dance team. How long have you been dancing?""
Or, you could ask, ""How's your project for our math class going? Mine is taking forever!""

"
"
Offer a compliment.,
Do nice things.,
Listen to your friend.,
Let the person be who they are.",How to Get a New Friend (Girls)3," Everyone likes to hear good things about themselves. When someone tells you something nice about yourself, it makes you feel good, right? Well, the same works for other people, too. When you're trying to make new friends, it helps to give that person a compliment because it makes her feel good when she's around you.All you have to do to give someone a compliment is tell them something you like about them. For instance, you could say, ""Your purple shirt is awesome!"" or ""You're really smart!""
Of course, you don't want to stop just because you became friends. Keep giving each other compliments. It'll make you both happier.

, Like compliments, people like it when you're nice to them. Plus, being nice to someone helps you make friends. When you do nice things for people, they want to hang around you more and be your friend because you're fun to be around.For instance, bring them a treat from home when you bake, or help them out when they're struggling with a problem. You could also make them a bracelet to show you want to be friends.

, Everyone likes to talk about what's going in their life. When you want to be a friend to someone, you can't just talk about what you're doing all the time. You also need to give your friend a chance to talk, too. Ask them how their day is going, and see what they says.Respond to what they say. For instance, if they say, ""I'm really sad,"" say, ""I'm sorry. Why are you sad?""
In addition, it's important to listen when you're friend is going through a tough time. Everyone has problems from time to time, and it usually helps to talk about it. When your new friend is feeling down, ask them what's wrong. See if they want to talk about it, and then listen to what they have to say. Being a good friend means being there for them when they need someone to listen.
Social skills come easier to some people than others. If you want some practice, ask your parents. They can help you build your listening skills.You can also use nonverbal listening cues. Look the person in the eyes, nod when they speak, and give them small affirming words (like ""uh-huh"") to let them know that you're listening. Have open body language towards the person: face them and don't cross your arms.

, When you meet new people, you may not like certain parts of who they are. Nobody's perfect, and everyone has something that will bother someone else. The important thing is to try to see past that to the person. If you like the person, try to just accept them for who they are, just like you expect to be accepted for who you are.For example, maybe you don't like the fact that your friend loves Justin Bieber. Everyone has different tastes, so let it slide.
Maybe you notice that your friend chews with their mouth open and that bothers you. It's better to just overlook that fact than to unfriend a person over it.

Stay friends if you break up.",How to Fall In Love with Your Best Friend," Is it really romantic love, or are you trying to create something that isn’t there? Is it just physical attraction or a matter of convenience? Be sure of your attraction before you talk to your best friend. Some questions you can ask yourself:Are you trying new things to impress your best friend?
Are you investing more time in your best friend?
Are you more anxious or emotional when around your best friend?
Do you find yourself imagining what it would be like to date your best friend?
Have you noticed your best friend looking at you differently or complimenting you?;
, Falling in love is fun, but to fall in love with your best friend might be riskier since you don’t want to ruin the friendship. Think about how compatible you and your friend are by considering if you share

:Basic moral and religious values
Similar levels of intelligence
Similar interests and hobbies
A willingness to share
Similar temperaments
Attraction to each other

, You already know you best friend really well, you probably feel like you can be yourself around him or her, and they probably already support you, respect you, understand you, and listen to you, or you wouldn’t be best friends. Now think about the potential consequences

:You might change the dynamic of your mutual friend group.
Your friendship might end if they don’t share the same romantic feelings.
You might end up breaking up if you do become more than friends.

, Once you know whether or not your feelings are legitimate, decide if you want to tell them your feelings. Decide if you can let go of any fear you have of losing or changing your friendship.

, Now it's time to talk to your best friend about your feelings. Share with them that you’d like to take things to a different level. It may be awkward or difficult to talk about, but you’ll likely regret not expressing how you feel.Talk to them in person, not via text or social media. Find a private place to talk.Be truthful and direct. You can say, “You’re a good friend to me. Lately I’ve been feeling that I like you as more than a friend. I think I’ve noticed that you might like me, too. Can we talk about it? I know it might be awkward and I don’t want to ruin what we have.”
Be aware of timing. Don’t approach your best friend with this talk if either of you are intoxicated or in a relationship with someone else., If they share your feelings, and want to move beyond friendship with you, determine what each of you wants. Do you want to date? How do you want to define yourselves? Is one of you just expecting to be friends with benefits?


If your best friend wants more of a “friends with benefits” type of situation, and you agree to it even though you’re experiencing more love-like feelings, you may end up hurting yourself and feeling like you have to hide your deeper feelings. Don’t go into one of these types of relationships holding back your true feelings and expecting love to build on their side.Be open and honest about what you both want if this relationship doesn't work out.

, Don’t skip the dating phase just because you know each other pretty well already. Take your time to get to know each other as romantic partners, instead of just friends. Dating will help make things less intense and allow you to break away from the routine of friendship.Make each other dinner.
Explore new hobbies together.
Keep your mutual friends out of your relationship for now.
Create boundaries. If you spent all your time together as best friends and talked about everything, take a step back from that pattern now that your relationship has changed., Get to know each other more deeply by talking about your hopes, dreams, and goals for the future. Take a trip together, just the two of you. Consider asking each other more meaningful questions, which were designed by a psychologist to create more intimacy between two people.What do you feel most grateful for in life?
If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?
What do you value most in our friendship?
What positive characteristics do you like most about each other?

, It might be awkward at first, or it could be wonderful, but you won’t know until you try and transition your friendship into something more intimate. Remember that sex complicates things, so keep in mind to:Set boundaries for physical intimacy.
Talk about these boundaries and your expectations.
Respect each other and listen if the other person says “no.”
Check-in regularly on your feelings.

, Give your partner attention and affection. Express gratitude and admiration. Compliment your partner, give them gifts, write them notes or do small favors. Make a goal of having a ratio of 5:1. For every five positive interactions, only have one negative one., Do things that make each other happy. Show interest in your friend’s needs, goals, and desires. Share your dreams for your future together. Be willing to change with them., Continue to express your feelings openly and honestly to your friend/partner. Remember not to just focus on yourself: ask how they're feeling and really listen. Check-in regularly about what they want and need. Be direct, clear, and calm with one another.If you're having an argument with each other, you can say, ""I feel angry when you..."" rather than saying ""you make me so angry!""

, Kind of like creating a mission statement for a business, create a mission statement for your relationship. Have a shared purpose and vision for the relationship you’re building. Have shared values and strive to meet those values with each other., It's possible you'll break up, even if you do all of the right things in your relationship. Take comfort in the fact that at least you tried! If you do break up, keep in mind that staying friends may be challenging at first, but it is possible for some couples, especially if it's a mutual break-up and if you ended on good terms.


Take some time apart. Don't try to go back to being ""just friends"" right away. Give it at least half the length of the relationship.Set new boundaries for your friendship. For example, you may not want to talk to them about other romantic partners or intimate feelings.Be careful where and how you spend time. Don't do date-like activities, as this may send mixed signals."

Admit to yourself you're in the Friend Zone.,
Define how your friend sees you.,
Tell him or her your feelings.,
Distance yourself from your friend.,
Get a life.,
Switch-up your look.,
Check your attitude.",How to Escape the Friend Zone (Girls)," Whatever you're doing right now isn't working, which is why you're reading this article. Accept this, and make sure to commit yourself to changing your approach to the situation. If things stay the same, you'll never escape the pattern.;
, Your friend does not see you as a girlfriend candidate, or you wouldn't be in this situation. So how do they see you? It could be a little sister, therapist, parent, back-up-plan, etc. Think about the dynamic between you. Do they pick on you, like they would a sibling? Are they always seeking comfort or a shoulder to cry on? Are they looking for support like a parent would give? Figure out this dynamic, then try to change it. Don't always be the shoulder. Don't act like a little sister. Be wary of always giving advice. When you stop fulfilling that role in their life, they'll begin to be able to see you in a more dateable role: a possible girlfriend.

, They might not be aware that you are attracted to them and want to date them. Make this clear. It's scary, but you can do it. Just take a deep breath, and (in person) tell them something like this: ""I've been wanting to tell you for a while that I have feelings for you. Do you feel the same way about me?"" Keep it simple, straightforward and casual. Make sure you're both sober and in a quiet, private place.

, This is going to be challenging, especially if you're very close to this person and have become dependent on them. But you can do it. You are a strong, independent woman who doesn't need to rely on this person to live her life. And you know the saying ""distance makes the heart grow fonder?"" It's true. They won't forget about you, they'll just miss you more. That's what this step will ideally accomplish: your friend will realize that having you out of the picture sucks, and they need to stop taking you for granted.

, Use this distance to start making yourself more of a well-rounded individual. Get out. Meet people and make other friends. Take a cooking or karate or sewing or rock-climbing class—whatever you want to try out. Sign up for a gym membership (and actually go). Read in the park. Meet your neighbors. Don't get a ""fake life"" where you post Facebook statuses in an attempt to make your guy or girl jealous. Actually do those things, and hopefully, you'll be having so much fun, you won't be thinking about them at all!

, Have you worn the same hair and clothes for the last seven years? Maybe it's time for a makeover. Don't be afraid to change! Take this time to create a new look for yourself. Try a different hair color or cut. Save up for a shopping spree (because who doesn't like to splurge on cute clothes?) Surprises are exciting; when you do see your friend again, they'll see the new you and wonder what else you're capable of.

, Angry, sad, pessimistic—do these traits sound attractive to you? Well, they're not attractive to your friend, either. A physical makeover isn't going to to do the trick if you have a poisonous personality—nobody wants to be with someone like that. Try identifying behaviors that are negative, and work to eliminate them. Finding it hard to fake happiness? Start small: just smile more. Science has proven that the action, whether it's a real smile or not, releases chemicals in your brain that make you happier. Also, get more sunlight, this also increases the amount of endorphins in your brain. Breathe deep, eat healthy, exercise more and be kind to friends and strangers alike. Once you start radiating positive energy inside and out, people (your friend included) are going to be naturally drawn to you.

Encourage even the smallest effort.,
Stop finding fault with the wrong and applaud the right.,
Look for outwardly demonstrable ways to encourage a person.,
Reject negative responses.,
Make positive comments.,
Write encouraging comments.,
Tell people positive things about themselves.,
Notice when someone does something good.,
Keep it honest, keep it real.,
Bite your tongue when you're feeling mean.,
Have a good upbeat attitude.",How to Encourage People," Small efforts may appear little but to the doer, having the effort recognized can mean a great deal. It can be enough to spark the motivation to continue with a challenge. It could even be a way of helping a small effort grow into something large.;
, By nitpicking and projecting our own insecurities and irritation onto others, we fail to see what the other person is doing right. By noticing the things done well, and downplaying the things we're not happy about or don't like, there is a greater likelihood of seeing more of the same right behavior and responsiveness. Water the flowers you want to see grow, rather than feeding the weeds.

, Stars or happy faces work with children. Badges, certificates, gifts and notes are nice ways to encourage employees, coworkers, friends, students, family members, etc. A photo of the two of you doing something good together, by way of both memory and acknowledgment, can be a terrific way to encourage another person and shows your solidarity with their efforts.

, These are the reactions such as frowns or pouts. They're also the physical evidence such as bad letter grades or nasty comments left online. There is always room for improvement––most people are constantly aware of this––but there is no room for berating or criticizing with mean intent; you may feel temporarily clever but barbs leave lasting marks, with no benefit. Think with a helping spirit rather than an attacking one––be very wary of your own inner emotions if all you feel like doing is dressing down someone else, as the source of your irritation is inner unhappiness. Deal with that directly rather than discouraging someone else.

, To a child, say things like “your work was really neat”, ""I can see you did a great deal of research on that topic, that's fantastic."" Tell people how well they have performed at something, faced their fears, overcome obstacles and succeeded at even the smallest things. Even if you feel dislike for a person or feel competitive towards them, there is always at least one thing about them that you can honestly say is positive, so dig for that and tell this person––remember that it may encourage more of the positive, less of the things that bother you!

, Whether it's for work, for peer review, for a child's homework or for any other written feedback, keep the comments encouraging and constructive. Decimating someone's work may feel satisfying but saying things forcefully tends to deflate and fails to give good direction on what needs to be improved.


Instead of being negative, make comments such as (for a child) “I really liked how you did that, I bet you will get it all correct next time” or ""You've done a lot of work here, of good quality. Next time I'd suggest focusing more on X, Y and Z, just to ensure that the paper as a whole reads coherently."" You can still say what needs to be clarified and improved, it's just the how you approach it that makes all the difference.

, People love to hear how you perceive them in a positive light; all too often we are our own worst critics and it is can be surprisingly uplifting to hear someone external tell us quite the opposite of our worries. For example, you can point out how kind, caring, helpful, thoughtful, considerate, timely, reflective, innovative, etc. a person is. Try to point out concrete examples that demonstrate to your mind why the person shows these traits, as that will help the other person to see that you're genuine.

, While we tend to admire the way people look or have the courage to look or act differently, often we stay silent. This is a pity, as it tends to allow the spiteful pick-apart culture so adored in celebrity-style media to take central stage. Part of moving away from such personal attacks involves shifting to always using personal compliments instead. By displaying this regularly, you serve as a role model on how to encourage people, rather than putting them down.


For example, you might like to notice people's dress and grooming, such as saying: “I love the way you dress"", or ""I love the way you comb your hair”.

, People know the truth about themselves. They'll also know when you're flattering rather than complimenting from the heart. Flattery is not a sincere form of encouragement; it usually always comes with an edge of wanting something or of wanting to pump up another person, only to pierce their balloon later. Get into the habit of speaking only honest compliments and you'll leave the gossip and rumor style comments well behind.

, We all feel mean at times, often when we're tired, rundown, hungry or feel humiliated in some way. It happens and it's part of life's journey to learn how to manage our own blues and down times. One important lesson to learn is to bite your tongue and not say negative and discouraging things, just to get people off your back. Instead, you could insert an encouragement or simply say nothing until you feel more like yourself again.


If you do overstep the mark (and goodness, who hasn't at some point?), apologize. This ensures that you do the right thing by the other person. You cannot make the other person forgive you or forget what you've done but you can always set things to right from your end and continue in a constructive and fair manner from that point on. Lesson learned. Move on.

, The cup is half full rather than empty. Each of us feels other people's negativity. As our mother taught us, “If you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all”.

Make plans to see each other as much as you can.,
Stay connected through technology.,
Exchange sentimental gifts to remember one another.,
Reminisce about the old times often.,
Do activities together from afar.,
Recognize that your friendship will change.",How to Feel Better After a Friend Has Moved Away1," If at all possible, try to see your friend when you can. In some situations, this may be nearly impossible, like if your friend moved to a different part of the country or to a new continent. But, if you have the ability to see each other and your parents are willing to accommodate you, try to meet up. Just having a date set when you might see your friend again can help you manage the distance.


For example, if your friend’s family comes home on holidays, be sure to schedule in some one-on-one time. Or, if your family is vacationing at a nearby beach, see if her family can join, too.;
, Thankfully, there are tons of ways to stay in touch with a long-distance friend. Work with your friend to negotiate a schedule of how often you two can contact each other. Depending on your age and access to technology, you can talk as much as you like.


Send text messages every morning to say “hi.” Stay updated on each other’s social media pages. Plan to do video calls over Skype or Hangouts. Even if you don’t have time to stay on the telephone talking for hours at a time, you can still keep in touch with your friend through different types of media., Either before your friend leaves, or through mail, the two of you can exchange personal tokens. This allows you to have something to remember your friend by. It can be a special teddy bear, a CD that you both like, or even a picture you drew.You can even send care packages of things you think your friend may like, such as fresh-baked cookies or a fun book to read., A great way to increase the connection between you and your friend over a long distance is to reminisce about past experiences you’ve shared. Talk about your first day of school in 3rd grade when you accidentally had your shirt on backwards and she was the only one to tell you. Stay up at night laughing about the time you had a sleepover and he was snoring horribly. Send each other old photos and videos of fond memories you both share., Just because you and your friend no longer live in the same area it doesn’t mean you can’t do some of the fun things you once did. Watch your favorite movies together. Play an online game or download one from your phone’s app store. Engaging in shared activities helps strengthen your bond and makes it seem like you are hanging out just like old times., Be honest with yourself and be willing to adjust your expectations of the friendship. While it's entirely possible for the two of you to maintain a rich relationship, things will not be the way they once were. Accept that your friendship will be slightly different, but no less valuable and important."

Make sure that everything is plugged in.,
Hit the power button.,
Look at when your computer boots up.,
Check for beeps.,
Observe any computer failures.,
Check the fan in your computer.",How to Diagnose and Replace a Failed PC Power Supply1," It's entirely possible that a cord could just slip out from the outlet while you're working. If power is present to the monitor and other peripherals, yet there is no power to your computer, there is likely something wrong with your power supply.
, The most obvious clue is that the system will do absolutely nothing when you hit the power button. If there is no sound and no monitor activity of any kind, the power supply has probably died. While this can also be caused by a faulty switch, it is usually the result of a burned-out power supply.

, Noticeable changes in how long it takes for your computer to boot up and shutdown, as well as spontaneous rebooting, could be a sign that something is wrong.

, If the system makes rapid, short beeps repeatedly and does not boot when you try to get it to, this could be linked to the power supply., If there are system startup failures or lockups, memory errors, HDD file system corruption or USB power issues, this is often directly related to your power supply., If the fan in your computer is failing to spin, it could lead to overheating and smoke in the system, all of which can cause a failed power supply.

"
"
First, remove all cards and DIMMs.,
With only the CPU inserted and the speaker hooked up, there are still no beeps when power is applied.

,
Try the steps listed below/ After trying each step, power up the system to see if beeps are heard.",How to Debug a Dead Motherboard," All we want is it to beep. If there is a beep, then it's not dead, but has problems. There is no need to complicate the situation further with various cards in the system. We do not need any cards or memory in the system to hear a beep. All we need is the CPU inserted and a working speaker connected to the board. *The orientation of the speaker does not make a difference.;
,, It is of course very important to determine that the speaker works before hand if possible and that it is hooked up correctly. If beeps are heard at any time, reinsert the RAM. If long beeps that repeat forever are heard, the RAM is most likely either bad or at least incompatible with the board. If there is a long beep is followed by a few short beeps, then reinsert the Video Card. If the same beeps are heard, make sure the video card is in all the way or try another card. Nirvana is reached when only the short, single POST beep is heard. At this point the board should be running normally.




Check the jumper settings. If the bus runs at 100Mhz, 133Mhz, etc. try a slower bus speed to see if that produces a beep. Try the ""auto"" setting if applicable rather than specifying a particular bus speed. Set the multiplier to a slower speed such as 2.5.
Check the voltage settings for Socket 7 CPUs.
Check the CPU for bent or broken pins or damaged contacts.
Reset the CPU. Take the CPU out and reinsert it, making sure it seats well.
Try another CPU if possible. At this point, we just want a beep. It is unlikely that the CPU is bad, but if another one is handy, try that to see if a beep is heard.
If the board is an ATX design, remove AC power from the power supply, unhook the power supply cable from the board, reinsert it and apply AC power to the power supply again.
At this point, if the system is in a case, take the board out and try it on a test bench setup, anti-static bag on top of case, etc. to check for grounding problems.
If possible, try a different Power Supply. Even if the power supply runs and the fan spins, etc. it could still have a problem.
If the board is still dead, if possible, try another mainboard. Does it work with the same CPU, Power Supply, etc?
If none of the above produce a beep, we have hit a wall. There is little else to try to the board may in fact be DOA.

Connect with fictional characters who have had a friend move away.,
Get emotional support from family.,
Create a scrapbook.,
Accept that change is a part of life.,
Let yourself feel sad.,
Acknowledge that it takes time to adjust.,
Find positive distractions.,
Ask your parents to let you see a therapist if coping becomes too hard.",How to Feel Better After a Friend Has Moved Away2," Sometimes, hearing about someone else who has endured a similar experience can help you feel not so alone. Look up books, movies, or TV shows with story lines about friends who are long-distance. Doing this might help validate your feelings.,

Turn to loved ones who can comfort you. Missing your friend is completely normal and healthy. It’s common to long for someone when you have a strong bond with them. However, don’t withdraw from others. Your parents and other family members would probably be happy to spend more time with you and help you get through the initial transition of your friend leaving.

Go to your parents or siblings and say “Hey, I feel really lonely since Charlie left. Can we do something together?”

, Producing some type of tangible record of you and your friend’s relationship may help you to recognize the strength of the bond you share. Get some arts and craft materials and work to create a memory book. Use pictures, quotes, magazine photos, and other decorations to make a physical representation of your time together., No matter how hard you try to fight it, change is an unavoidable part of life. You have changed from the person you were five years ago and so have the people around you. Resisting change can prevent you from engaging with your new circumstances in a positive way and it can even be detrimental to your personal growth. As a result, you may start to isolate yourself and become depressed because your friend has moved away.This response is harmful to you, so try to look for ways that you can adapt to your new situation instead.


For example, while you won't be able to replace your friend, you can use your friend's departure as an opportunity to make some new friends. Try inviting someone new to do something that you and your friend used to do together, such as going for walks or going to the movies. Or start a new tradition with someone, such as going for bike rides together after school or playing video games together on the weekend.

, Feeling painful feelings can be uncomfortable, but doing so can help you move through these emotions and feel better. If you refuse to acknowledge the pain or loss you feel, it will only build up inside of you. Try the T.R.U.T.H. strategy for feeling your feelings:Tell yourself what happened- stick to the facts

Realize what emotions you're feeling- try to describe the emotion

Uncover any self-criticism- look for any judgments you have about yourself for feeling a certain way

Try to understand yourself- answer ""why"" you are feeling this way (e.g. ""We've been living near each other our whole lives and things will be scary without her/him."")

Have the feeling- experience the emotion completely allowing yourself to cry or shout

, Having a friend move away is difficult. Feeling sad and missing your friend is difficult. It does take time to adjust to your new situation. After you acknowledge your emotions, allow yourself to feel them, but also know that the feelings you have will not last forever.


The emotions you are feeling can be referred to as “transitional feelings.” These are emotions that are related to the fact that you have a sudden change life that is disrupting your life at the moment. When you do make the adjustment, these feelings will start to lessen with time.

, When you're trying to cope after a friend has moved away, it can be healthy and practical to distract yourself until you start to adjust to the new change. Just be sure that you choose positive distractions that benefit your health and well-being rather than jeopardizing them.For example, refrain from distracting yourself by overeating, using drugs or alcohol, or spending excessive amounts of money to buy things you think will comfort you. Instead, distract yourself by taking on a project such as leading a local community improvement effort, completing a work of art, or even something as simple as reorganizing your bedroom.
Taking your mind off your absent friend and getting involved in a different activity may help you to manage during the initial period after he or she has left.

, Moving can be a very difficult ordeal for kids and adolescents, especially those who are left behind. If you seem to have trouble adapting to the change, you may want to talk to a professional who can teach you skills to cope better."

Play a sport at school to build new friendships.,
Get involved in a club or other organization at school.,
Volunteer in your community.,
Accept and extend invitations to parties and events.",How to Feel Better After a Friend Has Moved Away3," While it’s important to maintain your long-distance friendship, it’s also equally important to forge new friendships with others. Consider joining a sports team at your school. There are a host of benefits of to participating in athletics. In addition to engaging with a team and making friends, kids who are involved in sports also make smarter social choices, have better grades, and even develop better leadership skills., If you are not athletic, joining another kind of extracurricular activity may be ideal. Doing this can keep you otherwise engaged and distracted from always missing your friend. Also, participating in clubs and organizations helps you learn marketable skills that can look good on college and job applications.What’s more, regularly meeting up with other students in your school can help you build new bonds with people you may not have hung out with previously.

, Yet another beneficial way to make more friends and make a positive impact in your community is volunteering. Doing community services helps you develop better social skills because you get to meet up with people who share common interests. However, you also develop greater empathy because you are often assisting and interacting with people who come from all walks of life.Check out volunteer opportunities by contacting local religious groups, political groups, or community organizations to see if they have positions available.

, Sometimes, making new friends comes down to saying “yes” to different invites you receive from classmates at school or from people in your extracurricular activities. At the same time, you can also open up your home to invite a few friends over after school or on weekends. Check with your parents to confirm that this is okay first.

Familiarize yourself with proper ESD procedures.,
Disconnect all external connectors (including the power cord) from the machine.,
Identify the power supply unit.,
Remove the case cover.,
Gently remove the old power supply from the case.",How to Diagnose and Replace a Failed PC Power Supply2," This should be done before doing any kind of PC repair work which requires opening a computer. If you neglect this step, you may damage your computer.

, This may include keyboard, mouse, network cable and speakers.

, It will be connected to almost every component inside the computer case and will look something like this:

, Unscrew the mounting screws on the back of the case which hold the power supply in its housing. Place the screws in a handy location.

, This is usually a simple process, but if there is little room in your PC, it may be necessary to remove other components to get the power supply out. If you don't feel comfortable removing other components, replace the mounting screws and enlist the help of a PC expert before continuing. Do not try to yank a power supply out by force.

"
"
Purchase a new power supply of the same type as the old one.,
Unpack the new power supply and make sure it physically fits correctly.,
Using proper ESD procedures, connect the devices in your PC to the new power supply.,
Verify that no cables or unused connectors are stuck in the CPU fan or touching other moving parts.,
Replace and fasten down the case cover.

,
Replace all external connections to the back of the computer (power cord, mouse, keyboard, monitor, network cable, speakers, etc).",How to Diagnose and Replace a Failed PC Power Supply3," Most power supplies used in modern computers are of the ""ATX"" variety, but if you aren't sure, take the old unit to the store with you to compare.


The simplest rule of thumb is that the new unit should be exactly the same width as the old one. It's fine if the new unit is a bit longer, as long as it will still fit into your case. Do not hesitate to ask the salesperson or technician for help in identifying the correct unit to purchase.

, If the new unit has a large bottom mounted fan, the bottom rear bottom flange on some cases might get in the way. Add it to the case in the same place the old unit was, and use the mounting screws to fasten it down.

, The connections should be the same as they were before. It can require a bit of force to insert power connectors correctly, but if if you have to strain a great deal to push them in, you may be trying to connect them backward. It is very difficult to connect most Molex connectors improperly, but if you are determined (and strong) enough, it can be done. If you have to force too hard, try turning the connector around.

, If the CPU fan is stopped by a loose connector (or any other obstruction), the processor can be destroyed very quickly. You may wish to restrain unused cables to prevent them from getting tangled up in fans.

,, Power up the system and enjoy your new power supply.


If your system doesn't start up correctly here, your failing power supply could have taken out the motherboard.

Don’t trust pushing the “power” button to turn off all power. More often than not, this only puts your computer into “sleep” mode., If your computer is currently plugged into a power outlet, unplug it. If it’s a laptop, unhook it from its charger, too. Detach any other devices that are connected to the computer., If you have a laptop, turn it over. Find the battery compartment. Release its latch to remove the lid. Take the battery out and set it aside., Expect some amount of electricity to still linger within your computer after you power it off and remove the battery. Press the power button and keep it pressed down for at least ten seconds. Discharge any residual electricity that’s still present., Before you open the computer and start working on its insides, put on a pair of latex gloves. Expect oils from your skin to interfere with the components’ normal operation.Also, wear a pair of anti-static bracelets to prevent your fingers from discharging any static electricity, which can also damage the components.Anti-static bracelets can be purchased online or at brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart or Radio Shack.

, Expect dirt and dust particles to also interfere with the computer’s working parts. Choose a clean area to work in. If your workspace needs to be cleaned, wait for any airborne particles to settle before you proceed with opening your computer., Gaining access to your computer’s heatsink and/or CPU will vary depending on what you have. Refer to its owner’s manual to find out how to identify, access, remove, and reinstall the necessary parts. If you don’t have a hard copy, search the manufacturer’s website for a copy online., Once you have safely removed the heatsink, get rid of any dust in its vents. Use a small brush and/or a can of compressed air. Be sure to do this well away from the computer’s other parts so the loose dust doesn’t end up where it doesn’t belong., Find the heatsink’s copper cores. Scrape away as much of the old thermal paste as you can with the flat end of a spudger (a small handheld tool used to manipulate computer components).However, you obviously want to be careful not to scratch any parts, so if you’re nervous about this step, feel free to skip to the next.Alternatively, you could use a dry cloth or paper towel to rub off most of it if you're worried about scratching the components., Even if you used a spudger, don’t expect it to get rid of the old paste entirely. Whether you skipped the previous step or not, grab some coffee filters, lint-free cloths, or q-tips. Wet one with either rubbing alcohol or a cleaner specifically designed for thermal materials.Then use the wet end to moisten, loosen, and remove the old paste. Repeat as needed with fresh filters, cloths, or q-tips.After all traces have been removed, repeat this step once more to get the surface ready for a new application of thermal paste.
Cleaners designed for this specific purpose are usually labeled as TIM cleaners (thermal interface material)., Inspect it for any thermal paste where it came into contact with the heatsink. If you find any, use the same steps to clean the surface. However, if you use a spudger to scrape the old paste away, only use a plastic one to reduce the chance of scratching or otherwise damaging parts. If you don’t have one, don’t attempt scraping.Be especially mindful about where the old paste ends up. Once it’s loosened, you don’t want to accidentally brush it off so that it ends up lodged elsewhere in the processor.

, If your last application of thermal paste dried to any other parts, use the same method to clean it up. However, use q-tips, paper towels, or other soft material rather than a spudger, since other parts may be more fragile. Additionally, try using a compressed-can of CFC (chlorofluorocarbon)-based automotive electronic contact cleaner if the paste has dried in thin, hard-to-reach gaps., Remember: after you remove all traces of old paste, you want to wipe the heatsink and processor with another application of rubbing alcohol or cleaner. Do not apply new paste immediately after doing so. Wait until they have thoroughly air-dried., Apply a small bead of new paste directly to its surface. Keep it about the same size as a rice grain. Don’t worry about doing the same to the heatsink, unless your owner’s manual specifically states otherwise.Thermal paste is available online and stores selling computers and other electronics.

, If you’ve been using latex gloves, switch to a clean, fresh pair. Otherwise, wrap some plastic wrap around your finger. Use your fingertip to spread the bead of paste over the core’s surface.Try not to get it on the surrounding green area, but don’t freak out if this happens by accident. Your computer will still work fine. You’ll just have more to clean up next time around.

, Once the paste has been spread over the processor’s core, you’re good to go. Reassemble your computer. Refer to your owner’s manual for specific instructions regarding your particular model."

Locate the printer rollers.,
Clean rollers with a lint-free cloth and water.,
Use a rubber rejuvenating product.",How to Clean Printer Rollers1," On inkjet printers, the printer rollers are typically located on the underneath side. You can usually find them if you remove the paper tray and look right above where the paper tray used to be.The rollers should rotate manually when you apply pressure to them. If not, you will need to use the “feed paper” option on your printer to rotate them. Either way, you shouldn’t need to remove them entirely for the cleaning process.;
, Pour some distilled water into a cup and dip your lint-free cloth into it. You want the cloth to be damp, but not soaking wet. Wipe the damp cloth across the surface of the rollers to remove any dirt or grime that has built up over time. Be sure to fully rotate the rollers so that you can clean each part of the surface area.Make sure you dry off the rollers completely before using your printer again.

, In order to help the rubber printer rollers regain some of their original slickness and glide, you should use a rubber rejuvenating product. Simply moisten the end of a Q-tip or foam swab with the product and rub it lightly over the surface of the printer rollers.You should be able to purchase a rubber rejuvenating product at any computer or office supply or store.

Disconnect the LAN cable and all peripherals, such as monitors, scanners, printers, keyboards, mice and speakers.

,
Move to a suitable work area.,
Open your computer.,
Prepare to clean.,
Begin dusting.,
Make sure the heatsink fan is clean.,
Look around the entire inside and outside for any dust you may have missed.,
Clean up your work space.,
Close your computer.",How to Clean the Inside of a Computer," You need compressed air and a screwdriver (only needed if you must use a screwdriver to open the computer case). A small vacuum might clean up the mess you make around the computer, but should never be used inside it. A dust mask is suggested because it can save you a bit of sneezing if you need to clean a computer quickly.;
,,, If you haven't cleaned your computer in a while, a suitable work area is suggested. While you can clean your computer where it sits, it is not recommended. The job can be very messy and you'll want to work somewhere where you can adequately ventilate dust.

, Once you have a suitable work area, open your computer. This will vary greatly depending on your machine. If you have a user's manual, consulting it would be a good idea. Most machines have screws holding a side panel down. After removing these, you can then slip the side off your machine.

, After opening the computer, use compressed air. Additionally, you might want to wear a dust mask. Never touch the inside of your computer unless it is absolutely necessary. You may discharge a static shock to vital internal components (such as CPU and RAM) and damage them. If you must touch the inside of your machine, discharge any static by tapping your finger to the computer's metal case before unplugging it.

, Use your compressed air to blow out the inside of your machine. It is usually a good idea to start on the upper region of the computer, then work your way down. In this manner you can sweep out all the dust that settles on lower components in one run. Do not worry if you cause the blades of internal fans to spin. This is expected and it is important to keep these components clean. Be thorough, but do not press on cords or components. Also keep your air source a moderate distance from the component you're working on.

Make sure to hold your can of compressed air upright. If inverted, it can be let out as a liquid which can cause severe damage to your computer.






Compressed air is freezing cold when it leaves the can; don't let frost form on your chips.






A lot of dust can be raised; try not to breathe it. If the PC is very dusty, take it out of doors before using the compressed air.







, The heat sink sits over the processor, and it is a collection of metal ridges that stick up away from the motherboard. If this fan does not function properly, the processor will overheat, resulting in degraded performance or permanent damage.

, Once you are sure it is cleaned thoroughly, carefully replace the sides. Do not try to force them into place.

, The initial run will churn up a lot of particulates. Depending on your workspace, you may need to get a small vacuum and clean the area around the computer. Do not use a vacuum on the inside of the computer. You might want to consider leaving your machine open while you do this. Airborne dust inside the computer will begin to settle and you can make your effort exceptionally productive if you make a second run., After you've finished dusting, replace the side of your machine and any screws. Once the machine is tightly shut, return it to its usual spot and reattach the power cord and other cables. (You might consider cleaning this entire area to remove excess materials that can contribute to dust intake.) If you flipped the master power switch on the back of your machine off, be sure to turn it on again or your machine will not start. A clean computer will run significantly cooler and last much longer than a computer clogged up with dust and debris.

Find the printer rollers.,
Swab with alcohol.,
Use a lint-free cloth.",How to Clean Printer Rollers2," For LaserJet printers, the printer rollers can usually be found near the paper tray – which is often located on the top of the machine. If you can’t find them here, try opening the access panel. They may be on top here, or underneath the toner cartridge, which you can easily remove.Some LaserJet printer rollers don’t rotate manually. This means that you’ll need to unsnap the clips on either side of the roller and then remove the roller.

, Dip a cotton swab in alcohol and use it to clean your LaserJet printer rollers. Gently rub it over the surface of your printer rollers. Wipe the rollers off and dry them completely before reinstalling them in your printer.Make sure the cotton swab is just moistened with alcohol and not dripping wet. You don’t want an excess of the liquid getting inside the LaserJet printer.

, Dip a lint-free cloth into some distilled water and gently scrub the surface of your printer rollers to remove any dirt or debris that has caught on the rollers. This will help clean the rollers without drying them out or damaging them in any way.Be sure to dry the rollers completely before reinstalling them in your printer.

"
"
Refrain from over-cleaning rollers with alcohol.,
Avoid overloading your printer.,
Unplug your printer while cleaning.",How to Clean Printer Rollers3," Alcohol should be used sparingly when cleaning your printer rollers. Avoid using other kinds of solvents altogether. These products can dry out the rollers and cause them to become cracked and damaged over time.

Using these kinds of products could also void any kind of manufacturer’s warranty that you may have on your printer.

, If your printer seems to be having trouble feeding paper through, take a few moments to resolve the problem by cleaning the printer rollers. Don’t just keep trying to make the printer work, as this will just exacerbate the problem.Maintaining your printer regularly and treating it with care will give the machine a much longer life expectancy.

, Whenever you perform any kind of maintenance or cleaning on your printer, unplug the machine before you begin. Leaving the printer powered on or plugged in could lead to potentially damaging the machine or yourself.You don’t want to accidentally electrocute yourself or void your manufacturer’s warranty on the printer.

Close the cover of your computer when it is not in use.",How to Clean a Touch Screen Computer," Before cleaning your touchscreen computer, unplug and power down your device. This will reduce any electrical risks and keep your device a cooler temperature for cleaning., Use a microfiber cloth to clean your touchscreen thoroughly, wiping from side to side. Be sure to wipe around the perimeter of the screen, using your fingernail to press a bit of cloth into any crevices where the screen meets the back. Apply gentle pressure to remove surface fingerprints.Avoid applying extreme pressure, which can damage the crystals of your LCD.
Microfiber cloths can be purchased at camera, technology or eyeglass stores. They are made not to scratch sensitive surfaces, such as your touchscreen.

, For stubborn smudges, spritz 1-2 sprays of eyeglass cleaner onto your microfiber cloth so it is damp but not saturated. Wipe your screen in small circular motions to remove any oily smudges or fingerprints.Do not spray the cleaner directly on your touchscreen. This can cause the screen to become excessively wet and damage to the electrical components.

, Use a clean, dry microfiber cloth to buff your touchscreen after using eyeglass cleaner. This will reduce streaking and dry any residual moisture., Stand your keyboard on its side and give a gentle tap to loosen any food or dust stuck around the keys.

Remove the plate that retains the ball.,
Remove the mouse ball.

,
Keep it dust-free.,
Typically you don't need to clean the mouse ball, only the little wheels you see inside.,
This step is optional but will drastically reduce the amount of dirt that the mouse will pick up.,
Put it back together.,
If you find that the mouse still sticks/jumps, the problem may be that the rubber ball has become too smooth due to age.,
Finished.

",How to Clean a Mouse Ball," Just twist it in the direction of the arrow.;
,, The enemy of the mouse is dust. Over time, dust and lint spin into fairly solid strings that eventually gum up the mouse motion. Some mice use more spring-loading ticks than others to keep the rollers in contact with the ball, so keep an eye to see if any springs are popping out. In most cases, mice are built to be very rugged and there's nothing to hurt during a cleaning. The cup shape in the center is just to help position the ball in the mouse.

, Usually a paperclip will do, but if it's really dirty you can use a knife. Or, you can moisten the tip of a Q-tip (cotton swab) with rubbing alcohol to clean off the dirt. Use tweezers to remove any strands of hair near the wheel rollers. If there appears to be gunk on the ball, a rag and a little rubbing alcohol will take it right off.

, Take a Philips screwdriver and remove the screw on the bottom of the mouse. Some models will have the screw under the label. Gently lift off the top of the mouse by pulling it up and back. The inner parts are now exposed. Clean all of the hair and dirt that has accumulated inside the mouse. Now get some white grease or silicone grease, the kind used on garage doors or other hinges. Take a Q-tip and spray this grease on it. Gently apply this grease to the edges where the rollers meet the plastic casing of the mouse. This creates a more snug fit for the rollers which prevents uneven dust buildup and delays buildup. All ball mice have grease installed when they are new but as they are used, the factory grease dries up or slips out of where it was placed.

, After you're done, put the mouse ball back and lock it.

, You can rough up the ball for better traction by using a kitchen scouring pad. Remove the ball from the mouse. Moisten a kitchen pan scouring pad(usually a dark green coarse pad) and place it on the counter. Then rub the ball on the scouring pad, hitting all sides. Rinse the ball, dry it, and place it back in the mouse.

Wait 5-10 minutes before turning the keyboard or laptop back on.",How to Clean a Mac Keyboard," If your keyboard is part of your laptop, shut down the laptop before you begin cleaning. This will help prevent damage from occurring during the cleaning process.;
, If the keyboard is part of your laptop, unplug the laptop entirely. Otherwise, disconnect the keyboard from your computer, laptop, or tablet.







, First, carry your keyboard over to a trashcan and tip it upside down. Gently shake and move it side to side to dislodge any loose dirt or objects. Run your hand gently over the keys to loosen dirt that may be stuck.








, First, turn the keyboard at a 75 degree angle, so it is not quite vertical. Then, spray some compressed air left to right across the surface of the keyboard. Keep the straw of the air compression can about ½ inch away from the keys. After spraying the whole keyboard, rotate it 90 degrees to one side, and spray all keys again from left to right. Repeat this until you have sprayed the keyboard at all angles.








Apple doesn’t recommend the use of compressed air for all keyboards, as it may push particles further into the the keyboard. This step is specifically for MacBook laptops from early 2015 or later.

, Get the cloth damp, and then ring out any excess moisture before touching your keyboard with it. Run the cloth gently over the surface of the keys to remove dust and dirt. Be sure that you don’t get any excess moisture in between the keys in this process.







, For stains on your keys or keyboard, use a bit of pressure to scrub them off. Get the cotton swab or cloth slightly damp, and then apply it to the stain. You can rub in a circular motion, gently, until the stain is gone.








If you have a white keyboard, take extra time to scrub the dark brown areas that tend to develop on the spacebar and where your fingers rest.

, Consider using a microfiber cloth for this step. Run it over the keyboard to remove any remaining moisture or dust that may have collected., While disinfecting, be sure that your laptop is turned off and unplugged. If the keyboard is separate from the computer, be sure that it is disconnected from any power source.

, Some types to consider are Clorox or Lysol. You will want wipes that do not include any bleach, so be sure to check the labels before you make your purchase. Bleach can damage the finish on your keyboard., Sometimes you’ll grab a disinfecting wipe that is very wet. Be sure that you squeeze it out to make it only slightly damp before using it on your keyboard.







, Place the wipe over one finger. Using that finger, gently massage each key and the area between the keys. Be careful not to push too hard or move your finger too fast so that you don’t damage the keys.







, This is an important step that is easily overlooked. Be sure that you use a clean, soft, lint-free cloth to remove any moisture from the keyboard after disinfecting it. Also, make sure that you do not hold the wipe on the keyboard for too long. After you wipe each key, discard the wipe and dry the keyboard gently.








, Waiting a bit will give the keyboard time to fully dry. Once it is completely dry, you can turn your keyboard back on and enjoy the cleanliness!

, To configure routers, you’ll need a computer that can connect to them via an Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi. The operating system of the computer doesn’t matter.


If you’ll be using Wi-Fi to connect to the routers, take note of the SSID and passkey for each router. You’ll need this information to connect to each router via Wi-Fi.

, If you plan to connect computers and other devices to the network without Wi-Fi, you’ll need an Ethernet cable for each device.


For example, you’ll need one Ethernet cable to connect Router 2 to Router 1.
If you wanted to connect two additional computers to the network, have additional Ethernet cables available for each device (unless you plan to connect them via Wi-Fi).

,, You’ll want to start wiring the network with the equipment turned off.

,


The WAN port may be labeled “Internet.”

,


If you’d prefer to connect the computer to the router wirelessly, use your router’s instructions to do so.

, Wait a few moments for them both to come back up.

Netgear: 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.227, These credentials, like the IP address, can be found printed on Router 1.


If there is no username and password combination printed on your router, search the internet for “default router password for ”.
If you’re using the right password but still can’t connect, reset the router to its default settings by inserting the end of a paperclip into its “reset” port.,


The DHCP settings are located in different places across different types of routers, but you’ll usually find them under “Network settings,” or “LAN settings.”
In most cases, the DHCP server is turned on by default.

, Visit any website (like https://www.wikihow.com) to verify that you can connect to the Internet. Make sure that the physical configuration of your network leaves room for one LAN port to be open on Router 1.

, Everything else can remain on and plugged in.

, Now you’ll configure Router 2 as a second router on the same subnet. This means all devices on the network will be able to access each other.

,, Just as when you logged into Router 1 as an administrator, you’ll need to do this to Router 2. Log in to the router’s admin interface using your credentials. Check and see what the IP is; most routers default to 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, or 10.0.0.1.

, Locate the DHCP settings (as you did earlier for Router 1) and switch the DHCP server to “Off.”

, That needs to change.


Find the area in the router admin website called “LAN” or “Local Network.” There should be a blank that contains the current IP address (the one you connected to in your web browser).
Type a new IP address in place of the existing one. The new address must be on the same subnet as Router 1, meaning the first three sets of numbers (out of four) in the IP address must be the same as Router 1. It also can’t be an IP currently assigned to another device.
If Router 1’s IP address is 192.168.0.1, for example, Router 2 can be 192.168.0.100. Since the computer is the only other device on the network, there’s little risk for an IP address conflict.

, If it is, assign it the same SSID (the name of the Wi-Fi access point) and passkey as Router 1.


You should find these settings under a menu called something like “Wireless” or “Wi-Fi setup.”
If you’re unsure of Router 1’s SSID and passkey, it should be printed on the device.

, Now that Router 2’s all set up, it’s a good idea to give it a restart—though, for now, leave the power unplugged instead of turning it right back on.

, Make sure you’re not plugging it into the WAN port (they look similar).

, When the router comes back up, it will have the IP address you configured. As long as Router 1 has Internet access, Router 2 will now also be online.

,, Router 1’s DHCP server will automatically assign each device its own IP address in the same subnet. Enjoy your expanded network!

Take the LAN, or Internet cable, and plug one end to the back of the cable modem.,
Switch on your computer and your cable modem.",How to Connect a Cable Modem to Your Computer," Take the modem out of the box and determine if what you have is indeed a cable modem. It should have a coaxial port, or a small cylindrical protrusion located on its back. A DSL modem won’t have that; instead, DSL modems have telephone cable ports like those you find on telephones into which you can plug in the telephone line coming from the wall. Accessories should include the following:


An Internet cable for connecting the modem to your computer
The cable modem’s power adapter
A coaxial cable for connecting the modem to the cable line;
, Before you plug a modem, make sure to read first the voltage rating written on the power adapter to make sure that it matches the voltage rating of the outlet you are going to plug it into. Doing so will help avoid any short circuit.

, Once you’ve taken the cable modem out of the box, take the power adapter and plug it to the power port on the modem (located along the area of the coaxial cable). Take the other end of the power adapter, and plug it to a power outlet.

, Take the coaxial cable coming from your wall and connect it to the port at the back of the modem. Tighten it securely by screwing the cable into the port.

, There’s only one port on the modem where the Internet cable can fit into, so it’s pretty easy find. Take the other end of the Internet cable, and plug it to the back of your computer (the same port with the modem).

, Press the Power button on your modem to switch it on. As it boots up, the lights on the cable modem will blink, telling you that it’s trying to connect to the ISP’s server. Once the cable modem establishes a connection, the lights will become steady.


You can now start surfing the Internet using your cable modem.

If you are connecting four or less computers, you'll just need a single router, or one switch if you don't need internet.
If you're connecting more than four computers, you'll want a router and a switch, or just a switch if you don't need internet.;
, If your installing a permanent LAN solution, you'll want to keep cable length in mind. CAT5 Ethernet cables should not run longer than 250 feet. If you need to cover larger distances, you'll need switches at regular intervals, or you'll need to use CAT6 cables.


You'll need one Ethernet cable for each computer you want to connect to the LAN, as well as an Ethernet cable to connect the router to the switch (if applicable).

, To create a LAN, you'll need a router and/or a network. These pieces of hardware are the ""hub"" of your LAN, and all of your computers will be connected to them.


The easiest way to create a LAN where every computer has access to the internet is to use a router, and then add a network switch if the router doesn't have enough ports. A router will automatically assign an IP address to every computer that is connected to it.
Switches are similar to routers but do not automatically assign IP addresses. Switches typically have many more Ethernet ports than a router has.

, This port may be labeled ""INTERNET"" instead. This will provide internet access to every computer that is connected to your LAN.


You can skip this if you're setting up a LAN without internet access.
You don't need a router at all to create a LAN, but it makes things easier. If you just use a network switch, you'll need to manually assign IP addresses to each computer after connecting them.

, If you're using a network switch to connect more computers, connect it to one of the LAN ports on the router. You can use any open port on the switch to make the connection. When connected, the router will provide IP addresses for every computer that is connected to either device.

, Make sure you're using an Ethernet cable (RJ45), not a telephone cable (RJ11).

, This can be any open LAN port on either the router or the switch, depending on your LAN setup.

, If you're using a router, your work is complete. Once all of the computers are connected to a LAN port, they will be assigned IPs automatically and will appear on the network. If you set up your LAN for gaming, you should be able to start your LAN game and have each computer connect.


If you're using a switch and no router, you'll still need to assign IP addresses to each computer.

, You won't be able to access resources on a networked computer until file and printer sharing is enabled. You can select specific files, folders, and drives to share on each computer, as well as share access to printers.

",How to Configure a Router to Use DHCP," Connect to your router by entering its IP address. This will vary slightly from manufacturer to manufacturer, and will be listed in the documentation.


Here are some common IP addresses for various routers:
Linksys, 3Com, Asus, Dell, US Robotics: 192.168.1.1
Qwest (AKA CenturyLink), DLink, Netgear, Trendnet, Senao: 192.168.0.1
Belkin, Microsoft, and SMC: 192.168.2.1
Apple: 10.0.1.1
If you have misplaced your documentation, and you do not see your router listed here, search on Google for your router name and ""default IP address"" to find the correct information.
Another way to locate your router's IP address: on a PC, open the command prompt (click on Start > Run/Search for cmd) and enter ipconfig. Look for the Default Gateway line, and try that number.
On a Macintosh, open the Network control panel (System Preferences..., Network) and look for Router: This is your router's IP address.;
, If prompted, enter your router's user name and password, and log into your router. Not all routers will require this step. If your router defaults to requiring a password, it will be listed with the documentation. If so, the default password is generally “admin,” and you may leave the User name field blank.

, Scroll down until you see DHCP Server (Enable) (Disable) radio buttons. If it is disabled, select Enable

, This is optional, and is totally dependent on personal preference. If you're not sure what this is, it's totally safe to skip this step.


Some routers let you set the maximum number of DHCP clients. If your router has this setting, count all the computers, smart phones, and other internet-active devices (such as Apple TV), then add a couple extra, for guests who may visit with their smart phones and want to access the internet. Once the pre-defined maximum is reached, no one else can get an address until one expires!

, Use the DNS servers provided to you by your ISP, or use the following DNS servers: 205.152.37.254, 205.152.132.235, 205.152.132.23; There are many DNS servers out there. It's best to use your ISP's if possible.

, Click the Save or Apply button, or whatever your router calls the button that locks in your changes.

, Open up the network configurations for the computers on your network. On a PC, go to Control Panel -> Network Connections -> Local Area Connection (or Wireless Connection) and select Obtain IP address automatically. On a Mac, go to System Preferences, then click on Network, and select Using DHCP. On a WiFi-enabled device, check the WiFi settings, and select DHCP as the source of the IP address.

, Your router’s configuration page can be accessed by any computer that is connected to the same network. When configuring your router, you will have the best results if you connect with a computer that is wired to the router with an Ethernet cable.

, Routers are accessed through your web browser by entering the IP address into the address bar. The IP address varies a bit by manufacturer, but most are the same or very close. These are some of the more popular manufacturers and the associated addresses:Linksys - http://192.168.1.1
3Com - http://192.168.1.1
D-Link - http://192.168.0.1
Belkin - http://192.168.2.1
Netgear - http://192.168.1.1
Most routers have their default address printed in the documentation or on a sticker on the router itself. You can also look it up online on the manufacturer’s website.

, Before you access the configuration page, you’ll be asked for a username and password. Most routers will come with a default username/password combo, while some allow you to proceed without entering anything.


Your router’s documentation will tell you the default username and password required. They may also be printed on the router itself.
”admin” is one of the most common default usernames.
”admin” or “password” are two of the most common passwords.

, If you’ve looked up your default address and username/password combo and you still can’t access your router, you can reset it to factory defaults to clear out any changes that may have been made. This is useful for secondhand routers or old changes that you can’t remember.


You can reset your router by pressing the Reset button on it. This button is usually small and recessed, and can only be reached by a paper clip. Some routers have a button that can be pressed more easily.
After pressing the reset button, wait 30-60 seconds and then try entering the router’s address and username/password combination again.

, Leaving your router with the default username and password is very insecure, and you should change it immediately after setting it up. You can usually find this in the Administration section of the router configuration.


Choose a username and password that can’t be easily guessed. Include numbers and symbols in the password to make sure that it is hard to crack.

, In the Internet, Setup, or Home menu of your router, check that your Internet IP address, DCHP, and DNS settings are all set. These should typically be set to automatic unless your service provider informs you otherwise.


Many routers will provide a test button on the Internet menu page. Click it to check if your internet settings are configured correctly.

, This menu may be called Wireless, Wireless Settings, Basic Setup, or something similar. This page will display your wireless SSID, channel, encryption, and other settings.

, Find the field labeled SSID. This is the name of your network, and it will appear in the list of available networks for your wireless devices. Be sure to not put any personal information in your network name, as the name will be public.


Make sure that the “Enable SSID Broadcast” box is checked.
The Channel should be set to Auto. If you have a lot of wireless networks in your area, your router will automatically move the network to a clean channel.

, This can also be called the Security Options. Here you’ll be able to choose which method you want to use to encrypt your network traffic. The options for most routers are WEP, WPA-PSK, and WPA2-PSK.


WPA2 is the most secure mode of encryption, and you should use it if all of your devices support it. Only older devices do not support WPA2.

, The passphrase is what you enter when a device connects to your network. A strong passphrase will help protect your network from unwanted intruders. You should always have a passphrase for your network.

, Once you have chosen your SSID, encryption type, and passphrase, click the Apply or Save button to start your wireless network. Your router will process for a few seconds, and then your wireless network will be detectable by your wireless devices., This can usually be found in the Advanced section of the router’s configuration page.

, Click the button to add a custom service. This will open a form where you can enter the port forwarding information.


Name/Service Name – This is the name of the program you are port forwarding for. The name is only for you to easily recognize it in a list.
Protocol – Your options are TCP, UDP, and TCP/UDP. Refer to the program you are forwarding the port for to see what option you should choose.
External Starting Port – This is the first port in the range of ports that you want to open.
External Ending Port – This is the last port in the range of ports that you want to open. If you are only opening one port, enter the same port into this field.
Check the box that uses the same port range for the Internal ports, or fill out the same information for the Internal port fields.
Internal IP address – This is the IP address for the computer that you want to open the port for. To find out the IP address for the device, follow this guide for PC or this guide for Mac OS X.

, Your router will process for a few moments, and then the changes will be applied. Your program will now be able to access the open port for the computer you specified.

, This can be found in the Security or Parental Controls section of the configuration menu. You can block sites from being accessed by any device on your network, though you can allow specific devices to access them. You can also set a schedule for the blocks, which is especially useful for homework time or when you need to focus on work.

, Your options will change depending on the router you are using. Some routers allow you to block keywords as well as specific sites. Add what you want to block to the list.

, You can check a box to allow trusted IP addresses to view blocked sites. This can be useful for parents who still want access to the sites that they’ve blocked for their kids.


Once you’ve checked the box, add it the IP addresses you want to bypass the blocks. This guide will tell you how to find your IP address.

, This may be in a separate menu from the block list. You can select which days of the week you want the block to take effect, as well as the time of day that it is implemented. Once you are done, click the Apply button.

Remember first impressions count.,
Address yourself.,
Smile.,
Make sure you say thank you.,
If they are rude to you back, stick up for yourself but not in a rude way.,
If you eat dinner with them, have proper eating etiquette.,
They are probably going to ask you questions.,
At the end of the day, tell them thank you and goodbye.",How to Meet Your Partner's Family for the First Time," Imagine that you are trying to find the perfect lawyer. You walk in and find a man who yells at you, is rude and mean. Then later, he tried to apologize. Would you want him to be your lawyer even though he did all those mean things? Probably not. Same for your partners family. If you go in there, throw your coat on the floor, scream and insult them do you think they are going to want their son or daughter to be with you? Most likely, no. That's why you have to set a good impression. It's not just about looks, it's about personality, too.;
, (For example: ""Hello, I'm Jessica, how are you?"") Of course, don't be too fake. Being fake is annoying and won't get you anywhere. You have to be sincere, and don't kiss up just because you want to leave a great impression. Be yourself, but a respectful version of it.

, Smile a lot. A smile is a good way of showing that you are nice and open.

, Saying thank you shows that you appreciate what they did for you. They are inviting you into their home or in their lives.

, (Example: His/her mom says that you have ugly shoes.) Tell her that you like your shoes but you appreciate her opinion. Being rude about the situation is just going to be bad and awkward for both you, your partner, and his family.

, Put your napkin on your lap, eat slowly and chew your food. If you spill something, say you are sorry and help clean up. Make sure you chew with your mouth closed and you don't talk while eating something.

, Answer honestly. If they question you on something personal, tell them that you wish to not speak about that.

, Also let them know that you had a great time (if you did, if not don't say anything. DON'T BE FAKE!)

Look to the boyfriend to spark conversation if things get awkward.,
After you've finished your meeting, remember to say how much you enjoyed meeting her.",How to Meet Your Boyfriend's Daughter," If you're on the cusp of meeting your boyfriend's daughter, you should first consider the stage your relationship is at. If it's not already serious, how committed can you realistically see it becoming? Sometimes, it's best to wait until the relationship is more secure before you bring family into the equation. If there's a good chance the relationship will fall apart shortly, it might be good to go without meeting his kids entirely.;
, It is recommended you have an earnest discussion with your boyfriend before meeting his family. Ask him what he thinks of it, and whether he thinks you two are ready to advance to that stage of commitment. If he shows any sign of hesitation, it's probably best to wait until the two of you are feeling more secure.

, Nothing will replace talking with the girl yourself, but it certainly helps to know a little bit about who you'll be dealing with before you meet. Ask your boyfriend about her interests. What kind of music, films and books is she interested in? Make a mental note of common interests you share; despite age differences, there's almost certainly something the two of you can bond on.

, Remember you're the adult. This includes getting to the meeting on time and dressing in a respectable, mature manner.Depending on the level of commitment in the relationship, you'll be ideally filling a partially maternal role for his daughter, so it's important to keep that in mind, especially if you've never had children of your own.

, First impressions mean everything. While you might be feeling anxious about the occasion, it's very likely your boyfriend's daughter's feeling even more out of place. Maintaining eye contact, giving a warm smile and a friendly handshake all work towards alleviating the tension in both of you. Here are some ways you might consider introducing yourself:


""Nice to meet you! I've heard so much about you.""
""I've heard you like . Sounds like we've got something in common!""
Giving a brief compliment upon meeting is also a great opening move.

, Gift-giving is a good thing to do if the daughter is young. If she's older however, she might interpret the act as a bribe. If she's a teenager, it's a good idea to emphasize respect above all else. When you're meeting with the daughter, treat the discussion between the three of you as a conversation amongst equals.


If you do plan on buying a gift, make sure it's something modest, but thoughtful. Ask your boyfriend's opinion on it, just to make sure you don't buy anything inappropriate (e.g. candy for a diabetic.)

, It's important that the boyfriend stay part of the conversation; that will minimize the risk of awkward silences and tension on either side. Be kind and polite, regardless of how the daughter is acting. Try to make the conversation mostly about her. Ask questions about her life, whether it's school, work, or her hobbies. Keep the conversation light and pleasant; hopefully that will be enough to ease the tension.


Although you should ask questions, take care not to put her on the spot. If she doesn't sound interested in talking about school, for instance, don't press the subject any further.

, It's extremely important that your boyfriend be part of the discussion until things start becoming more easy-going. If the daughter isn't talking much, ask him a question that might apply to both of them, such as:


""I heard the two of you like to watch movies together. I've heard is coming out soon. Maybe the three of us should go see it together?""
""What days are the two of you free next? Maybe we can all go do something.""

, Be sure to say this even if she wasn't entirely pleasant; being unconditionally warm towards the daughter will go a long way towards making her feel more at-ease around you. This will also make you look good in front of your boyfriend.

",How to Meet Your Boyfriend's Parents," Be patient, you don't need to meet them until you are sure things are serious in your relationship. Usually, after three of four weeks of being together, meeting the parents is a good way of moving the relationship forwards.;
, Try to find out from your partner if his parents have any favorite cookies, flowers or chocolates, or if you are going over for dinner, a bottle of wine. This will start everything off in a positive way.

, Nobody likes someone who moans and whines. Stay away from sad stories, comments on ex-boyfriends or any arguments you and your boyfriend have been having, his parents don't want to hear any of that. As long as you two look happy, they'll be happy, so keep the conversations on a positive note.

, There's nothing worse than a fake, and it's totally obvious if you try too hard. Just calm down and Try to enjoy yourself. If you are relaxed and not too shy or over-excitable then they'll feel much more comfortable being around you and conversation will come much more easily. When they ask you questions, for example about your future or career, just be truthful, but make sure you have confidence in your own plan.

, Ask them questions about their son, about their jobs, their hobbies. This will help you really get to know them, and show that you're not self-absorbed. Also, if you find something in common then that's a great conversation topic and lots of bonus points. Don't forget to throw a few (but not too many) compliments their way as well, but no lying, if you think they have a nice home, tell them.

, You want to make a good first impression, so dress for the occasion. Find out exactly what you're going to be doing, if it's a fancy meal then dress smart, if you're only popping over for a cup of tea and a chat then dress casual but respectable. As long as you look like you haven't just rolled out of bed, and you don't dress too revealingly, then you'll be fine.

,, To make sure you have a wonderful time with them, first ask your boyfriend about them. What do they like, what to they dislike, things like that. Try to make up in your head 3 new subject lines if the conversation gets kind of dull or uncomfortable. If you don't know much about what they are interested in, I suggest you research in a library or online more about that subject so you can have a good conversation without having to smile and nod your head, having no idea what they are talking about. Also, try not to use those 3 new subject lines, or as I like to call them, 'life lines', unless you really need to. Don't feel like you have to talk about everything with them, because remember, if they would like you to come back again for dinner, you need to have to learn new things they like and such, and do the whole process over again. So unless the conversation as plunged in a downwards spiral, don't use up all of your 'life lines'.

Take your FBF aside and make sure that she knows how important your girlfriend is to you, and that you are in a very loving relationship.",How to Make Your Girlfriend Comfortable Around Your Female Best Friend," If you go to your FBF (female best friend)'s house, then you have to tell your girlfriend! If you or your FBF lies about it, your girlfriend will probably find out, and then she'll have problems trusting both of you. Think about it-if you found out that your girlfriend had spent the day alone with another guy and not told you, how would you feel?;
, That way, you'll show her that you have nothing to hide about what the two of you do together when she isn't around.

, Holding her hand or wrapping your arm around her when you're sitting down is a good way to help reassure her. It also shows her that your FBF is in no way uncomfortable with you having your girlfriend around.

, If they both have Facebook, why not start a group chat with both of them, and let them get to know each other?

, If her excuse is along the lines of 'we can't do things we normally do around her' or 'it's not fun when she's around' etc, then perhaps your girlfriend is right to be wary of her.

, Do not try to defend your FBF or turn the blame on your girlfriend (""So she appeared offline to you on Facebook so she could talk to me alone, whatever! Get over it! She only did it because you're so annoying!""). Instead, encourage your FBF to apologise or explain her actions to your girlfriend. The same works vice versa.

, If she's still trying to get used to your FBF being in your life, don't suddenly demand that you get to stay overnight alone with your FBF. Most girlfriends wouldn't be happy with this, and for the sake of your relationship, you shouldn't consider it.

, Chances are that if your girlfriend sees that nothing flirty goes on between the two of you, then she'll be more okay with you talking to her. If you don't want to show her because you think she'll take the things you say to your FBF the wrong way, or the messages you send are flirty, then you should own up to it and stop sending those messages immediately.

, You should also tell your FBF that your girlfriend is still feeling uncomfortable around her, and ask her to maybe try to talk to your girlfriend and put her at ease. If your FBF refuses, chances are that you shouldn't be friends.

The most important rule ever, please do not make out with your boyfriend in front of his parents.,
Be yourself.",How to Make Your Boyfriend's Parents Love You," If you've been invited on a picnic at the park at 3:00, don't show up at 3:30. Perhaps even show up a bit early.;
, Don't try to impress them with a barrage of information about how you're a straight-A student, the MVP for your soccer team, and the lead in the school play. If the subject of grades, sports, or hobbies comes up, you can smile and say ""Yes, I like school."" or ""I love to play soccer."" or ""Really? I love acting, too."" You can also use your interests to segue into an invitation to another meeting. Offer to refresh their memory on physics or tutor their son; suggest shooting hoops together after dinner; or invite them to come and see the play. In summary, don't focus the conversation on you; ask about their interests.

, Most parents love to see that their son has discovered a girl with a bit more to her than her looks. They like to know you aren't just a meek and mild thing draining their sons time. Whether having a meal with them or bumping into them when you turn up at his house, start a small simple conversation to show you're genuinely interesting.

, It sounds a bit 'teacher's pet' but even the simplest things as laughing (not too over the top) at their jokes, gives the impression that your friendly and even against their will sometimes, they will start to like you.

, No parent wants to see their precious son come home from school with his arm draped over a girl in a miniskirt, wedges, and a tube top exposing a ""tramp stamp"" (AKA: lower back tattoo.) This is not to say you should show up in a prairie dress, bonnet, and granny boots. Nice jeans, pressed khakis, or a mid-length skirt will do, as will a cute t-shirt, tank top, or even a nice dress. Also be sure you're not flashing a thong or that your bra straps are flapping about.

, Swearing will not impress your boyfriend's parents. Nor will your talk of that ""gnarly rave"" you went to last night, or your ""hilarious"" story about that time you drew all over your friend's face whilst she was passed out drunk. However, your story about your cute dog or polite answers to their questions will.

, It may sound simple, but parents will love it if you offer to help set or clean up dinner, make polite conversation, or at the very least just say please and thank you. Don't chew with your mouth open, help yourself to seconds, or dig into dinner before everyone has sat down. You may even consider bringing a small gift such as jam or cookies with you.

, Use common sense. A slight peck on the cheek is OK, but nothing more.

, Yes, it sounds totally cliché, but nobody wants their son going out with a totally plastic, ""perfect"" girl. They want him to be going out with a girl who is nice, who can help cook dinner some nights, or to shoot hoops with alongside their son. Really, just be you. Your boyfriend and your boyfriend's parents will love you for it.

Give your parents time to consider your explanations.,
Don't get disheartened if you parents feel strongly about another religion or caste.,
Bring this person home to meet your parents.",How to Persuade Your Parents to Let You Date Someone of Another Religion," Consider how they feel about intermingling with persons of a different faith and whether there are other family examples where this has happened. It is important to know whether your parents are vehemently opposed to interfaith dating or are only mildly uncomfortable about it, for this will condition your own approach toward persuading them.;
, If you know they're only mildly uncomfortable about the idea of interfaith dating. In this case, it may be enough to explain the different religion, how faith matters a great deal to your proposed dating partner and the similarities between the two faiths. If you know they're going to shut down really quickly and simply say no, you'll need to be more subtle but determined to keep raising the matter.

, Tell your parents how you feel about this person, what they do and how this person as impacted your life.


Explain how caring and good this person is. Every parent wishes to learn that a potential partner for their child will care for the child as they do.

, As well as telling your side, listen to theirs. Find out what is holding them back from giving you their agreement or blessing to the interfaith dating. It could be a custom or maybe even a matter that is worth you pondering over some more. It has to work both ways. Listen to them and, in turn, they will listen to you. It won't happen in a day or two but it will be worth the effort in the end.


Remain polite and understanding at all times. One act of foolishness or spark of anger may destroy everything you're trying to achieve.

, This may be normal where you live or within your community, and that is a strong pull on your parents. Don't play the drama card or storm out. Repeat your wishes slowly, yet directly. Inform them that you continue to feel strongly for this person and that the feelings are reciprocated. Stay strong.


Enlighten them some more about the other person. Focus on all of the positives, including this person's devotion to faith.
Don't lose hope; stay firm. Realize that there may be tension in the household, there may be bitter feelings but you can ride this through with determination, kindness and calm.

Demonstrate affection for your partner.,
Make a joke or comment to diffuse the situation.,
Remove yourself and your partner from the situation.,
Take time to process your emotions.",How to React to a Friend Who Flirts with Your Spouse1," If you’re concerned that a friend is flirting with your spouse, move near your partner (even if you’re across the room) and make a physical or verbal demonstrative gesture. For example, you could put your arm around your partner, tousle their hair with your hand, sit on their lap (if appropriate given the context), or give them a kiss.This demonstrative affection will make you seem calm and confident, even if you feel jealous or insecure internally.;
, This will be useful if your friend is unaware that their behavior seems flirtatious, and to communicate to your spouse that you don’t necessarily approve of the friend’s actions. If your friend is intentionally flirting, your comment can serve as a warning or “back off” signal, making clear that you don’t appreciate their advances toward your spouse.Say something like:


“Hey this is my spouse, go find one of your own!”
“We’ll have to find you a girlfriend or boyfriend of your own, buddy.”

, If your friend continues their flirtatious behavior, even while you’re close at hand, it may be time to leave the situation before you become angry or the flirtation becomes more serious. If your spouse appears to be enjoying the flirtatious attention from your friend and even returns the behavior, it’s best to remove you and your partner from the situation, whether it’s a dinner party, happy hour at a bar, or an evening out on the town.Even if you’re angry at this point, avoid taking it out on the friend or your spouse before you’ve had a chance to discuss what happened.

, It’s important that you acknowledge—both to your spouse and to yourself—that you’re upset over what happened. It would be wise to acknowledge these feelings before expressing any anger towards your spouse or towards your friend. Give yourself time to decide if you are truly offended by your friend’s actions or you were only annoyed in the moment.If you process emotions best by thinking through the event and considering the various responses you could have, take a long walk to give yourself time to think.
Be sure to consider if there is a pattern. For example, does this sort of thing happen often, or has it ever happened before? Do you often feel jealous?

"

Ask your partner if they noticed the flirting.,
Acknowledge your jealousy or frustration to your partner.,
Do not blame your partner for the friend’s flirting.,
Clarify boundaries for both you and your spouse.",How to React to a Friend Who Flirts with Your Spouse2," Before you make any assumptions about your spouse’s response to your friend’s behavior, find out if they thought your friend was being deliberately flirtatious, or just being friendly. Sometimes kindness, polite conversation, and friendly attention can be mis-construed as flirting.Say something like, “I noticed that Ben stayed near you at the bar yesterday and didn’t seem interested in talking to other people. Do you think he was flirting or just being friendly?”
You should have this conversation relatively soon after the flirting occurred. It will do you little good to wait a month before bringing up the incident.

, Married partners should be emotionally transparent with one another, and this situation certainly calls for transparency. In this situation, you need to help your partner understand your emotions, and bottling up your feelings of frustration won’t help.You don’t need to be petty or sarcastic; rather, help your partner understand why the flirting bothers you. Say something like:


“I think that Steve was flirting with you last night; it made me feel like you enjoy talking to him more than to me, and I couldn’t help but wonder if you enjoyed the flirtation.”
“It made me jealous to see Jess flirt with you at the party; I don’t like it when other people speak to you like that.”

, Unless your spouse was clearly enjoying the flirting and even flirting back, don’t blame him or her for having encouraged the attention, as this was likely not the case.Also, if you blame your partner, they will likely react with hostility and may accuse you of prying or being overly sensitive, which will stop productive conversation.


You can clarify this by saying, “I know you didn’t ask to be flirted with, and no part of it is your fault.”
However, if your spouse becomes defensive or evasive, that is also information. Sometimes flirting can indicate that someone is cheating.

, This should be a healthy and productive conversation for both you and your partner, in which you can clarify what you do and do not find acceptable concerning behavior that seems like flirting with other people. The line between flirting and normal social behavior can be thin, so you and your spouse should name specific actions that are either acceptable or too far—and make it clear that any sexually suggestive behavior or comments from other people are inappropriate.Say something like:


“Of course friends can hug each other, but it concerns me when other men put their arm around your waist.”
“You and Cindy seemed to be sharing a lot of inside jokes last night after the movie, and didn’t spend time conversing with anyone else. That makes it seem like you’re flirting with her.”
You can use this as an opportunity to make a list of boundaries that are important for each of you in the relationship.

"
"
Talk with your friend about the incident.,
Ask your friend about their intentions.,
Ask your friend to stop the behavior.",How to React to a Friend Who Flirts with Your Spouse3," It’s best to talk with your friend directly, rather than making dramatic assumptions about their behavior. Reach out and explain that you’d like to have a conversation in the near future; for example, you could ask your friend to meet you for a coffee. Avoid lashing out in anger or frustration as soon as you see your friend; stay calm and avoid making accusations.Say something like:


“I consider you to be a good friend and want to keep our friendship, but at the movies last week I thought you may have been flirting with my spouse, and that concerns me.”
Make sure that you talk with your spouse first. Don’t talk with your friend before that.

, This should be done politely, and in a private space. Assuming that you value the friend and want to keep that relationship, you should not confront them aggressively or with hostility. Instead, have an attitude of concerned curiosity; mention the specific behaviors that you took to be flirting, explain that this upset you, and ask your friend to explain themselves. For example, say:


“It seemed to me like you were flirting with Sharon at the party yesterday, when you kissed her cheek after dinner. That bothered me. Can you explain why you did that?”

, If you’re not satisfied by your friend’s explanation of their flirtatious behavior, make it clear that you’d like them to stop this kind of interaction with your spouse. Explain your reasoning and clarify the specific types of behaviors (joking, physical contact, etc.) that you find objectionable. The friend should respect your wishes.Say something like:


“Even if you’re not intentionally flirting, it still comes across that way to me and I’d appreciate it if you back off a little.”

, The words ""Sir"" and ""Ma'am"" may seem outdated, but they are very useful for having the appearance of class and charisma. Also, ALWAYS use ""Please"" and ""Thank you"". Depending on the mother, ""Miss"" may be more appropriate- its connotation is younger and more vivacious.

Do not snipe at 'the other' biological parent.,
Let the children decide how you fit into their lives.",How to Interact With the Children of a New Partner," It goes without saying that you should always treat your partner with respect. This is of even greater importance if that partner has children. Using a partner for a 'fling' especially if they have children can be incredibly damaging and could potentially worsen any abandonment issues that family may already be suffering from. Humans are not perfect and we cannot predict the future, we make mistakes but at the very least you should have an honest discussion with yourself before entering a family situation with a new partner about your motivation. It is not enough to say I will 'put up' with the children to be with my partner. This situation will make you, your partner and your partner's children miserable in the long run. If you are fully entering this relationship then you need to be prepared to become part of the fabric of that family. In the case where two families is involved, that is both of you have children, that now blend, it will make a ""new fabric"".;
, Suddenly appearing 24/7 in a child's life is a massive change for them to adjust to and is unfair. You need to enter their life gently and through events or situations that are on 'neutral' ground i.e: Not in your partner's home. In the first instance something like a cinema or zoo trip would be a good idea as there are other distractions for you, your partner and their children which will diffuse some of the intensity of the situation. Gradually build up the amount of time that you spend with the children allowing them to get to know you and you to get to know them.

, Pretending you are an old school friend or work colleague rather than your partner's new boyfriend/girlfriend is a bad way to approach the situation. Despite any good intentions that you may have, once that 'white lie' is revealed your relationship with those children sets off on a false premise and may breed suspicion.

, Coming into a family home and laying down new rules right from the off has the potential to cause resentment. Be sensitive, this was a fully working family before you came onto the scene and you need to respect that. There is no reason why over time you cannot suggest different ways of doing things or things that you would like to see happen but it needs to be handled sensitively and with consensus of the children and your partner. Don't make mountains out of molehills, if they stack the dishwasher differently to the way you do it, there really is no point in creating a situation between you and the children over something so trivial.

, Before your arrival the children would have unrestricted access to your partner. It is vital that the children still have this quality time with their biological parent. Make sure that you maintain opportunities for the children to speak to their Mother or Father without you being present. Go for a walk or see a friend for a couple of hours to allow them this space.

, As a new partner there will be occasional resentment and jealousy from the children however hard you work to avoid this. ""You are not my Father, you can't tell me what to do"" is a common one. Don't give up working on your relationship as a consequence of these remarks, you are in this for the long run!

, You should let the biological parent have the final say in these discussions and back her (him) up on it. Present a united front on all rules and discipline methods. If grounding is the penalty for mouthing off, make sure both of you agree on that. This causes the least stress for the kids. They will test your boundaries but if the rules don't change when they're with you or Mom, they will feel a lot more secure in life. When they ask permission for something, always ask ""did you talk to your mother?"" and check with her about it. Kids will try to pick which parent to get a permission from whether you're the step dad or their biological dad. Good communication solves a host of problems.

, Trying to be your partner's super cool new boyfriend or girlfriend will eventually exhaust you and probably cripple you financially. It is not feasible to always be the fun, super hip person in the family! Be yourself, the children want to know you not a fake superhero/heroine character you have created.

, If they are a total deadbeat, it is not your place to say so! The children should be free to talk about their biological Father or Mother without derogatory comments from yourself. This is the case even if your partner tries to goad you into joining a 'slating' session. The children will not respect you for it and you will place them in a position where you will make them feel anxious.

, Do not try to be a replacement for their other biological parent! The best relationship you can have and that the children can have is one that has developed organically rather than something that has been forced onto them.

Use a clear, confident voice when you are talking. Don’t whisper – but, don’t yell either. Just speak in a normal, calm tone of voice.
For instance, if your friend’s older brother is picking you guys up from dance class, you could smile and say, “Hey, Josh. Thanks for picking us up” in a clear voice.

, It will be hard for your friend’s older brother to think of you romantically if you start giggling and saying, “OMG!” every time he’s around you. Being calm and mature when you see him will help him see you as more than just his younger sibling’s friend. Remember that being mature is not the same as trying to act older than you are. Acting mature means acting your age.


When you see your friend’s brother, calmly smile and say “Hi, How are you?”
Remind yourself that staying calm and showing how mature you are will help your friend’s brother see you as a person and not just as his sibling’s friend.
You might say to yourself, “If I relax and act my age, he’ll be able to see my great qualities and might think of me romantically.
For example, if you happen to see your friend’s brother at the mall, don’t run up to him and start jumping up and down in excitement.
Instead, take a deep breath, calmly walk up to him, and say, “Hi, Bruce! What are you doing out here?”

Maintain a stable life.The Cancer man typically has his life together, and to some degree, he may expect the same from you.,

Look for signs of affection.,
Give him time.,
Talk about family.,

Spend time in nature.,
Plan for the future.,
Commit completely.,
Pay attention to him as an individual.",How to Make a Cancer Man Fall in Love," Your accomplishments do not need to be the exact same as his, but your life should demonstrate a certain degree of stability.


Show him that you can take care of yourself without him. You should have some direction for your life and be capable of caring for your basic needs.;
, Even though most Cancer males are capable of supporting you materially, it's best to avoid that type of situation. If the Cancer guy in your life has any reason to suspect that you might be after his money, he might cut himself off from you emotionally.


Unless he offers to pay for you on every date, you should take turns or occasionally split the bill.
Don't make any demands regarding gifts or things you want him to buy. If he does like to dote on you with various material gifts, you should make sure that you give plenty to him, as well. The gifts do not need to be expensive, but they should show a comparable amount of affection.

, You might be worried about making your sensitive Cancer man upset if you argue with him, but a healthy argument can actually increase the esteem he holds for you.


The key is making sure that your arguments are reasonable and healthy. Don't lash out, aim for his weak spots, or make unfair accusations. When the time comes to reconcile, don't hold back.

, Generally speaking, Cancer men can be somewhat superficial regarding appearances. You don't need to be a beauty queen, but dressing up for him every now and then can certainly help your cause.


You don't need to do anything extreme, but when you should generally maintain good hygiene, wear a little make-up, and dress in clothes that flatter you.
Scent can be another powerful tool. Look for a feminine, flowery perfume, body wash, or shampoo. Make it your signature scent and let him learn to associate it with you., Since Cancer men are sensitive beings, they can appreciate inward beauty as well as outward beauty. Try to go through life in a poised, graceful manner.


Losing your temper on occasion is natural and fine, but it needs to be the exception to the rule and not your standard behavior.

, Become an expert on his moods and emotions. Cancer men tend to be among the most emotional, sensitive zodiac males. If you can master the ability to decipher his moods and react accordingly, you can find your way into his heart rather quickly.


When he feels distressed, ask him about what's wrong. If he hesitates, let him open up at his own pace but make it clear that you are willing and eager to listen.
When he's not actively unhappy, keep him laughing. The typical Cancer man loves to laugh, so a woman who can keep him smiling will seem very appealing.

, Drop your guard and let yourself be vulnerable in front of him. Most Cancer men are fully capable of supporting you emotionally and actually appreciate having the opportunity to do so.


Confide in him about your secrets. Turn to him first when you've had a bad day. He craves empathy from those he cares about and yearns to return it.

, You'll need to appreciate his thoughtfulness towards you, and you'll also need to accept and encourage his thoughtfulness toward others. Even though most Cancer men are loyal, there can be times when they'll prioritize helping someone else over spending time with you.


Don't be surprised if he rushes to the side of a sick friend or offers to assist a neighbor with a difficult task, even if it means canceling a night with you to do so. His sense of obligation can take over at inconvenient times, and you'll need to learn how to tolerate that.

, Healthy arguments can be beneficial, but lashing out or spouting spiteful insults won't be. If you attack his weak points through your words, you may cause him to put up a barricade between you and his heart.


He might be more sensitive to criticism than most, so comments that cut him down will cause him to withdraw. You can bring up constructive criticism or concerns when needed, but stay away from criticisms that do nothing but insult him., When your Cancer man can feel how much you love him, he might be more likely to fall in love with you in return. Do something nice for him without having a reason. A little well-timed kindness can go a long way.


When you say ""I love you,"" make it meaningful, passionate, and genuine. Don't say it just to say it.
Gifts that remind him of your relationship can be especially effective. Think photo albums, love poems, and trips to sentimentally significant spots--like the place you first met, for instance.
Gestures that nurture are also a plus, so you might try giving him a home-cooked meal or a hand-knitted scarf.

, You might be tempted to make your Cancer man jealous by flirting with other guys, but doing so will inevitably work against you. Most Cancer males tend to lean on the possessive side, so they can become jealous quickly and don't handle the emotion well.

, No matter who feels hurt—you or him—the two of you need to sit down and iron out your emotional difficulties as rapidly as possible. His negative feelings probably won't vanish on their own, and he may also expect your negative feelings to linger until resolved.


When he feels hurt, he may withdraw from you until you offer him an honest apology.
On the other hand, if you withdraw emotionally, he can become clingy and demanding. The only way to calm him down is to open your heart back up and make amends., Since Cancer men tend to be so sentimental, you might know when he has fallen in love with you before he even says the words. Watch for a shift in his behavior. If he becomes notably more affectionate towards you, his heart may very well be yours.


Increased levels of affection and consideration are good signs. If he does a lot of hugging, asking about your day, and sensing your moods, he might be falling for you.
Similarly, if he withdraws or seems notably hurt when you upset him, it could mean that he has become emotionally attached to you., Cancer men are usually intuitively aware of how sensitive they are, so they know they can be hurt if they get involved with the wrong people. It might take some time before he opens up to you, but if you're consistent enough with your affections, he should drop his guard eventually.


His need for emotional security can be pretty strong, so he will need to sense a certain degree of emotion from you before he can let himself feel the same way. Once he feels certain of your feelings, though, he's more likely to be free and honest with his own.

, If he fits the mold, your Cancer man will be fairly family-oriented. Talk about your family and encourage him to talk about his. If he senses a shared appreciation for family, his affection for you may grow.


His idea of family might be broader than yours and can include aunts, uncles, cousins, and other distant relatives.
Some Cancer men may even take things a little too far and dote on their family members more than necessary. If he gets along well with your family, though, he may also come to love them as his own.

, Due in part to his love of family, the Cancer male thrives in a warm, cozy environment. It nurtures his spirit and opens his heart. Creating that environment for the Cancer man in your life can encourage him to open his heart to you.


Welcome him into your home and show an interest in being a part of his. Spend time with him at home and indulge in plenty of one-on-one time.

, One interest that most Cancer men share is an appreciation for nature. When you spend a day or evening together, consider going to some spot that will allow the two of you to appreciate nature at its finest. Dragging him to a place he will love demonstrates a highly appealing level of consideration.


A weekend camping trip will probably mean more to him than a weekend getaway to a big city.
Parks and other locations with scenic views are great for quick dates.

, Don't be afraid to talk about the future with him. Cancer men are successful thanks to their ability to think ahead, so they'll usually adore women who do likewise.


Talk about your dreams and goals.
Since most Cancer guys have no problem with commitment, discussions about your future together are usually safe, too.

, When your Cancer guy gives his heart to you, he will do so completely. You need to be prepared to do likewise. Before you make him fall in love with you, make sure that you can fall—and stay—in love with him, too.

, Keep in mind that every guy is different, and the ideas offered here are only guidelines.


You will need to pay attention to who your man is as an individual and act accordingly, regardless of whether or not he fits the Cancer profile.

, Yes, their dad might be satan himself. But for you, he should always be an angel. The Capricorns themselves are not blind to their family's faults, but they are used to turning a blind eye to them as they have learned to accept it and love their family anyway.

Figure out if he has the personality of a Virgo.,
Notice if he's interested in current affairs.,
Let him see your funny side.,
Pay attention to good manners.,
Discuss your work ethic.,
Plan dates around intellectual activities.,
Play it somewhat coy.,
Strive for neatness when you're together.,
Discuss your values.,
Have patience.,
Allow him to pursue his own work.,
Be kind and loyal.,
Accept his intensity.",How to Get a Virgo Man," Don't assume your man has all the traits of a Virgo just because he was born between August 23 and September 22. While it can be fun and interesting to take someone's sign into account, don't trust astrology over what you can learn with your own eyes and ears. Observe and talk to the man you are interested in and get to know his personality, and see if it fits with what you are looking for in a partner. It should also be said that you shouldn't have to change yourself or pretend to be something you're not in hopes of attracting a Virgo. Be yourself, and evaluate whether or not this person's values and interests align with yours.


You might make a game of this with your man. Say something like, ""I think astrology is really fun, and I noticed you are a Virgo. They're supposed to intellectual, a little conservative, polite, hardworking, and intense. Do you think any of those apply to you?"";
, Virgo are thought to prefer people who can carry on an intellectual discussion. If this sounds like your man, you may want to read up on what is going on in the world and strike up a conversation about the latest happenings.Read the news regularly. Try downloading a few apps on your phone, like apps put out by the New York Times, that send you regular updates about recent news stories.
Watch the news. Put CNN on in the background while you cook dinner, or turn on a radio show that talks about current events.

, The ""typical"" Virgo man is considered serious by nature, so he may be drawn to someone who can get him out of his head. See how he responds to your sense of humor. You should be able to introduce a joke into a situation to lighten the mood.As you get to know your man's sense of humor, start out with jokes that aren't to edgy or raunchy. If raunchy is your sense of humor, that's fine, and you don't have to change it for him, but it's best to feel things out a little before launch into a naughty limerick or off-color jokes.
Start with lighthearted, observational jokes. Work on making jokes about the weather that day, or make cute puns from time to time.

, It's important to always be respectful to others, and this may be especially important to a Virgo. If you notice your Virgo is somewhat conservative himself, you may find that classic good manners go a long way in attracting a Virgo man.Remember the manners your parents taught you as a child. Use terms like ""please,"" ""thank you,"" and ""excuse me."" If you're at a restaurant, take extra care to be courteous to the wait staff. Do not yell or snap when frustrated by the bill or your food.
If you are a more boisterous, loud personality, and this seems to offend your conservative partner, think about if this is a partnership you really want. You shouldn't have to change yourself to be with someone, so if the guy would prefer being with someone a little more demure or quiet, he's probably not the one for you. On the other hand, your rambunctious personality may help him loosen up a bit. The important thing is to just be yourself while being respectful of others.

, Notice if your Virgo is intense and works hard. Someone with this personality may be turned off by people he considers lazy or complacent. If you also work hard in all your pursuits, you and this Virgo may be a good match.If you have a job, for example, strive to be the best employee you can. Pay close attention to small details, be on time every day, and use downtime to learn more about your company. This can be particularly helpful if you're trying to attract a hard worker in your office.
Work hard in other areas. Keep a neat home and engage in hobbies.

, Going to a museum or seeing a play would be the ideal date for a Virgo man. They prefer intellectual conversation, so anything that could provoke an interesting discussion would be a great first date for a Virgo. Just make sure it's something you are interested in, too.Browse the cultural enclaves of your location. Are there any museums or planetariums? Is there a local theater troupe?
Cater to your individual Virgo's taste. If he loves art, for example, take him to a local art museum or art show. If he's fascinated by science, go see a documentary about evolution together.

, The typical Virgo is thought to be a little slow to show emotion. You may want to try to be subtle in your emotions if your guy has this trait, but if you're a naturally emotional, affectionate person, don't feel pressured to behave in a way you're not comfortable. Do what feels natural, and watch the guy for cues. If he's uncomfortable with your level of emotion, you may want to dial things back until you get to know each other better. When a bond is built, a Virgo man will enjoy displays of affection, but you have to win him over first.Respect his boundaries. If this guy likes to take it slow, then you can slow your pace to match his. It's important to watch his body language, or even ask him outright — ""Is this okay?"" Some people take longer to decide if they want to be physical or enter a relationship with someone, so respect this feeling and take it slow.
Play it cool during communication. Make sure he knows you're interested by returning texts and phone calls, but avoid being too excited. Go for a response like, ""Thanks for inviting me out. I look forward to it."" A more enthusiastic response, like, ""I can't wait to see you!"" may put off a Virgo man.

, Virgo men tend to veer on the side of perfectionism, and may be turned off by messy partners. If you are a neat and tidy person who pays attention to the details, then you and this Virgo may be well-matched; however, if organization and tidiness is not your style, he may not be the one for you.Make sure your clothing is clean. Do not wear anything with stains or holes. If you have cats or dogs, make sure to run a lint roller over your clothes prior to going out. You want to make sure you remove any loose hairs.
When out to eat, eat slowly and avoid slurping or spilling your food. Keep your napkin on your lap at all times.
If you invite your Virgo man over, keep your place clean. A Virgo may be turned off by a floor that needs sweeping or a sink full of dirty dishes.

, While your Virgo may perfectly fit the description of his sign, you still should not make assumptions about what is important to him or what his values are. As with any partnership, take the time to find out what is important to your man in a relationship and decide if they fit with what is important to you, too. You may find you disagree on major points, such as having children or have very different communication styles. Be direct and honest about what you both want from a relationship.


For instance, it would be a mistake to assume that he wants a lot of alone time simply because he is an intense Virgo man. You can ask him, ""Are you someone who need a lot of 'me' time? Will you let me know when you feel you need a little space?"" You may find that he actually prefers to be around people most of the time, contrary to the typical Virgo.

, Virgo men may be deep thinkers, and may take awhile to make a decision about a partner. If you're looking for a whirlwind romance, you might not get that from a Virgo man. It may take him awhile to commit, so strive for patience in the relationship.Do not pressure your Virgo man for a commitment early on.
Do not get impatient. While the wait can be frustrating, remember that Virgo men are kind, loving, and loyal. You will have an extremely kind, caring significant other if you allow a Virgo man to come to you.

, If your Virgo is passionate about his hobbies or work, it may be important for you both to be good at doing things independently and having a little ""me"" time. Virgo men do not do anything halfway, and a Virgo man is sure to put his all into any pursuits.A Virgo man may be very dedicated to work. Allow him to do his job without interference.
If your Virgo man has hobbies, expect him to take them seriously. Try to support his passions. For example, your Virgo man may be on a sports team. Show up to his games and cheer him on. Even if sports aren't really your thing, it's nice to go and show support.

, If your man is a typical Virgo, he will be very dedicated to his partner, and he will expect as much in return. Virgo men also have very little patience for unnecessary drama. Be loyal to your Virgo man and not to bait him into unnecessary arguments.While you should never put aside your own feelings, try to avoid argument. If your Virgo man upsets you, approach him in a calm, kind fashion. Say something like, ""Could I talk to you about something that bothered me? I just want to make sure we talk it out so it doesn't affect our relationship.""

, You can expect a Virgo man to be intense. This is just his nature, and it is unlikely to change. A Virgo man tends to take everything seriously, including your relationship. Once he's ready to commit, he will be intense about the commitment. This can be a good thing, as you'll have a loving and loyal partner, but he will also be intense about work, school, and hobbies. You need to accept this to be with a Virgo.Allow your Virgo man the time he needs to pursue his passions. He may get very serious about matters that seem silly to you, but try to accept this. It is just in his nature. If you aren't interested in the same things, take that time to pursue your own passions.
Remember, his intensity will ultimately benefit you. You want a partner who's intense about you, as this will spell out a longterm commitment.

, This will help you to get beyond a Capricorn man's formal exterior and engage the quirky, charming man inside. Capricorn men often very reserved, witty and have a dry sense of humor, so spark up quiet, intelligent conversations.


Choose outings that make a good environment for conversations. Capricorns prefer quiet dinners out or at home. Avoid bringing him to a loud bar or party. He will just get bored or annoyed.

Consider why you might be feeling that your roommate isn't gelling so well with you.,
Consider the reasons why you think that your roommate might well like you.,
Trust your feelings.,
Consider whether the situation is temporary or permanent.,
Be prepared for close encounters.,
Be ready to make compromises about comings and goings.,
Don't be offensive or confusing yourself.",How to Know if Your Roommate Likes You," Things to look for that might spell out negative vibes include your roommate's lack of cooperation, not talking to you, being impolite whenever you do talk, being grouchy, being reticent to spend time around you beyond sleep time, making difficult requests about lights, noise, positioning of furniture, etc. Equally there could reasons why these should not be interpreted negatively - your roommate might be feeling lonely, homesick, sad, anxious, afraid, bored, drugged, etc.;
, If you're worried about all the negatives, try looking for positives to balance with the negatives. Good signs include talking with you civilly, asking you permission to move things, checking that you're OK with things happening or changing, being respectful of curfews, etc.

, It won't take long for you to know whether or not there is a friendship between you but it can be harder to know if you do at least have mutual respect even if friendship is not going to be an option. Good signs of a positive relationship include feeling comfortable and at ease around your roommate, being able to talk with them about room issues without too many difficulties, and generally just getting along fine. Bad signs include feeling sick, nauseous, and uncomfortable in their presence, being unable to hold a polite conversation, shouting at one another all the time, bullying, mean-spirited behavior. You're the best judge of how life in your room is headed.

, Stress does weird things to people. If your roommate has been great but suddenly changes, don't assume it's you. If might be exams, a broken heart, a lost trophy, a missed audition, a dented car, a poor mark on an essay, a death in the family. Give your roommate the benefit of the doubt, let them know you're available to talk and give them space. Perhaps in time they'll change back. If, on the other hand, the difficult and uncomfortable behavior has been going on since day one, it's probably a permanent state of affairs.

, When the two of you live in close quarters, you will be crossing invisible boundaries all the time. It's a really good idea to sit down and talk about this from the outset. Find out about each others' space issues and try to find ways to accommodate these early on. A great deal of animosity can be avoided by not crossing these boundaries but you need to know them first!

, Is there anything less disturbing than being woken up at 3am by a loud, drunken roommate when you've got an exam first thing in the morning? Not really. Again, set the ground rules early on, as well as letting one another know when important events are happening, such as exams, dates, etc.

, If you're making life unbearable in the room, don't expect joy back. Be considerate and helpful, remedy that snoring issue, and keep the lights out when both of you agree. It's not easy sharing a room with someone else but it is a good lesson in life in not making assumptions, being open, and being ready to make compromises so that both sides are comfortable.

Be open.",How to Keep an Aries Man Interested," Simply put, an Aries man will lose interest the moment his relationship with you becomes too routine or burdensome. If you sense yourself falling into a routine with him, mix things up to prevent him from getting bored.


Realistically speaking, there is no way that every day you spend with him can be completely unlike any other. If you see each other on a daily basis, though, you should try to do something new with him at least once or twice a week to throw off any routine you've developed.;
, If you haven't realized it already, your Aries guy tends to like dates full of variety and adventure. If you want to keep him interested, you need to keep up. On the off chance that your Aries asks what you would like to do, opt for a night on the town instead of a night in.


If you absolutely must have a night in, make it as interesting as possible. Cook a meal using exotic and unfamiliar ingredients or rent an instructional DVD on Latin dance.

, If your relationship is still in an early stage, you need to keep the momentum going. The Aries man is not a fan of taking things slow. Get ready to make him fall fast or not at all.


Of course, you also need to be honest with yourself about how ready you are to advance the relationship. He might be ready to take you to bed, but if you don't feel likewise, don't let his eagerness push you into something you don't want. If, however, you are ready to move forward, do so confidently and without hesitation.

, Even though the Aries man will usually take the lead, he will enjoy a relationship with a woman who can keep him on his toes, as well. When he least expects it, surprise him with something new and exciting. If he gets a buzz of energy from being with you, he will want to be with you for as long as possible.


One weekend, you could suggest trying something like bungee-jumping or rock climbing, especially if your Aries sweetheart has demonstrated an interest in similar activities in the past. You do not need to drag him there blindfolded, but simply suggesting the idea can be a nice enough surprise.

, When you want to give your Aries guy a great gift, take him out on an adventure instead of buying him something tangible. He is far more likely to appreciate the excitement of adventure more than some dull trinket.Front-row seats to watch his favorite sports team or a long weekend camping trip will usually make a better present than something like a new CD.

, An Aries man needs to feel free and independent, so he might not always invite you to take part in his latest and greatest adventure. Try not to hold him back, though. A clingy woman is a turn-off for most Aries men.Try not to be too discouraged if it seems like he would prefer a night out with the guys rather than with you. An Aries man is not likely to beat around the bush and drop hints that things are over; if he loses interest, he will be honest about it. As such, you needn't worry that his sudden interest in hanging out with friends is a subtle indication that things are over between you.

, Many Aries men have a tendency to be extremely bossy and do not appreciate being told what to do. In other words, you will need to let him take the lead most of the time.


If you want to have your way in the relationship, you need to suggest things in a way that can allow your sweetheart to claim credit for it later.

, Unfortunately, many Aries men have wandering eyes. They might flirt with other women they meet regardless of whether or not the two of you are an official item. This might tempt you to keep him home or latch onto him when you head out, but doing so is more likely to drive him away than keep him looking in your direction.


If his eyes do start to roam, skip the direct confrontation and focus on making him look back in your direction, instead. Try making eyes at another guy and letting your Aries man catch you doing so. His competitive nature will kick in and he will invest his energy back into wooing you.

, If an Aries man feels smothered by your attention, he may lose interest. On the other hand, if you challenge him to hold your attention instead of worrying about keeping his, he will probably respond to the challenge more than adequately.


It is important, however, to let him ultimately win once he accepts the challenge. Act disinterested at first, but once he starts trying to get your focus back on him, let him know that his efforts are working.

, Most Aries guys will thrive in a relationship if their partner is active both in and out of the bedroom. Athletic activities are a good way to bond with him, especially if those activities involve some level of challenge.


Engage in a one-on-one race, game of basketball, or similarly competitive game.
Keep in mind that Aries men hate routine, so your physical activities should not adhere to a strict schedule. In other words, a daily jog after work might not be the best thing to hold his attention. Mix up the activity and time a little each time.

, In terms of physical intimacy, the Aries man rarely needs much coaxing. Whether you've reached the bedroom stage or not, you can expect him to put the moves on fast and to heat things up in the blink of any eye. You'll need to keep pace with him if you want to avoid boring him.


For your own sake, you might want to stay physically fit. Otherwise, you'll find yourself exhausted well before he wears out.

, Unfortunately, the Aries man can be a little selfish regarding acts of physical intimacy and quickly takes over. If you want to have any say in the experience, you may need to act unimpressed from time to time. Doing so can trigger his love for a good challenge, and as a result, he may end up paying more attention to you in the pursuit of his conquest.


Hint around this his moves just aren't doing anything for you. Once he catches on, he will be eager to figure out what will and likely won't stop trying new approaches until he reaches his goal.

, As with all other aspects of his life, and Aries man needs variety. If he wants to try something new in the bedroom, let him. If he gets nothing but ""the same old thing"" with you, he might get bored quickly.


If you are uncomfortable with something, though, you need to be straightforward and directly tell him to stop. Once he gets an idea in his head, he will go through with it, even without direct permission. Only direct denial will be enough to put the brakes on things.

, Since Aries men crave excitement and variety, they tend to get involved with more new things than most other guys do. He may or may not invite you along for the trip, but either way, you should let him know that you're cheering for him the entire time.


This means being involved in other aspects of his life, whether they be new business ventures or new hobbies.
If he welcomes you into the adventure, join him confidently. If he doesn't, show as much interest as possible without pressuring him into inviting you.

, Even though your Aries man needs to be right, he needs to be given the opportunity to prove how right he is in order to feel fully satisfied. You can and should challenge him on occasion, but keep in mind that you also need to let him win more than lose.


Of course, if you feel strongly enough about something, you don't need to let him have his way or walk all over you. Being timid will not go over well, nor will letting him win when it's obvious that you have the upper-hand.

, The ego of an average Aries man needs tender loving care. If you have a habit of embarrassing or correcting him in public, you are probably causing a good deal of damage to his sense of self-importance and causing his feelings for you to wane as a result.Making fun of his junior high photos is a definite no-no, and laughing about a mistake he made with his buddies or families will almost always start a huge fight and lead to seriously hurt feelings. In spite of how assertive the Aries male can be, he's actually rather sensitive and easily hurt.

, It is true that most Aries guys are impatient and independent, but in order to make the relationship last for a long time, you need to encourage him to grow emotionally. The best way to do so is with obvious, tangible gestures of affection. Deep down, he fears rejection, and continual reassurance of your acceptance will go a long way.


Don't be afraid of coming on too strong. A frequent “I love you” or “I can't wait to see you” text is perfectly acceptable, as long as he hasn't told you to back off or stop. Likewise, letting him know that he's been on your mind all day will be a major compliment and will usually go over quite well.

, If you really want to hold his attention, you'll need to be honest with your Aries man. Giving him a challenge from time to time is important, but he won't be fond of guessing games, so you need to be decisive and confident when called for and honest about what you want when asked.Now is not the time to get into arguments and expect him to know what you're upset about. Similarly, you should also avoid asking trick questions like the classic, “Does this make me look fat?” He won't appreciate being backed into a corner, even if he knows how to get himself out of it.

Pisces are known to be the partner for life and love to love and be loved.,
Pisces are great with Cancers, Aries, Taurus, Scorpio, Virgos, Libras and other Pisces...

,
Pisces-Pisces relationships can be good or bad.,
Pisces are amazing cooks and make perfect parents.

",How to Get a Pisces to Like You," It's a real turn off for most.;
,,, Don't even say that you would be cruel to animals.

, So if your Pisces does something which bothers you, like sending 10 emails in a week to show you that he or she cares, it's okay to speak to him or her about it. Just mind your words.

, Even if it's just an email every other day. Pisces doesn't need to be romanced in a big way. Small, tiny ways are often perfect. If you can do little thoughtful things for your Pisces, you'll score big time. But don't over-indulge your Pisces. Make them learn that just because you don't call every day, it doesn't mean you don't love them.

, Pisces are the type where if you break a promise they will never forget it and they will lose trust in you.

, Pisces just can't help it but they can change if you tell them. Again, be tactful with your words.

, Seek ways to reciprocate. They would appreciate you for it.

, That would make them feel more loved. But of course, don't go all fatal attraction on them and kill a bunny. For emphasis again, only SOME Pisces would love that.

, They are unworldly, and it will get you nowhere with them.

, When Pisces are being used or taken for granted they normally don't speak up immediately. They normally deal with it, but when it gets out of control they become very outspoken.

, If you want someone who is sensitive, compassionate, loving, interesting and a long term relationship then a Pisces is the one for you.

,, Depending on the type of Pisces the relationship with another Pisces can be bad because it could be like having a clone. Most of the time this isn't the case. Most of the time Pisces are great together.

Ask Cancers about their family.",How to Flirt With a Cancer," Cancers are both born leaders and astute financial planners. If they are a part of a group, they are likely to be at the head, leading it. They are also very good with their money and can be quite successful at anything they set out to achieve.Don’t be intimidated by this aspect of Cancer. While they are successful leaders, they are also incredibly sensitive. The power and success does not go to their head.;
, They tend to appreciate lavish dinners, the arts and cultural experiences. They will be open to someone who is well-versed in the arts and appreciates extravagance.Tell them about the last book you read and which part was most touching to you.
Suggest a fine dining restaurant and describe your favorite dish.
Talk about plays and movies which have meant a lot to you and stirred your emotions.
Mention museums and your favorite works of art.

, A Cancer can be prone to mood swings. Don’t let this throw you off. They are incredibly emotional and can seem contradictory with these emotions or move through several emotions in a short amount of time.Be kind when their emotions begin to appear.
Attempt to find logic and reason for their feelings. Stay sensible as they become emotional.

, A Cancer will rarely make the first move, so it is going to be up to you to step up and initiate a conversation. Their emotional delicacy and fear of rejection tends to keep them at bay, but they will be open to your initiation., Do not rush them into a decision on the spot. If you try to force them to give you an answer right away, that answer will likely be “no” and they will pull away from you. Make suggestions and allow them time to make their decision.If you ask them on a date, give them options of when and where, then allow them time to decide.
Leave them with a question. Give them time to consider your proposal, and check back with them later in the night to see what they think.

, A cancer enjoys physical affection. Their erogenous zone is their chest. This works better when flirting with a man than a woman. Gently touch a Cancer man on the chest as you are flirting.You could gently pat him on the chest when he genuinely makes you laugh.
Gently run your hand along his chest as you briefly walk away, before you return to check in on him.
While you want to avoid touching a woman’s chest while you are flirting, you can still be physically affectionate and reach out to touch her shoulder or forearm.

, Cancers are very loyal people and tend to have a small group of very close friends. They will take their friends’ opinion of you to heart. Being respectful and kind to a Cancer’s friends will draw you closer to the inner circle.Spend some time with the Cancer’s friends when the Cancer walks away. Befriend them on your own.
Actively listen to what the friends have to say. Make a point to learn their names and remember specific things about who they are and what they do.
Ask a Cancer about their friends when just the two of you are together. If someone had an important meeting come up, ask how it went. If one of their friends is going through a tough time, follow up and ask the Cancer how that person is doing.

, Let your feelings and intentions be known. If you are looking for a long term relationship, mention it. If you are hoping for a one night stand, let it be known.On the other hand, do not lead them to believe that this has potential for a relationship if that is not your intention. They will find this out and it will drive them away.

, Like most people, Cancers have a need for approval, but they will see right through a forced or insincere compliment. Even if the compliment is very simple, keep it honest and sincere. Find something truly unique about their appearance and mention it.Maybe they have a distinct speck of color in their eyes.
Something about their style or outfit could intrigue you. Mention their necklace or tattoo and ask them about it. It likely has special meaning to a Cancer.

, The biggest sticking point for a Cancer is trust. They instinctively protect themselves until you earn their trust. This can be tough to gain in a short amount of time, but starts with complete honesty.


A Cancer will see right through any pretense.
Speak the truth and do not contradict yourself.

, People born under the sign of Cancer have strong ties to their families. Family always comes first to them and they are likely to have a large family. Cancer women are great mothers.Ask if they have brothers and sisters. Take a genuine interest in learning more about their siblings.
People who are important to a Cancer should be important to you.

Don't be put off by her masculinity.,
Engage her competitiveness.,
Get active.,
Indulge her impulsive side.,
Don't let too much of your shy side show, even if it's a big part of who you are.",How to Get a Aries Female to Fall in Love with You1," Aries are usually thought of as a masculine sign, regardless of gender. So your woman in waiting is likely to have some masculine tendencies — directness, energy, a temper perhaps — even if her more feminine traits shine brighter in your eyes. The first step in getting an Aries to fall in love with you is to understand, accept, and finally cherish, these tendencies.


Accept her way of doing things, especially in the beginning. Aries are known as very domineering, which can be tough if you're that way too. If she doesn't get to decide what she wants to do because your ideas are different from hers, the chemistry between you too is likely to suffer. Go with the flow.
Let her be rowdy. Remember the tactful little lady that Audrey Hepburn always played in old movies? That is, most definitely, not your average Aries female. She may talk loud, swear, or act boisterously, but you have to be there, at her side, trying not to wilt under the pressure. A tough act, but a rewarding one.;
, Like Aries the Greek god, Aries females are fiercely competitive. This competition plays itself out in the workplace (where she's usually angling to get a promotion, or at least win the support and admiration of her peers) as well as in her day to day life. So how do you begin to attract an Aries female? Stoke her competitiveness! Try the following:


Play board-, card-, dice-, and sports games with her. Bring a set of cards when you go to a bar and challenge her to a game of Rummy; or bring eight dice along and challenge her to a game of Liar's Dice. Whatever you do, don't just let her win; she wants the satisfaction of knowing that she beat you when you were giving it your all.

, It's a must. Aries are extremely active signs, preferring the rough and tumble of physical adventure over the easy predictability of domesticity. In order to click with an Aries, you need to enjoy that side of yourself. Gone are the days of sitting in front of the TV on Fridays and Sundays; get ready to meet mother nature and sweat like a sow.


Women usually like a great walk on the beach, but Aries might rather go kite-surfing instead. Or how about an impromptu swimming challenge past the breakers and back?
Go on jogs and runs with her. Yoga and Pilates are rather tame, so try to pick something with a little more verve — something that really gets her heart pumping. Many Aries love rock-climbing.
Play and watch sports with her. Women are thought to be disinterested in sports, but usually not Aries. She might not like the passivity of watching sports, but she's sure to embrace the opportunity to play them. Invite her along when you play pickup basketball with your buddies, or take her on a date to a football game.

, Aries will often act before they think. That can sometimes lead to a little trouble, but Aries love the adventure of wriggling out of trouble, too. Don't be afraid to act on your impulsive side, or accept hers, when you're around her. Many Aries can't stand a partner who doesn't know how to fly by the seat of his pants from time to time.


Take her on an unplanned date. Try showing up unannounced and whisk her off to a sculpting class, followed by a bar. If she, on the slim chance, has other plans or isn't ready to jump down the rabbit hole, shrug it off and try again another time. Don't moan or take it as a slight against your character. This will make her upset.

, Aries find it hard to understand why other people are shy. They're extroverted, communicating their feelings easily and readily. If you're a shy one, don't put your shy side front and center during the first couple of dates. It's not that she can't love it; it's that she simply doesn't understand it. If you can show her in the beginning that your shyness doesn't define you, there's a chance that she can eventually learn to live with it, and love it.

Know that he's a fire sign.,
Play a savvy game of cat and mouse.,
Engage him in debate.,
Get adventurous.,
Take the good with the bad.,
Keep him wanting more.,
Be naughty and impulsive.,
Notice the details.,
Don't get too clingy.,
Be energetic and enthusiastic.,
Let him be your knight in shining armor.",How to Get an Aries Man," First things first, Aries is a fiery, passionate, sexual sign. If your lustful, impulsive side is at all buried under a pile of inhibitions or insecurities, your Aries will quickly look the other way. So get to flirting and constantly -- it's a primary source of fun and reaffirmation for this sign of the zodiac. In their minds, it keeps every situation spicy!


Flirt with him on every level -- with your body, with your eyes, and with your words. To make him even more entertained, make it subtle with double entendres and plays on words. The Aries man loves a clever woman who can keep him thinking on his toes.;
, Aries men are very tuned into their bodies and how others operate in theirs. To satisfy this need of his, use your body language to draw him in. As you pass him, graze his back. Tousle his hair at the nape of his neck. Dangle a heel against his calf. He loves the challenge of not being able to think straight!


This being said, Aries men do love an intellectual woman. They're all about passion, novelty, and excitement. If you can keep them engaged on multiple levels (intellectually, sensually, etc.) they'll be even more amazed and in awe of you.

, Most Aries men are attracted to women who are quite feminine. They want to be with a woman who they can provide for, who they can feel needs them like a damsel in distress. Crazily enough, clothes can convey this meaning. Dresses and skirts can remind him of your femininity and still be classy!


Since your Aries is so sensual, it's important to smell great, too. You want to engage all his senses. Soft skin to touch, a luscious scent to smell, a feminine silhouette to gaze upon, etc. You want to keep his mind reeling 24/7.

, Let's put it out there: the Aries man is pretty fond of himself. He can be rather self-centered and egotistical. In order to get into his head, you'll have to play along. Give him the praise he believes he deserves. He'll think you're just showing good sense!


This can be a quality that's a little hard to come to terms with. Realize that it's just a part of his personality and how he operates. Some will find it charming; others will find it painful. If you can find it charming, he'll love you for it!

, The Aries man needs a strong personality to counter his boundless enthusiasm and drive. Though he does crave a damsel in distress, he also needs a woman that's confident. Kinda seems like a contradiction in terms, but it is doable. Show him that you love who you are and he won't be able to argue with it. Who could?


Just because you're praising him and being coquettish doesn't mean you can't be confident about it! On the contrary, doing these things shows him that you know what you're doing and are comfortable deferring to others.

, In addition to confidence, Aries loves a woman who is clever. They want someone who can play at all levels -- the Aries man is not a fan of boredom (and that's putting it lightly). They need to be entertained. Being clever can do just that!


Go ahead, tease your Aries! They'll love the attention, especially if you do it slyly and with a grin. Don't just spit out facts -- add humor and dynamism to your words. In short, be yourself!


, Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius are all what are called ""fire"" signs. This means just what it sounds like -- they are enthusiastic, larger than life, and unstoppable. They are generally very self-assured, confident, sexual and incredibly creative. Your Aries is just that!


The downside of this is that they have very strong personalities and can be seen as rather bossy. When a fire sign gets too hot to touch, you may need to stand back to avoid ""getting burnt."" If you can handle the heat, stay in the kitchen!

, Let your Aries man always think that he is the pursuer and you are his lovely catch. He sits naturally in the role and loves nothing more than an old fashioned chase. So don’t make it easy for him and enjoy the attention he pores on you as he slowly circles you and draws you in. This is the best position for you to be in to get an Aries man.


Take pleasure in knowing that you are actually dictating the moves while he is none the wiser. But don't be the mouse that runs away and can't be seen anymore -- stay just out of his reach. Let him think he's making progress and about to get you. If he doesn't see progress happening, he'll find another mouse to play with.

, Aries loves a woman who can challenge him mentally. Don't be afraid to start an intellectual debate with him to get his brain juices running. He should be in awe of you just as much as you're in awe of him!



However, be careful with this. He likes being on top. If you prove him wrong, he may get emasculated and not be able to handle it. Give concessions. Agree to disagree or tell him that he's made valid points that are getting you thinking. He really likes debating -- he also really likes winning.

, There is no room for boredom in Aries' life. The second they get bored, they go elsewhere seeking fulfillment and excitement. So seek adventure yourself! Suggest dates that are exotic and a little crazier than your typical dinner and a movie. Go to an amusement park, go hiking, or go on an impromptu road trip. Keep it spicy!


Not only is this good advice for Aries, but it's good advice for everyone. Ever heard of the Capilano Bridge Experiment? Turns out there's such a thing as a ""misattribution of arousal"" -- meaning that when your body gets aroused (be it from heights or horror, etc.), you don't know why -- and you attribute it to the sexiness of your partner!, Aries (fire signs in general, really) tend to have a few characteristics that others find off-putting: They can be selfish, jealous, temperamental, childish, and moody. When this side breaks out, it's important to stay calm and not take it too personally. If they're displaying emotion, it means they care!


That being said, Aries are full of great qualities, too (otherwise you wouldn't be attracted to them in the first place!) They are driven, confident, charismatic, clever, sensual creatures. Their less positive traits are just more obvious because their personalities are so strong.

, Aries loves the thrill of the chase so much it can seem hard to keep them running after you for more than a hot minute. But it is possible if done with a bit of panache. Don't give your entire personality up at the get-go. Leave little gems for them to discover along the way to keep them thinking there's more of you to conquer!


Because of this, it's important that you maintain your own self in this relationship. Keep up your hobbies, have a world they're not a part of. That way Aries will feel like there's more territory they need to gain, a more thorough understanding they can have of you. They don't want their partner to be easily figured out!

, Remember that ""Aries hate being bored,"" thing? Get around this by being a little naughty and impulsive. They are too, so when you show this side, they'll get it. Suggest an impromptu romp and refer to it as a ""power lunch."" They'll be left reeling for days.


In addition to impulsive sexual behavior, be impulsive with your lifestyle! Surprise gifts, surprise trips, spur-of-the-moment changes in plans -- Aries will eat it up. They'll spend every day wondering what the next will have in store. And looking forward to it!

, When you're springing surprise romantic gestures on your man, make it clear you've been paying attention. He'll love seeing that you remember that one comment on Star Wars he made three months ago. That's admiration in its finest form! The little things mean a ton to him.


This goes back to Aries needing praise and attention. Even if he seems self-assured and like he needs nothing, it's not true. He still needs others, craving their approval and notice. These little displays of your awesome observational skills will let him know you're there and giving him just what he needs.

, Aries is a fire sign and needs to be let loose to find his true power. If you try to reign him in, he'll just explode. He relishes his independence and thrives on it, so it's important not to be too clingy. Let him do his thing. Trust him.


Aries wants a partner that is their own spirit. When you start attaching onto his, you're cramping his style. Be confident in your relationship! It's the sexiest thing there is.

, Aries is full of life and he expects you to be too. How else could you keep up with his vitality?! He's going, going, going, so to be a viable partner, you'll need to be quite the Energizer bunny yourself. So when it comes to life, get excited! It's the only one you have, after all.


Don't be afraid to show your emotions. Aries thrives off of stimuli and sensation. If something makes you excited, preach it on the hilltops! And if your Aries is showing you how much he cares, definitely give him the reaction he's aiming for!

, At the end of the day, Mr. Ram is looking to provide for you and to be the man you've dreamed of. He feels he's worthy of it, so let him! He can be all about chivalry -- which is nice, considering it's practically dead. Let him keep it alive. Let him know he's needed. How could he then stray?


Allow yourself to get vulnerable with him. Though he can be erratic and moody and fiercely independent, showing him you can get real will show him he, in turn, can get real too. He'll love seeing the softer, genuine side of you. And he'll love that you trust him enough to do so!

Give her freedom and independence.,
Be prepared for a burning, but straightforward, sexuality.,
Never make things more complicated than they need to be.,
Take risks with her, but make her feel like she's there with you for each step of the way.,
Bounce back from crises and setbacks.",How to Get a Aries Female to Fall in Love with You2," Aries need to feel that they are free to do anything they want, even if that's not strictly the case. Don't cling to her like a squid to its prey. Keep her in your sights and engaged, but never smothered. As soon as you complain that she hasn't made enough time with you or is hanging out with another guy too much, you've stifled her sense of freedom. Lover beware.


Don't rush her into the relationship. If you two are doing things together but haven't begun calling yourselves a couple, don't sweat it. It'll take her time to come around, most likely. Even if she isn't calling you a boyfriend, you're benefiting from the arrangement. Don't forget that.

, Aries women tend to know what they want. They don't debate the intricacies of sex like other signs do, even if they enjoy it very much. Aries women will be straightforward with you. They'll tell you want they want and expect to get it, unless you can give them a really good reason why it's a bad call.


Aries can have an emotional selfishness which can sometimes detract from the spiritual nature of sex. If you're expecting sex to be a tantric fusing of two persons' souls, expect again. Aries probably has a different idea of what it is.
On the other hand, many Aries have a romantic side to their personality, one that juts out from their other tendencies. If you learn to nurture this romantic side, which you will as time goes on, you can generally expect sex to look a lot different from how it was in the beginning.

, Aries is nothing if not uncomplicated. An Aries won't try to play mind games with you. An Aries won't expect you to know something without first telling you. An Aries won't belabor the meaning of love if it doesn't mean something practical to her at the end of the day. Learn to understand this part of her personality, and be the same way with her. Keep things simple without boring the heck out of her.

, Tap into that adventurous, inner-child spirit that she gets along with so well and don't be afraid to take risks. Consider:


Traveling with her. Nothing says romance more to an Aries than the adventure of travel. Being in a novel place, with different sights, sounds, and customs, will help fuel the fire of her passion. Just make sure she's ready to take the jump with you.
Start a whole new career path or direction in life. Although this is more for you than for her, it can feel like it affects her more than usual because she likes to experience adventure vicariously when she's not experiencing it firsthand. Just be sure the new change in direction is good for you, too.
Be selectively liberal with the money that you spend. The key word here is ""selectively."" Aries are notoriously spendthrift, so you also want to balance out her freewheeling wildness with a little bit of tact. But you don't want to scare her away with any penny-pinching either, so learn to let loose on occasion. It'll help make her feel validated.

, Since Aries are often bold, bossy, and boisterous, you're inevitably going to get into arguments with her, or see things a different way. Try to be calm and forgiving throughout the entire argument. If you reach an impasse, give her an out: Say something like ""Let's talk about this when our tempers have cooled."" Don't take any wrenching personal attacks to heart; she's impulsive and wants to win at any cost, even if it means winning the argument.


What you'll have to deal with is teaching her how to compromise. She'll see compromise as ""losing"" and stay away from it at all costs. Your goal will be to explain to her that compromise isn't the same thing as losing — in fact, that it's essential to a relationship.
Learn to communicate your needs in order to keep the relationship humming. Aries can be blissfully unaware of what your needs are if you don't explicitly let her know. She's extroverted and communicative, so she expects you to be the same.

Understand that Aries women work well with Gemini men.,
Know that Aries women work very well with Libra men.,
Know that Aries women work well with Aquarius men.",How to Get a Aries Female to Fall in Love with You3," Aries females work well with all fire signs, generally, but Leo (July 23 to August 24) excites her most. Both are domineering and alpha-types, but Leo's encouraging and generous nature really makes Aries hum. At times, though, Leo's dramatic nature can butt heads with Aries' more straightforward tendency.

, (Sometimes, too great.) It's December not a match made in heaven, but it works better than most. Sagittarius (November 22 – December 21) and Aries share a fierce independent streak, feeding off of one another. But he's so independent that he might just out-independent her and walk out before the relationship starts. Still, they're compatible in bed and love each other's sense of humor.

, A great relationship if neither tries to dominate the other, Gemini (May 20 – June 21) and Aries both share a restlessness and sense of adventure. He can be fickle, however, and Aries can cause him to retreat if she's just a little too straightforward.

, Because Libra (September 22 – October 23) actually wants to be dominated, Aries' bossiness actually works to her advantage here. He gives her the romance she wants, and she gives him the guidance he craves. Still, she can become frustrated by his indecision.

, Aquarius (January 20 – February 18) enjoys Aries's impulsive nature. They aren't the same when it comes to sex, but are surprisingly compatible sexually. He might be too distant and introspected for her rambunctious and extroverted tendencies.

Be charitable by giving back.,
Mean it when you deliver gestures of affection.",How to Get a Pisces Man1," If Aries men are the crash and burn, fly by the seat of your pants type, Pisces men are more gentle, nurturing, and romantic. The more you can turn on your gentle side, exploring your natural sensitivity and vulnerability, the better your chances will be.;
, The Pisces man doesn't care how much money you have, what kind of car you drive, or where you live. While it's a plus to him, he doesn't base his opinion of you on superficial factors like job status. Pisces men are looking for more of a soulmate, not a status symbol.

, Pisces men are very in touch with their creative side; they tend to look for the same thing in their romantic interests. If you've got a creative bone in your body, get in touch with it, explore it, and nurture it. A Pisces man who sees you develop a relationship with your art will want to explore that relationship with you. That's your in.


Art, spirituality, music — these are all expressions of your creativity that you can show to the Pisces man. Philosophy, sculpture, writing are also good hobbies to cultivate in order to put your best foot forward.

, A Pisces man may not be the life of the social party, but he treats the friends he does have like family, and he treats the family he has like friends. Invest in his family in order to invest in him.


Pisces also like to feel that they are welcomed by your family. Therefore, try to prepare your family for someone who has a rich inner life, but whose outer shell may not immediately suggest it.

, Because Pisces internalize a lot about the world, perhaps noticing injustice and cruelty in ways that other signs don't, it helps to be generous around a Pisces you're trying to woo. Don't fake it, because he'll be able to see right through your shenanigans; tap into your most charitable self and let that person come out.

, Whenever you say ""I love you,"" mean it. Don't be afraid when he says it back because a Pisces's words are the most meaningful and carefully chosen of any sign.

Search for someone staring at you for more than 5 seconds or that does it repetitively.,
Look to see if anyone is unusually sitting quietly.,
Watch for dark clothed people.,
Look for people where there is shallow and flowing water.,
Look for secluded people.,
Look for people doing dangerous deeds, working or being alone, or acting in a way most people would not.,
Once you have found a Scorpio, be secluded like them.",How to Find a Scorpio," Scorpios tend to stare too much and analyze their observations. This may not always be the habits of just Scorpios, it could be a Cancer or someone just staring, so try some other steps featured here to be certain.;
, Scorpios always observe their surroundings, pondering at little things such as a car turning or leaves blowing in the wind, they prefer to just sit back and assess the situation. For example, at social gatherings they may sit in the back corner or at dimly lighted tables, unless they are with someone or their family.

, Scorpios always will have black, brown, reds, any dark color clothing on them each day of the week. Female Scorpio usually wants to be the most aggressive and powerful person among others near her, and she may wear shoes with higher heels then other women, or something as simple as a more beautiful dress than anyone else, or does something along with that idea. Male Scorpio is similar, but will most likely not wear any bright color except white, gray, and blue, and would probably hide it if he can.

, Scorpios are fixed water signs, and mostly all of them are naturally seduced by water, but some may not venture out into deep natural water. However, you will find them most likely near or in fast or slow flowing streams, at fountains be it for drinking or decoration, at sinks, in restrooms when alone, or near the water's edge at beaches and coastlines.

, Scorpios, like their animal counter-part, hide during the day in their homes. They tend to venture out when the sun starts or has receded, if they do go outside during sunrise and the following hours between sunset, most will try to find a place that will give them as much comfort as would their home. This could be in the community park where there is shade, into air conditioned buildings, and somewhere to be alone of course, or generally anywhere that may hide themselves. Often they will be scarce when you are actually looking for them, and sometimes they seem to come out from nowhere, such as if they speak to you or just walking around.

, This could mean working as a chef and handling knives dangerously close to injury, lifting heavy objects, working heavy equipment, lifting the most weight than anyone else at gyms (not always the case), or similar examples and usually doing the alone. Scorpio are not very social unless they come across the opposite gender, and also in a very small and select group of friends.

, Try to hide your emotions, your secrets, and whatever you own just like they do, only giving out little bits of information. Most born under Scorpio will try to find out anything that interests them until it doesn't, but don't be to dead and ignore them, they will leave that situation with bitter memories and hate.

Be lighthearted, make jokes, and above all, treat her platonically until she makes the first move. This is essential.


Aries is a male cardinal sign - ruled by the planet Mars, the symbol of war. You are dealing with a fearless leader. She is a woman who refuses to play by the usual female rules. She doesn't care what people think, and she won't be a stickler for tradition. She won't behave like those other girly submissive women! Because she's ruled by a male sign, it really is essential when dating that she make the first move.
An Aries woman will let you know right off the bat if she's attracted to you sexually, whether with her words or body language. Aries in general are unskilled at keeping secrets, no matter how hard they try. It's likely that if an Aries woman likes you, you'll know. You may sometimes come across an Aries woman who seems shy; open up to her and she will unfold before you.;
, When approaching her for a date, be confident, make eye contact, and smile. Aries women tend to be unorthodox in their interests, so don't be shy. Come right out and suggest rock climbing, or roller skating, or sneaking unseen into the movies. And listen when she makes her own suggestions, which are bound to lead you to unexpected places!

, The motto for the sign of Aries is ""I am"", and you'll understand why within the first few minutes of conversation. An Aries woman is a creature of her own mind, and often gets caught up on the nuances of her own identity and life goals. Provide positive feedback when prompted, and add in your own advice. Aries women appreciate constructive advice on their life paths and personality, but be careful how you phrase your words so as to not step on her toes emotionally - and be prepared for her to not follow your advice at all!

, When talking about yourself, be as honest and forthright as possible. Don't try to play mind games or conceal parts of your character. Aries women abhor dishonesty and duplicity, and will dump you if they suspect that you're being less than truthful with them. Don't be afraid to talk about yourself, though; feel free to tell her about you.


Talk about your future aspirations. Aries women are very loyal friends and companions, and if they think your goals are worthwhile, they love to help out, if they can.

, Let her set the pace for your relationship. Nurture a strong element of friendship and spontaneity when you are together, and keep things fun and interesting by trying new things together, working on something together, or engaging in friendly competition. Stifle any jealous tendencies you may have, because if you try to come between her and her friends, your relationship will be over before it begins. Aries women don't have time for those who try to order her around.

, Aries women are characteristically very strong, loyal, levelheaded and focused about her goals. Some might say she appear rude at first, but try not to judge her too quickly in the initial encounters. Try to look beyond the first impression when you are dealing with females who are of the sun sign Aries.


These women are very sentimental and sensitive, even if they appear rude. Understand their complicated emotions that are tied and mixed up in their minds. These women are far from cold if that is what you think about them; it is due to the fact they take time to accept changes. In fact, these women are warmhearted, extremely loyal, and affectionate.

, Trust has always been an issue for those born under the sign of Aries. Because they say what they mean, they expect everyone else to speak the truth as well. As a result, many Aries have been taken advantage of and used - repeatedly. No matter how often their trust is misplaced and they face the hurtful consequences, Aries always gets back up, forgetting the hurt, and gives their trust away again in all the wrong places. However, the average Aries woman will trust you with her life after knowing you for five minutes. This is one of her most endearing characteristics. It actually stems from her total lack of fear, and her faith in the goodness of others. She thinks everyone is just like her - and she would never take advantage of someone's trust. If you understand that, this is one of her most appealing strengths, and also her greatest weakness, then you'll respect her premature trust and never take advantage of her.

, If she is initially approached correctly, she can be very friendly, helpful and loyal. At some point of time she might be the only person you could turn to in all situations. She is someone whom you could totally depend on and rely on even in the worst possible times of your life. She might be the only person you might think of in such situations that will not let you down. The Aries will always defend the underdog, with heroic courage. There need be no others on her side. She'll fearlessly tell anyone what she really thinks - and this includes gun-wielding maniacs. She will also be the person who will feel your pain and share your happiness. Aries empathize with and actively support those who are struggling to survive, but they have little time for whiners, complainers and unjustified depressives.

, She is made up of strong substance. She is stronger than you, and if you need her, just call her; she will come. She will not give up easily and she will only relax when she has achieved what she had set her mind on. Don't doubt her or take away her liberty and freedom, and she will respect your trust and faith in her and will remain loyal and confident in you. She will do nothing that might harm the confidence you have in her.

, She will not like it, and will rebel against you. She must get the respect she deserves. Make her feel special. Make her feel the importance she has in your life. Cook her favorite meals if you can. Sing or send her songs or write romantic love letters. Poems are also not a bad idea. Try to make her feel special and you will always have her. Above all, fight for her, especially when she is at her weakest, and you will never lose her.

, She will appreciate everything that you have done for her, and will do anything to maintain the love and trust in a relationship she decides to pursue. An Aries woman is a woman of actions. She also sticks to what she says and does not change irrespective of time or season. She might exhibit small amounts of anger, but don't take this seriously, as it may be due to her professional life - she is very driven. It could also be a natural sign of frustration, because she is missing something or someone in her life. Instead, show her love and affection, and most of all, friendship at this time, and she will always remain loyal and grateful.

, Very few can be trusted to care for an Aries woman. Perhaps it's a Leo male who takes her into his pride. Maybe she'll fall for some deep Scorpio eyes (yes, Scorpio can get the better of Aries). But be sure that even if your Aries woman is bossy by day, she may be submissive at night. Are you really strong enough, confident enough to handle this fiery and fearless female? Here's a hint: if you have to ask her to let you be the boss for a while, it means she is the dominant one.

Be open-minded.,
Choose to be with them as much as possible.,
Try to tone down your gossip.,
Never cheat on, lie to, or deceive a Pisces man.,
Stoke the fires of your passion.,
Care for him more than you care for yourself.",How to Get a Pisces Man2," Pisces men tend to be sensitive and questioning, lending them an unusually open mind. If you're obstinate, learn to tone down your stubbornness when you're around him. The inability to budge or compromise will be a downfall in your relationship if you let it.

, Pisces men are not secure in love. They would rather have you around more than their friends if they truly care for you. Plus, this will give them ample opportunities to be the romantic sign that they know they can be. Most people like being showered with affection.

, Loose lips sink - in this case, they sink Pisces. Gossip is superficial, and Pisces are, as a rule, opposed to the superficial. As much more deep thinkers, Pisces men tend to engage better in meaningful conversation. Skip the latest celebrity banter and move straight to a conversation about art for a satisfying response.


If you're not great at small talk, take it little by little. Find out what areas of conversation interest him and don't be afraid to bring it up. Asking questions is good. Once you get a Pisces talking about a subject he loves, you won't have to do much of the talking anyway. You'll probably have to pry him away from the conversation.

, A Pisces can tell right from the start when you begin acting strangely towards him. There's a good chance he'll intuit what's going on and bring it up with you after wrestling with it himself. That's not good for your relationship.

, Pisces like to be emotionally mothered, but that doesn't mean he doesn't want to see the passion you're capable of. When you kiss, put your all into it (kissing passionately is not the same thing as kissing violently). When you compete, put your heart into it. Whenever there's a chance to bare your soul, do so passionately. Passion is what will attract a Pisces man to you.

, You know why? The reason is he cares more about you than you care about him.

Know that Capricorns and Pisces make ideal partners owing to their gentle nature.",How to Get a Pisces Man3," Cancer and Pisces work well together, as both are water signs. Cancer is mystified (in a good way) with Pisces's quiet vulnerability, while Pisces appreciates Cancer's sympathetic nature.

, Another water sign, Scorpio also lives in a more — let's say — rarefied realm. Scorpio and Pisces appreciate each other's depth and reasonableness. Both signs, however, can begin to show signs of frustration when the real world butts its nasty little head in and requires either sign to make compromises, be practical, and get things done.

, Virgo and Pisces share a fascination with and fondness of communication. Although Virgo can be a little bit exacting from time to time, Pisces's loyalty makes these signs quite compatible.

, A Pisces/Pisces love match could either go one of two ways: unburdened and complete love for one another, or consummate distaste. They'll either love each other because of similarities or hate each other because of similarities.

, One likes to change (Pisces) while the other likes to stay the same (Taurus). Although the stability that Taurus offers may be reassuring to Pisces, her desire to always stay the same may eventually be stifling for a Pisces that can embrace changes readily and quickly.

, This relationship will enjoy a perfect balance of comfort and compassion, and will endure a long stay together.

Don’t compete with them.",How to Date an Aries," As a fire sign and the first in the zodiac, Aries are known for being bold, tireless and aggressive. Aries are headstrong, can talk a mile a minute, and prefer to be doing rather than sitting. Dating an Aries means that you’ll have your work cut out for you, and you should be prepared to be as energetic and agreeable as it takes to keep both of you interested.Dating an Aries may not be for the faint of heart. Between the rapid fluctuations in mood, the impulsive decision-making and the natural intensity of their personalities, they may sometimes be overwhelming to handle.
You can have a lot of fun dating an Aries because of their adventurous spirits. Don’t be resistant to going new places and trying new things. You’ll be given a chance to enjoy opportunities that you might not have otherwise experienced on your own.;
, Aries are born leaders and will assert themselves in leadership roles whenever possible. This goes for relationships, as well. If an Aries isn’t allowed to call the shots, they’ll begin to get anxious and resent the restriction, as this is literally in opposition to their nature. While all relationships should consider both partners’ feelings, it’s okay to let an Aries take the reigns. It’s where they feel most comfortable.Letting an Aries handle the planning aspects of dating can do you both a favor if you’re not good at making decisions.
While it’s one thing to give your Aries partner control of day-to-day sorts of details, you should both be on equal footing in the relationship.

, Never content to simply sit and luxuriate, Aries signs are fiercely driven and competitive and will jump at the chance to prove themselves. This means that your relationship will be punctuated by thrilling and unusual dates and activities. Rather than a relaxing night out at the movies, you can expect an Aries to want to take you dancing, be in attendance at rousing events and even plan adrenaline-charged outings like rock climbing and skydiving. If you want to date an Aries, you should get used to the idea of adventure.In general, you should try to be agreeable to your Aries date’s zany ideas, but don’t be afraid to let them know when something is a little too far out of your comfort zone.

, Planning only goes so far with an Aries. While it’s important for them to make and keep a schedule, most Aries men and women will prefer to take things at the spur of the moment, as this is more appealing to their thrill-seeking character than adhering to a strict calendar. Your Aries date might come up with outrageous date ideas at a moment’s notice, and you should be ready to show the willingness to go along with them.If you’re the kind of person that finds it draining to constantly be spontaneous, try to work out a balance between mutually agreed-upon plans that the two of you stick to and more on-the-fly sorts of activities.

, If you’re not a sign that naturally gets along well with Aries, explain these differences to your partner when conflict arises. That way, you can shift the focus to your respective personalities and emotional requirements and keep situations from growing heated. Discuss what you have in common and where you differ early on, so that you have an idea of what to expect from one another in the future.Fire signs like Aries (which also includes Leo and Sagittarius) tend to form the strongest bonds with air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) and other fire signs, so if you're a water (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) or earth sign (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn), you may discover that your Aries interest possesses characteristics that clash with your own.
When talking about your differences, frame the conversation in such a way that each of you are presenting constructive elements of your personality that the other might lack and find comforting in a relationship.

, If you’re not a fire sign yourself, you may find it difficult or uncomfortable to open up about what you need from a relationship. You won’t have to worry about this with an Aries. They are by nature frank, sincere people, and will appreciate your directness. Since it can be a challenge to always know what your partner needs, it’s best when you can establish grounds for talking about these matters openly and avoid a lot of frustrating guesswork.Be extremely clear about what it is you need to feel comfortable in the relationship. It may be that the two of you will just be too different to meet all of each other’s needs, but if you make these needs known in unambiguous terms, an Aries’ action-driven character should be motivated to find ways of caring for them.

, Aries love to make plans and embark on new projects, but aren’t always the best at following through with them. If you’re a planner, use that organization to encourage and concentrate your Aries partner’s innate penchant for getting the ball rolling. Whether you’re thinking about moving in together or just deciding on a place to eat, you should use cool rationale to keep an Aries’ impulsive urges from leading to decisions that never get off the ground.This goes back to not letting your Aries partner become a tyrant when it comes to control. Make sure you’re involved in the decision-making process.
An Aries' almost blind determination to undertake new tasks can be a great benefit when it comes to getting things done as long as they’re not allowed to abandon the task whenever a distraction comes to mind.

, One of the most important things to keep in mind is that no matter how accurately an Aries’ moods and actions reflect the kind of traits represented by their sun sign, nobody can be distilled down to a simple collection of behavioral characteristics. Despite your habits, you’re both individuals, and should strive to view and treat each other on an individual level of respect and consideration. Talk things out, keep an open mind and work continually on compromise and the two of you will enjoy one another for a long time to come., Most of the time, an Aries will be a confident, take-charge person and will become chafed if things don’t go their way. However, it’s important not to let your Aries partner turn into a control freak. As half the relationship, you have a right to express your own feelings, even when you worry it might rankle them. Try to strike the right balance between letting an Aries take the wheel and knowing when to hit the brakes.Your desires, feelings and goals are every bit as important as your partner’s, whether you’re as fierce about expressing them or not.

, Though they are devoted, passionate lovers and will usually be very liberal with their affections, Aries signs also tend to be self-consumed people at a fundamental level and won’t appreciate too much constant attention and oversight—and they’ll have no problem letting you know it. Recognize that Aries are naturally independent people, and be prepared to deal with their romantic mood swings. Clinginess can be a death knell to a relationship with an Aries.An Aries will give and request affection when they feel like it according to their moods.
Every successful relationship needs space. You should enjoy your time alone or with friends as much as your time together., Since Aries are so aggressive, you should know better than to butt heads with them directly over relationship issues. Though this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t stand up for yourself and present your side of things, you should know that making things work with an Aries is about meeting their blunt forcefulness with tact and pliability. Don’t lose your temper when arguing; instead, wait until your Aries partner has had their say and then calmly explain your own thoughts on the matter.If you allow the argument to become heated, an Aries might use it as a chance to unleash their competitive side, even if it’s to one-up you in saying hurtful things. Try not to let disagreements turn ugly.

, It doesn’t pay to compete with an Aries, especially if you’re dating them. While it can make recreational activities and sex more interesting to be a little playful, Aries are arguably the most competitive sign that there is, and will never back down when it comes to pushing their will on others. When things get tough, this means you should adamantly maintain your position, but refuse to engage in terms that specify winning and losing.Compromise is about reaching a conclusion that both partners can live with despite having to make some sacrifice. All relationship matters are best resolved through compromise, not through one person giving in to the expectations of the other.

Go with the flow.",How to Date an Aquarius Male," Aquarians aren't interested in the one-trick pony that's obviously trying to get with them. They want something more interesting. Something more dynamic. Going all out in one fell swoop isn't enough. Take it slow, show them you're worth the time, and be friends first.


Your aim is to be the friend that stands out. Aquarians (not to be confused with aquariums) want something special. Something that can captivate them. They know better than to judge a book by its cover, so they'll need to read you first. Let them get absorbed in your pages.;
, The Aquarian is the one you find who's spilling with creativity. Whether he's behind a camera or a paintbrush, he's full of vision and drive. His entire life is outside the proverbial box and he's often on a different wavelength than others. If you show him that you get this, that you get it and you appreciate it, you'll be leagues above the others who are just smiling and nodding away at him. He'll love it.


Ask him questions! Get curious about what he's up to. Is he writing a song? Turning his basement into a veritable spy facility? Painting a mural on the side of the school? Be interested! And if you can add your skills into the equation, too, all the better.

, This is by far the greatest aphrodisiac for the Aquarian. There’s nothing like a lively chat rich in culture and future possibilities to get this sign going. He knows he's got it going on upstairs; he wants someone else to talk to who's got it going on too!


Aquarians are just about interested in everything. So don't worry about what you can talk about to impress him. Whatever you're passionate about should be what you engage him on. He'll love seeing your zest for life.

, Since he feels a bit different than everyone else, sometimes he can feel a little abnormal. Show him that his eccentric side is something you love -- and it's something you can even relate to! Be unusual. Be original. Do your own thing. How else will you stand out?


When it comes to you, do your own thing. Wear whatever clothes you feel like. Act on a whim. Don't be afraid to be too loud or too reserved or too different. Who wants to be vanilla anyway?

, Aquarius craves freedom and independence. If you come on too strong, he'll be gone like the wind. He's not into emotions and getting too clingy/desperate/intense is not appealing to any of his sensibilities. That's part of the reason being friends first is so important!


Let him know that you are cool and casual. Be a little detached. Nothing is a big deal with you. That lack of stress and drama is something Aquarians definitely are attracted to. That way when he does ask you out, he knows you won't freak out one way or another.

, In general, it's pretty hard to tie an Aquarius down, at least initially. They don't like talking about labels or being boxed in to anything. If you take is slow and don't put pressure on the relationship, it'll last much, much longer.


Your relationship, at least in the beginning stages, is all about enjoying each other and having fun. And there is nothing wrong with that. If you want to go to the chapel after 5 dates, calm it down. There can be time for that later.

, Since Aquarius is curious about everything, they love surprises. They love learning, they love experience, they love doing -- they love living to the fullest. A spicy, fulfilling relationship to them is one that keeps their brains running, wondering what's around the corner. So surprise them!


Don't be afraid to go for the shock factor. It's almost impossible to shock an Aquarius, so make it a personal challenge to do so! Suggest doing some crazy things -- chocolate covered grasshoppers, anyone?

, Aquarians, in general, are open books. They have no qualms when it comes to talking about even the most taboo of topics. Engage them in politics, current events, morals and ethics -- whatever it is, they'll take it and run with it. The more things you're capable of talking about together, the better!


Don't worry about offending their principles. They love hearing others' opinions, even if they don't agree with their own. So long as you have an opinion and a reason to stand behind it, they'll respect what you have to say. As far as the signs go, they're one of the best, most diplomatic arguers and conversationalists.

, You know how we talked about Aquarius' creativity? Do it together! While you should definitely have separate hobbies, do spend some of your free time combining powers. Whether it's pottery, designing a website, or planning a trip, your relationship will be that much sturdier when you have projects to work on.


One of the benefits of dating an Aquarius? They can teach you. If you don't know thing one about photography, playing the piano, or whatever it is your Aquarius does well, have him show you the ropes. You'll stand on your own two feet eventually, but in the meantime, let him wrap his arms around you while you both click the buttons or pound the ivories.

, Aquarius is a sign that resonates strongest in the brain. His heart is not something he uses often -- or at least willingly. If you want to relate to him, use reason and logic. Don't use tears, guilt, or any other feeling to get your way. It won't work. But a sound argument just might!


If you're having a fight, explain how you're feeling in the most reasonable of terms. Remove yourself from you for a bit and take a more objective stance. Instead of saying, ""Oh my gosh!!, why did you use the last of the toilet paper and not tell me?!"" say, ""I was very inconvenienced by not having any toilet paper and could've avoided the situation if you had told me."" He'll respond much more promptly.

, So here's the thing about Aquarius: since they're not really keen on emotions, they're susceptible to freaking out when they get them. So if your man starts being a bit avoidant or anxious, it actually could be because his feelings are getting too strong. When this happens, remember this fact -- or the relationship will fall apart very quickly.


The only thing you can really do is to talk about it. Don't jump to any conclusions and be as tactful as possible. A simple, ""Hey, I've noticed a change in your behavior recently"" might be enough for him to 'fess up. And definitely don't freak out yourself!

, You don't have to do a lot of math to figure out what this means: Aquarius is like the wind -- flowing free, there one minute, gone the next. Sometimes fierce, sometimes gentle, but always doing its own thing. In order to be compatible with Mr. Water Bearer, you gotta let him have his independence.


This by no means he won't be faithful or loyal. That has nothing to do with it. It simply means that he needs to feel that he's his own person and is free to do as he pleases. Trust that ""as he pleases"" is the behavior of a good boyfriend!

, Sometimes you'd swear your Aquarius' alter ego was Holden Caulfield -- he absolutely can't stand phonies. He can see right through you if you start self-presenting and image-maintaining so don't do it. Relax. Know that yourself is all he wants.


Be honest at all times. Honesty and sincerity are essential for anyone seeking a long-term connection to this dynamic personality. When it comes to love, people best suited are those that are not thrown off by Aquarian frankness and honesty. Open, communicative, imaginative, and willing to risk are all qualities that blend well with this sign’s perspective on life.

, Mr. Aqua doesn't do well with intense dramatics. If you run around with your hands in the air, crying, muttering nonsense between gulps of tears, he'll go sit down on the couch and turn on the TV. It's not that he doesn't care about you, it's that he doesn't care for theatrics.


On the same token, he probably won't display emotion on a grand scale, either -- both positive and negative. So when you think he'll be super excited about something, know that he just may be somewhere deep inside -- he's just not showing it.

, Your man is totally open to all walks of life, all opinions, and all philosophies. He's not a fence-sitter or a people pleaser, he just sees it all. It'd serve you well to be open-minded, too! At least for those times when he sits down to dinner with a raging -ist and isn't giving them the third degree.


You'll also need to be open to all his eccentricities. Where most people may find them strange, your open-mindedness will find them endearing. You realize that there is no normal, but there is unique and original -- too very wonderful qualities!

, A relationship with an Aquarius can be interesting, indeed. Since you're not putting too much pressure on them, it's important to just hang tight and see where it goes. Let the breeze take you wherever it goes. When he wants to be serious, you'll know. And you can decide if you want to be serious then, too.


Some people find it difficult to allow the other person this sense of control. Don't think of it like this! You're simply enjoying yourself. You both are. Why would that need to end? Don't worry about the long-term. He's not! After all, you only have today. So live it up, have fun, and have fun with your dynamic, fascinating, intriguing water bearer.

If she takes you up on your offer and calls you at two in the morning, make sure you answer your phone and listen to her. If she needs to see you at three in the morning, climb out of bed and go to her.Don't forget to call her to say hi and to ask how she's doing and how she's feeling.

, Friends who you both share can provide extra support and duplicate the cheering-up efforts. You don't want to tell them anything she's told you in confidence. Ask her beforehand if you can tell them about her sadness, and clarify what you can say., If your friend's sadness continues, if her sadness is interfering with her life, if you find that you can't cheer her up, her problem may be more serious than being upset over a difficult situation. She may be clinically depressed.Be honest with your concerns. Suggest she talk to someone about her problems. Offer to help her find a counselor or therapist and drive her to the appointment if needed.


If you suspect that your friend may be suicidal, then seek help immediately. Contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).If your friend is in an immediate medical crisis, call 911."

Use these as inspiration when you're trying to come up with things that make your friend happy, such as:


Favorite foods and drinks
Things or places the he or she likes
Favorite songs, music, or books
Photos from happy memories
Special ways to relax;
, Any box or container can be turned into a bad day survival kit, but you must consider what types of things will be going into the kit so you can determine how large a box you need. Great ideas for boxes include:


Old cigar boxes
Shoe boxes
Popcorn or cookie tinsGift boxes or priority mail boxes, This is again a great opportunity to personalize the bad day kit to the tastes of your friend, because you can decorate the kit any way you like! When decorating, consider patterns, motifs, colors, and styles that your friend likes. Some good ideas include:


Use glue to cover the box with a collage of photos from happy times you and your friends shared.Cover the kit with wrapping paper (you can even use Christmas or Halloween paper, for instance, if your friend particularly likes a specific time of year).For a friend who enjoys traveling, consider decorating the kit with post cards, maps, or photos from his or her favorite place.
For an even more personal approach, decorate the box by hand, using markers, stickers,glitter, crayons, paint, or whatever your own style and talents dictate.

, Once you decorate the kit, you can create a protective layer on the inside to keep the contents safe. This step isn't strictly necessary, but it’s a good idea if you're going to be carting the kit around a lot, or if it will contain delicate or fragile items.


To protect what's inside the kit, cover the bottom and sides with a thin layer of material, such as foam, fabric, or bubble wrap.
If you use fabric, use something you know your friend likes. This could be a material like velvet, satin, cotton, or something textured or patterned.

, You need somewhere safe and secret to store your kit, because you don’t want your friend finding it before it’s required. Choose somewhere that’s dry, so the contents don’t get wet, and pick somewhere dark so the sun doesn’t discolor your decorations. Good places to store your kit include:


In a drawer or closet
In your locker at school or work
On a shelf that’s protected from elements like light and dust

, Most people have some sort of comfort food or beverage that they turn to when upset, but what to put in your kit will depend on your friend. Just be sure you don’t keep anything that’s perishable or needs to be refrigerated or frozen! Popular choices include:


Candy and chocolate
Herbal tea (bags or loose leaves)
Granola bars
Water
Mints or gum
Crackers and preserves

, A great way to cheer up someone who’s feeling down is to remind them of the good times, so consider including photos of you, your friend, other friends, family, and all of you together. The photos could be:


From vacations or trips you went on together
Taken at parties you attended
Of fun an exciting activities you did together
From birthdays or holidays you spent together

, Sometimes all it takes to cheer someone up is to remind that person that there are others out there who care. Include compliments, words of encouragement, and reminders that while there have been bad days before, things always get better.They say laughter is the best medicine, so feel free to write some jokes into your letter.
If your friend likes literature, include a few verses of poetry, or a passage from his or her favorite book.
Another idea is to write a gratitude list, which is a list of good things that your friend has to be grateful for, such as health, loved ones, pets, children, or anything else that he or she appreciates., Along the same lines as including jokes, why not clip out some funny comics from a newspaper or print some off from the Internet. Just be sure to tailor the humor to your friend, otherwise the gesture could backfire!

, Comfort and distraction are great ways to get someone out of a funk, because sometimes people just need time to process something that happened, and making them comfortable can help ease their minds. To make your friend feel at ease, include things that are familiar, like a:


Cherished book
Favorite CD or DVD
Favorite game or video game

, Most people love getting greeting cards, whether it’s a birthday, joke, thank you, or other type of card. You can find a card that’s cute, funny, serious, or any other style your friend might like.


Inside the note, include more words of love and encouragement, a joke, or a reminder about how awesome your friend is.

, Bubble bath, face masks, aromatherapy oils, and scented candles are all small and easy things you can include in your care package,and not only will they help your friend relax, but they’ll also make the bad day kit smell wonderful!


Relaxation products are also a great idea because they're something your friend can take home and use later to continue the healing when you're not there.

, Another great way to get your friend’s mind off what happened is to distract him or her with a creative endeavor. This could be a:Coloring book
Small build project
Jar of clay or playdough
Craft or hobby

, For when your friend finishes the creative project, make sure you’ve provided another task that can occupy his or her mind for a while, such as a puzzle, crossword puzzle, a toy to play with, or a trinket that he or she might like.


If you do include a crossword, word search, or other paper puzzle, be sure to throw in a sharpened pencil as well.

, Some people find retail therapy to be the epitome of relaxation, and others might just need a good meal. Whether you plan to accompany your friend to the mall or restaurant or think he or she just needs some time alone doing something, a gift certificate is a nice way of helping your friend out of a blue mood.

, Sometimes getting back to nature, or a reminder of nature, can be enough to help ground someone and bring them out of a bad mood. If your friend is an outdoors type, remind him or her of the natural world by including something like:Sand or seashells
Dried flowers or herbs (this can also be for aromatherapy)
Gems or crystals

, Especially if your friend is the type to write in a journal or express emotions in a written way, make sure the bad day survival kit has a pen and paper that your friend can use to vent and process emotions.


Even if you do include writing implements, it’s also a good idea to remind your friend that you're available to talk, listen, or provide advice whenever he or she is ready to open up.

, Sometimes you may want to have a survival kit available in your locker, or a mini-kit that you can carry around with you. In this case, you'll have to make the kit smaller, so only focus on smaller things and the bare essentials. People often turn to comfort foods during bad times, and good food ideas for a mini kit include:


Mini candy bars
Snack-sized granola bars
Small snacks like crackers or cookies
A couple sticks of gum or a few mints

, You may not have room for an entire spa worth of aromatherapy and relaxation products in your mini kit, but you can throw in a couple items that may help alleviate stress and calm your friend. You can look for travel-sized versions of aromatherapy items like:Scented lotions and creams
Colognes and perfumes (try to find your friend’s favorite scent)
Scented candles (look for tea light or votive candles)

, Since you won’t have a lot of extra room, focus on small games and puzzles. If you include a paper puzzle, don’t forget a pen or pencil! Small and packable games you can have in your mini kit include:


Sudoku
Word searches and crosswords
Small wooden puzzles
Cards from a trivia game
A deck of cards
A mini Rubik’s cube
Car or travel-sized versions of popular games like checkers

, This will depend on your friend’s personality, so you're going to have to dig deep to think about inside jokes, preferences, memories, and other things that will mean something to a specific friend. You could throw in:


Some jokes
Comics
A coupon for a free hug
A cute or funny picture or card
A small toy
Some philosophical words of wisdom or a poem

Empathize with your friend.,
Affirm your friend’s feelings.,
Ask your friend what they need.,
Offer your help.,
Don’t feel like you have to talk.",How to Comfort Your Friend2," Try to put yourself in your friend’s shoes, and let your friend know that you understand their emotions. Say something like, “That sounds so hurtful,” or, “You must feel really disappointed.”Don’t say “I know how you feel” to someone who’s upset, since that can seem dismissive. Show your empathy by naming specific emotions instead.

, Validate your friend’s emotions to help them feel less alone. Say something like, “It’s okay to be angry about this,” or, “Anyone in your shoes would feel betrayed right now.”, If you don’t know how to help your friend, ask. Tell them that you want them to feel better and you’re willing to do whatever they need.Say something like, “What do you need from me right now?” or “How can I help?”

, Some people don’t like asking others for favors or support. If your friend is like this, take the initiative so they don’t have to ask. Offer to get together again soon, or plan an activity that might help cheer them up.For instance, say, “I’ll call you when I get home tonight, OK?” or “Do you want to meet up for lunch tomorrow?”

, If your friend isn’t talking much, don’t feel pressured to fill in the silences, especially if nothing you say will make the situation better. Just sitting quietly with your friend will help them feel supported.Tell your friend it’s OK to cry if they need to. Sometimes crying is more cathartic than talking.

Avoid trivializing your friend’s pain.,
Tone down your positivity.,
Keep the conversation focused on your friend.,
Keep the advice to yourself.",How to Comfort Your Friend3," Don’t dismiss your friend’s feelings or resort to using clichés, even if you don’t know what to tell them. Saying something like, “Everything happens for a reason,” or, “Come on, it’s not so bad,” will only make your friend feel worse. Take their sadness seriously and, if you don’t know what to say, stay quiet., Avoid reassuring your friend that everything will be fine, and don’t compliment them in an effort to cheer them up. When someone is feeling down in the dumps, telling them to look on the bright side won’t help, and compliments may just seem empty and fake.If your friend is upset about failing at something, it may be okay to remind them of their strengths in other areas. Don’t overdo it, though, and stay far away from false praise.
For instance, if your friend is upset about not getting into the college they wanted to attend, you could reassure them that they’re a great student and they aren’t defined by which college they go to. Don’t say they’re the best student in school if they’re not, though.

, Avoid talking about yourself and your own problems, even if you’ve faced similar issues as your friend. Derailing the conversation with a story about yourself won’t solve your friend’s problems – it will just make them feel like you aren’t listening to them., You can’t solve your friend’s problems for them, as much as you might want to. Offering advice might also make your friend feel like you’re brushing their feelings aside. Focus on helping them feel understood and supported instead.It’s fine to offer advice if your friend asks for it. Just don’t push your ideas on them when they’re feeling miserable.

"
Acknowledge their grief.,
Make yourself available.,
Ask how you can help.,
Be empathetic.,
Try to gently cheer them up.",How to Console an Inconsolable Friend1," One of the most important things you can do to console a friend is to acknowledge and legitimize their grief. Even saying something as simple as “I am so sorry for your loss” will let them know that you know that they’re dealing with something painful., Simply saying that you are there for them, whatever they need, is a great way of consoling your friend without being pushy. Just letting them know that you're there if they need you with an open invitation to listen to them vent or cry can help your friend know that they're not alone in their sadness.

, Something small like running an errand for them so they don’t have to worry about doing it or watching their kids so they can take a nap or have some down time can work wonders for their outlook and stress levels. If you ask how you can help and they say that you can’t, don’t be discouraged. Remember that your friend is hurting, and the fact that you even offered to help won’t go unnoticed.If you know of something you can do for your friend under the radar, then do it. For example, if your friend is struggling with bills after losing their job, then casually stop by with lunch one day. Under the guise of eating lunch, you can spend time with them to cheer them up and also subtly help them out by providing a meal when money is tight.

, Tell your friend that you empathize with their grief. Don’t tell them to just deal with it or get over it. Hurting their feelings while they’re down will only compound their sadness. Listen to them attentively, and say that while you aren’t in their shoes, you’re sorry for what they’re going through., Small gestures like stopping by your friend’s home with a meal or sending flowers to let them know you’re thinking of them are great ways to help console your friend. Avoid being pushy or implying that they should be grateful for your gestures. Simply making the effort to do something small to brighten their day can make a huge difference. Knowing you were thinking about them and you cared enough to act on it will mean a lot to them, even if they’re too sad to say so.


There's a fine line between trying to cheer your friend up with small, thoughtful gesture like a meal or flowers and bulldozing their feelings with forced positivity. They might not be at a place where they can feel happy, so don't force the issue if they still seem sad after your effort and don't take it personally.

Make sure you know just how drunk your friends want to get tonight.,
Make sure everyone is drinking water in between their alcoholic drinks.,
Ensure that everyone has a plan to get home.,
Take their alcohol away if they drank too much.,
Stop drinking too.,
Don't let your friends wander off.,
Give them water to drink.,
Consider leaving the party.,
Don't let a drunk friend go home/sleep/make out with someone random.,
Keep an eye on anything your friend drinks.",How to Deal with Drunk Friends at a Party," It is important to know how much alcohol your friends intend on drinking tonight, so that you can make sure that they don't end up more drunk than they would've wanted.
, It will take them longer to get drunk and they will feel less sick later on., If you are the designated driver, then don't drink anything. If you plan on calling a cab/Uber, make sure everyone has the money to pay., Allowing your friend to drink more will only make the problem worse, and might make them vomit. Take any alcohol that they still have in their hands away so that they cannot drink it when you aren't looking, and make sure that they are not getting more from anywhere else., You won't be much use to your friends if you are just as drunk as they are. Your friends need you right now, so don't drink anything else and put all of your focus on your friends for now., It is important to keep a close watch on them to ensure that they don't do anything stupid. Hold on to your friends, sit down with them, or follow them wherever they go. Although you might be tired of constantly running after them, it is better to keep an eye on them than to let them go and risk having them get themselves into trouble., If they are feeling sick and/or wanting to vomit, it will help them to feel better. Although water won't help them to sober up any faster, it will keep them hydrated and give them something to sip on if they are craving a drink., Although you might have been having a fun time, getting your friends home would be much safer for them than keeping them at a busy party. If your friends are out of control and/or feeling very sick and you think that they might be better off just heading home to get some rest, then consider just getting them home.

However, do not let any of your drunk friends drive home, and do not drive either if you have had anything to drink. It is far safer to just call a cab, an Uber, or another sober friend/family member to come and pick you up than to take the risk of driving yourself.

, Consent requires sobriety. If you notice someone trying to get your friend to go home with someone and/or have any sort of sexual contact with them, try and talk to your friend first, especially if this individual is a random girl/guy. It is best to think about what your friend would've wanted when they were sober.

If you know that your friend has a significant other or that they just didn't want to get with anyone tonight, then try and pull them aside to talk before they go with the other person. Also, this individual might be dangerous, and harm your friend, so it is best to just keep an eye on your friend instead of leaving him/her in the hands of someone you can't trust.

, You should always watch your friend's drinks whether they're drunk or not. However, it is way easier for someone to slip a drug into your friends drink if they are intoxicated. If your friend is still drinking, make sure you watch the drinks that they have and where they get them from."

Avoid making the situation about you.,
Do not try to fix it.,
Do not discount how your friend feels.,
Be emotionally present.,
Be physically present, if possible.",How to Console an Inconsolable Friend2," Regardless of your own personal experiences with grief or loss, don’t try to console your friend by talking about yourself. For example, if you lost a grandparent and your friend lost her mother, don’t attempt to make her feel better by talking about how you coped after your own loss. Your situations are not the same, and you each probably have different coping mechanisms., One of the worst ways to try to console a friend is to tell them how to easily fix their problem. If your friend is inconsolable, chances are that they’ve already considered possible options or scenarios before they got to this point. Even if you think you have a clear solution, they need to come to it on their own., It’s imperative that you don’t tell your friend that you think their reaction to their grief or loss is silly or irrational. Regardless of how you might deal with a similar situation, you must not tell your friend that their response is inappropriate.Simply telling your friend that whatever they're feeling is completely valid will go a long way in comforting them. Validating their feelings will help them emotionally and help them feel like someone understands what they're going through.

, Don’t avoid your friend. Avoiding contact with a friend that is hurting does not help their situation and will likely hurt their feelings even more. Going through a loss can be an isolating, lonely experience. Be sure that you are there, even if you don’t live near your friend.


A phone call, Skype call, or text message can go a long way to let them know that you’re thinking of them and care about their grief., People don’t always want to talk about what’s upsetting them. Sometimes, if you live close enough to your friend, simply being physically near someone can be comforting.


If appropriate, a hug or arm around a friend can speak volumes. Sitting quietly in their presence might be difficult, but just being physically present and sitting with them while they cry is a positive form of consolation.

Keep checking in.,
Pay close attention to subtle clues.,
Remember that there is no time frame for moving on.,
Suggest seeking professional help.,
Offer to help with the logistics of therapy.",How to Console an Inconsolable Friend3," If your friend appears to have moved on from their loss or grief, then that probably means that they are healing from their pain. However, it is still important to check on them to see how they’re doing. Don't assume they are doing better simply because they tell you that they are.

, Your friend might say they are doing better, but are they really doing well? Or are they covering up depression and simply trying to avoid people's pity or judgement? It's important to determine which is the case.


When you follow up with your friend look for clues about how they're really doing. Are they keeping their room or home reasonably clean? Are they showering? Are they doing as well in school or at work as they did before their grief? If not, they may not have fully moved on., Don’t burden your friend with your personal expectations for getting over grief. Whether it’s losing a loved one or losing a job, everyone copes differently and requires different lengths of time to move on from a loss.


Let your friend know that's it's perfectly fine to take as much time as they need to grieve. This is comforting because you aren't forcing an expectation that they need to ""get over it,"" this will help them feel supported during their grieving process.

, If you have tried to console your friend on multiple occasions over a long period of time, it might be time to suggest that they seek professional counseling. This is a sensitive subject, so it is vital to avoid sounding judgmental when you make this suggestion. Instead, express your concern that they don’t seem to be improving. See this article for tips on how to Choose a Therapist., Assisting with any obstacles to getting to therapy appointments, such as transportation or childcare during the appointment, is a great way to help your friend. If these concerns are taken care of, they are more likely to schedule and keep their appointment.

Assess the situation.,
Convince your friend to walk away.,
Get out of Dodge.",How to Convince a Friend to Walk Away," Look at the aggressor. Are there multiple aggressors? Observe your surroundings. Are there people watching? Are there others who could intervene? Chances are, there might be a cop who just happens to be watching. The cop will most likely intervene in this case. If so, he/she is most likely better trained than you, let him/her take it from there.;
, Think up of whatever you can to get them out of there ASAP. Tell them you need to talk to them in private. Or just flat out tell them to walk away. Trust your instinct on this one.


If your friend attacks. Most people looking to pick a fight will attempt to coerce the victim into throwing the first punch. If your friend moves towards the aggressor with a raised fist, firmly grab his/her wrist. If this isn't enough, restrain your friend in whatever way you can (if there's more than two of you, this will be easier). If they have something in their hand (i.e. knife, broken glass, etc.), take it off them. At this point, your friend will probably realize the impulsiveness of his/her actions.






If a fight occurs. All else has failed, and now your friend and the aggressor commence a full out brawl. Now its necessary to intervene. Your only concern now is to break up the fight.

Scenario A: Your friend is winning. If your friend is clearly winning the fight, pull him/her off the opponent. If the opponent is smart, they will most likely walk away at this point.






Scenario B: Your friend is losing. The opponent has your friend pinned to the ground, and you have to get your friend out of there! Your only option here is to attack the aggressor yourself. The attacker is distracted, leaving you with a free shot. The attacker might be stronger, but there are two of you, and only one of him. See more on how to fight









, However you resolve this situation, there's no reason to stick around, you're better off leaving. If the attacker leaves, chances are they might bring back a few friends of their own, and the last thing you need is multiple attackers.

Stop asking why he's upset.,

Just be present.,
When he talks, listen closely.,
Just listen, don't try to fix the problem.,

Encourage him to hang out with his male friends.,
Give him a change of scenery.,

Improvise.",How to Cheer a Guy Up," Guys will often need a little bit of time to cool off before they want to talk about what's bothering them. Look at it this way: If he's upset that you've noticed, you know enough. There's not much need to pinpoint it. Make yourself available to listen, but don't try to pry.Instead, say you noticed that he was upset. From there, your genuine concern will sometimes make a guy feel comfortable enough to come right out and say what's bothering him.
It's probably not about you. If it is, you'll probably make it worse by prying into the issue. If you want him to talk about it, give him a chance to cool down a while, and stay calm.;
, If your guy is still clamming up, show that you care and that you're there by talking about other things. Ask questions about your guy's day, talk about your own, and see if he starts to open up.


Talk about something he likes to talk about. If he's watching a game, give him a chance to rant for a while about what's going on. Show an interest in what he's interested in to help put him at ease. Even if you're not ""having the talk,"" you are.
Don't be pushy, but read the situation carefully. Some guys just need to be left alone for a few minutes to make the clear blue skies reappear, that's perfectly normal. Others need to vent, and that's also perfectly natural.

, Sometimes, you don't need to do anything special to help a guy cheer up but make yourself available. Just be there. Sit with him quietly and be together. Just watch a movie or relax, and let him process his grumpiness on his own. After a bit of silence, he may want to open up.


Pay attention to his body language, actual words, read the context you're in, and tone. Sometimes, now is just not the time to talk, and silence is a great tool. When there's silence, people feel like breaking the silence. Let him take his time, and let him steer the conversation.

, If he starts unloading, just sit and listen. Allow him to vent. Once he does that, he'll feel like a huge burden has been lifted which is really half the battle. From here, you'll start to see a change in his mood for the better.


Once he's expressed the problem, don't try to move on from it too fast. He'll feel like you weren't listening if you hop onto another subject. Acknowledge his words, genuinely, and let him know that you hear him.
Feeling like someone is listening to you makes you feel validated, and also helps you reflect on your thoughts. Gloomy days can often be caused by chaotic thoughts, and putting your thought into words helps with organizing them.

, Cheering up a guy is a big waiting game, a lot of the time. If you push too hard at trying to do ""cheery"" things, you're going to make him feel parented, or condescended to. It's not your job to try to fix his problems, or offer the optimistic solution. Just say, ""That sounds tough. I'm so sorry.""


If he asks specifically what you think he should do, voice your opinion if you have one. If not, try to suggest someone else that might be a good person to talk to about the issue.
Don't mother him. If you try to paste over his gloom with excessive cheeriness, you're likely to really turn off some guys. If you don't want to be around it, then go out. Go elsewhere, and leave him alone for a while to stew. Come back when he's more receptive to talking.

, All guys are different, and all problems require different distractions. For one guy, pro football tickets may be the cure-all for anything, while for others it would be a huge waste of money and time. Likewise,


If your guy is just grumpy after work and is really tired and hungry, just let him sit and eat for a while before worrying too much about what to do. He'll likely cheer up with a little unwinding time. More activities will likely make the problem worse.
If something more serious is going on, or if your guy can't seem to find his own way out of the rut, plan something yourself instead of waiting. Don't ask ""What do you feel like doing?"" a million times until he gets irritated. Instead, just say, ""I bought tickets to that movie. We're grabbing pizza before hand. Let's go.""

, Your guy's guys may have dealt with his tantrums many more times than you have. Likewise, if he is having problems with your relationship, it may be good for him to get it out with his guy friends, instead of talking to you about it. That's a healthy part of a functional relationship.


Plan something for him, if possible. Don't tell his friends the nitty gritty of what's exactly is happening to him. Say something vague like ""John seems a little down. Want to come over for the game this Sunday?""

, If the guy doesn't really feel like talking, suggest an activity that gets you out of the house and gets him focused on something else. Even if it's not an activity that he's a huge fan of, like going grocery shopping, it's still good to get the attention focused elsewhere.


Do some kind of chore you need to do together. Head to the store to pick up a few things and ask if he can come along to help. Don't require it, just ask. Find a good reason for him to come, like that you need help picking something out. Get his mind busy.
Try little things, like going for a walk, or getting ice-cream. Even just seeing if there's anything fun on TV can be some kind of distraction. Cue up a dumb meme or puppy vid from the Internet, if necessary.

, A little physical contact is extremely useful in helping to cheer someone up. Hugs stimulate the release of oxytocin in the brain, which promotes contentment and reduces anxiety and stress.A little physical contact can go a long way.


Warm touches to the upper back, and arm, are automatic charmers. It'll help ease the tension, and trigger endorphins to release, which ultimately will put him more at ease. If you're a couple and want to do more? Up to you.As grumpy as some men are on the outside, they want to be comforted and tended to, both emotionally and physically. If you know him well enough, you'll know what he likes, and what he doesn't.

, You know what they say about guys and their stomachs. If he loves chocolate-bacon, go get some at the store and surprise him. If you're tight on cash, whip up his favorite meal. Here are some useful dude-food meal options:


Chicken and waffles
Steak
Reuben sandwich
Biscuits and gravy
Lasagna
Pizza

, Is your guy a gamer? If you express an honest interest in something that he loves, he'll appreciate it a lot. Playing video games with him may help him to get his mind off his problems, even if it's just for a while, and help bring you closer together. You might even let him win a round or two.


If your guy isn't a gamer, pick something that the loves and do it together. He's obsessed with horror flicks, or baseball games? Sit through one and daydream. It'll mean a lot to him.

, Cheering someone up is hard work, and not everyone reacts to it the same way. In general, it's good to just give it time, and tailor your approach to the specific guy and situation. Nobody's happy-go-lucky all the time, that's just the way it is.

Approach the person.,
Provide support.,
Show empathy.,
Validate feelings.,
Let the person cry.,
Listen actively.,
Provide space if needed.",How to Console a Very Sad Person1," In order to help someone who is sad, you must be able to approach the person and begin a conversation. How you decide to approach the person will depend on your relationship with her.


Walk up to the person and engage her in conversation. You can begin by saying something like, “Hi. How are you doing?” If the person simply says, “fine,” you can say, “It seems like you are sad. Do you want to talk about it?” If she says no you must respect her decision to be alone; say something like, “I understand. I’m here for you if you want to talk.” You can try again to approach her later if you wish.;
, Communicate that you will be supportive of your friend or acquaintance.Tell the person that you truly care about her and her well-being and that you are there for her. Offer your help. You can say something like, “I know you are very sad and I just want to let you know that I am here for you.”
Ask her what you can do to help. You could say, ""I'd like to help in any way I can. Is there something I can do? We could talk about it if you want.""

, Part of being empathic is matching the other person’s affect or emotions. If they are sad, you should also look concerned. Try to feel the other person’s emotions and mirror them. You would not want to smile or laugh at a person who is crying or very sad.


Express warmth and understanding.Use physical touch such as a hug, or holding the person’s hand if you feel this is comfortable and appropriate.You can ask the person, “Can I give you a hug?”

, Many people experience sadness in the face of adversity; this can be a normal reaction to a very difficult situation.Validating or normalizing sadness can help the person gain acceptance over this emotion.You can say something like, “I understand why you are sad. It makes sense. This is such a difficult situation. I’m sorry that you are going through this.”
Do not tell the person not to feel her emotions. Never say anything like, “Don’t be sad.” This can be very invalidating.
Another way you can normalize feelings is by educating your friend about sadness, grief, and loss.You can explain that it is normal to feel denial, anger, and other grief reactions during these types of situations.

, Crying can actually increase our well-being by cleansing and releasing pent up emotions.Encourage your friend or family member to let her emotions out if she is inclined to do so.Simply sit with your friend while she is tearful. You can hand her a tissue, rub her back (if appropriate), or tell her to, “let it out.”
You can follow up by saying, “It’s okay to cry. Sometimes it is good to let those feelings out.”
Avoid saying things like, “Please don’t cry.” This is sending the signal that it is not okay for her to let her emotions out and that you feel uncomfortable with her sadness.

, Active listening is about focusing solely on the other person and her experience. Try not to think about the next thing you are going to say and simply listen to everything the person is saying.


Ask clarifying questions to show that you are being attentive. An example is, “I’m hearing that you are very sad because you lost your dog and you want to find him, is that right?”

, Be respectful of your friend’s space and wishes. If she does not want to talk about what is bothering her anymore, you can begin helping her feel better and doing other activities with her.


To show that you are understanding of her need for space you can say, ""I understand if you do not want to talk or if you want to be left alone. I'm here for you if you do want to talk or spend time together.""

Be positive and hopeful.This means not letting the person’s sadness get you down.,
Give a gift.,
Assist in changing negative thinking.Sometimes people can have negative (and untrue) thoughts that increase sadness or guilt.,
Problem-solve.",How to Console a Very Sad Person2," You need to be able to regulate your own emotions and not become overwhelmed yourself, otherwise you won’t be able to help your friend very much.


Take a break from the conversation if you need a minute to re-group. Perhaps excuse yourself to go to the bathroom. Take deep breaths, or let some of your emotions out if you need to.

, According to the 5 love languages, many people enjoy receiving gifts as ways to show love and support.This can go a long way in cheering someone up who is sad and it shows that you are thoughtful and supportive.


Give a gift such as flowers, a card, or her favorite candy.
If you are lacking in finances, you can write her a loving letter or make her a home-made gift (art, etc).

, For example, some individuals may tend to personalize events or situations, which can create unnecessary negative emotions.An example might be if your friend says, “It’s my fault that Fido ran away.” Help your friend re-direct these types of thoughts by offering alternatives and calming disagreeing with her. You could say something such as, ""You love Fido and do everything you can to take care of him. Maybe he just got out somehow and couldn't find his way home.""
Some people might have negative thoughts that try to predict the future such as if your friend says, “I’m never going to find Fido.” This is an incorrect thought because she cannot predict what will happen. You can gently say something like, “Isn’t it possible that you will still find him? I have hope that we might be able to get him back.”
Avoid blaming others.Encourage your friend to focus on what she can do about the situation instead of thinking too much about how others may have contributed to the issue; this can increase anger and reduce her ability to think logically and problem-solve.

, When people are very sad they can sometimes have difficulty thinking rationally and working toward solutions to their problem. Encourage your friend to look at her emotions as information. Her sadness is telling her that something is wrong and might need to be resolved.Then, you can help her come up with possible solutions and work toward them.


For example, if your friend lost her dog, you can say, “Let’s work on a solution together. What do you think we should do first?”
Offer possible solutions. For instance, you could say, “I have an idea, why don’t we start calling local shelters to see if anyone has found him.”

Encourage positive coping.,
Distract the person.Many times people can get caught up in ruminating, or overthinking, negative thoughts and get stuck in an emotion.Help your friend distract herself in order to reduce rumination.,
Spend quality time together.",How to Console a Very Sad Person3," Help your friend find healthy coping resources. Coping skills are ways to deal with negative feelings and situations. This way, she can express herself or heal without causing herself more harm.Some examples of positive ways of coping with sadness include: spiritual or religious activities, creative exercises (art), nature-related activities, exercise, and mindfulness or meditation.
Avoid drinking alcohol or using substances to excess with your friend or family member.This can be harmful and does not promote healthy coping or a reduction in sadness. In order to discourage using drugs or alcohol to cope you can educate your friend and offer alternatives by saying, ""I've read that coping by using alcohol can create more problems and decrease your ability to deal with your emotions and the situation. What if we watch a funny movie together instead?""

,


Some helpful distracting or grounding techniques include: watching a happy movie, listening to cheerful music, dancing, naming colors or objects in the room, and playing a game.

, Spending time with your friend can help to console her and promote a sense of social support.Support is crucial to helping someone overcome sadness.


Do creative activities together such as painting, drawing, playing musical instruments, writing song together, making candles, etc.

, Find somewhere that they are able to let out all their pain, frustration, confusion, etc.


Find somewhere that has no or few people so that your friend doesn’t have to worry about anyone unwanted seeing them upset and so you don’t disturb anyone. This may mean going to another room, outside, etc.
If needed, find somewhere safe where your friend can release their feelings without getting hurt or damaging anything.You may need to go to a room that doesn’t have a lot furniture or an open space outside.
If you are on the phone with your friend, ask them are they somewhere that they feel safe and comfortable. If not, and if possible, go pick them up and take them somewhere else.

, As long as they are not hurting themselves or damaging property, allow them to work out what they are feeling. Your friend is relying on you to be there for them in their time of need.


If necessary, give them space to safely release any physical tension they may be feeling.
Try not to tell them to stop crying, or yelling, etc. unless it seems that they are getting more upset.
If you are on the phone with them, just listen and wait while they release their emotions. Occasionally, say things like, “I’m here for you” so that they will know you are still on the line.

, Sometimes people will say they are okay, but their body language tells a different story. Certain body signs can be indicators of your friend’s distress. Body language can tell you that you may need to help them calm down before they can tell you what happened.


Sometimes body language is obvious. For example, are they crying? Are they sweating or shaking? Is your friend punching the air or pacing the room?
Sometimes body language can be more subtle. Is their body tense or rigid? Hands clinched? Is their jaw tightened? Are their eyes red or puffy as if they were recently crying?

, This way, you can listen attentively to your friend without being interrupted or having to focus on anything else.


It may be difficult for your friend to tell you what’s wrong if there are a lot of distractions for you and them.
Try to go somewhere quiet, if you aren’t already in a quiet place.
Turn off your electronic devices or at least put them on silent mode. It can be distracting when your phone is beeping, pinging, and ringing every few seconds.

, Let your friend know that nothing is more important to you than them right now.


Try to clear your mind so that you aren’t thinking about anything that might distract you. Focus on just listening to your friend and taking in what they are telling you.
Use your body language to let them know they have your attention. Turn towards them. Look at them.
Tell them that they have your attention. Try saying, “You have my full attention and I’m here for you.”

, Calmly, ask your friend what is going on or what happened. For example, you might say, “I want to know what has you so upset. Please tell me what’s wrong.” Or even, “What’s going on? What happened?”

, Forcing them is more likely to make them bottle their feelings up. It could also cause them to become upset again or upset them even more.


Assure them that you are there when they are ready to talk about it, and create trust.
Try saying something like, “There’s no rush, I’m here for you. You can tell me when you are ready.”
Sit quietly with them until they are ready to talk to you.
Your friend may also make small talk while they are building up their courage to tell you what happened.

, They may not immediately want to tell what is going on, but, if you give them a little time, they will eventually open up to you on their own.

, It is very likely that your friend needs to talk about what happened (or is happening) and how they feel about it. When they do decide to open up, let them talk about their situation and their feelings.


Listen to what your friend is saying, as well as how it is being said. A lot of times the way someone says something can tell you as much as what they say.
Try not to interrupt a lot or make them feel rushed. Sometimes it is hard for people to talk about the things that are upsetting them.
Think about what they are telling you, not how you are going to respond to what they are saying.

, If you don’t understand something, in a sensitive way, ask your friend to explain more or repeat what they said.


This can help you really understand what happened that has your friend upset.
You can say things like, “So what you’re saying is…” or “So, in other words, what happened was…”
This also lets your friend know you are truly listening and care about what they are telling you.

, For example, if they say ""I'm worthless"" or ""I don't deserve to be happy"", turn it around and say ""Of course you deserve to be happy!"" and/or ""You aren't worthless; look at how many people love you and care about you. I love you and care about you too.""

, Telling someone about a similar or worse situation, reminding them that it could be worse, or that things are worse for some people may seem like a good idea, but it can do more harm than good.

It can make your friend feel like you really don’t understand or care how bad the situation is making them feel.
It can sound like you are calling them a “crybaby” or implying that they are upset over nothing.Instead, say things like, “I can understand that you are upset” or “I see why you are upset”.

, Unless it is an emergency or they ask you for help in doing so, refrain from telling them how you would handle the situation. Most often, people just want someone to listen to them.

, If your friend has been the victim of abuse or a crime, let them know you would like to contact the appropriate authorities so that they can receive the proper help.If they don’t want to, then don’t press it. That might cause them to become more upset. Let it go for now.
Try to discourage them from doing anything that could disturb or destroy evidence of the incident (for example, deleting texts, taking a shower or bath, etc.).
When it seems okay, bring up going to the authorities again. Let your friend know there are professionals that can protect them (if needed) and help them cope with what happened.
You can try saying,”I really think we need to talk to about this. They can help you get through this. Why don’t we call them together?”

, Give them appropriate verbal and physical support. Be loving and let them cry on you if they want to.


First, make sure your friend is okay with physical contact! For example, you might say, “Is it okay if I give you a hug?” or “Is it all right if I hold you?”.
Physical contact can be very comforting, but ask your friend if they are okay with hugging, cuddling, or any other type of touching before you do it.
Contact can make people feel better, but if they don't want it, don't do it.

, Sometimes just sitting quietly, whether it is in prayer or meditation or not, can help calm people and provide some comfort.

, Doing something active and physical can help your friend release negative physical energy. This can help calm your friend down or distract them from the situation for a moment.


For example, take a brief walk, jog, go for a swim, or bike ride.
Do yoga, tai chi, or some simple stretching.

, Sometimes, the only thing you can do is try to keep your friend from thinking about what is bothering them.


Offer, or just take them, to do something that they like. Go for ice cream or a movie.
Get them involved in a project, for example, sorting clothes to donate or gardening.
Find something humorous like a funny meme, video clip, etc. to try to lighten your friend’s mood a bit.

Educate yourself.,
Keep it confidential.,
Let them know you are there for them.,
Offer to help in specific, practical ways.,
Let your friend vent about the emotional aspects of the diagnosis.,
Direct your friend to support services.,
Encourage treatment.,
Take care of yourself, too.,
Help your friend deal with stigma.,
Be there for your friend if they choose to disclose their diagnosis with others.,
Honor your friend by making contributions to related charities or registering for an AIDS walk.",How to Be Supportive of a Friend With HIV," There are many myths surrounding the disease, and the first thing to do is understand the basic facts about HIV to best help your friend cope with the side effects:HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, meaning it affects the body’s immune system and its ability to fight off disease. HIV can develop into AIDS.
There is no cure for HIV, but scientists have developed medication that allows people with HIV to live long and healthy lives.
HIV is spread through sexual contact, needle-sharing, or from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy.
HIV cannot be contracted through normal day-to-day contact, insect bites, kissing, coughing, or sharing utensils.;
, If your friend confided in you, it means they trust you. Don’t break that trust by telling other people without their consent. Your friend’s medical information is personal and private.

, Understand what works best for your friend and try to help them out in the most natural way possible. Don’t try to change too much in the way you interact with them - remember that they are still the same person, and that the HIV has not changed them.


Start by asking “Do you feel like talking about it?” to let them know you are there if they want to talk.Don’t try to ignore the topic all together, because they may think you are ashamed to talk about it. If they don’t want to talk, that’s okay - don’t force it. They may want to forget about it for a while. Spend time with them doing things that you would normally do when hanging out together. Take them out to the movies or plan a weekend of activities to take their mind off of it.
If they do want to talk, talk about the disease in an open and honest way. Follow your friend’s lead. Ask them questions to show them you are engaged and interested to learn more in order to help them throughout the process. It may also help them to feel less self-conscious, ashamed, or embarrassed., Instead of saying “let me know if there is anything I can do,” which is vague and requires them to reach out to you first, try to pinpoint specific ways in which your assistance may be most valuable.For example, if they have to miss a day of class, take notes from them during lecture and bring it to them afterwards. Offer them a ride to and from their doctor’s appointments. Help run errands or go grocery shopping with them.
If you are still having trouble figuring out how you can help, ask them specifically what they could use; let them tell you what would be most helpful. Try saying something like, “I have a lot of free time on my hands right now and I would love to help you out in any way I can. Is there something I can do to take some things off your plate?” Keep checking in with them regularly.

, The stress that comes with learning of an HIV diagnosis often manifests itself in a variety of different emotions, like anger and sadness. Let your friend know it’s okay to let those emotions out.


Ask them how they are doing when spending time with them one-on-one, to give them the opportunity to talk on a more personal level.
Be a good listener. Sometimes just being there for them to confide in is the best kind of support.
Be careful not to nag them about talking about their diagnosis, however. If they don’t feel like talking about it, leave it - they may want to get their mind off of it for a while.

, Your friend’s diagnosis may lead to anxiety, depression, or substance abuse, in which case professional, outside help might be helpful. Examples include seeing a psychologist or therapist, or signing up for a support group.


It can be hard to bring up the subject of therapy and counseling. Start out by saying, “I’ve noticed you’ve been more lately, and I’m worried about you. Have you ever considered talking to a psychologist?”If you’ve ever done counseling, it may help to share your own experiences about how it helped you to make them feel less embarrassed and scared.
If they agree to see a professional, the act of reaching out to a therapist might be the hardest step. Try researching some support services in your area or seeing if anyone has any recommendations. Then, provide your friend with a name and number of someone they could contact. Just be sure to honor your friend’s privacy when you ask for recommendations., When HIV is caught early and a patient follows ART (antiretroviral therapy), it can keep the virus under control and prevent it from progressing into AIDS or spreading to others.Make sure they see a doctor and adhere to their medication. It is important for your friend to take their medication every day, exactly as prescribed. If they are forgetful, ask if you can help by giving reminders about medications and appointments, or offer to drive them to the doctor’s office., It can be hard having a friend with a HIV because you often feel very attached to their emotions - when they are sad, you feel sad too. The best way to support someone else is to first make sure you are in a good place personally.


Try to stay in tune with your own emotions. If you are feeling run down, it’s okay to take a break from being with your friend and take some time for yourself.
Do not put the entire burden of supporting your friend on your own shoulders. You are likely part of a bigger support system - like your friends’ parents, siblings, and other friends. Talk to them! It is likely they are feeling the same way as you and it can help to talk things out with them if you need to.
If your sexual partner has been diagnosed with HIV, you may need to think about getting tested yourself and make sure you are engaging in safe sex practices.

, Many people have misconceptions about HIV and view the disease as disgraceful or taboo. This may lead to your friend feeling isolated or ashamed of having HIV, even if no one knows about their diagnosis.


Remind your friend of all the successful people, such as famous actors or athletes (i.e. Magic Johnson), who are living with HIV and have disclosed their status to promote awareness and break down the stigma.Help your friend find personal stories from others living with HIV from online blogs and websites. These can be very comforting and empowering.In the case that your friend’s HIV status is public, they may be insulted, rejected, gossiped about, or excluded from social activities. If you see this happening to them, stand up for them. Remind them that the bullies are probably just ignorant about HIV. Explain to the bullies, in a kind and patient way, that your friend has not changed as a result of the diagnosis and educate them about the misconceptions that they might have about HIV. Set an example by spending time with your friend in public, or eating lunch with them at school.If you feel like things are getting out of hand or you can’t stand up to the bullies alone, don’t hesitate to involve a teacher or other adult who knows of your friend’s health condition. Even if they don’t, you can still report the bullying without disclosing their HIV status., Telling people about their HIV status can be a nerve-racking experience, especially if they don’t know how others will react. Offer to be there when they share the news with someone if it makes them feel more comfortable.


It will also give you the opportunity to provide advice to the other person on how they can be a supportive friend, as well.

, Round up your friends and do it together. Not only will it show your friend you care, it will help raise funds for prevention and awareness services in your area. Again, in the spirit of confidentiality, don’t mention your friend’s name unless they say it’s okay.

Don’t stay long.",How to Bring Food to a Friend in Need," While cookies, muffins, and snacks are great housewarming gifts, people in need will benefit most from a main meal. This is especially true if children are a part of the family. Bring a main dish so that those eating will be full without needing another meal.For example, bring a casserole, lasagna, or hearty soup.;
, Now might not be the time to experiment in the kitchen with a new recipe. Make something you know is delicious and that you’ve made before with positive feedback. Stick with a meal you know and are comfortable making. While you might want to make some changes or add some ingredients, don’t make any drastic changes.Choose something tried and tested that most people generally enjoy. For example, make lasagna, chili, or pizza.

, If your friend is a vegetarian, don’t send them a meal with meat in it. Inquire about any food allergies or dietary restrictions before you begin preparing food. You may ask your friend or someone close to them if they have any food sensitivities or food restrictions.Avoid common food allergens (like peanuts and shellfish) and other polarizing foods that people seem to either love or hate (like olives and fish).
For example, don’t bring anything spicy if you suspect they do not like spicy food.

, Your friend may love a certain type of cuisine, like noodles or spicy foods. Show your thoughtfulness by sending them their favorite foods. For example, if they love soup, make (or buy) soup you know they enjoy. If they have a taste for pizza, bring some by.


Likewise, stay clear of foods they dislike or may not enjoy. For example, make warming foods on an especially cold night.

, Don’t bring a meal that’s messy or difficult to eat or put together. For example, a DIY taco night might be fun, but it also might include lengthy setup or cleanup afterward. Keep your meals easy to eat and easy to clean up after.Finger foods might be more difficult to keep clean up after, so aim to serve something that requires utensils.
If serving food to children, keep it relatively mess-free. For example, if you include sauces, make sure they won’t stain clothing.

, Hold off on meals that require lots of pieces or separate items or dishes. Keep your meal simple and easy to move. As much as possible, keep everything self-contained or all together. Any assembly should be fairly simple and straightforward.Keep delicate dishes for another time. If you care greatly how it looks or that it is presented a certain way, try something simpler or easier.
For example, don’t bring a liquid soup that can spill easily. If you do bring soup, make sure it is secured and unable to spill at any point during transport.

, If you know your friend will be eating the meal once you bring it, drop it off hot and ready. Cook and prepare the meal ahead of time and if needed, heat it briefly when you drop it off at their house. Keep any work your friend or their family has to do minimal.You might want to help get their table or eating area ready. Place utensils, glasses, and plates on the table to minimize meal preparation for your friend.

, If you send something and your friend isn’t prepared to eat it quite yet, make sure it’s easy to stick in the freezer (or fridge) and eat another day reheated. Some examples of fridge or freezer meals might include casseroles, soups or stews, or ravioli.Pack it into a container that’s not too large or bulky. It should be able to be easily stacked or tucked away in a fridge or freezer.

, Don’t ask for containers back if you can avoid it. Instead, prepare and pack your food in containers that your friend can keep and reuse. Clearly let the person know you don’t need (or want) the containers back.It can be stressful to sort out people’s containers and who sent what, so keep it simple.

, Let the person know that food is on the way. Giving a heads up can ensure that someone will be there to accept the food and that they will be around to enjoy it. If you’re a part of a train of people bringing meals, make sure you know when to drop it off and to whom.The person may need to make room in the fridge or make other arrangements, so it’s always best to give some warning.

, Even if you’ve checked with food sensitivities beforehand, it doesn’t hurt to send a list of ingredients for anyone else who is enjoying the meal. Say how to reheat it (“Place it in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 degrees” or “Reheat in the microwave for 3 minutes”) and how to store it (in the fridge or freezer).For example, attach a piece of paper with the ingredients and any other special instructions with the meal or tape it to the sides of the container.

, Along with the meal, say something thoughtful or sweet in a note. This can show how much you care and support them. It might be a note of encouragement, something silly to make them laugh, or a thoughtful line to let them know they are in your thoughts. After the meal is gone, your kindness and thoughtfulness will be remembered.Say something simple, such as “Thinking of you” or, “I hope you recover quickly.”

, Along with your meal, include something that can be placed in the pantry or used over and over again. For example, include a jar of applesauce, box of crackers, or other staple items that can be snacked on or prepared easily.For example, if you know your friend enjoys bagels, throw in a bag of bagels with your meal.

, You may wish to stay and visit, but take any cues that your friend or their family want privacy. If you want to stay and talk, ask before you come over whether you can stay or whether you should schedule for another time. Your friend might be exhausted, so drop off your meal then be on your way.Consider making time to talk when they are feeling good and not stressed.

Urge them to get help if they are having suicidal thoughts.",How to Comfort Someone," It might seem simple, but asking someone what is bothering them if it isn’t already clear could be exactly what they need. They may have been struggling with something all day and wishing someone would reach out to them and ask what’s wrong. Be there for them and be the first to break the ice.If you already know what’s wrong, you might ask the person to elaborate on it. Ask, “How do you feel?” or “What do you think about that?”;
, Even if you want to chime in and offer your feedback or opinion on their problems, try to keep them to yourself. People who are upset don’t necessarily want to hear opinions or advice. More often than not, they simply need empathy and understanding.Don’t suggest alternative solutions or tell them what to do. If they are already upset, they likely won’t find comfort in suggestions to keep dealing with whatever is bothering them. Instead, just try to listen and let them get it all off their chest.

, One of the best things you can say to someone who is upset is: “That’s really upsetting, and I’m sorry you’re dealing with that.” Letting them know that their pain is legitimate can help them feel comforted.Try not to tell them that everything will be okay, or that things will work out eventually. For all you know, things won’t be okay, or they won’t work out. When comforting someone in crisis, just validating their negative feelings can help them get past those feelings, without offering them any false promises. Tell them, “You’re right to feel how you do.”
Say something like, “It’s okay to cry. What you’re going through is hard, and if you need to be upset, you should let yourself be.”

, Rather than simply trying to banish their negative feelings, try and have them explore those feelings and get them out, instead. Telling someone who is upset to calm down or get over it likely won’t help them feel any better.Telling someone to calm down or urging them to brush off whatever is making them upset will only push the problem under the rug, so to speak. It won’t help them address it and work towards resolving or getting past it in a healthy way.
It might be your first instinct to try and avoid an awkward situation—especially if the upset person is crying. But, if someone is being vulnerable and open with you, you should do the same in return, rather than trying to avoid it.

, Rather than telling them that you’ve been in their position, or even that you’ve been through something worse, let the moment be theirs. Be there as support rather than to compare your own struggles to theirs.Instead of making it about you, say something like “I’m really sorry you’re going through this. Is there anything I can do?”

, When listening, respond now and then with affirmative noises, like “mmmhmm,” to let the person know you’re considering everything they’re saying. Let them know you’re there to listen, and that you care.If you ask someone what’s bothering them and they don’t want to share, simply letting them know you’re there if they need you to be can be just as comforting as listening. Tell them, “Even if you don’t want to talk right now, I’ll be here when you do.”

, Sometimes, people just need to sit with their sadness. It’s not a bad thing to let someone feel their feelings. Allowing the person to cry on your shoulder, or even just sitting quietly beside them can help them feel comforted, even without speaking.If you’ve ever been really upset, you might have felt like you wanted to be alone, or like you didn’t really want to talk about what was bothering you. You probably know from experience that someone just letting you know you could talk if you needed to, but not pushing it on you, was all the comfort you needed.

, Sometimes, getting up and moving while talking things over can be a little less intimidating or awkward than simply sitting face to face. Offer to get up and leave the situation. Offer to go for a walk, or to go get some coffee. Moving to a new place might also help them feel more calm or relaxed.A change of scenery can be helpful. Try suggesting something like, “Would you like to go for a walk and get a cup of coffee? I think some fresh air could be helpful. We can talk on the way there.”

, When someone is upset, they aren’t exactly in the best state of mind to make any decisions, especially regarding what’s upsetting them. Don’t encourage them to do anything or to take action with the situation. Encourage them instead to take some time to think things through and calm down before making any decisions.If your friend’s significant other just left them, for example, don’t encourage them to find someone new right away, or to say nasty things about their ex. Instead, let them vent, validate their feelings, and encourage them to take some time to settle before taking any further action.

, If someone is going through a tough time, one easy way to comfort them is to do something nice for them, like bringing them something to eat, running an errand for them, or even just offering them a hug.


If your friend has children or pets, offer to take care of them while your friend takes some time to themselves. If they’re feeling busy or overwhelmed, ask how you can be of help., If your friend has been sad or depressed for a long period of time, they may not be suffering from something acute. Make sure you watch for signs of depression in your friend if this happens.


Signs of depression can include prolonged hopelessness, changes in appetite, sleeping too much or feeling tired often, a clear loss of interest in things they used to like (like spending time with friends), poor self-esteem, and even irritability., If you notice your friend seems to be upset for a prolonged period of time, speak up and ask them what’s going on. Ask them how they have been feeling and how they’re doing. Ask them if they’ve had any major changes in their lifestyle lately. Keep communication open.You might also ask your friend what things seem to make them feel better, and what things seem to make the situation feel worse. Not only will this help you find things to comfort them with, but it will also help you know what things to avoid.

, If your friend is showing signs of depression, encourage them to seek counseling or therapy. If you educate yourself on the issue, you will be better equipped to offer some suggestions on what steps they could take to help themselves get healthy.Some resources might even be online groups where your friend could seek anonymous help from people suffering from similar issues. This might be a better option if they aren’t very receptive to the idea of therapy, or to in-person support groups.

, If your friend expresses any suicidal thoughts or ideations, direct them to a suicide hotline or to the nearest hospital. You should always take these kinds of threats seriously, and do what you can to get your friend the help they need when they are in crisis.The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached 24/7 at 1-800-273-8255. There is also a Crisis Text Line; simply text “START” to 741-741 (in the US) and you will be connected with a trained volunteer."

Build a repertoire before inviting him anywhere.,
Ask him to connect on social media.,
Initiate a few conversations with him about common interests.,
Keep your first encounters casual and let them end naturally.",How to Get a Guy to Be Your Friend1," Asking a guy you’ve never spoken to out on a “friend date” is risky, since his first instinct will likely be that you are hitting on him. He may have never had a platonic female friend, western media offers little advice on opposite-sex friendships and almost no examples.Start by saying “hi” and making an observational statement relative to the situation.


Comment on the weather or how busy it is in the store, for example.
If he is in your class, ask him about a homework assignment or what he thought about a test.
Be sure that you approach him naturally, without seeming to find an excuse to speak to him. If you have to go out of your way to have any interaction, reflect on your motives.
On TV and in movies, guys and girls are rarely simply “friends,” because at least one of them feels a romantic attraction for the other.You might have to have several short, informal interactions to get past any doubts about your motives.;
, Nearly everyone participates in some type of social media site, and gaining access to each other’s profiles will tell you more about each other.This is especially useful if you are not sure that you two would really get along but want to explore the possibility.It is also a casual way to ask someone to start a relationship without any pressure or commitment.

, There was a reason you approached him in the first place. After finding something to talk about during initial meetings, the next step in forming a solid friendship is building on these brief interactions with in-depth conversations about your shared interests.Consider where you usually see him. Does he share one of your hobbies, shop at the same store, run at the same park?
If you see him at a concert, for example, ask him later what he thought of it, or for suggestions about similar groups to check out.
If you both take guitar lessons at the same shop, start with a question about what he is currently learning to play, or how he motivates himself to practice everyday.
If your first attempt at engaging him doesn’t pan out, don’t be discouraged. Unless you both love the same obscure band playing in your town this weekend, it will probably take a few conversations to figure out what your first ‘friend date’ could be.

, Don’t try to force longer contact by continuing to press him on interests he isn’t responding to or by repeatedly changing the direction of the conversation.


Limit your questions to two or three topics. You don’t want to appear desperate to continue talking to him or to find something you have in common.
Unless you get into an in-depth discussion about a topic you both really care about, limit your interactions to 5 or 10 minutes.

"
"
Approach him when he’s alone, not with a group of his friends.,
Ask him to do something specific.,
Make it clear that you want a friendship, not a relationship.,
Don’t take it personally if he turns you down the first time.",How to Get a Guy to Be Your Friend2," Your goal is to break down the stereotypical standards of behavior for inter-sex communication, since you are asking for a “friend date” and not a romantic date.


He might feel peer pressure if his friends are there to treat you like a potential love interest, or to assume that you are hitting on him. The presence of other people might create anxiety for one or both of you. If you are anxious, your request to hang out as friends might unintentionally come off as insincere.

, Instead of approaching the subject of hanging out together from the perspective of having compatible personalities, ask him to join you at a concert for a band you have been talking about, or to go ride all the roller coasters at the nearest amusement park. .Avoid statements like, “I think we should be friends,” or “We have a lot in common and should hang out sometime.” These expressions imply saying yes to a “friend date” means committing to be in your life long-term.
Telling him you like his personality and want to spend time together might put him on the defensive by sounding too much like a romantic interest.
Keep your request casual. Don’t excessively explain why you want to hang out with him or offer too many choices of activities to share.
Instead of saying, “Let’s go to a concert together sometimes,” you can say, “I’m going to see________ play this Friday. Want to come?”

, When people are shown interest by someone of the opposite sex, they tend to consider whether or not they are being hit on.Avoid any inclination to flirt just because he is a guy. Treat him the same as you would a girl you want to befriend.


Watch your tone of voice to ensure you are speaking like you do to your other friends. Girls tend to speak in a higher voice and talk more quickly when flirting with a new person.Avoid touching him or entering his personal space. With the exception of a handshake or high five, don’t initiate physical contact since it is a universal sign of flirting.If you already have a significant other, state that up front to express that you are not available for dating and just want to be friends.#* If you get the impression that he is attracted to you or thinks it’s a date, be direct and tell you are only looking for companionship, not a boyfriend.It is less likely to feel like a “date” if you invite him to join a group of friends., Another advantage to asking him to do something specific, rather than just spending time together, is that it allows him the choice to decline without feeling bad or worrying about offending you.Negative feelings are no way to start a friendship!


Saying no doesn’t mean that he has no interest in hanging out with you. He may have another engagement that day. He might have had a bad experience at the club where your favorite band is playing and not want to go there.
Perhaps he is very hesitant about starting new relationships too quickly due to past experiences with failed friendships. Respect his right to say no, and don’t assume it means he isn’t interested in doing something else at another time.
Don’t push him by inviting him somewhere else immediately. Wait until you have another encounter with him to explore other possible mutual interests."
"
Go out in groups more often than alone.,
Focus your conversations on outside stimuli, not your emotions.,
Avoid discussing your romantic relationships with each other.,
Limit displays of affection or physical contact.,
Dress appropriately and avoid revealing or tight clothes.,
Be honest and direct with him.If you get the feeling he might want to change your friendship into a dating situation, acknowledge your concerns and remind him that you value your friendship and don’t want to change it.

",How to Get a Guy to Be Your Friend3," Companions, or casual friends, typically spend only a couple hours together every week.It’s okay to spend more time with him than that, but people will assume something else is going on if you are always alone together.

, Talking about your feelings is something that only girls typically do. Guys do not discuss their emotions or personal thoughts with other guys often, if at all. Although having a platonic female friend may offer him a chance to do so, make sure it’s the exception and not the rule.


Sharing feelings establishes intimacy, and it is difficult to maintain romantic indifference to someone you feel really ‘gets’ you.
Specifically avoid talking about your appearance or other friendships.

, Guys can’t talk about relationship issues with their guy friends and may see an opportunity to do so with you. But sharing doubts and struggles about your romantic relationships with another member of the opposite sex blurs the line between being friends and thinking about each other romantically. Save these talks for your girlfriends.


If he needs to talk to someone and has no one else, be a good friend by listening, but resist the urge to give advice. He may start wondering if you are trying to replace his girlfriend.
Encourage him to talk to her about their issues instead by explaining why girls crave this type of intimacy with romantic partners. Be sure to do it from the perspective of his own growth and emotional development, not from any opinions about the girl he is dating., Guy friends don’t hug each other every time they get together. Touching him often feels like intimacy, even if you don’t mean it that way, and may either create anxiety that you might want to date, or make him think about you as a potential partner. Don’t treat him like a stand-in boyfriend., You have a right to feel comfortable in how you look and what you wear, but remember that your guy friend is still a guy. If he hasn’t thought of you as a potential girlfriend yet, dressing provocatively could bring up new feelings.

Let things happen naturally.,
If she turns you down, be understanding.,
Text her soon, but keep it short.,
Start slow.,
Know when to call her.,
Gauge her responses.",How to Get a Girl's Number as a Teen," Say hello and strike up a conversation. Introduce yourself and ask questions about her. If things don't go well, try sparking up another conversation with her later. Do your best to keep her engaged.


Getting to know her is the first step. Some people say that you should ask for a girl's number before they've even spoken with her for more than two minutes. However, this usually only works well if you know that you won't see her again for a long while.
Spend some time with her and befriend her, but don't hang around her all the time and abandon your friends (or keep her from hers). If she feels like she's giving her number to a (non-clingy) friend and not a potential boyfriend/girlfriend, she may feel more comfortable about giving you her number. Be careful about setting up too much of a platonic relationship.;
, If she thinks you're creepy or dangerous, she won't want to give you her number. Be genuine and kind. If she gives you her number, she's giving you a key to her life, and she's giving you the chance to get to contact her anywhere – so make sure that you are worthy of that trust., The more deeply you talk with her, the more likely she will be to want to give you her number. Try to find out more about her: who she is, what she likes to do, why she likes to do it. Before you ask for her number, you should find out if the two of you even like to talk to each other.


One way to keep things going is to ask if you can walk with her; another is to sit next to her in class. Whatever tactic you use, make sure she's enjoying the conversation as much as you are.
If she isn't responsive, take a hint and leave her alone for a while. See if she comes to you. If she doesn't engage, then don't force it. Don't worry if she doesn't talk to you; it happens to everyone.

, Most girls will appreciate it if you have the courage to talk to them. Confidence does not mean that you must put girls down, or act like you're better – it means simply that you are able to treat them as people rather than placing them on a pedestal.

, You don't need to ask for a girl's number right away. Asking her for her number immediately when you meet her—or even after just a couple days of talking in class—could come across as too forward, and you might turn her off. Learn to feel when the time is right.


It may be time to ask for her number if you're talking a lot, she seems interested, and you're beginning to make plans to hang out together. If you're making a plan to hang out in a casual setting (outside of school, work, church, or any group), it's the perfect opportunity to ask for her number so that you can coordinate more easily.
You may want to hold off on asking for her number if she seems hesitant, or if you haven't been talking to her for very long. Find a good reason to ask, whether that reason is to continue a conversation or to invite her to hang out. Don't ask for her number just for the sake of having her number.

, Tell her you would like to meet up and get to know her better. If you're feeling cool and confident, and she's enjoying herself with you, chances are she'll say yes and give you her number.


Try to be clear about it. Don't stutter, don't hesitate, and don't beat around the bush. Just say, ""Hey, can I have your number?""
Don't have anyone else do it for you. Don't ask her friend for her number. If you're going to impress her and do it right, you need to work up the courage to ask her yourself.

, Asking for a girl's number should not feel like a big deal; it should feel natural. Don't build it up in your head beforehand. A phone number isn't automatically going to change everything: it's possible to date a girl without ever getting her number, and it's possible to get a girl's number when she doesn't terribly want to date you. Try not to draw the process out or make it more complicated than it needs to be. Don't make her think twice about giving you her number.

, If you're uncomfortable asking for her number, try to find a legitimate purpose for asking. ""Hey, can I have your number so that we can ____?"" Having someone's phone number makes planning and coordinating things much easier. Even if you're making plans to hang out with her in a group, having her number might help. Once you have her number, you can always text her about other things – like hanging out.


If you've made plans to study with her, ask for her number to make it easier. Say, ""Hey, can I get your number so that we can make plans to study?""
If you're going somewhere with a big group, ask for her number to help get together with the group. Say, ""Tonight seems like it's going to be pretty hectic, and I might be a bit late. Can I get your number so that I can find you guys if I have any trouble?""

, If you're in a class together and a school project comes up, partner up with her and give her your number if you need to work on it outside of class. This is a somewhat smooth way to go about this; even if she suspects what you're trying to do, she might not do anything about it because you really do need to talk about the project outside of class. Make sure to actually talk about the project, especially at first. Don't immediately just go, ""Hey, what's up?"", or she'll get what you're trying to do and may not appreciate it.

, As part of your suggestion, ask for her number so you two can discuss plans later. Make sure you've been friends with her for a while before you do this! There isn't necessarily a set ""right time"" for this; just request her number when you feel like she's comfortable with you. It really depends on how well you connect.

, If at the end of the conversation, she hesitates and seems to not know what to say, ask her politely if it's okay that you get her number. She may be waiting for you to ask and may be a bit shy. It's always better to ask and not to demand it; she may not want to be rude, and asking politely gives her an acceptable way to say no. Women don't usually like to feel as though they must give their number just to be polite.


Chances are that if you force her, your feelings will get hurt when she avoids your calls or texts. It's better to just to be open and let things flow as they should.

, Don't be rude and brush her off. Say something like ""Okay, that's no problem. I'll see you around."" Girls don't like it if they feel you are being too pushy – so just be friendly. This makes the girl think you are easy-going, and so she might give you her number some other time.


A lot of the time girls just want to figure out what kind of person you are. If you can, strike up a polite and friendly conversation about something that she's into (or a teacher, a club, or a particular subject).
Consider simply invite her and her friends out with you and your friends. You could go bowling and get an ice cream after, or you could go to a movie, or hang out in the park. This way, she can see what kind of person you are, and it may inspire her to give you her number.

, If you succeed in getting her number, she is probably pretty excited to talk to you as well – unless she felt pressured to give her number away. The old rule about waiting three days to call isn't really relevant in a society that is connected 24/7. It is okay to contact her later that day or the next, but keep it short and sweet. Something like ""How is your day going?"" Is a good way to start., Ask her how she's doing, but don't feel the need to get her entire life story from the first text conversation. Don't start sending novels on how everything is going for you, and don't start asking multiple questions at once. There is no need to rush things! You have plenty of time to get to know each other, and you may as well enjoy the journey.Consider finding a reason to cut the conversation short. If you've gotten a good talk going, and you find a natural lull, you can say, ""It's been great talking to you, but I need to go to practice now. I'll talk to you later :)"" If things were going well, then this might leave her wanting more.
If the first few texts naturally bloom into a huge, days-long conversation over multiple messaging media – let it happen. This almost certainly means that she likes you.

, With the rise of texting and instant messaging, it isn't as common to call girls as it used to be. Call her if you're planning to meet somewhere, but you can't find her; call her if you feel confident asking her a question about something over the phone; or call her to talk once you know her much better. Texting should be more than enough to start you off.

, If you text her a lot, and she seems to engage with the conversation, then you don't need to think twice about continuing to text her. If she's giving short, one-word answers to everything you say, then it's a good indication that she isn't really interested. In this case, texting her more won't make her like you more; indeed, it may make her want to avoid you.


If you ask her a question and she sends you a long answer—at least a few sentences—then you should definitely keep asking questions. If she asks you questions back, that's even better.
If you ask her a (deeper than yes-or-no) question and she responds with ""yeah"" or ""idk"" or anything along those lines – she is probably either shy or uninterested.

Find a new friend.,
Smile and offer compliments.,
Share your interests.,
Share a bit of yourself.,
Spend time together with your new friends.,
Make sure your relationship is reciprocal.",How to Form Lasting Friendships1," Knowing where to look for like minded people and new friends can be a challenge. Despite this challenge, there are many places you can go to make new friends. Keep some of these tips in mind when considering where you might be most likely to meet interesting new people and make lasting friendships:You could join a group that is centered around one of your interests.
For example, if you are into table top gaming, you might head down to your local game store and start playing with the people there.
If you attend a university, there should be many different groups open for you to join.
Attending conventions that cater to your interests can be a good place to meet new people.
If there are no interesting groups in your area, you might form one of your own.
Go to public places. Avoid cinemas and theaters as well as malls. In such areas, people are usually occupied in their own tasks and have a single focus. They might/will not be too interested in making friends at the moment.;
, Although it may be standard practice when meeting new people, smiling and offering compliments have both been demonstrated to cause others to be more drawn to you. Make sure you are showing your appreciation of others and demonstrating that you have a friendly personality to help you make new friends. Don't offer this many compliments that the person you are conversing to finds it awkward. Make sudden and flying compliments that flow with the discussion.Smiling will generally cause others to perceive you as being friendly and open.
People often apply your comments about others back onto you. Saying nice things about those around you will help you present yourself as having those qualities yourself.

, People will often initiate friendships based on interests that they share. Being open about the things you are interested in can be a good way to attract friends that have those interests in common. Whether you are starting a new friendship or enjoying an old one, it's important to share what you're currently interested in.Try talking about hobbies that you might both share.
Talking about your favorite movies, music or shows can be a good way to bond.
You could discuss your views on current events.
Get off the topic if the talk between you and your friend is getting awkward due to dissimilar interests or if either of you is getting too hyped up in an argument.

, Building a stronger sense of friendship will require you to share some personal details about yourself and your life. Sharing these more intimate aspects of yourself can show that you trust and value your friend's support and thoughts. Try opening up more about yourself to help build a longer lasting friendship.Try sharing some details about your other relationships.
Don't be afraid to share some personal issues with your friend.
Be honest with your friends and represent yourself genuinely.

, When you are building a new friendship, it's important that you spend time together with your friend. Ideally, you'll be able to spend time together face-to-face, as more frequent exposure to one another can build a stronger bond between you. Try to make plenty of time for you and your new friend to hang out and to help lay the foundation for a lasting friendship.Spending time together online can be helpful, but it's not a replacement for meeting up in person.
Always try to make it to events that your new friend has invited you to.
Avoid turning down invitations to meet up with your new friend, as this may send a message that you are not interested in them.

, A big part of any long lasting friendship is reciprocity. Your friend will need to share as much of themselves as you share of yourself. Personal thoughts and feelings that you tell your friend should be met with personal experiences of their own. Keep your communications open and flowing both ways to make your friendship a long lasting one.Someone who offers nothing back after you've shared something personal, may not feel that you are friends yet.
Avoid over-sharing. If you aren't noticing much personal conversation coming back to you, it may be a sign that the friendship isn't that well developed.
If you are the one who always has to make contact with your friend, it may be a sign that the friendship is unbalanced.

If your friend has a big event coming up, check in with them afterwards to show your support.,
Be open with your emotions, feelings and thoughts.,
Help your friend out with practical things.,
Boost your friend's self esteem.",How to Form Lasting Friendships2," Contacting your friend after an important meeting, test or other event can show that you care and were thinking about them. Always reach out to your friend after they've gone through something big to help make your bond a lasting one.For example, if your friend had an important exam that day, calling them and asking how it went would be a good idea.
Your friend may have had an important business meeting. Texting them to see how it went would be a good way to show that you were thinking of them.
Maybe your friend had a performance that they were nervous about. Asking the how it was can be a great way to show that you care.

, Sharing your genuine feelings with your friend can demonstrate that you trust them enough to open up. Listening to your friend's feelings and concerns can demonstrate that you are a trustworthy person. Always try to facilitate an open and honest sharing of your thoughts, feelings and personalities to help create a long lasting friendship.


You may be going through a tough time in a romantic relationship. Talking about it with your friend can help you both feel more connected.
Always actively listen to your friend whenever they are sharing something important and personal.
Don't be afraid to tell your friend something that you think they might not want to hear. For example, if they are considering buying something they can't afford, you might try telling them why it's a bad idea.

, Being there to help your friend out with practical issues can help create a stronger bond between the two of you. Although studies have shown these practical shows of support aren't as bonding as emotional support, helping your friend out can still make your friendship stronger. If your friend needs help with a challenge, task or other practical issue, offering your help can be a good way to make your relationship a lasting one.For example, you could help your friend move some new furniture into their house.
If your friend's car broke down, you could try giving them a ride.
Loaning your friend a couple of dollars can be a good way to show your support.
You might try throwing your friend a birthday party.

, Research has shown that the longest lasting friendships are based on how well they reinforce a person's sense of self and identity. Because of this, you'll want to show your friend that you are aware of how they identify themselves and support them in these roles. By showing your friend that you understand and support them, your friendship can be a lasting one.For example, you might say something like “You are such a good mom!” to help boost your friend's self esteem.
You could try offering your friend praise for their professional lives. For example, you could say ""I don't know how you landed that deal. I'm really impressed that you pulled that off.""
Maybe your friend is a musician and has written a new song. Telling them how much you enjoyed it could be a great way to strengthen your friendship.

Don't let distance break your friendship apart.,
Reach out to your friend.,
Keep your relationship positive.,
Make sure you spend time together.,
Understand where your friend is at in their life.",How to Form Lasting Friendships3," It may have once been the case that moving away from a friend would make for a challenging relationship. However, thanks to modern technology, you can easily stay in touch with your good friends no matter where you are located. No matter the distance between you and your friend, you should still be able to stay in contact and keep the friendship alive.]

Make sure you keep your friends contact information up to date.
Try to find a method that makes it easy for you both to stay in contact. For example, you both might find it easy to keep in regular contact through email.
There are many video based chat programs that can make it easy to connect with a friend.
You might find a game to play online with your friend for a fun way to spend time together.

, It's important that you make a real effort to reach out and contact your friend regularly. If your friend is the one who is always making plans or making contact with you, they may begin to feel the friendship is unfairly balanced. If you want to maintain a long term friendship, make sure you are making an effort to contact your friend on a regular basis.If you think your friendship is in danger, reaching out should become a priority.
If you are the one who is always making contact, you might want to ask your friend if they could try reaching out to you a bit more often.
Don't be overbearing. You'll need to learn how much contact is appropriate for you and your friend.

, Although it can be fun to vent or complain to a friend, doing so too often can damage a relationship. Too much negativity during your conversations can leave your friend feeling drained or worn out after meeting with you. Try to keep time spent with your friends positive and energizing in order to maintain a long lasting friendship., If you live far away from your friend or it's become difficult to find free time to meet up, you'll want to make time to spend together.

Cultivate a positive outlook.,
Respect differences between people.,
Seek to understand other people's perspectives.,
Know your own triggers.",How to Get Along With Everyone1," People with a genuinely positive attitude are seen as more attractive and charming by others. The more you can cultivate this outlook in your own life, the more most people will like you.Don't worry if this doesn't come naturally to you — it is something you can learn through practice. Be conscious about smiling more. Accept compliments with gratitude and humility.
When you find yourself thinking negative thoughts about situations or people, stop and try to think of a bright side or positive characteristic that can help you feel better about it.;
, Accepting the fact that people are different from you, and that doesn't make them wrong, is part of having a positive attitude.Whether the difference is in terms of behavior, culture, or opinion, remember that these differences are not only okay, they make life more interesting.


It's easy to think ""Other people would be happier if they were more like me,"" but remember that most people are happy being who they are, and that all people aren't made happy by the same exact things. Spending time with friends might make you happy, while spending time alone might make a different person just as happy., Make a habit of trying to put yourself in other people's shoes, even (or especially) those who you find difficult to understand or relate to.Remember that there's at least two sides to every story. Make a genuine effort to see how other people have valid perspectives, even if they conflict with your own. Having an open mind will make nasty conflicts less likely.

, We all have ""pet peeves,"" things that really bother us when other people do them. Think what yours are. Recognize that not everyone feels the same about these things.Further, make plans to deal with these things when they come up. Does it drive you crazy when people whistle or drum their fingers? Having a practiced, polite response to these behaviors that lets others know you find it frustrating without being critical or combative can help you get along better with others.
For example, you could say: ""Excuse me, would it be okay if I asked you to stop whistling? No offense, but it really drives me crazy after a while!""

"
"
Be cheerful.,
Take an interest in other people.,
Be kind and considerate.,
Match the pace of others.,
Focus on your similarities.,
Don't make promises you can't keep.",How to Get Along With Everyone2," Entering conversations with a good attitude will lead to more positive interactions with others and make it easier to get along. Smile and talk about positive things to the extent that you are able.You don't need to fake happiness if your best friend has just died, but generally, try not to burden others with your problems, especially minor gripes.
For example, if someone asks how you are, and you've just gotten in from a long, difficult commute, try to think of something good that happened that day that you can tell him or her about rather than immediately expressing your frustration with rush hour traffic.

, Don't just talk about yourself when interacting with others. Find something genuinely interesting about what they have to say, and ask questions about them.


This will make other people feel more important and valued by you.Be a good listener. People want to feel that what they have to say is heard by others. This will make people enjoy talking to you more and reduce conflict in your day-to-day conversations., Be careful of other people's feelings when talking to them. Avoid unnecessary criticisms or mean-spirited jokes that might make others feel bad.Compliment others, especially at the start of a conversation. Starting a conversation off with some sincere flattery will get things off on the right foot., Each person walks, talks, and generally moves through life at a different pace than others. It's easy to feel like your own pace is the ""natural"" one, but try to match the pace of other people.

If someone talks slowly and quietly, avoid talking to him loudly and at a rapid pace. This will make it more enjoyable and comfortable for the other person to talk to you.

, It's important to respect people's differences, but it's also good to focus on what you have in common with others.This will make conversation smoother and easier for both of you.


This works at both the individual and cultural level. Whether someone comes form a completely different culture or just has a very different personality from yours, looking for similarities is a good way to bridge the gap.
If, for example, you meet someone with conflicting political or religious beliefs, but find you both like baseball or dogs, focus the conversation on baseball and dogs, at least until you get to know the other person better.

, Making promises you can't live up to is a good way to create resentment with people. It can be difficult to say no to people, especially when you want to get along with everyone and may whole-heartedly want to say yes to everything, but there are ways to say no without being mean. This is part of communicating assertively.Promising to do something you really don't want to do or don't have time for can build resentment. If you end up not following through or doing a bad job, the other person may not trust you or have his own resentments, too. If you can't or don't want to do something, it's better to just say no.
When you say no you are not rejecting someone — you are simply refusing a request.You can say no directly, without excuses or explanation — ""No, I can't do that."" Or try saying no while acknowledging the sentiment behind the request, such as: ""I know you really want to go for a hike this afternoon, but I can't today.""
If you have to say no to something you want to do, but simply don't have time for right now, you might follow up with something like, ""I can't hike today, but is there another time you'd like to go?"""
"
Keep it short.,
Keep your cool.,
Avoid arguments and difficult topics.,
Listen mindfully.,
Accept criticism.,
Be measured in your criticism of others.,
Keep it logical.,
Release your stress.",How to Get Along With Everyone3," Some people are a lot harder to get along with than others, and one of the best ways to get along with difficult people is to not spend any more time with them than necessary.The less time you spend with someone you don't really like, the less likely you are to have a conflict.


Have an exit strategy when you know you'll be spending time with someone you find hard to get along with. This could be making plans to be somewhere else, or just excusing yourself for unspecified reasons.It's also good to have practiced responses for politely limiting conversation with someone who talks too much and you find unpleasant. For example, if you have to deal with someone who offers lengthy and unsolicited advice, you could cut off a rant by saying ""Thanks! I hadn't thought of that!"" For someone who brags a lot, you can look for a place to say, ""That's great, I'm really happy for you,"" then exit the conversation., However frustrating someone may get in your interactions with them, to get along, try to avoid getting angry.Take some deep breaths, count to ten in your head, whatever you need to do. Just try to stay calm and avoid things turning into a fight.

, If there are topics you know will lead to conflict with someone, try to avoid them. If you and your brother-in-law always fight about politics, don't bring up the election! Do your best to steer the conversation away from such topics.Likewise, if one of these topics does come up, avoid being sucked into an argument. Don't try to to defend your position or justify yourself, just say something like: ""Well, you know we don't feel the same about that issue,"" and then try to move the conversation on to something else. You can even say ""Let's talk about something else."", When someone is talking to you, don't spend that time judging what she is saying or thinking of your defense — try to be present, listening to what the person is actually saying. At the same time, try to keep in mind that what the person is saying is a reflection of her perspective — her experience of life, which may be very different from yours. Her points of view don't necessarily make her a bad person, even if you disagree with them. Most people have reasons for thinking the way they do, and immediately becoming judgmental and defensive will keep you from learning why she thinks that way.

When the person is done speaking, respond in an appropriate and kind way. Instead of saying, ""I can't believe you think that. What is wrong with you?"", you might say, ""I've had a very different experience with that. Can I tell you about it?"", or, ""I'm interested to know what makes you think that.""

, If someone you find difficult is critical of you, try to treat this criticism as simple information. It is information you can choose to use or not use, depending on whether you think it has any merit.Try not to take criticism personally. It is as much a reflection of the viewpoint of the other person as it is anything to do with you.

, Sometimes, especially in professional situations, it's not possible to avoid conflict. Sometimes it is necessary to criticize others, if, for example, you supervise them at work. Make your criticisms tactfully to avoid personal offense.


Focus on the behavior, not the person. Rather than attacking someone's personal characteristics, critique what he is doing that you don't like. This can minimize the risk of hurt feelings or conflict.For example, don't say ""You are bad at planning ahead."" Instead say: ""I wish you'd try to think ahead more when we have major deadlines coming up.""
Point to specific, concrete improvements you would like to see, or specific things that are bothering you.For example, you could tell a coworker: ""It was really hard for me in the meeting last week when you didn't have the reports ready that you had promised. In the future, if there's a problem, let me know in advance and I can help you get them ready.""
Try the ""compliment sandwich."" Start by talking about one of the person's strengths, then deliver the criticism, then conclude with another positive statement.

, When you have to interact with difficult people, do your best to keep it fact-based.This will make it less likely that you'll get emotional and will make it harder for an argument to start.

, After an interaction with a difficult person, do what you can to let go of stress so it doesn't build up and affect your interactions with others.Go for a run, listen to your favorite music, punch a pillow, or whatever works for you. Anything that doesn't direct your frustration at others will help you get along better with people.

Try joining a club related to an activity you love.Do you love books? Join a book club. Are you an avid sports fan? Try joining a local football or softball league.
You can go to a local community center and see what types of clubs they offer. You can also look for clubs online through sites like MeetUp. Check out alumni events for your high school, college, sorority, fraternity, etc.;
, Make a habit of putting yourself out there in public. You never know who may become a friend. The random stranger you meet on the subway or the person you strike up a conversation with in a bar bathroom may become a lifelong pal.Try to be more social. If someone starts talking to you, talk back. Obviously, if you feel uncomfortable with someone, disengage, but try to give new interactions a chance.
If you meet someone interesting at, say, a coffee shop, try exchanging numbers or social media profiles. You can get together with this person later for a drink or coffee.
Consider trying to talk to one new person every time you go out. This small goal can help build comfort with meeting new people as you practice over time.
Try, too, attending events with a social component — such as lectures or town hall meetings with group/public participation. This can increase your

, If you want to meet people, put yourself out there. Work on saying ""Yes"" more. You will end up making friends if you agree to be social more often.If a co-worker invites you to a party, go. Even if you feel lukewarm about this co-worker, you never know what could happen. There could be someone fun and interesting at the party who you become friends with.
Try saying ""yes"" to Facebook invitations. You may not know the friend of a friend who invited you to their birthday party, but you may meet people there. This is also an opportunity to get to know an existing acquaintance more.

, If you're having trouble meeting new people, try reaching out to family. It can sometimes be hard to be friends with siblings, cousins, and other family members when growing up, as rivalries and arguments get in the way; however, many people find close friends in family members later in life.If you and a sibling or cousin live in the same town, try making plans more often. The two of you may find you get along great as friends in adulthood.
Many people form strong bonds of friendship with family members. As you get older, you may find a sibling or a cousin becomes a best friend.

, Is there a coffee shop you love or a bar you enjoy? Try becoming a regular. Many people end up making friends simply by hanging out at a bar or coffee shop. Eventually, you'll get to know the staff and other patrons.Don't be shy about going out alone. Many people enjoy having a drink or a cup of coffee on their own once in awhile.
Bring a book or a laptop if that makes you feel more comfortable, just be mindful to make conversation with people and appear approachable.

, Many people feel awkward reaching out to a potential new friend. While making friends feels easy and natural in childhood or school, you often feel odd doing the same as an adult. Try to remember other people are as eager to make friends as you. Don't be shy about sending someone a text or making a phone call.Don't feel like your friendship is unwanted if you have to initiate the first hang out. The other person may be shy or busy.
Send a text or make a phone call asking the person to hang out. It can be something simple. For example, ""Hey! We met at Julia's party last week. Do you want to get together for drinks this Friday like we talked about?""

, In adulthood, there are a lot of obligations. People do get busy with work, family, and other issues. If someone passes on an invitation, do not get discouraged. In all likelihood, it was not personal. The other person probably was genuinely busy.Wait a week and text something like, ""Hey! Too bad it didn't work out Friday. When are you free? I would love to get together.""
Don't get discouraged if it takes a while to form a solid plan. Many people are genuinely busy. The two of you may end up having conflicting schedules for a bit before you can start forming a friendship.

, Make plans centered around shared experiences. People tend to bond through sharing things. You're also likely to find more friends by pushing yourself to experience more out of life.Experience things you both enjoy. If you met in a cooking class, for example, try cooking a meal together. If you met on a sports team, go for a hike.
While sharing experiences, strive to meet new friends together. The two of you can be open to chatting up strangers in a bar or joining a few mutual friends for a dinner party.

, Just as you extend invitations, strive to accept them. You're more likely to meet new people and make new friends if you show up. You'll get invited out more if you're consistently the person who's always there and ready to have fun.Try to say ""Yes"" as often as you can. If a friend invites you to coffee, go even if you have to tweak your schedule. If you want to make and find new friends, sometimes you have to make time for this.
Make sure and thank the person who invited you after the event. This will reinforce to them that you like being included.

, Friendships can blossom with a series of one-on-one interactions. It can be fun to go out in a big group now and again; this can also be a way to meet people and make friends. However, try to have one-on-one time with people you really click with. This can help a strong friendship develop.If you meet someone you click with in a big group, reach out to them. Invite them out to dinner or for a drink. The two of you can spend some time chatting and getting to know one another more in depth.
Keeping the first one-on-one encounter brief can help keep the potential friend interested and feeling positive about the future of the friendship.

, Push beyond small talk. Bonds tend to form when people feel vulnerable. As you start to get close to someone, confess some deeper information. Talk about your secrets, insecurities, dreams, and more. Sharing sensitive information with someone can strengthen a bond.Laugh at yourself! Find something you did that day or something about yourself that you can poke fun at — this is generally endearing to people.
However, make sure not to share sensitive information with someone until you're sure you can trust them.

, If you want to build a strong friendship, communication is important. Make an effort to talk to your friend as often as possible.If you met your friend at a club or meeting, chat that friend up each time you get a chance. Sit next to your new friend in meetings so you can talk before and after meetings.
Text when you can. It's easy to have strong, interesting conversations via text.

, Friendship builds over time, and small gestures can go a long way towards keeping a friendship strong. Pick up your friend's favorite treat if they've had a bad day. Buy your friend a drink at the bar. Send your friend a text if you see something that reminds you of them while you're out on the town. Slowly, you will begin to form a stronger bond., Propose a road trip. The two of you can go out of town for the day to a spa or out for a hike. A road trip, even a short one, can give you time to bond.New experiences help foster strong friendships. If there's something the two of you have always wanted to do, try it together. For example, take a trip to a mountain range you've always wanted to hike together.

, Be patient. It takes around six to eight meaningful interactions before you will really feel like you're friends with someone. You cannot force friendship to take place overnight. Allow your friendship to develop at its own pace."

Introduce yourself to new people.,
Watch for people who advertise their interests.,
Ask people questions.,
Discuss your own interests.",How to Find Friends That Share Interests1," The more people you meet, the more likely you will find someone who has similar interests. Be bold. If you are in a new situation, put your hand out and state your name. Brief introductions are best. If the other person is interested in a conversation, they’ll respond.Some ways you can do this include:


If you’re at a party, instead of only talking to your friends, talk to strangers. Tell them your name. You can say something like “How do you know Lisa?” or “This music is great, huh?”
If you’re at a new school or workplace, introduce yourself as you run into people. You may want to introduce yourself to those sitting next to you. Be bold. You can say: “Hi there. My name is ____. I’m new here.” Wait for them to introduce themselves back.;
, Sometimes people show their interests and hobbies in visual ways. They may wear a t-shirt of their favorite band, or they may have stickers of their favorite superhero on their bag. Perhaps you see them knitting on the bus, or they’re reading a book you enjoy. In these situations, don’t be afraid to compliment them on their tastes. You can try saying something like:


“I love your shirt. That’s my favorite band. Have you been to one of their concerts?”
“That scarf you’re knitting is beautiful. I knit quite a bit myself, and I always find that stitch difficult. Any tips?”
“Have you read the latest book by that author?”
You can advertise your own interests in the same way. Perhaps someone will comment on your shirt or sticker.

, After you’ve made introductions, you can start small talk. Asking the other person questions shows your interest in them.While small talk is often about the weather or your workload, you can also guide the conversation towards your interests. Asking for recommendations is a natural way to feel out their interests while helping you find fun places to go and things to do. You can ask:


“So what do you like to do on the weekends?”
“Are there any good movies out? What would you recommend?”
“Do you know if there are any good hiking trails around here?”
“Are you watching the game tonight?”

, Don’t be afraid to talk about your own hobbies as well. Do not worry about being judged for your interests. Instead, confidently state what you like to do, and the other person might respond positively. If they’ve never heard of your favorite band or if they haven't played your favorite sport, you might be able to teach them about it in a way that makes them interested.


If they ask you what you did over the weekend, you can discuss how you spent it doing your favorite activity. For example, “I just saw this great play over the weekend. Have you heard of it? I love theater, especially musical theater.”
If they ask you how you are doing, add a short response that tells them not only how you feel but what you’ve been up to. For example, “I’m good, but I am so tired today. I was up late last night playing this new video game.”

Join a club.,
Volunteer.,
Attend local events.,
Join a social media group.,
Take interesting classes.,
Organize your own event.",How to Find Friends That Share Interests2," Clubs, associations, societies, and organizations provide easy ways for you to find people with similar interests. If you are in school or university, you can look up your student union’s list of organizations to see if there is anything that matches your interests. If you are an adult outside of university, you can search meet-up websites or check out local web forums for information.Some ideas for clubs include:


Sports team
Improv group
Board game club
Fantasy sports league
Running group

, If your interests tend to be motivated by social justice, you should also consider volunteering. Non-profit organizations can often use extra help, and you will form many new networks with people who share the same beliefs.If you love animals, you can volunteer to walk dogs at the local shelter.
If you are religious, your place of worship probably offers many opportunities to help the local community alongside your fellow worshippers.
If you have strong political beliefs, you can join a local advocacy group. You can organize protests, campaign for a politician, or attend town hall meetings.

, Look up your city or town’s calendar of events to find out what is going on near you. If there is anything that sparks your interest, attend it. Going to events alone can be intimidating, but it allows you to meet new people who also enjoy the same kinds of events. Some good places to meet people include:


Sports game
Concert
Cultural festival
Art Fair
Comic book convention, More and more, people are meeting each other online instead of in real life.Using your social media account, you can connect with a local interest group. Write on their board, or make comments on their posts. If they organize a meet up, attend it. You may feel better having talked to these people online before meeting them in person.


If you don’t want to use your social media account, you can also be anonymous on forums that center around your interests. The friends you make may not be local, and you may not meet them in real life. That said, they can still be lasting friendships.

, If you are in school, what classes you take often determine who you meet. While you should be taking required classes for your area of study, you can also take courses in subjects you find interesting. This will connect you to other people who are also fascinated by these topics.

If you are no longer in school, you can still take classes at your local community college or public library., If all else fails—if there are no local clubs, no volunteering opportunities, no fun events—make your own opportunity. Other people with the same interests will find you instead. Do not assume that no one out there has the same interest. They may be interested, but they may not have the same initiative to start something.


Start your own club. You can advertise it online and in local coffee shops. Make a page for it on social media.
Plan an event. Research local artists, musicians, or vendors to see if they would be interested in helping you. You can contact your local town council to see if they will help you. Raise money through ticket sales.
Start a blog about your hobbies. People who are interested will come and comment on what you do. You may even form an online community around the activity.

Text each other.,
Invite them to join you on your hobby.,
Act like a good friend to them.,
Avoid badgering them.",How to Find Friends That Share Interests3," It can be difficult to start hanging out with someone you’ve just met. You may not feel comfortable with them enough to ask them over or to go out together. A good way to start a long term friendship to start texting them about your shared interests. Send them a picture you think they’ll find funny. Show them a website about your common interest. Ask them questions about homework or work. Texting is key to modern friendships, and it’s one of the primary ways that friends keep in touch.Sometimes asking for someone's number feels awkward. Try saying something like, ""If it's okay with you, I would love to get your number so we can chat a little more and maybe hang out!""
You could also ask, ""Could I have your number? I want to text you about what we've been talking about!""

, Once you’ve established that you share an interest, you should take the opportunity to do it with them. Ask them if they want to come over or to go out to do your hobby. Some casual activities include:


Discussing books or movies over coffee
Playing video games together, either over the internet or together in the same room
Going on a hike together

, It sounds easy, but the best way to make good friends to be a good friend.Be open about your interests, and they’ll open up to you. Invite them to group outings. Perhaps they’ll do the same and introduce you to more people who share your interests.

, While it might be exciting to find someone who has all of the same interests, you should not overwhelm them with texts, phone calls, and emails. While they may be interested in being your friend, they have other social obligations, time requirements, and hobbies too. You want to make friends, but you do not want to appear needy.


Wait for them to text you back before you send another message.
Call once and leave a voice mail if they do not answer.
Friend them on social media, but do not like all of their posts at once.
If they do not respond, they will probably not be a good friend, no matter how many interests you share.

"
Identify quality friends.,
Reach out to people you see every day.,
Go to parties.,
Strike up conversations with people who share your interests.,
Hit the ""scene."",
Go to organized events.,
Join some kind of organized group.,
Branch out through your existing friends.,
Meet people online, too.",How to Find People to Make Friends1," An ideal friend will share your values, interests, and beliefs. Quality friendship is based on a mutual understanding of the qualities you share, and acceptance of your differences. When you look for a friend, try to find someone who will:Be genuinely interested in you and your life. They will take the time to listen to what you have to say, and respect your thoughts and feelings.
Accept you fully, including any differences in opinions.
Listen to you without judging you or pressuring you to change your personal opinion and beliefs.
Comfortably share their thoughts, feelings, and emotions with you. Keep in mind, though, that you should also feel comfortable being open and sharing things about yourself.;
, Expect strong friendships to rely on consistent interaction.Focus on people that you already see on a regular basis. Odds are that you’ll either work and/or go to school with most people who fall into this category, but don’t limit yourself to that. Consider anyone whom you see on a regular basis.This could be anyone from a fellow passenger on the train who shares the same commute each day to another dog owner who walks their pup in the park at the same time as you.
Pausing to chat with with people like these can result in a stronger relationship than the one you have with your BFF from high school if you don’t speak with the latter very often.

, Accept any and all invitations that other people extend. Remember: the whole point of a party is to relax, let your hair down, and socialize, so this is the perfect place to strike up conversations with people you hardly know because everyone's expecting it. Whenever you're given the chance to attend a party, jump at it!Do so even if the person inviting you isn't exactly the friend you're looking for. You may end up meeting someone more desirable through them.

, People love talking about things they love, so use that to your advantage. Whenever you see someone engaging in something that you're passionate about, engage them! Break the ice with a topic that you could both go on and on about. Try something as simple as:Mentioning that a certain book is a great read if you see someone reading it or pulling it off a shelf at the library or bookstore.
Commenting on how much you love a band if you see someone sporting a t-shirt or anything else with their name or images.
Complimenting someone's pet if it's an animal that you love.

, Go to coffee shops, concerts, shows, or anywhere else the kind of people that you hope to meet tend to gather to relax or be entertained. If you're of age, go to bars and clubs. In order to meet people, you need to go where they go, so put yourself out there. Go wherever the scene is, whether it's:The park
The beach
A music scene
Sports events

, If the idea of just walking into a bar or coffee shop on any random night and striking up a conversation with perfect strangers is a little intimidating, then go to some kind of event that's open to the public instead. Choose one that appeals to your interests and use the subject at hand as an ice-breaker. For instance, you could go to:Trivia nights
Wine-tastings
Singles events
Professional conferences
Walking tours

, People tend to have a tribal mindset, so use that to your advantage. Expect forming friendships to be much easier if you’re both part of a unifying group. Join any kind of organization that appeals to you. Then use your membership and shared interests to form an instant bond with fellow members. Consider things like:Church or volunteer groups
Gym classes, sports team, or similar clubs
Book clubs, art classes and other cerebral pursuits

, Don’t feel like an organized group of people needs to be an official club. Treat other people’s circle of friends as an organized group in and of themselves. When you befriend one person, use that friendship as a common bond to build on with their other friends so you can form a more direct relationship with each of them, too.Meeting new friends through existing ones makes it much easier to maintain the new relationships that you build, because everyone's already connected.
This doesn’t mean you have to turn down friendships with a dozen different people just because you meet each one separately. Just expect a lot more work in keeping those friendships alive.

, Expect friendships to require consistent interaction in order to survive, but don’t take that to mean that it needs to be face-to-face. Utilize the internet. Join online forums and communities that share your interests. Start conversations with other users just like you would in a “real world” setting."
"
Turn solitary pursuits into social ones.,
Ask for contact info.,
Break your routine when necessary.,
Avoid the “Mr or Miss Right” mindset.,
Show vulnerability.",How to Find People to Make Friends2," Obviously, a great way to break the ice with new people is having a common interest, but not all interests lend themselves immediately to a group setting. If most or all of your hobbies and passion projects tend to be one-person endeavors, think of ways to repurpose them to include other people. For example:If you love writing, join a workshop where you and other members share your respective work and discuss them.
If you’re a runner, find clubs in your area that practice and run races together.
If you do a lot of DIY projects around the house, attend seminars on home improvement.

, Whenever you have a positive exchange with someone new, follow it up by asking for their contact information. Demonstrate that you’ve enjoyed your time together by showing that you want to repeat it. If they’re willing to, be sure to provide them with your own so they can get in touch with you, too. You don’t need every possible way to reach them, so just ask for one at first, like their:Phone number
Email address
Social media profile

, Everyone has their own routine in life, but don’t let yours hold you back. Understand that making new friends requires you to make room in your life to accommodate them. Be willing to readjust your schedule to make time for them.For example, you may enjoy winding down after school or work by watching TV at home. But, assuming you have work or class five days a week, sticking to this pattern without fail will really limit your availability.
This doesn’t mean you have to go out clubbing straight from work or school each night. But at the very least be willing to vary your routine by inviting people over or chatting with them online or over the phone.

, As with romantic relationships, don’t limit yourself by holding prospective new friends up to an overly idealized standard. Sure, you may have a preconceived idea of what your “perfect” friend would be like, but refrain from comparing real people to that. Leave yourself open to surprises. For instance:Let’s say you joined a running club and have started buddying up with a fellow runner. As you get to know them, you realize that they come from a much different background than yours and lead a much different lifestyle.
Although you may have hoped to meet someone much like yourself, with the same interests and personal tastes, that doesn’t mean this person won’t be a great friend. They may in fact open the door to new experiences that you otherwise would never have had.

, People are attracted to self-confidence, but don’t confuse self-confidence with trying to come off as absolutely perfect 24/7. Expect new friends to feel a deeper bond with you if you give them the opportunity to provide advice, comfort, and emotional support. So don’t be afraid of sharing uncertainties and fears with new people.This could be done through simple means like conversation, or you can incorporate it into your decision about what type of groups or activities you want to join in order to meet new people. For example, join a drama club if you’re nervous about public speaking, or up the ante even further and try something like skydiving.

"
"
Meet up with your new friends outside of established settings.,
Follow through with the plans you make.,
Say “yes” to invitations.,
Match each attempt they make to reach out to you.,
Be attentive to others.,
Avoid acting a “part.” Meeting new people and trying new things often means stepping outside of your comfort zone, but as you do, be careful to stay true to yourself.",How to Find People to Make Friends3," Think of your friends from school for a second. Odds are, you probably hung out with your closest pals during school breaks and fell out of touch with those you only ever saw in the classroom. However you might meet your new friends, don’t let those initial circumstances define your relationship. Extend your relationship outside of the proverbial classroom. For example:If you’ve become pals through a mutual friend, don’t allow yourself to become dependent on that mutual friend. Suggest some one-on-one time without them instead.
If you’ve met new friends through, say, an art class, find other activities that you can all participate in before that course ends, whether it’s joining a new class or just meeting up for coffee.

, Planning to meet up for coffee or drinks or a movie is all well and good, but expect to lose favor with people if you constantly break plans with them. Whatever your plans might be, see them through. Prove yourself to be reliable so they don’t start thinking of you as a flake who isn’t worth their time.


Obviously, stuff happens, and sometimes you do need to break plans. That makes it all the more important to follow through whenever you can, even if you don’t find yourself in the mood for coffee or drinks when the time comes., Accept their offers to meet up and hang out whenever possible. This doesn’t mean you have to go out partying the night before a big test or meeting just to please your new buddy, but remember: strong friendships need regular contact. Show them that you want to remain friends by seizing each chance they give you to spend time together.Keep in mind that they’ll probably stop giving you the chance if you keep turning them down. So if there’s a specific reason why you have to keep saying “no,” let them know what it is. Offer alternatives so they know they still matter to you.
For instance, if they keep asking you to go out dancing on Thursday night when you have to wake up early every Friday, explain the situation. Then suggest another time to meet up, or maybe a more laidback activity for Thursday night if that’s the only time they can meet.

, Don’t make the other person feel like they’re the only one making an effort to stay in touch. Take on an equal amount of responsibility in keeping your friendship active. Whether they’ve set up some fun activity to do together or just reached out to you with a phone call or email, return the favor and do the same with the same frequency.One exception would be if they happen to be shy or otherwise reserved. In that case, matching their level would obviously spell doom. If they’re not the type to reach out themselves, it will probably be on you to keep in touch.

, When you hang out with friends or meet new people, be sure to focus on them rather than expecting them focus only on you. You’ll be able to better connect with others and develop more meaningful friendships when you show interest in other people. When you are fully engaged in what they are saying, how they are feeling and thinking, it shows.Be genuine. Don’t pretend to listen as others can pick up on that quickly, and may find it insincere or off-putting.

, Avoid the temptation to act like someone you’re not just to impress someone. Although doing so might seem to work at first, expect it to grow tougher the longer you try to keep it up.If you feel like playing a part is necessary to maintain your friendship, then the truth is that you’re probably better off being friends with someone else.

The first step is to walk through the door and out into the world. When you get out to places where there's a good likelihood of meeting and interacting with people in a social context, you've already put yourself on the right track.;
, Search online for club opportunities in your area. Remember, you aren’t the only one in town hoping to find a new friend!


If you’re a mom, you can join a mothers club. A mothers club is a place for mothers to get together to discuss their kids, problems they've been having or what they've been doing, as well as just spending time with other mothers and getting to know each other and share stories.
If you appreciate literature, join a local book club where you can hang out and discuss the month’s readings.

, Concerts, neighborhood meetings, or even store grand openings and events at your local library are places where you can interact on a social level with like-minded individuals.


Being more present in your community can make a huge difference in your ability to find good friends.
Being a member of the same local community means you will always have something to talk about.

, Find forums on subjects that interests you. In online forums you can discuss a wide variety of subjects and issues that you relate to with other people, and increase your chance of making a connection with someone who shares common interests. Look into forums that:


Relate to your occupation, especially if you are in a specialized field.
Focus on a particular sport or hobby that you like.
Are populated by people who are in your age group, or share similar backgrounds.

, To find good friends, you should get involved with things that you like do, so that if you do meet someone, you'll have the same interests. When you connect with someone with similar tastes as you, be ready to use that connection to develop your friendship further.


If you’re into sports, join an intramural or amateur league for your sport of choice.
If you’re a veteran, hanging out at the local VFW is a great way to meet fellow service members.
If you live in a place with lots of outdoor possibilities, hiking the trails, skiing, swimming or engaging in other outdoor activities regularly can put you in contact with other outdoor enthusiasts (and help you stay in shape, too). Spending active time with a new friend, or even someone you've known for a while, will help take your relationship to a higher level.

, Join an online social site, like facebook, so that if you meet someone you can add them to your social network. Even if you don't know them very well, you can see what they've been doing and keep in touch. Being aware of what is going on in a friend's life makes it more likely that you will be able to connect on a deeper level, and make a casual friendship into a more intimate and close one.

, You might think they’re all dating apps, but there are some services that cater specifically to people looking for platonic connections, such as Meetup and Peoplehunt. These apps can help put you in touch with groups or individuals in your area, and tailor your interests to theirs. Apps such as Foursquare and Crowded Room are also good tools for using location to put you in touch with other like minded individuals. , Often the best way to meet new people is through mutual acquaintances. Meeting and spending time with the friends of people you already know gives you a leg up-and you’re more likely to get along with someone that your friends get along with. , If you want to make new friends, especially good, long-lasting ones, you may need to make yourself get out more. It’s perfectly understandable to want to just relax at home at the end of a long workday or week, but getting out and about is crucial for making new friends. Instead of ordering your favorite take out, eat in the restaurant.
Make a habit of going for a walk around the neighborhood in the evenings.
Think of the whole world as your playground, not just your own backyard. Get out and enjoy the sights-you’ll end up meeting people in the process.

, It’s very easy, especially if you’re a somewhat solitary person, to rationalize why you don’t want to go to the party, for instance, why you won’t enjoy it, why it’s not a good idea because you were sick a week ago-but if you want to make friends, you’ll give yourself a major advantage by being willing to accept invitations.


Be wary of declining invitations too often; people may eventually stop asking.
Accept that you’ll need to inconvenience yourself from time to time in order to spend time with potential friends. Usually the inconvenience stops once you’re together and having a good time. Let others change you. Sometimes, especially if you have emotional walls up, making a good friend requires letting someone break them down. When someone is trying to connect, they may be trying to bring you out of your shell. Let them in, and share your more intimate thoughts and desires with them.

Introduce yourself.,
Know what situations are acceptable to approach people.,
Judge people on more than appearances.,
Explore mutual interests.,
Be relaxed and non-expectant.,
Be prepared for intimacy.",How to Find Good Friends2," If you’re in an appropriate situation, and see someone who seems like they might be interesting, go up and say hi. Tell them your name and make small talk-perhaps you’ve seen them around before and thought you’d introduce yourself.


When you introduce yourself, embrace understatement. Usually saying less is best. When you talk too much about yourself right off the bat, it will make you seem overly egotistical. A simple “Hi, I’m Steve,” is way more likely to lead to conversation than, “Hi, I’m Steve. Well, let’s get this party started. I just had a long day making some major business deals with some really important clients from overseas and having my new Jaguar tuned up. What do you do?” Which of the two would you feel more comfortable in responding to?
Be aware of the situation when you introduce yourself. If you’re at a company party, say, “Hi, I’m Steve from accounting.” Likewise, if it’s a random situation, don’t feel the need to create a context-if you’ve been introduced at a bar for instance, just stick with “Hi, I’m Steve, nice to meet you”, and focus on the other person rather than declaring your job title or what you did that day.
Ask questions and listen. When you meet new people, always try to listen more than you talk. Don’t demand information, but use a simple, “What do you like to do?”-and then listen with genuine interest. Being a good listener is a sure way to get someone on your side. , If you’re in a bar, at a dance, a party, or other social mixing situations, people are more likely to be open to meeting new people. Likewise, avoid walking up and trying to have a conversation when people are busy or going about their daily tasks.


Be confident in approaching people, but not overbearing. No one likes to feel like they are being pursued or harassed by someone they don’t know.
Observe people’s body language when you approach them. If a person won’t look you in the eye, or seems like they want to disengage from the conversation, let them.
When someone speaks to you with an open posture and looks at your face, especially into your eyes, it can be a good indicator that they are willing to engage further.
People will often keep their arms crossed when they feel uncomfortable or closed off, or hunch their shoulders and look down.When you see signs of discomfort or avoidance, don’t react with your own annoyance, even if your feelings get hurt a little. Don’t push it-respect others’ body language and nonverbal communication signs; you never know what else is going on with someone to make them unwilling to engage.

, Appearances are important, especially in first impressions, but you should also consider other aspects of people when sizing them up.


How do they behave? Do you find the person interesting based on how they act? How do you feel about their demeanor?
How do you feel interacting with the other person? Good friends often are made “naturally”. The two of you simply hit it off, and find that you are comfortable and engaged around one another.

, One of the best ways to create an immediate bond with someone is to find common ground. When they mention something that they like that interests you, too, pick up on it.


If a person mentions going to the theatre, and you like acting, it might lead to something like, ""Really? I was in a production of that two years ago! I love that play!"" It doesn't need to be that specific, simply expressing a mutual interest can go a long way.

, When you first meet someone, avoid laying expectations on them from the start. Finish your conversation with a casual “see ya around” rather than asking to get together right off the bat. In the right local situations, or if you’ve connected through an app or online service, you’re likely to run into each other again.

, Usually, a first meeting will be casual and non-committal. But sometimes you connect on a deeper level with someone right off the bat. Be ready!


Let your senses guide you. Sometimes someone will just open up to you when they, too sense a connection.
Reciprocate intimacy. Sharing intimate or personal stories and experiences creates a bond between people. Everyone experiences pain, fear, loneliness- and sharing that common humanity with someone is what becoming close, good friends is all about.

"
"
Get together.,
Ask if they’d like to get together sometime.,
Don’t rush it.,
Share yourself on a intimate level.,
Become good friends.",How to Find Good Friends3," After you’ve become somewhat acquainted with the other person is a good time to get together and get to know each other better.


If you had a good first meeting or introduction, and the other person seems interesting in getting to know you better, take it to the next level and make plans to hang out.

, Once you’ve established some mutual interests, find out if the other person wants to share the experience. Whereas a date usually involves an intimate and romantic situation (i.e. candlelight dinner) just hanging out and doing fun stuff is the way for friends to go.


If you both like sports, see if they want your extra ticket, or come with you to a game.
Engage in recreational activities together on a weekend.
Get out for a hike, go kayaking or canoeing, or catch a movie together. Grab some lunch.

, Good friendships develop over time. Don’t expect to be best friends after hanging out once or twice.


Be casual, have fun, and let things develop as they will.
Just like with dating, becoming good friends can’t be forced or manipulated-when it’s there, it’s there, if not, not.
The same goes for the other person-if you feel like you’re being pushed into something you’re not ready for, back away. Don’t feel obligated to always meet the other person’s demands because you want a friend. If they’re truly your friend, they will want you to do what’s best for you.

, In Method 2 we discussed allowing yourself to open up in first meeting situations. When you are getting to know someone and spending more time with them, it becomes essential to let yourself open up.


Make a point of sharing personal and intimate stories. Telling life experiences to each other, especially if they involve less than comfortable subjects, is a useful strategy for connecting on a deep level. Remember, being good friends isn't about showing only the best parts of yourself and your life; it's the struggles that we've all experienced that connect us through our humanity.

, Simply being connected with someone online isn’t the same as having a truly good friend. Even if you have several hundred Facebook friends, having that special person that is there for you in person in times of need and times of joy is important. Be there for them as well. It’s important to view friendship as a two way street. Treat your new friend as you want them to treat you.
Don’t sweat the hassle of making plans. Arranging and deciding on times and places to meet can be logistically tricky, especially if your or the other person has a busy work schedule, or if there are more than two people involve.
Keep building on your relationship, and keep budding relationships. Once you’ve gotten together some, keep hanging out, keep getting in touch, and keep letting your relationship grow. If you have several people that you get together with occasionally, it’s likely that that special friendship will grow out of these. It takes some effort, but keep after it, and you’ll end up with a good, sturdy, long-lasting friendship. "

Remember that for better or worse, people tend to judge others based on first impressions.,
Smile and project a positive attitude.,
Quickly choose someone to approach and talk to.,
Start the conversation.,
Keep the conversation going.,
Be a good listener.,
Okay, it's been 60 seconds.",How to Create a Friendship in 60 Seconds," This is just a fact of life.


Pay attention to your personal hygiene (shower, brush your teeth, check your breath) and dress attractively.
You don't have to be fancy or overdressed; just avoid looking too sloppy or unwashed.

,


A smile is kind of a universal sign that you're friendly and your intentions are good. It also suggests that you have a positive personality, which is appealing to most people.
If you have trouble smiling naturally, try thinking of something that makes you happy.

, Be sure not to choose some random stranger, just make sure that you known them the least bit and at least know their name.


Don't agonize over this – the point is to talk to as many people as possible in a social setting to increase your chances of making a new friend.
Don't choose people based on their ""attractiveness,"" or on how ""confident"" they appear. Your new best friend may not fit either of those descriptions, but may still be a fantastic person. So just approach anyone who looks available for a conversation. If the conversation doesn't pan out, you can always move on with no guilt (see below).
Put yourself at ease by remembering that the people around you are probably as interested in making new friends as you are.

, Look, you approached this person, so logically it's up to you to start the ball rolling. Almost any opening remark can start a productive conversation.

If the two of you happen to have anything in common, start with that. For example, ""Hey, I think I've seen you in my biology class – how do you like that teacher?"" Or, ""Do you work at Starbucks? I think I've seen you there.""
Give the person a compliment that leads to a question: ""Wow, that's a really nice bracelet – where did you get it?"" Or maybe, ""Your hair looks amazing – how do you get it to do that?""
Go with the age-old standby – the weather. If it's hot, say you're burning up and you need to sit down for a minute. If it's raining, say you'd been planning to go shopping (or biking, or sightseeing, or something else interesting), but now you might be changing your plans.

, Unless the person is disastrously insecure or just not in the mood to talk (it happens), your opening line will get some kind of response. Be prepared to follow up with additional remarks.


Try to retain interesting bits of information from reading books, magazines and newspapers, watching TV and surfing the Web. These can be life-savers in a conversation.
Talk about yourself and gradually share more information as the conversation progresses.

, This is one of the main things that people respond to when meeting someone new – when you give someone your attention, you make that person feel important and worthwhile.

Make eye contact – the best way to show that you're tuned in. Don't stare into space or look at other people, and definitely don't look at your phone!
When the person makes a statement or relates a story, give a response that expands on the topic or otherwise shows that you understand.

, Did you make a connection?


If no, that's okay. You won't strike gold every time, and people aren't always in the mood to be social, so you shouldn't feel discouraged. All you have to do is politely disengage yourself (""Hey, thanks for chatting. I should get going – talk to you later!"") and then find a new person to approach.
If yes, great! Keep talking for as long as it's comfortable, and then when it's time to go, be sure to exchange phone numbers and/or email addresses so you can stay in touch. Then be sure to follow up. This may not turn into the friendship of a lifetime, but you'll only find out by taking the initiative and contacting the person to talk or hang out again.

"
"
Take the initiative.,
Meet new people.,
Don't be oversensitive.,
Don't be picky.,
Be persistent.,
Be patient.",How to Find a True Friend1," When it comes to finding a true friend, you can't afford to be lazy. A real friend won't just magically materialize on your doorstep, so you need to be willing to put some work in. Take matters into your own hands and start socializing.


Stop waiting for other people to do the work for you. Call people up and ask if you can hang out with them, or organize an event yourself.
Don't worry about seeming desperate or needy. Focus on you and your goal. If it all works out in the end, then who cares?
Try to hang out in such a way that no one feels you are clinging to them in desperation or friend-poverty. If there is a group, make eye contact with everyone, and not directing your speech singularly.;
, You won't make friends by sitting at home alone every night. You need to be proactive, so force yourself out of the house and meet as many people as possible. It might be intimidating at first, but it'll be worth it in the end.


One of the easiest ways to meet people is through friends you already have. Tag along to a party or social event and get your friend to make the introductions.
Meet people through hobbies or classes. Friends are generally people that you share a common interest with, so the people you meet through hobbies or classes are excellent potential friend material.
Meet people through work. You might have a work colleague who you feel a connection with, but you've never hung out socially. Now is the time.
Meet people online. Sometimes there's a stigma attached to meeting people online, but it can be a genuinely great way to meet people. Blogging, social networking and posting on online forums are all perfectly viable ways of socializing.
Avoid going to places that have one focus. This means that you shouldn't try to get a chance at cinemas and theaters, since there the main focus is on the screen and you won't meet too many people there except by chance. Public places like tea and coffee shops, parks and bars help a lot in socializing. However, there are other places with a friendly environment that you shouldn't hesitate to try out.

, Meeting people for the first time can be tough. They may seem disinterested or unwilling to make an effort. Or else you might hit it off instantly, but you never hear from them again. Don't be disheartened. Finding a true friend takes time. You should realize that a friend you have earned with a lot of hard effort is commonly a true friend.

, Keep an open mind about who you hang out with. When you're trying to make friends, being picky is not a good strategy. Your initial goal is to meet as many people as possible, so talk to everybody and keep an open mind. This will help you determine about people's personalities and know who to stay away from and what good characteristics should be present in a good friend.


Even if you meet someone who looks or seems like someone you'd have nothing in common with, talk to them and give them a chance. They might turn out to be your truest friend!
You're not going to know a true friend at first sight - you'll have to get to know them first - so consider every possibility!

, Even if your first attempt at putting yourself out there isn't as successful as you had hoped, don't despair! People can take a little while to warm up, so the second or third time meeting someone might go a lot better than the first.


If you invite someone to hang out, don't be upset if they can't make it. Chances are they have a genuine excuse, it's not because they don't like you. Give it a week or two, then ask again.
Sometimes it just won't work out with someone and that's okay. Consider it a practice run for when you meet the real deal.

, It takes time to really get to know someone, especially when you're looking for true friendship. If you continue to put yourself out there and make an effort to hang out with as many people as possible, eventually you'll find someone you genuinely connect with.


Be realistic about how much time it'll take to really get to know someone. Sure, you might hit it off and feel like you've known someone for ten years rather than ten minutes, but usually it'll take much longer, depending on how often you hang out.
In the right situations, you can make new friends very quickly - like when you start college, move to a new city, or join a sports teams.

Start a conversation.,
Get their contact information.,
Invite them to hang out.,
Accept every invitation.,
Give the relationship time to grow.",How to Find a True Friend2," The first step in getting to know a potential friend is to strike up a conversation. Believe it or not, very interesting conversations can start up with, ""The weather is sure cold!"". Another way is to find out a little bit about them and their interests. Once you get started on an interesting topic, the rest will come naturally.


Try making a general comment or asking a question about something generic, just to break the ice. For example, ""Great party, huh?"" or ""How do you know John?""
Try to listen more than you talk. Show that you're interested in what they have to say. Even if you find their speech boring, try to appear concentrated in order to not hurt the other's feelings.
Find out about their interests and hobbies. If you can find something you have in common, the conversation will flow more freely.

, If you hit it off with someone, make sure to get their contact information before you part ways, you'll need it if you want to organize to meet up with them again.


Get their phone number or email address, or ask if they're on Facebook. It doesn't matter as long as you have a way of reaching out to them.
Be sure to give them your contact details too. They might just invite you to do something fun.

, Here is where a lot of people falter. It's fun to meet people once and make friends with them on Facebook afterwards, but you won't develop a true friendship unless you take the next step and invite them to hang out. Hang outs are not necessarily about going to Starbucks and buying a Coffee Espresso for both of you! Try new and fun ideas, like consider going on a long-drive if you have a car.


You don't need to invite them to do anything special, just ask them if they'd like to go for a drink or hang out at the beach.
Even if they can't make it, they'll probably be flattered you asked. Try again in a week or so. Let them have their space otherwise they will think you are too clingy.

, It's good to make your own plans to meet up with people, but if you get an invitation it's even better. Think of it as an easy opportunity to get to know someone better or meet more people.


Accept every invitation that's thrown your way, even if it's to see a movie you're not interested in or to play a sport you don't like. Once you're there, you will be glad that you made the effort.
You don't want to get a reputation as the person who never shows up for anything. That's a surefire way to never get invited anywhere.
If you really can't come, explain your reasons to the other person funnily and in such a way that they realize you aren't refusing to your own option but on a real excuse.

, Deep, meaningful relationships don't just blossom overnight - you need to nurture them and allow them time to mature.


Once you've made the initial steps and established a routine of hanging out, just repeat, repeat, repeat.
To become a true friend with someone, you need to hang out fairly often, keep in touch, enjoy good times together, and get to know each other on a deeper level.

Look for someone you can have fun with.,
Look for someone who will be honest with you.,
Look for someone who will be loyal to you.,
Look for someone trustworthy.,
Look for someone dependable.,
Look for someone supportive.",How to Find a True Friend3," A true friend is someone that you have a great time with. You should be able to make your own fun, laugh together, get in trouble, and genuinely enjoy one another's company. It's not necessary that you have to laugh with your true friend---deep and meaningful conversations for a long period of time are usually are helpful to nurture a friendship.

, A true friend will always be honest with you, no matter what. It doesn't matter whether it's about something trivial, like whether your outfit looks good on you, or something life-altering, like if they found out that your partner is cheating on you. A true friend will never keep you in the dark. This doesn't include their telling you about their personal affairs all of a sudden. This will take a little time since your friendship isn't that ripe yet!

, A true friend will be fiercely loyal to you, whether you're present or not. This means that they'll stand by you, even if they don't agree with your decisions and stick up for you when nobody else will. However, don't expect them to stand up for you when you truly are wrong. If they do, reconsider their being a good friend.

, You can trust a true friend with anything, whether it's to feed your cat while you're on vacation or to keep your deepest, darkest secrets. If your secrets litter around the whole school, and the only person you have told it to would be your best friend, then they are not really considered real friends.

, A true friend is there when you need them, to share the good times and help you through the bad ones. They return your phone calls. They show up for the lame double date you made them agree to. They don't go M.I.A. when the going gets tough.

, A true friend is supportive of you and your goals. They won't try to change you, make you feel uncomfortable to holding you back.

However, if you ever are late, have a suitable reason for it and do not hesitate to tell others. This shows them that you are confident and don't make lame excuses.;
, Don't act shy! Hold your chin up and walk confidently but not quickly. Don't cross your arms or look defiant; let your arms hang by your sides.


Smile at others. Sometimes, it seems hard, but you'll seem more confident if you smile. Are you the shy type? Give a smile to everyone and try not to look nervous. People will surely try to look out for you. Overdoing any results poorly. You don't always have to show your teeth when you smile. A tiny smile can show others that you are fresh, positive, approachable mood.

, Start a conversation or two. Don't be shy. The worst people can do is look at you strangely, but who cares about them? You have to start making friendships; they do not just happen overnight.

, Obviously, you aren't going to become the most popular girl right away. Don't act like a know-it-all. Act curious but guarded. Nevertheless, don't be so stiff that you look unapproachable or rude.

, Don't try to copy others. Dress in your style, but make sure your clothes are nice, stain-free, and properly fitting. It doesn't matter if you get critical looks from others as long as you know that your clothing is appropriate.


Wear sensible clothes. Don't wear revealing clothes, and avoid wearing anything with insulting or provocative phrases. Those things will only put people off.

, Have a spa day the night before. Take a shower, brush your hair, and maybe even wear some makeup.

, It's a great way to make friends. You might even pick up a new hobby. Make sure it is a club of your own choice. If you join a club you are talented or interested in, you'll get friends that share the same interests as you.

, It's good to know your way around school so that you don't look silly. If maps are available, print one of your school or get one from a reception. That will save you from the awkwardness of being shown around the school by a specific person. However, if you don't have a choice, ask an acquaintance to tour you around the school.


Don't be rude. First impressions count. If a someone shows you around and keeps talking about something you are not comfortable with, don't say anything rude or hurtful toward them. Say something like ""I am not really comfortable with this because ____.""

, Ask people for their e-mails and talk to them on social media. Try not to seem like a stalker. Keep online contact with your friends, and if you have a phone, save their contact number. Not only can you stay in contact with your friends, but you can also phone or text them!

, Smile and be friendly! It will make you more approachable.

Do things you enjoy.,
Meet people at work.,
Go to themed meet ups.",How to Choose a Friend1," Friendships are built on commonalities. People who share a similar interest or experience are more likely to engage with each other and genuinely find one another interesting. To find these people, you have to go out and do things in the community that you enjoy. The other people doing those things are great potential friends. Check your local newspaper and any other local event resources to find out about events in your area. You might even sign up for a mailing list to receive info about an organization’s events. For example, you might:Volunteer for a cause that you are passionate about.
Visit popular attractions.
Attend local events such as concerts or festivals.;
, Not every co-worker will become a lifelong friend, but there is something to be said about the shared lifestyles of people who work together. On average, you are spending forty or more hours per week doing work in the same field. This gives you a lot of material for conversation. Invite a co-worker to lunch or an evening event to connect with them beyond the workplace. You could also participate in company sponsored events like parties or fundraisers.Having friends in your work field can also boost your chances of moving up in your field.
Be careful about which of your colleagues you befriend to avoid conflicts of interest. For example, it might not be a good idea to befriend someone you supervise because this may result in other employees accusing you of favoritism.

, Anything from church to Comicon could house many potential friends. The trick is to find something with a theme that you are interested in and passionate about. Introduce yourself to others at the event and keep in touch with anyone that you find particularly interesting.Try checking out Meetup.com for local events. This is a great resource, especially if you have just moved to a new city.

Look for friends with discipline.,
Keep friends that bond emotionally.,
Surround yourself with positive people.",How to Choose a Friend2," We all run a little low on self-discipline from time to time. Studies show, however, that our friends can make or break us in these times. Choose friends that are disciplined and you will be more motivated to reach your own goals. Choose friends that are reckless and you are more likely to go along with their behavior and blow off your own responsibilities. Examples of disciplined friends are people who:Go to work when they are supposed to.
Pay their bills.
Take care of themselves physically, mentally, and emotionally.
Have successful careers, relationships, etc.

, While common interest can start a friendship, it isn’t enough to sustain one. Friends need to bond emotionally. Friends that offer you emotional support during difficult times are essential to a healthy, happy life. Make sure that you return the favor and show support for your friend, too. Gravitate towards people who:Check in with you to see how you are doing.
You can rely on to help you in difficult times.
Allow themselves to be vulnerable with you and seem trusting of you.

, The attitudes of your friends will influence your own attitude. By surrounding yourself with positive friends, you will be uplifting your own attitude. Simply avoid pursuing a friendship with anyone who seems rude, self-centered, or pessimistic. This way, you won’t have to break off that friendship later.Be on the lookout for people who are:


Nice and helpful to strangers.
Optimistic about their career, family, and life.

Consider the person’s impact on your happiness.,
Let go of people that make you feel bad or who engage in harmful behaviors.,
Cut ties with anyone that abuses your relationship.",How to Choose a Friend3," Try to make friends with people that make you feel good, but keep in mind that difficult conversations within relationships are sometimes necessary. However, if you frequently feel unwelcome or unappreciated around someone, do not try to build a friendship with them. You are under no obligation to befriend anyone who makes you feel bad.Ask yourself after having spent time with someone “Did I enjoy myself?” If the answer is yes, spend more time with them. If the answer is no, spend less time with them.

, Sometimes old friends change, or we change and they remain the same. When this happens, your old friend may make you feel bad. This can range anywhere from feeling guilty about your success to being uncomfortable with the situations you end up in with that friend. When this happens, you should let go of that friendship and allow yourself to move on to friendships that better fit your needs.For example, you might tell your college friend “I know we used to have a lot of fun partying, but now I have responsibilities that I take seriously. I am not interested in living the same lifestyle that you live.”
If a friend is engaging in irresponsible behavior without acknowledging a need to change, then it may be time to let go of that friendship.

, People abuse relationships in many ways. Your friend might constantly borrow money off of you and never pay it back, they might call at all hours of the night for emotional support but never answer your calls, or they might be physically abusive. Regardless of the type of abuse or manipulation, friendships aren’t meant to operate this way. Both sides should be giving and receiving emotional and other support.If you are being abused or manipulated, you likely won’t enjoy the time you spend with that friend anyway.

Find and join a group that does an activity you enjoy.,
Volunteer with a charitable organization.,
Befriend your neighbor or co-worker.",How to Befriend Someone1," Doing something you enjoy will most likely involve people with common interests to you. Having a common interest will make it easier to get to know someone, as you will have something to discuss.;
, If you are willing to give your time to a good cause, you may also get a new friend for your time.


Doing certain kinds of volunteer work may attract people who have similarities to you. If you have kids, consider volunteering to coach one of their teams. This will get you in contact with other parents of kids the same age. If you are religious, consider volunteering at your religious institution. This will allow you to meet other people who prioritize religion in their lives.

, You don't always have to go out of your neighborhood to find a new friend.


Do you run into the same neighbors outside of there homes working in their yards or playing with their kids all the time? Strike up a casual conversation with them and gauge whether you would like to hang out with them. If you would, invite them over to your house for coffee or a drink. Make is super causal but make the effort.
Take the time to get to know your coworkers. There may be one that you would like to hang out with outside of work.

Join a sports team or an after school club.",How to Befriend Someone2," Don't be afraid to say hello to a kid you don't already know. They may not end up being your friend but it doesn't hurt to try.


Ask them about themselves, for instance what kind of games they like to play or what their favorite subject is at school.

, Ask to join a game already in progress or organize a game yourself with a variety of kids.


If you meet someone new that likes to play games or do activities that are different from what you usually do, don't be afraid to try something new and play with them anyway. You may discover a new friend at the same time as you find some new activity that you like.

, There are usually a variety of activities to choose from, so pick an activity you think you might enjoy.


Your school it not the only place to find fun after school activities where you can make friends. Search for a local community center or a boys and girls center for a variety of programs they might run.
Remember that you don't have to be an expert at the sport or activity that you choose. Part of joining a team or a class is that you will improve your skills, wherever they are to start is just fine.

Expect that the person you are befriending will give some effort as well.",How to Befriend Someone3," A smile can go a long way if you are trying to make a friend in the line at the grocery store or while playing with your dog at the dog park. It signals to strangers that you are pleasant and that you may be approachable.

, Say hello to people you might like to befriend. Ask them how their day is going or some other icebreaker.

, It is important to show that you are interested in the person you are trying to befriend. Don't just tell them about yourself, instead leave room in the conversation for them to engage. This can be done by asking them questions and waiting for them to answer.

, Nobody wants to hang out with someone who is completely timid, but you also don't want to appear completely self-absorbed. Be sure that you are walking the line between the two.

, Ask the person what they enjoy doing in their spare time. Suggest a common activity that you both could do together., Haven't we all said that we should do something and then the plans were never solidified? If you really want to hang out with this person, make concrete plans to hang out. If you have a plan you are more likely to actually spend time together.

, It may take some commitment on your part to create a new friendship, as people lead busy and hectic lives that don't always lend themselves to new relationships, but don't give up easily. If someone you are trying to befriend cancels plans or doesn't respond to your call or email right away, don't give up. Give people several chances before walking away.

, Friendship is not a one way street. While it may fall to you to make the first steps toward a lasting friendship, you should not be doing all the work.


Sometimes you want to be friends with someone but they just don't make the effort to keep the relationship going. One of the biggest benefits of having a friendship is that you feel that someone else likes and cares for you and that you reciprocate those feelings. If this is the case, it may be best to walk away. Find someone else who will give you the kind of friendship you deserve.

Pick someone to become friends with at work.,
Remember to appear approachable.,
Be open to having a conversation.Spend your breaks hanging out with your coworkers, instead of by yourself.,
Remember people's likes and dislikes.,
Spend time with people you want to befriend.",How to Befriend Someone4," Unless you work by yourself, there are usually a lot of opportunities to create lasting relationships in any work place with a wide variety of types of people.You may like or feel comfortable with a particular person at work. In normal everyday interactions there may be a few people who you know you “click” with. Those are your potential friends.
While you probably won't connect with everyone you work with, it's important to make a good friend at the place where you spend most of your waking hours.

, In order for you to befriend someone at work you will need to show them that you are nice to be around. While work can be stressful at times, be sure to keep an air of approachability and pleasantness even when having difficult conversations.

, Even though you may not enjoy every conversation, you will figure out who you enjoy hanging out with and who you do not.

, Try to familiarize yourself with what interests and hobbies the other person might have. You may be surprised to find that you might end up sharing interests or hobbies with someone you work with.

, Friendship is not something that can be built in a day, it takes time and commitment at both ends, just like any other relationship. If you want to be friends with a coworker you will need to spend time with them outside of your workplace. Build your friendship off of common interests and fun activities, not just proximity during work hours.

Figure out where in town the people your age hang out.,
Look for clubs based on your interests.,
Accept invitations to parties and social events even if you're invited by people you don't know well or have much in common with.,
Ask for advice.,
Sign up for social networking sites.,
Join a gym.,
Volunteer for charity service.",How to Build a New Social Network As a Young Professional," Different age groups usually visit different areas for socializing. Look for popular destination areas and neighborhoods.


Visit coffee shops and take time to linger. Offer your extra seat to someone who needs one. Be personable.
Visit local pubs in popular districts that cater to your age group. You never know who you’ll meet during Happy Hour. Sit at the bar and don't hide away in a booth. If you're adopted by a fun group of people to hang out, remember to exchange contact information, Myspace or Facebook details, etc. Also, don't forget to buy a round.
Take in the local music scene. See bands around your new town. Don't be afraid of striking up conversation between sets.
Look for festivals or block parties. St. Patrick's Day, Mardi Gras, Cinco de Mayo are a common holidays for some cities to block off streets and throw great parties.;
,


Running or cycling clubs can be good because you'll swap stories while basking your tired legs in an endorphin high. They're also great ways to cover a lot of ground and explore a new city.
Book clubs can help you meet others who also like to lose themselves in a good novel. The main thing is that you’re striking up conversations with new and interesting people.
Sports clubs (hockey, basketball, softball, soccer, tennis, golf and ultimate frisbee leagues) offer excellent opportunities to meet people, get fit, have a great time and sometimes explore neighboring cities if your team participates in tournaments. Find a sport you’ve always wanted to play and get involved. Look in free weeklies or community gyms for sign up information.
Theatre clubs - Assuming another identity and putting yourself on stage in front of the whole world may seem risky, but the benefits you reap will be even greater. Theatre is a promising way to meet outgoing people.
Cultural and religious organizations. Familiarity breeds comfort, so seek out those common ties and make yourself known.
Search out young professional groups in your town. It may be as easy as doing an online search or asking around work. Look for signs posted at business hot spots, popular lunch places and bulletin boards.

, It's always an opportunity to get to know them better or meet others at the same party.

, Ask people for advice who are in your age group and could possibly have the same interest. Ask them about fun places to eat, dance, have drinks, meet for happy hour, etc. Showing interest in these things and asking for advice is also a way to open the door for an invitation.

, Myspace and Facebook are popular choices. If you already have a page, remember to change your city or network. When you meet new people ask if they're on Myspace, Facebook or another social site. Check out their profiles to see if they're a good match, if they have common interests, if they may be a bad choice, creepy, etc.


It can be a safer way to screen and make contact with people than by sharing emails and mobile numbers.
Befriend the new people you meet and add them to your pages.
Look for pages run by social groups, clubs, bars or restaurants in your new town. Add them to your friends. They may send out updates and invitations to events.

, It's good for the head, heart, body and soul, the gym also provides an easy environment in which to meet others. The camaraderie that comes from collectively punishing yourselves in an aerobic or weight-lifting class is unbeatable. Look for gyms in hip parts of town or near popular neighborhoods. Visit it at various times when people your age will also be attending. Strike up a conversation with the person on the treadmill next you. See where it takes you.

, Help others and help yourself at the same time. United Way and Red Cross are two large and deserving causes. Local food banks and charities based in your new town are a great way to get connected with your new city and people in it.

Active@KillDisk is the program recommended by Microsoft to securely remove your data.Download the program from a reputable website and use the included utility to create a bootdisk. You can get a perfectly functional free version but the pay version is much more thorough and secure. If your computer cannot create disks, use the utility to create a USB boot disk (this will need to be accounted for in your BIOS settings).
Boot the computer from the disk, similar to the process described above in the previous section. If the computer will not boot from the disk, use the instructions in that section for entering the BIOS settings.
Once it starts, you will see a blue screen with options on the left including “Active@Killdisk” and then either free or pro, depending on what you chose. Press the down key until this option is selected and press enter.
Select your hard drive from the list which then appears on the left. It will bring up another window which will have the option to “Confirm and Erase”. Select this with the down arrow and hit enter. Type “erase-all-data” as requested by the window. Hit enter.

If you're on a computer that has DOS as an operating system, the command prompt should appear automatically when the computer is turned on.,
You should see a window with ""C:\>"", ""C:\DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS\>"", or something similar.,
The most important thing you should be able to do is list the contents of directories, and navigate them.,
When used on its own, dir will show the contents of your current directory, but there are many useful arguments for the dir command.,
If you want to enter a directory, type cd, then the path and name of the directory (ex.,
Executing programs is exactly like commands.,
Now that you know the basic syntax of DOS, here are some other useful commands.",How to Use MS DOS," If you're using a Windows computer, you'll need to start the command prompt manually. For most computers, it should be located under 'Accessories' in the Start menu. It can also be accessed by typing ""<windows button>"" and ""R"". Then type in ""cmd"" without the quotes and you should be in DOS, also known as a Command Prompt.;
, This is called the command prompt, and it also serves the useful purpose of showing what directory you're currently in. At the end of this prompt, you type commands (think verbs) followed by arguments (think nouns -- when the verb needs a noun, that is), then press enter. Here are some sample commands:



C:\GAMES>ping nosound







C:\MY DOCUMENTS>edit essay.txt







, Use the dir command to list the contents of your hard disk or the directory (or ""folder"") that you're in. Depending on where you are, you might get something like this:


. DIR
.. DIR
DOS DIR
GAMES DIR
WINDOWS DIR
AUTOEXEC .BAT
ESSAY .TXT

, For example, typing the name of a directory after dir will give you the contents of that directory instead, and /p is useful for very long lists because it will stop and wait for you to press a key every time it reaches the end of the screen. /p can also be used in most other commands that print on the screen.

, cd C:\GAMES\GRAPE). If the directory is a subdirectory of the directory you're currently in, like if you were already in GAMES in the previous example, you could also just type cd GRAPE. Here, ' cd ' is the command and the directory is the argument. The command prompt also shows the name of your current directory. So, typing


C:\> CD C:\GAMES\GRAPE






Would change the command prompt to C:\GAMES\GRAPE>







, For example, if I wanted to start the game Mortar Mayhem, I would navigate to the directory it's in:


C:\> cd games\mortar






Then type the name of the EXE file, without the extension.



C:\GAMES\MORTAR> mortar






And now the game would run.

If the Firefox complains about the missing library that you see in its folder, try export LD_LIBRARY_PATH = <folder where you have placed firefox>. Later you can write the shell script where the first line will be this export statement and second - the actual command to launch the Firefox.
Firefox may also complain about some other missing libraries. This is because we bypass the Debian package manager that would solve these missing dependencies.
To get other missing libraries, try to run tool like ""Synaptic package manager"" that provides a user friendly search by name. If you do not have the user friendly manager, install it with apt-get install synaptic (run as root).
Firefox should start after you install its needed libraries that way.;

Install Debian according to the instructions in the installation wizard.",How to Install Debian1," Installing Debian on your machine will clear your entire hard drive and reformat it, erasing all data in the process. Store your important information on a removable drive before beginning the installation.;
, Debian is distributed through www.debian.org, and the necessary files can be found on the ""Getting Debian"" page.

, From the Debian website, choose the installation image that is suited for your processor architecture. If you don't know what type of processor your machine has, choose the ""32-bit PC netinst iso"" image, as this one is compatible with common 32-bit Intel or AMD processors.

, Once you have downloaded the image file (it will have a "".iso"" extension), burn it to a disc using disk imaging software. There are several free applications available that can perform this task, though your computer must have a CD-R or DVD-R drive. Alternatively, you could burn the image to a USB drive if your computer supports booting from a USB drive.

, Once you mount the .iso file onto a disc, leave the disc in your optical drive and restart the computer. The computer will boot from the disc and take you directly to the Debian installation wizard.

, Debian includes an option that lets you run the operating system completely from the CD or DVD, without overwriting any information on your hard drive (this option is called Debian Live). Choose this option from the installation wizard if you want to test Debian before installing it completely. Note that performance will be quite slow with this option.

, When you are ready to proceed with the full installation, follow the prompts in the installation wizard to set up the operating system as desired. You will be given the option to partition your hard drive in case you want to run Debian alongside another operating system such as Microsoft Windows.

Load the installer onto the USB stick.,
Reboot your computer and enter the boot menu.,
Follow the instructions in the installation wizard.",How to Install Debian2," Installing another operating system on your computer will reformat your hard drive, thus erasing any files stored on your previous OS. For this reason, you should back up any important files onto a removable device. After the installation, you can easily copy them back into Debian., This USB stick is going to be used as the Debian installer. All of its contents will be erased, so make sure to back up any files that you want to keep.

The USB stick should have at least 2 GB of storage to hold the installer

, There are many popular choices when it comes to software used to create Live USB sticks. UNetBootin is available to people using Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. We will be using UNetBootin in this article.

If you choose not to use UNetBootin, these instructions will still generally apply to most Live USB creators.

, From the Debian website under the ""Getting Debian"" tab, you will be presented with the option to download either the small or complete installation image. Choose the one that best suits your situation.

Choose the small installation image if your computer can connect to the Internet.
Choose the larger complete installation image if your computer can not connect to the Internet. This image contains more packages, making it easier to install on devices that have no Internet connection.

This file will take longer to download, so you also have the option of downloading it over a torrent. If you have a BitTorrent client, using it will make downloading the file much quicker.



, On Windows, click the start button and search for ""UNetBootin"". On Mac OS X, open Spotlight search and enter the same keyword. You will probably be asked to grant the application administrative privileges. Enter your password and press enter., Click on the ""Diskimage"" radio button. Ensure that ""ISO"" is selected from the drop down menu, and press the button at the very left in order to open the file explorer. In this window, locate the ISO file you downloaded earlier and open it., At the bottom of the window, ensure that ""USB Drive"" is selected from the ""Type"" drop down menu and that you have the correct drive selected in the Drive menu. This is very important, as if these to aren't set correctly, you could end up formatting the wrong USB stick, or worse, your entire hard drive. Finally, hit OK to set up the USB stick.

This process may take a while. It might be a good idea to save and close all of your work since you will need to reboot your computer to start the installation.

, Once you have all of your work saved, reboot your computer. Once you are presented with the manufacturer splash screen, you should see that the key used to enter the boot menu listed in one of the bottom corners of your screen. Press this key.

If you aren't given the option to enter the boot menu, then it's probably hidden in the BIOS menu. Enter the BIOS menu instead, and navigate to the tab labeled ""Boot Menu"".
If you aren't given the option to enter the boot menu or the BIOS menu, then you will need to search your model up online to figure out what key you need to press. Typically, you'll need to press F2, F11, F12 or Del.
Once you are in the Boot menu, your USB stick should be listed as either the brand name (Lexar, SanDisk, etcetera) or something along the lines of Debian followed by the version name and number. Select this option to boot into the installer.

, During the installation, it may be a good idea to plug your computer into your router using an Ethernet cable to ensure that you don't lose connection mid installation. Enter the required information at each prompt. If you want to dual boot Debian with another OS such as Windows, you will be given the option to partition your hard drive near the end of the installation to do this."

An ISO file is a CD image file that will need to be burned before you can use it. There are two options available from the Ubuntu website (you can also buy official Ubuntu CDs, which come in packs of 10):


16.04 LTS has continuous updates and provides technical support. It is scheduled to be supported until April 2021. This option will give you the most compatibility with your existing hardware.






Ubuntu builds (not yet released) 16.10, 17.04, and 17.10 will come with limited support. They will have the newest features, though they may not work with all hardware. These releases are geared more towards experienced Linux users.






If you have a Windows 8 PC or a PC with UEFI firmware, download the 64-bit version of Ubuntu. Most older machines should download the 32-bit version.





;
, Open up your burning program of choice. There are free and paid programs available that can burn an ISO to a CD or DVD.


Windows 7, 8, and Mac OS X can all burn ISO files to a disc without having to download a separate program.







, Once you have finished burning the disc, restart your computer and choose to boot from the disc. You may have to change your boot preferences by hitting the Setup key while your computer is restarting. This is typically F12, F2, or Del.

, Once you boot from the disc, you will be given the option to try Ubuntu without installing it. The operating system will run from the disc, and you will have a chance to explore the layout of the operating system.


Open the Examples folder to see how Ubuntu handles files and exploring the operating system.






Once you are done exploring, open the Install file on the desktop.







, Your computer will need at least 4.5 GB of free space. You will want more than this if you want to install programs and create files. If you are installing on a laptop, make sure that it is connected to a power source, as installing can drain the battery faster than normal.


Check the “Download updates automatically” box, as well as the “Install this third-party software” box. The third-party software will allow you to play MP3 files as well as watch Flash video (such as YouTube).







, If your computer is not connected to the internet via Ethernet, you can configure your wireless connection in the next step.


If you didn’t have an internet connection in the previous step, hit the Back button after setting up the wireless connection so that you can enable automatic updates.

, If you have Windows installed on your system, you will be given a couple options on how you’d like to install Ubuntu. You can either install it alongside your previous Windows installation, or you can replace your Windows installation with Ubuntu.

If you install it alongside your old version of Windows, you will be given the option to choose your operating system each time you reboot your computer. Your Windows files and programs will remain untouched.






If you replace your installation of Windows with Ubuntu all of your Windows files, documents, and programs will be deleted.







, If you are installing Ubuntu alongside Windows, you can use the slider to adjust how much space you would like to designate for Ubuntu. Remember that Ubuntu will take up about 4.5 GB when it is installed, so be sure to leave some extra space for programs and files.


Once you are satisfied with your settings, click Install Now.







, If you are connected to the internet, this should be done automatically. Verify that the timezone displayed is correct, and then click the Continue button.

, You can choose from a list of options, or click the Detect Keyboard Layout button to have Ubuntu automatically pick the correct option.

, Enter your name, the name of the computer (which will be displayed on the network), choose a username, and come up with a password. You can choose to have Ubuntu automatically log you in, or require your username and password when it starts.

, Once you choose your login info, the installation will begin. During setup, various tips for using Ubuntu will be displayed on the screen. Once it is finished, you will be prompted to restart the computer and Ubuntu will load.

Download the installer from the Ubuntu website.,
Choose your username and password.,
Click Install to start.,
Restart your computer.",How to Install Ubuntu Linux2," If your browser prompts you, select Run, Save, or Open. The Windows installer is not compatible with Windows 8. You must use the method in the previous section.


The Windows installer will install Ubuntu alongside Windows. Your files and programs will not be affected. When you reboot your computer, you will be able to choose which operating system you would like to load.







, Once you run the installer, you will be presented with the configuration menu. Choose your new Ubuntu username and password.


You can also change the size of the Ubuntu installation. A larger installation will give your Linux operating system more space to install programs and add files, but this will take away from the free space that Windows has access to.






You can choose your Desktop environment. The three most common are:






Ubuntu (the most popular) has Unity, a unique and intuitive desktop environment.
Kubuntu has KDE which resembles Windows
Xubuntu uses Xface, which is faster and good for PCs that are 2-3 years old.
Lubuntu uses LXDE, and can be used with very old PCs or netbooks with as little as 512MB of RAM.



, The installer will begin downloading the files necessary to install Ubuntu on your computer. Installation will happen automatically.


Downloading the files can take a significant amount of time depending on your internet connection. You can use your computer while the files download in the background.







, Once the installation is complete, you will be given the option to reboot now or later. When you reboot, you will see a new menu before Windows starts that allows you to choose between Windows and Ubuntu."
