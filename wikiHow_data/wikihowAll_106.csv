You can quickly open the Terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T or by opening ""Applications"" → ""Accessories"" → ""Terminal"".;
, You'll need to know this before proceeding so that you can install the correct software.


Type sudo uname --m and press ↵ Enter. Type in your administrator password.
If the Terminal returns i686, you are running the 32-bit version.
If the Terminal returns x86_64, you are running the 64-bit version.

, This allows for better compatibility with programs compiled for other computers.

Navigate to ""Applications"" → ""Internet"" → ""Skype"". You can use this to create a shortcut on your desktop for Skype.

, The first time you run Skype, it will likely take a minute or two to start. During this time, it will appear as if nothing is happening. Be patient and it should start after a little while. When you start it again in the future, it should start immediately.

, You can also create an account for free if you don't have one. Click here for more details on Skype accounts.

, When you first start Skype, you'll see a contact named ""Echo / Sound Test Service"". Select it and then click the call button. This will allow you to test your microphone and speakers to ensure that you are sending and receiving sound.

You can prevent Skype from taking control of your system mixer by clicking ""Tools"" → ""Options"" → ""Audio settings"" and unchecking the ""Allow Skype to automatically adjust my mixer levels"" box.

, For many webcams that don't work, installing the ""v4lcompat"" driver will fix the problem. If this doesn't solve your issue, you'll need to check for instructions for your specific webcam. Not all webcam models work with Skype on Linux.


Make sure that there are no other programs running that may be using your webcam. The webcam video feed can only be used by one program at a time.
Open the Terminal, type sudo bash apt-get install libv4l-0:i386, and press ↵ Enter.

Check this Ubuntu support page if the above steps don't work. The page contains a list of webcams that should ""just work"", webcams that need specific tweaks to get working, and webcams that don't work at all or require a significant amount of effort to get running.

, Skype for Linux does not officially support 640 x 480 video, which can make the image look blurry. There is a hack you can use to force 640 x 480, but it isn't guaranteed to work for everyone:


Make sure Skype is functioning properly and then close it completely before proceeding.
Navigate to User/.Skype/SkypeName/.
Open config.xml in a text editor.
Add the following lines between the <VIDEO></VIDEO> tags:

<CaptureHeight>480</CaptureHeight>
<CaptureWidth>640</CaptureWidth>


Save and close the file. Skype should now transmit in 640 x 480 resolution. It may take a minute or two for it to ""warm up"" to this resolution.

If you have the zimbra email server is in a local network (27.251.168.3, a private ip address) behind a router, so make sure you use the router's public ip address (e.g. 7.8.9.0) in the dns records.     If you have a dynamic ip address, you could use a service of dyndns.org, but ensure that the elected public ip address is not blacklisted.;
, Afterwards, become root by running “su”  ,, in the screen you will see as below:         # this file describes the network interfaces available on      your system    # and how to activate them. for more information, see      interfaces(5).         # the loopback network interface    auto lo    iface lo inet loopback         # the primary network interface    auto eth0    iface eth0 inet static            address 27.251.168.3            netmask 255.255.255.0            network 27.251.0.0            broadcast 27.251.0.255            gateway 27.251.0.1,, this is done by typing “vi/etc/hosts”. on the screen you will see as below:         127.0.0.1         localhost.localdomain     localhost    27.251.168.3    mail.example.com         mail

You'll need an active internet connection to install it.It is possible to install the latest, unstable version from Wine's developers, but this is not recommended for most users as you may encounter serious issues with it.;
, The Wine program should be the first on the list of results.

, This may take a few minutes.

, You will need to configure Wine before you can use it, which needs to be done through the Terminal.


You can open the Terminal from Applications → Accessories → Terminal, or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.

, This will create a folder on your computer that will act as the Windows ""C:"" drive, which will allow you to run programs.


This folder is labeled .wine and is hidden in your Home directory.

, After the ""C:"" drive is created, the configuration window will open, allowing you to adjust the settings for the emulated version of Windows. The different tabs allow you to adjust different settings.


""Applications"" - This allows you to set the Windows version for each of your installed applications. The ""Default Settings"" is the version of Windows that will be loaded for any application that does not have a specific operating system set.
""Libraries"" - This lets you adjust DLLs for the emulated version of Windows. Most users can leave this alone. You may need to make adjustments here to make some programs run correctly.
""Graphics"" - This allows you to adjust options like screen size, mouse capture, and resolution. This is linked to the ""Applications"" tab, so these changes can be application-specific.
""Drives"" - This allows you to map virtual drives for Wine using your own drives and folders. To find the Path for your disc drive, right-click the icon on your desktop. You can also click ""Autodetect"" to attempt to have Wine automatically detect your installed drives.
""Desktop Integration"" - This allows you to set the theme and appearance of your emulated applications.
""Audio"" - This adjusts the audio settings for Wine. Most users can leave them at default, and Wine will use your Linux settings.

, You can install any Windows application as if you were using Windows. If you're downloading an installer, place it somewhere on your computer that's easily accessible.

, If you are installing from a disc, see the next step.

, For example, if you downloaded a file named ""itunes_installer.exe"", you would type wine itunes_installer.exe and press ↵ Enter. This will run the program as if you were using Windows.


If you want to install a program from a disc, make sure that the disc drive has a drive letter assigned in Wine and then type the following command: wine start 'D:\setup.exe'. Change the filename to whatever the actual filename is.

, The installation will proceed just as if you were installing it in Windows. If you are asked for an installation location, select C:\Program Files.

, Many Windows applications will create a shortcut much like they would in Windows, allowing you to easily start them by double-clicking.

, If installing the program didn't create a shortcut, you can use the Terminal to start it up.Navigate to the location of the program's executable file. For example: /home/user/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Apple.
Type {{kbd|wine progamname.extension and press ↵ Enter to start the program. For example: wine itunes.exe


, If you'd rather not type in the Wine command into the Terminal each time you want to start it, you can create a shortcut on your desktop.


Right-click on your desktop and select ""Create launcher"".
Select an icon from the list or add your own.
In the ""Command"" field, type wine progam-location/program.extension. The location is where the program's executable file is located. For example: wine /home/user/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/itunes.exe.
Uncheck the ""Run in terminal"" box.

, Do this by clicking on the Download Ubuntu button; here you can choose between the 32 and 64 bit versions, and will find instructions on how to burn them to a CD.


The CD image is about 700 MB.

You can find detailed instructions on the Ubuntu Download Page. After a minute or two, you should see a windows that asks whether you want to try or install Ubuntu. Choose the 'Try Ubuntu' option, and in another minute, you should see the basic Ubuntu desktop. You should have access to most of your hardware, including network, sound, and graphics. Some older video cards and wifi cards may have compatibility issues; in this case you might want to check the LinuxQuestions Hardware Compatibility List, as well as asking about your hardware on the Ubuntu Forums.

, Assuming you booted into the live desktop properly, this is as simple as double-clicking the Install icon on the desktop. The install program will prompt you for your language, location, and keyboard layout before you get to the hard-disk partitioning section. When Ubuntu asks for a timezone, and you do not see your city simply click on a city that is near/in your timezone (e.g Vancouver, Canada instead of Seattle, United States). Partitioning your hard disk is the only step of the install process that has the potential to do serious harm. If you install to the wrong partition, you could accidentally nuke your Windows drive and all of its contents. That's why it is recommended to run a full backup before you start the install process. The safest way to install is to add a new hard drive or create free space on the existing drive. This is not always an option; you can re-size your partitions to free space using the sliders.

, If you wish, Ubuntu can bring over your Firefox bookmarks, music, photos, and documents from your Windows partition (if you are keeping the Windows Partition).

, You'll need to wait 20–40 minutes while the install completes and then finish by rebooting your PC and selecting the Ubuntu entry from the boot manager that was installed.

Decide how should vsftpd run.,Use the following section to fine tune the configuration file options to what your needs are.",How to Set Up vsftpd FTP on Ubuntu Linux1,"

Open up a command line and type sudo apt-get install vsftpd. You will be required to type in the root password and after that, just follow the instructions vsftpd gives you in order to install it.;
, There are several possible ways to do that. You can manipulate the configurations file using the windows or using the command line. See the vsftpd.conf file for all compiled-in defaults.

Open the vsftpd.conf configuration file with a text editor. The file is located in the etc directory.

If you are going to use windows, get to the file browser and type /etc in the location bar. Next scroll down and double click on a file named vsftpd.conf

If you prefer using the command line, then you can do a similar thing. Open up a terminal and type cp vsftpd.conf.sample vsftpd.conf after changing to the vsftpd directory.Replace the file's content with the text contained in the file /etc/vsftpd.conf example configuration file.

The default compiled-in settings are fairly paranoid. This sample file loosens things up a bit, to make the ftp daemon more usable.
This example file is not an exhaustive list of vsftpd's options.



, It also helps keep you more organized., This applies to other services (such as email), vsftpd can run either from an inetd or as a standalone daemon started from an initscript. To run in the standalone mode, enable the listen option in the configuration file by adding listen=YES or changing the value to YES if the option is already added and have the default value NO.,"
"
listen_ipv6, whether to run as standalone with IPv6.,
anonymous_enable, whether to allow anonymous FTP.,
local_enable, whether local logins are permitted.,
write_enable, whether to allow any FTP commands which change the file system such as stor, dele, rnfr, rnto, mkd, rmd, appe and site

Allowed values: Boolean
Default value: NO

,
anon_upload_enable, whether to allow the anonymous FTP user to upload files.,
anon_mkdir_write_enable, whether you want the anonymous FTP user to be able to create new directories.,
dirmessage_enable, whether to activate directory messages - messages given to remote users when they go into a certain directory.,
xferlog_enable, whether to activate logging of uploads/downloads.,
xferlog_std_format, whether to have your log file in standard ftpd xferlog format.,
connect_from_port_20, whether to make sure PORT transfer connections originate from port 20 (ftp-data).,

,
local_umask.",How to Set Up vsftpd FTP on Ubuntu Linux2," Unlike the listen parameter, vsftpd will listen on an IPv6 socket instead of an IPv4 one. This parameter and the listen parameter are mutually exclusive.

Allowed values: Boolean (YES/NO)

Allowed values: Boolean
Default value: NO (in the sample configuration file, it is enabled)

, Not recommended for security (the code is non-trivial). Not enabling it, however, may confuse older FTP clients.

Allowed values: Boolean
Default value: NO

, By default the server will pretend to allow ASCII mode but in fact ignore the request. Turn on the below options to have the server actually do ASCII mangling on files when in ASCII mode. Beware that on some FTP servers, ASCII support allows a denial of service attack (DoS) via the command ""SIZE /big/file"" in ASCII mode. vsftpd predicted this attack and has always been safe, reporting the size of the raw file. ASCII mangling is a horrible feature of the protocol.

Allowed values: Boolean
Default value: NO

, If you want, you can arrange for uploaded anonymous files to be owned by a different user. Note! Using ""root"" for uploaded files is not recommended!

Allowed values: chown_uploads is Boolean, chown_username is a username string

Default value: nobody

,

Allowed values: String
Default value: none - default vsftpd banner is displayed

, Apparently useful for combating certain DOS attacks.

Allowed values: File path string for banned_email_file and Boolean for deny_email_enable
Default value: NO for deny_email_enable and /etc/vsftpd.banned_emails for banned_email_file

,

Allowed values: Boolean
Default value: NO

, You may specify an explicit list of local users to chroot() to their home directory. If chroot_local_user is YES, then this list becomes a list of users to NOT chroot().

Allowed values: File path string for chroot_list_file and Boolean for chroot_list_enable
Default value: NO for chroot_list_enable and /etc/vsftpd.chroot_list for chroot_list_file

, This is disabled by default to avoid remote users being able to cause excessive I/O on large sites. However, some broken FTP clients such as ""ncftp"" and ""mirror"" assume the presence of the ""-R"" option, so there is a strong case for enabling it.

Allowed values: Boolean
Default value: NO

, Some of vsftpd's settings don't fit the Debian filesystem layout by default. These settings are more Debian-friendly. This option should be the name of a directory which is empty. Also, the directory should not be writable by the ftp user. This directory is used as a secure chroot() jail at times vsftpd does not require file system access.

Allowed values: File path string
Default value: /usr/share/empty

,

Allowed values: string
Default value: ftp

,, Default umask for local users is 077. You may wish to change this to 022, If your users expect that (022 is used by most other ftpd's)

Install KDE Kubuntu.,
Install Ubuntu Server;

Normally when you install Kubuntu you download one of the Kubuntu ISO images and make the CD and then install it on the system.,
Update the Installation

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

,
Install X-Server, KDM, KDE-Core Pmount and Synaptic;

Obviously we need to install the X-Server and KDE.,
Use Synaptic To Install Core Software

Add the following to your sources.list file

# Remastersys
deb http://www.remastersys.klikit.com/repository/ remastersys/


We need some software installed to handle key factors like sound automount and many other things.,
Remove the Server Kernel

There is one thing we have to clean up when using this install method, and that is the kernel.,
Install Additional Packages

NOTE: You may want to use Remastersys to create a core system ISO image before installing more packages.,
Create A Test Account To See Your Default Setting Changes

Use your current account as the working account where we do all the changes, editing and configuration changes.,
Set Default Kicker Options

NOTE: If you plan on using kicker_kickoff_1, or any other menu system outside of the standard KDE Menu, in your distribution install it now before continuing with the rest of this step.,
Select Your Default Cursor Theme;

Setting of the default cursor is much easier now.,
Setup the Desired Default Desktop Icons

To setup default Desktop Icons (The icons every new user will see when they first login) simply setup icons on your working desktop, use the Kiosk Admin Tool and click on 'Setup Profile' Select 'Desktop Icons' and click 'Setup Desktop Icons' then click 'Save'.,
Set the Default Icon Theme

To set default Icons in KDE so that all new (first time users) start with your selected Icon Theme right click on the desktop and select run command.,
Set Default Background Image

Setting the default background image hand edit the following:

/etc/kde-profile/default/share/config/kdesktoprc
Here we are concerned with two entries:

Wallpaper=
WallpaperMode=


In my case the entries look like this:
Wallpaper=/usr/share/wallpapers/Jewell.png
WallpaperMode=Scaled


Kiosk Admin Tool will also do this but it's a bit more time consuming.

,
Set the Default Theme and Color Scheme

The absolute best way to setup and install a color scheme is to use the Kiosk Admin Tool.,
Set the Default K splash Theme

You will have to create the file that sets the default K-Splash theme.,
Set the KDM Theme

Unfortunately the kdmrc file on this setup is bad.,
Login Manager Settings

Like KDM this is a global setting so it's a quick and simple one.,
Set Default Sounds

You will have to create the file that sets the default sounds.,
Clean Up For ISO Creation

Once you have tested and are satisfied with everything then remove and delete the test user account.,
Create the ISO Image

Using Remastersys is pretty straightfoward.",How to Make a Fully Customized Live KDE CD/DVD Using Kubuntu,"

The main issue of trying to get a customized KDE Kubuntu based distribution is dealing with many of the hidden default settings in Kubuntu to begin with. Ideally it would be much easier to have a base KDE install where those defaults are not present. Fortunately there is a way to do this using the Ubuntu Repositories.;
, However, whether you use the Live CD, or the Alternate Install CD you are going to end up with the default setting we don't want.
In order to avoid getting those configuration files installed one needs to do the installation through another method. That method is to simply use the Ubuntu Server Edition CD instead. The server Edition does not install the X-Server and therefore does not install a GUI. Because of this we can install KDE clean and without the messy Kubuntu default settings.
Download the Ubuntu Server Edition ISO file and create the CD from the image. On the selected machine install the Ubuntu Server. When asked what additional services you wish to install do not select any. This will install only the core Ubuntu components and base files on the system.

,, However, it has to be done correctly or we may as well have used the Kubuntu CDs. Since we only have a command line at this point we will have to utilize it. Login and at the prompt and type the following command EXACTLY as I have it here;

sudo apt-get install x org kdm kde-core pmount synaptic -y


After the installation completes run the following command

sudo shutdown -r now



, The current installation is extremely minimal and would require a great amount of time to go through and individually find all the correct packages needed. So I have used Synaptic to create a recovery file of all the software you need for your core install system.
Click Reload in Synaptic to update the apt sources.
In Synaptic go to File >> Read Markings >> browse to the file BaseBuild that was included in the archive along with this file.
Click Apply

, Since we used the server edition for the base install we have the server kernel. As we are either building a Desktop System, or a Demonstration System (as is the case with me) we certainly don't need the server kernel.
The core packages file installed the 2.4.26-18-generic kernel packages (latest at time of this how to) so use synaptic to remove all of the old 2.4.6-xx-server kernel packages on your machine. (Use Completely Remove option to purge them.)

, This will allow you to have a clean base install to work from if you want to create different types of Kubuntu Based Distributions.
At this point I am going to let you play on your own. We are going to install the software packages we want to be included on our CD/DVD ISO image. It is completely your choice of what to install. You know what you want to have on your live CD/DVD. There is one important note about what you install though. DO NOT INSTALL ANY PACKAGE THAT WILL SETUP THE KUBUNTU DEFAULTS. If you do then the rest of this How To will become useless for use as I am basing it on a build that is free of these default settings.
Final word of warning, be careful on what you include in your customized distribution. Especially if you include non-open source packages. Some of these by their license must be installed separately by the end user. Also note, even including some open source packages may prove an issue because of some legal restrictions. If you are not sure about some things research, ask in a forum, ask those who also make distributions, etcetera. Do not land yourself in hot water for illegal distribution of software.
Finally to assist you here is a copy of my sources.list file:

There is a known problem in Hardy Heron, Kaffeine is broken and will not function fully. It is best to not include it until it is fixed. If you have it installed you should purge all kaffeine files from your system or you will have issues. (This will be updated when kaffeine is fixed)



, You will also need a test account to see how things come together as you do them. Test often (you should test each time you make a change to the default desk configuration) and make sure everything is coming together as you planned. Each time you make a change use 'Krusader' or some other File manager in root mode and clean out the entire home folder (including the hidden folders, especially) of your test account. When you do that it will repopulate with new default folders and when you log into it will be as if you logged in for the first time. The reasoning and purpose of this is so we can see what a new user will experience when they use the Live CD/DVD for the first time. Since our global settings will only affect a new user we must make KDE think your test account has never been logged into before each time we use it.
Your initial desktop should look nothing like a standard Kubuntu desktop. Which is good because we can now modify it in any manner we choose. The following steps will take you from this to your final layout step by step. In some cases I will tell you to hand edit the files and in others I will have you use the Kiosk Admin Tool. There are some cases where you can use either method, and I will mention that. However, based on my experiences while putting this How To together I will emphasize what I feel is the better method of the two.

, Make sure all panel applets you wish to use are also installed.
Most everything we want to do with the kicker panel needs to be done via the Kiosk Admin Tool. The final part of this step will require the hand editing of a file. You will see and understand why when we get to that.
Start by opening the Kiosk Admin Tool. You will find it under 'System' in the programs section of the KDE Menu.
The default profile should be the only one listed and highlighted. Click on 'Setup Profile' to start. Then click 'Panel' you will get a notice click 'OK' to continue. Click 'Setup Panel' to begin configuring the Global default settings of the kicker panel. Just as if you were on your own desktop right click on kicker to bring up the options. Start with 'Configure Panel' Here you can set the panel looks and operations. When you are all done setting up the panel use the 'Add Applet to Panel” to select what Applets you want starting up and arrange them on the panel where you want. Go back to 'Configure Panel' to make any final adjustments. When done with that click on 'Save' in Kiosk Admin Tool to save your changes. Now use the following command to do a bit of hand editing to your default settings;
kdesu kate /etc/kde-profile/default/share/config/kickerrc
Look at the line labeled Untrusted Applets= and see what's listed there. If any applet you have previously selected is listed there then remove it from this line.

, First make sure that you have installed the cursor theme you wish to use as the default.
The following information is from Debian Admin
If you want to change the default cursor theme first you need to install one of the available cursor themes

crystalcursors
dmz-cursor-theme
xcursor-themes
comixcursors
Chameleon-custor-theme
Big-cursor
For example i am installing crystal cursors
aptitude install crystalcursors


This will complete the installation.
Now you need to run the update-alternative to set/change the current cursor-theme, when prompted give the number of the theme and press enter.
sudo update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme
There are 24 alternatives which provide `x-cursor-theme’.
Selection Alternative

/etc/X11/cursors/core.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/redglass.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/whiteglass.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/handhelds.theme
+ 5 /etc/X11/cursors/crystalblue_classic.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalblue_nonanim.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalblueleft.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalblueleft_classic.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalblueleft_nonanim.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalgray.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalgray_nonanim.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalgrayleft.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalgrayleft_nonanim.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalgreen.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalgreen_classic.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalgreen_nonanim.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalgreenleft.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalgreenleft_classic.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalgreenleft_nonanim.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalwhite.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalwhite_nonanim.theme
22 /etc/X11/cursors/crystalwhiteleft.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalwhiteleft_nonanim.theme
/etc/X11/cursors/crystalblue.theme


Press enter to keep the default, or type selection number: 23
Using ‘/etc/X11/cursors/crystalwhiteleft_nonanim.theme’ to provide ‘x-cursor-theme’

, This will create the file structure the default profile will use to set the default settings. Using Krusader (or some other file manager) in root mode copy the files from your working desktop directory to /etc/kde-profile/default/share/apps/kdedesktop (or kdesktop)/Desktop/
If you want functional Icons for System, Home and Trash then simply cut and past each of the following into new text files on your desktop to create them. Each one should have its own file and it should be named appropriately:

Comment=Home Folder
Encoding=UTF-8
Icon=folder_home
Name=Home
Type=Link
URL=system:/home
-----------------------------------
Comment=Contains removed files
EmptyIcon=trashcan_empty
Encoding=UTF-8
Icon=trashcan_full
Name=Trash
Type=Link
URL=trash:/
-------------------------------------
Comment=System Folder
Encoding=UTF-8
Icon=system
Name=System
Type=Link
URL=system:/


Once the above files are created then copy them to the Before mentioned directory. Once copied all new (first time) users will get the Icons for System, Home and Trash on their desktop.
NOTE: I recommend you at least put the Trash Icon on new desktops.

, Enter the following into the dialog box:

kdesu kedit /etc/kde-profile/defaults/share/config/kdeglobals

Just above the section add the following:
Theme=name of the Icon Theme you wish to use
In my case the entry looks like this
Theme=oxygen




All new users I setup on my system will now default to the Oxygen Icon Theme set for KDE3 when they first login.

,, It will allow to bring up the theme dialog. Whether you create your own color scheme or use an existing one use of the Kiosk Admin Tool is safest and most efficient way to import or select the color default and theme. Same with Style and Windows Decorations. Once you have setup the decorations, style and color themes click on save and exit .Kiosk Admin Tool. Test and see all your work come together in the test account.

, To do so use the following command:

kdesu kate /etc/kde-profile/default/share/config/ksplashrc


Simply put in the following two lines:

Theme=name of ksplash theme


Save the file.

, Since its easier to replace it than to fix it I am including a copy of my kdmrc file in this package. Simply take my kdmrc and as root copy it to /etc/kde3/kdm and over write the current kdmrc file. Then edit the file by hand:
kdesu kate /etc/kde3/kdm/kdmrc
Look for the line Theme= and place the path to and the name of the KDM theme there. You will be glad to know you will be able to use the KDM theme manager after that. Because the KDM theme setting is global that's all you need to do.

, In Kcontrol under 'System Administration' select 'Login Manager'. Click on 'Administrator Mode' and then enter your password. Click the 'Background' tab and select the background you want displayed. I personally like to choose the same background as the one in my default settings. You can choose whatever you want of course.

, Use the following command to do so:

kdesu kate /etc/kde-profile/default/share/config/knotify.eventsrc


I suggest you cut and past the following into it:

presentation=1
soundfile=/usr/share/sounds/KDE_Logout_new.wav
presentation=1
soundfile=/usr/share/sounds/KDE_Startup_new.wav


Now lets look at this one a bit. It took me awhile to figure this out. Unlike other configuration settings this is not a simple if else function, where if the user has settings use them else use default. In other words this works very differently from the other configurations and we need to know what is happening.
Lets look at the knotify.eventsrc file in my home directory here:

commandline=
logfile=
presentation=1
soundfile=
commandline=
logfile=
presentation=1
soundfile=
commandline=
logfile=
presentation=1
soundfile=
commandline=
logfile=
presentation=1
soundfile=
commandline=
logfile=
presentation=16
soundfile=
commandline=
logfile=
presentation=0
soundfile=
commandline=
logfile=
presentation=2
soundfile=
commandline=
logfile=
presentation=1
soundfile=KDE_Logout_3.ogg
commandline=
logfile=
presentation=2
soundfile=
commandline=
logfile=
commandline=
logfile=
presentation=65
soundfile=KDE_Chimes_2.ogg
commandline=
logfile=
presentation=1
soundfile=KDE_Error_1.ogg
commandline=
logfile=
presentation=65
soundfile=KDE_Vox_Ahem.ogg
commandline=
logfile=
presentation=1
soundfile=KDE_Beep.ogg
commandline=
logfile=
presentation=2
soundfile=
commandline=
logfile=
commandline=
logfile=
presentation=2
soundfile=
Now lets look at Kubuntu's default knotify.eventsrc file that sets their default sounds.
presentation=65
soundfile=/usr/share/sounds/KDE_Error_1.ogg
presentation=1
soundfile=/usr/share/sounds/kubuntu-login.ogg
Carefully look at the user file then look at the default file. You will notice that the lines in the default file fill in the missing lines from the user's file. For example The KDE startup sound is defined in our default file but the lines in the default file do not exist in the users file.
This is a typical entry for an event sound in the users file:
<< Name of Event
commandline=
logfile=
presentation=2
soundfile=<<path and name of soundfile
If we have a defined default sound then last two lines are removed and those lines are read from the default file making this an if then process. If the presentation and soundfile lines are not present in file <a> then read from file <b>. Which makes for a somewhat confusing scenario.
Add to that any attempt to dig up actual documentation on the file enteries utterly failed. The only thing I could find out is if you set presentation=0 no sound will play for that event even if defined. So in other words I haven't a clue about the rest of the entries and I have no idea what effect the numbers under presentation= does. Though best guess is it's a time delay of some kind. Whatever means, well your guess is as good as mine on that.
So with all that in mind if you decide to define default sounds then here is what I suggest you do to ensure they work. Use the presentation= number as defined from the file I took from my ~/.kde/share/config/ folder.
In the file /etc/kde-profile/default/share/config/knotify.eventsrc make enteries like so:
presentation=number as defined in the list
soundfile=path/name to file
Do this for each event you want to have a default sound for.



, Now open a terminal and use the following command:

This document assumes that you might have another vendor version of Java installed on your Ubuntu Linux system, such as OpenJDK or Oracle Java which is common when you use Ubuntu Linux.,


,First, of all we will remove and disable other vendor versions of Java so there is no system conflict with multiple versions of Java.Let's assume you have OpenJDK installed on your system if so we are going to remove OpenJDK by issuing the following commands

,


,
To remove OpenJDK from your system issue the following command:



Type/Copy/Paste: sudo apt-get purge openjdk-\*
This command will completely remove OpenJDK/JRE from your system

,


,Second, we will disable Oracle Java if it is installed by editing the /etc/profile system PATH.In this exercise we will comment out the references to Oracle Java in the system wide /etc/profile file

,
I also recommend deleting the Oracle Java folders if you have them so they do not cause system conflicts.For example if you have Oracle Java installed in /usr/local/java follow these instructions to remove Oracle Java



Type/Copy/Paste: cd /usr/local/java

Type/Copy/Paste: rm -rf jdk1.7.0

Type/Copy/Paste: rm -rf jre1.7.0

,
If Oracle Java is installed on your system you will comment out the references to Oracle Java in the /etc/profile, .profile or .bashrc file.

,
For example, as root, use a text editor such as nano or gedit to edit your /etc/profile.,
You may have a file that looks like this:


JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk1.7.0
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin
JRE_HOME=/usr/local/java/jre1.7.0
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JRE_HOME/bin
export JAVA_HOME
export JRE_HOME
export PATH

,
You want to make sure you comment out the references to Oracle Java, using the ## symbol in your /etc/profile, .profile and .bashrc file so change the file to look like this:


##JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk1.7.0
##PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin
##JRE_HOME=/usr/local/java/jre1.7.0
##PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JRE_HOME/bin
##export JAVA_HOME
##export JRE_HOME
##export PATH

,Save the /etc/profile file and exit

,
Download the IBM Java 7.0 SDK and JRE


Note in order to download IBM SDK/JRE you will have to be a registered user, following the provided links from the IBM website in order to register.

,
Download the version of IBM Java SDK and JRE for your system architecture, in this case we are using the IBM Java SDK/JRE for 64 bit Ubuntu Linux, which is:


ibm-java-sdk-7.0-0.0-linux-x86_64.tgz
ibm-java-jre-7.0-0.0-linux-x86_64.tgz

,
Once the IBM Java SDK and JRE has been downloaded you will proceed to set up a development environment for the IBM JDK and JRE.,
Create a directory to hold the IBM Java SDK and JRE using the following command:



Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s mkdir -p /opt/ibm/java

Type/Copy/Paste: chmod -R 755 /opt/ibm/java
This makes the directory available to all users on the system

,
Change into the download directory and copy the IBM Java SDK and JRE to /opt/ibm/java/ directory



Type/Copy/Paste: cd /home/""your_user_name""/Downloads

Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s cp -r ibm-java-sdk-7.0-0.0-linux-x86_64.tgz /opt/ibm/java

Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s cp -r ibm-java-jre-7.0-0.0-linux-x86_64.tgz /opt/ibm/java

,
Next change into your IBM Java directory



Type/Copy/Paste: cd /opt/ibm/java

,
Make the compressed IBM Java binaries executable for all users on the system by running the following commands:



Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s chmod a+x ibm-java-sdk-7.0-0.0-linux-x86_64.tgz

Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s chmod a+x ibm-java-jre-7.0-0.0-linux-x86_64.tgz

,
Unpack the IBM Java SDK by issuing the following commands



Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s tar xvzf ibm-java-sdk-7.0-0.0-linux-x86_64.tgz

Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s tar xvzf ibm-java-jre-7.0-0.0-linux-x86_64.tgz

,
The IBM SDK and the JRE will unpack into a single directory called:


/opt/ibm/java/ibm-java-x86_64-70

,
Also, you need to edit the system wide PATH /etc/profile in order to create a system wide PATH for the IBM Java SDK/JRE on Ubuntu Linux.,
Enter the following information below:


export PATH=${PATH}:/opt/ibm/java/ibm-java-x86_64-70/bin:/opt/ibm/java/ibm-java-x86_64-70/jre/bin:$PATH

,Save the file and exit

,
Next, inform the system that IBM Java SDK JRE is available



Type/Copy/Paste: sudo update-alternatives --install ""/usr/bin/java"" ""java"" ""/opt/ibm/java/ibm-java-x86_64-70/jre/bin/java"" 1

Type/Copy/Paste: sudo update-alternatives --install ""/usr/bin/java"" ""javaws"" ""/opt/ibm/java/ibm-java-x86_64-70/jre/bin/javaws"" 1

Type/Copy/Paste: sudo update-alternatives --install ""/usr/bin/javac"" ""javac"" ""/opt/ibm/java/ibm-java-x86_64-70/bin/javac"" 1

,
Inform your Ubuntu Linux system, that IBM Java SDK/JRE must be the default Java.,
Also reload your system wide PATH /etc/profile by typing the following command:

,
Type/Copy/Paste: .,
Test to see if IBM Java installed correctly by using the command:



Type/Copy/Paste: java -version

,
You should receive a message that displays:

,,,,,,,,, If you have references to the Oracle Java JDK/JRE in those files comment them out using the ## symbol.



Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s nano /etc/profile
or

Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s gedit /etc/profile

,,,,,, Create a directory to hold the IBM Java SDK and JRE then we will move the downloaded IBM Java SDK and JRE, to /opt/ibm/java directory. Then we will unpack the Java SDK and JRE.

,,,,,,, Use a text editor such as nano or gedit and edit the file.



Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s nano /etc/profile
or

Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s gedit /etc/profile

,,,, Also inform the system that IBM Java javac compiler must be the default compiler.



Type/Copy/Paste: sudo update-alternatives --set java /opt/ibm/java/ibm-java-x86_64-70/bin/java

Type/Copy/Paste: sudo update-alternatives --set javaws /opt/ibm/java/ibm-java-x86_64-70/bin/javaws

Type/Copy/Paste: sudo update-alternatives --set javac /opt/ibm/java/ibm-java-x86_64-70/bin/javac

Configure the software to install the Edubuntu image you downloaded.,
Click ""OK"" in UNetBootin or ""Make startup disk"" in Startup Disk Creator.,
Power off your computer.,
If you unplugged your USB stick, plug it back in now.,
Turn the computer back on and quickly press the key to enter the Boot Menu.,
Once presented with the first screen, select ""Install Edubuntu"".,
Follow the rest of the installation process.,
Finish up and watch the installation slide show.,
Reboot your computer and start using Edubuntu.",How to Install Edubuntu," Although Linux distributions are usually very flexible, it is still a good idea to make sure your computer meets the minimum requirements. Your computer must have:


A processor of 1GHz or more
A minimum of 512MB of RAM. 1GB or more is recommended.
20GB of disk space or more depending on the options you choose.
If you want to use the netbook interface, you will need a graphics card that supports 3D acceleration on Ubuntu. Most netbooks are supported so you shouldn't have many problems.;
, If you are planning on replacing your current OS with Edubuntu, all of your files will be deleted and your hard drive will be wiped clean. If you are planning on dual-booting your computer with Edubuntu, then you still should back up your files as things can go wrong in the installation process.

, The USB stick should have at least 2GB of space. If you don't have a USB stick, then you can use a CD to install the OS. This USB stick should be formatted as FAT32

, Startup Disk Creator is the best option for people using Ubuntu as it comes pre-installed. The other option would be to install UNetBootin (Linux, Mac and Windows) from its website.

, Depending on your internet speed, this could take some time. Here you will be able to choose over downloading the 64-bit ISO file (newer computers) or the 32-bit ISO file (almost all computers).

, Again, you need to format this USB stick as FAT32. If you have any important files on your USB stick, back them up now.

,


On Ubuntu, you can open the Dash and enter ""startup disk creator"" or ""unetbootin"" depending on what you want to use.
On Windows or Mac, search for ""unetbootin"" and select it when the rocket with the title UNetBootin shows up.

, The process in UNetBootin and Startup Disk Creator are pretty much the same.


In Startup Disk Creator, click the ""others"" button under Source disc image (.iso), navigate to the Downloads folder and select ""edubuntu-14.04.4-dvd-.iso"". Then, select the USB stick you want to use to install Edubuntu.
In UNetBootin, click on the Diskimage radio button. Then, ensure that ISO is selected from the first drop-down menu and click the ""..."" button. Next, navigate to the downloads folder and open ""edubuntu-14.04.4-dvd-.iso"" as you would in Startup Disk Creator. Finally, make sure that Type is set to USB Drive and then select your USB stick from the Drive drop-down menu.

, Your live USB is now being made. This may take a while to load depending on how fast your computer is.

, Make sure your computer is completely off. If you are reading this article on the computer you are trying to install Edubuntu on, get out another computer or device and open up this page.

, Your USB stick will need to be plugged in for the entirety of the installation.

, This key is usually F2, F12, Esc or Del. When the motherboard manufacturer splash-screen shows up, this key should be listed at the bottom of the screen. The Boot menu might be hidden in the BIOS menu as well.


You only get about a second or less to do this, so be quick! If you don't get to do it in time, that's OK. You can simply turn your computer off and try again.
Once you get to the Boot Menu, select your USB stick. This could be displayed as the name you have chosen for your USB or something along the lines of ""USB Removable Disk"" or ""USB-"".

, Optionally, you can try Edubuntu without installing to see whether it's your thing or not, check the disk for defects or test the memory.

, The next part is as simple as selecting the options that are best fit for you and clicking the next button.


When you get to the ""Preparing to install Edubuntu"" section, select ""Download updates while installing"" and ""Install third-party software"" (requires an internet connection).
When you get to the ""Disk Setup"" section, click ""Erase disk and install Edubuntu"". If you want to dual-boot Edubuntu with another OS, then you will need to create and / or resize partitions.

, The rest of the installation will be automated and it should take around 15 to 20 minutes to complete. The slide show will list some features of Edubuntu.

, Now the installation is complete, and Edubuntu is installed on your system. You can reboot your computer and start using the new OS, your you can continue testing it from the USB.

Get involved with other resources.",How to Get Familiar With Ubuntu Commands,"



sudo (""superuser do"") - Allows you to run other commands with administrative privileges. This is useful when, for example, you need to modify files in a directory that your user wouldn't normally have access to.

cd (""change directory"") - Changes the directory you are currently working in. You can use full paths to folders or simply the name of a folder within the directory you are currently working. Some common uses:


cd / - Takes you to the root directory.

cd .. - Takes you up one directory level.,

cd - - Takes you to the previous directory.



pwd (""print working directory"") - Displays the directory you are currently in.

ls (""list"") - Lists all files and folders in your current working directory. You can also specify paths to other directories if you want to view their contents.

cp (""copy"") - Allows you to copy a file. You should specify both the file you want copied and the location you want it copied to - for example, cp foo /home/john would copy the file ""foo"" to the directory ""/home/john"".

mv (""move"") - Allows you to move files. You can also rename files by moving them to the directory they are currently in, but under a new name. The usage is the same as cp - mv foo /home/john would move the file ""foo"" to the directory ""/home/john"".

rm (""remove"") - Removes the specified file.


rmdir (""remove directory"") - Removes an empty directory.

rm -r (""remove recursively"") - Removes a directory along with its content.



mkdir (""make directory"") - Allows you to create a new directory. You can specify where you want the directory created - if you do not do so, it will be created in your current working directory.

history - Displays all of your previous commands up to the history limit.;
,



man - Displays a ""manual page"" on the specified command. Manual pages are usually very detailed, and it's recommended that you read the man pages for any command you are unfamiliar with. Some common uses:


man man - Provides information about the manual itself.

man intro - Displays a brief introduction to Linux commands.



info - Similar to man, but often provides more detailed or precise information.

<command name> -h or <command name> --help provide a third alternative. While not as detailed as the info or man pages, this will provide a quick overview of the command and its uses.

,



df (display filesystem) - Displays information about the disk space usage of all mounted filesystems. df -h uses KB, MB, and GB, if this format is preferred.

du (directory usage) - Displays the size of a directory and all of its subdirectories. du -h can be used if KB, MB, and GB are preferred.

free - Displays the amount of free space available on the system. To view the information in MB, use free -m.

uname -a - Provides a wide range of basic information about the system.

top - Displays the processes using the most system resources at any given time. ""q"" can be used to exit.

,


The Up and Down arrow keys can be used to scroll through your command history, allowing you to quickly execute the same command multiple times.
The Tab key can be used to complete the command you are typing. If more than one command is possible, you can press it multiple times to scroll through the possible completions. If a very wide number of commands are possible, it can output a list of all possible completions.
Ctrl+r allows you to search your history for commands matching what you have typed.

, There are many more commands and terminal tricks than the basics listed here, allowing for a nearly endless amount of customizability and functionality. As with any pursuit, the best way to become proficient with Ubuntu commands is to learn by doing and to get involved in the community! The Ubuntu Forums are an excellent resource for any budding command line user.

Join a Ubuntu IRC channel.,
Ask someone you know.,
Determine your problem.,
Explain your problem in detail.,
Be specific.,
Aim to make your question helpful to others as well.,
Spell and grammar check your post.,
Declare what you have already tried.,
Ask for more information if needed.",How to Get Help for Ubuntu," Someone on any number of forum sites could have had the same problem as you. This person may or may not have found the solution. Try simply searching up any error code or issue you are having. Usually Google is the best for this, as you may be looking through several websites and it has the best indexing.


For an example, let's say that Firefox is crashing every time you try to launch it. Try searching ""firefox crashed on launch in ubuntu"". Be as straightforward as possible.
If someone else seems to have the same problem as you but hasn't yet found the solution, tell them! If someone sees that many people are having the same problem, this will encourage someone to attempt to solve it. If it seems to affect every user, it's probably a bug.;
, Ask Ubuntu is the official, community driven website (part of the Stack Exchange network) for people looking to ask questions about Ubuntu. You can ask your question for free with an account that you can sign up for using an email, Google, Yahoo! or Facebook.


If you are planning on using Ask Ubuntu to search for help, be sure you read the How to Ask page as the community tries really hard to keep questions specific and on-topic.

, The Ubuntu Forums is the official forum website to discuss everything Ubuntu related. This website would be better than something like Ask Ubuntu if your question is more broad. You can sign up for the Ubuntu Forums using a Ubuntu One account.

, The advantage of using IRC instead of something like Ask Ubuntu is that it is real-time. If the people on the IRC channel need more information to solve your problem, then this can be done in a matter of seconds. You can find a list of Ubuntu IRC channels at the Ubuntu Wiki IRC Channel List.

, If you have a friend or know someone who might be able to help you, ask them! It might help to have someone you trust there helping you live instead of over the internet.

, Most - if not all - of the support you will get will be from the community. For this reason, you will need to explain your problem in a way the community will understand and hopefully be able to help you on.

, Try and make it as easy as possible for the individual trying to solve your problem. If they ask for more information and you can supply it (for an example, error logs or console output), give it to them. The more detailed your question is, the quicker you will get a response.

, Depending on where you are asking your question, being specific can be very important. Although broad questions are good for discussion, this may make it harder for the person to offer help.

, Keep in mind that others who have the same problem may read what you have posted. Although this step is optional, many people will thank you.

, You are aiming to make your question as readable and clear as possible for the best results. There are many online tools you can use to check spelling and grammar like Grammarly and Spell Check Plus.

, If you have attempted to follow a tutorial on how to solve the problem, link it! This will prevent people from giving you a solution that you have already tried and it will give them a better idea of what is going on.


If you have run commands in attempt to solve the problem, copy and paste the terminal output into your post. Depending on the question, they might ask you to do this anyway, so this will cut out the middle-man and get you an answer quicker.

, Don't be afraid to ask for more information if the provided solution doesn't work. Depending on the size of your question, it may take several solutions to get an answer that completely solves the problem.

Familiarize yourself with the Apple Menu.,
Be aware of which application you're working in when you use the menu bar.,
Learn to kill crashed programs.,
Take advantage of System Preferences.",How to Switch from Windows to Mac OS X," This is an essential part of OS X, similar to Windows' Start Menu and Taskbar. The Dock is how you launch new applications, or switch to ones that are already open. It is also where a window goes when minimized. It is usually at the bottom of the screen, though it can be moved to either side. The Trash Can is also here, which functions exactly as the Windows Recycle Bin.;
,


For example, the window control buttons in OS X are on the left side of the window instead of the right, and the green button makes the window enter full screen mode.
To right-click on a Mac without a right-click button, you can either click and hold an item you'd like a menu for, you can hold the Control button while you click (which works more often), or you can enable right-click in System Preferences > Mouse. The Magic Mouse will sense the position of your finger and allow you to right-click.
If you use keyboard shortcuts, learn the new ones on a Mac. For the most part, they're nearly identical to Windows shortcuts, except that where Windows uses the Control Key, Macs use the Command Key, which is next to the spacebar, and is marked with a ⌘. The function keys (F1-F16) also add extra quick features.

, This operates a lot like Windows Explorer, and for daily tasks, you should be able to adjust to it easily. Remember the different names for folders on a Mac, ""My Documents"" is ""Home"", ""Program Files"" is ""Applications"", etc.

, It is toggled by the apple icon in the top left-hand corner of the screen, and is the button you will need to click to shut down the computer, put it to sleep, access the System Preferences, and Force Quit applications, as well as several other tasks.

, In Windows, the menu bar for each application appears in the window itself. In OS X, the menu bar for the selected window always appears at the top of the screen. The application's name appears in bold, and by clicking on it, you can control the app's preferences and other general tasks.

, Like any operating system, sometimes programs crash unexpectedly. When that happens, press ⌘S (Command+S) to attempt to save your work. Then click and hold the crashed program's icon on the dock. From the pop-out menu, click Force Quit. If this doesn't work, you can press ⌥⌘Esc (Command+Option+Esc). This is the equivalent of Windows' Control+Alt+Delete.

, You can open it by clicking on the Apple Menu and selecting System Preferences. Similar to Windows' Control Panel, System Preferences allows you to oversee every aspect of your Mac, from security, to hardware, to design. There are even some features that can make OS X more comfortable to Windows users. Make your Mac your own!

, This album will display all of the different people that Photos has recognized in your pictures. When you open this for the first time after upgrading to macOS Sierra, you'll have to wait a bit while your photos are scanned.


For large libraries of photos, it may take a day or more for all of your pictures to be scanned and analyzed for faces.
Faces are not synced between your Macs and iOS devices for security reasons. If you've already set up faces on your iOS device, you'll have to do it again on your macOS device., Photos will scan your pictures and attempt to group images of the same person. If you have a lot of photos with faces, you'll likely have a lot of different results here. Oftentimes, Photos will not completely recognize the people in your pictures, so you may end up with lots of duplicate people.

Click the person to display all of their photos.
Right-click on the picture that you want to make into the Key Face.
Select ""Make Key Face."" This will change the picture that is displayed for that person in the People album.

, If there are too many people in your People list, you can hide the unimportant ones:


Select all of the faces you want to hide by holding ⌘ Command and clicking each one.
Right-click your selection and click ""Hide.""

, This album will only appear if you have photos that have been geotagged. When you open the ""Places"" album, a map will appear with pins for your different sets of photos., The number next to the pin indicates how many pictures were taken at that location.

, You can click and drag the map to move around, or scroll up and down to zoom in and out. You can also click the ""+"" and ""-"" buttons to zoom.


As you zoom out, pictures from different locations will be gathered together. For example, when you're zoomed in on your home town, you may see a bunch of different pins for the photos you've taken. When you zoom out, they'll all be collected into a single pin for your town.

, You can click the ""Map,"" ""Satellite,"" and ""Grid"" buttons in the upper-right corner to switch between views. This functions much like the Maps app.

, This is directly below the ""Photos"" option at the top.

, You can type a name to find all the pictures of a specific person. The results will be based on the people you've added to the People album.

, This will search for all photos taken in a location. Only photos that have been geotagged when they were taken will appear in these results. You'll see memories and locations in the search results.

, You can type ""smiling,"" ""angry,"" and other expressions into the search field and Photos will attempt to find pictures that match. This can be finicky, but expect this functionality to improve over time.

, For example, you could type ""Water"" into the search and Photos will attempt to find all pictures with water in them. As another example, you could type ""Tuxedo"" and find all of the pictures of people wearing tuxes. Like the expressions search, this may be hit or miss for now."

, Under the new Advanced options, you'll see a smaller window with the header Settings. Scroll down until you hit Locally Administered Address. Click on it.

, Once you've clicked on Locally Administered Address, you'll see some text within a yellow background. It'll say something along the lines of Change the MAC Address used by the network adapter. This indicates the option of changing your MAC Address.

, Right next to the Settings window, you'll see space provided under the header Value. That's where you'll be typing in a new combination of characters to change your address. Before typing in a new value, you should take a look at the combination of your current MAC Address.

, Go to the Start button, and click on it. You'll note a search bar on the bottom, below All Programs. Type in cmd, and look to the top of the search results within the same window. You'll see something labeled as cmd.exe. Click on it.


A new, black window with some text will appear.

, Looking at the window, note where a blank underscore blinks off and on. That's the space you can type in. Type getmac, and press enter.


A list of Physical Addresses will appear. The first address is your current MAC Address.

, Now, you can change your current MAC Address to a new one by following the format of your current address (12 characters total), and changing the numbers and letters. You may arbitrarily use letter combinations from A to F, and any numbers. Under Value, type in your new address.


For example, if the first 4 characters are arranged as F1-D2 you can change them to F4-D1. Perform the same action for the remaining characters. You're maintaining the format, but changing the combination.

, The Advanced options window will disappear, and you'll see some movement in the Local Area Connection under the Network Connections tab.


At first, you'll see a red cross next to Local Area Connection and it'll say Disabled, or Unplugged. This means the system is registering a change.
After only a few seconds, you'll see the red cross vanish and the Local Area Connection will be Enabled. You have successfully spoofed your MAC Address.

In OS X (i.e. on your computer), click on the Apple menu (looks like an apple with a bite out of it) at the upper left of your Mac desktop.
In iOS (i.e. on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch), you’ll want to have it open and be on your home screen.;
, In OS X, you’ll select this from the menu that drops down when you click on the Apple icon. In Yosemite, “System Preferences” is the second option from the top, but this may differ depending on which OS X you have — for example, in Mavericks, it’s fourth from the top.


In iOS, tap the “Settings” icon on your home screen (it may also be in a folder, depending on whether you’ve moved it). The “Settings” icon looks like a grey box with a darker grey gear inside of it.

, In OS X, click on the “Network” icon (in Yosemite, it’s on the third line down from the top), which looks like a navy blue globe with white lines webbing across it. On the left panel, you should see a list of options for connectivity. If you’re connected through Ethernet, it should say “Connected” under the Ethernet connection. The same goes for Wi-Fi.


In iOS, tap Wi-Fi (second line down in 8.4), which will open a menu to the right that lists networks. At the very top, to the right of the word “Wi-Fi”, there is a slider button that should be pushed to the right, with green next to it indicating that the Wi-Fi is on. Beneath that, you should see your network with a checkmark next to it and black bars to indicate a strong connection.

, In OS X, click the Apple menu again to show the drop-down menu, then select “About This Mac”. In Yosemite, this will open a pop-up window that shows details about your Mac. Near the bottom right of this window, click on the button that says “Software Update”, which will open the App store and show you available updates. (Again, note that this process may differ depending on which OS X you have.)


In iOS, in “Settings”, tap on “General” (7 lines down in iOS 8.4), which will open a menu to the right. Tap “Software Update”, which is two lines down, beneath “About”. This will automatically turn into a software update check.

, In the App store of OS X, you’ll see a list of apps that need to be updated. If Mail appears on the list, click “Update” at the lower right to begin the update. Close the window if Mail does not appear and you do not want to update the other software on the list.

, In OS X, the Mail icon looks like a postage stamp of a hawk. It should be either on your desktop or, more likely, in your doc (the menu bar that by default sits at the bottom of your screen). The Mail Setup Wizard should appear the first time you open up Mail.


In iOS 8, the Mail icon looks like a white envelope in a light blue box.
In OS X, if you don’t see the Mail icon, you’ll want to search for it in your “Applications” folder, which can be accessed by clicking anywhere on your empty desktop so that the word “Finder” appears in the menu bar at the top of your screen, then selecting “File”, “New Finder Window”, clicking on “Applications” in that window, then scrolling until you find “Mail”. To show “Mail” in your dock, click and drag it to where you want it to be.

, In both OS X and iOS, when you open Mail for the first time, you’ll be prompted to enter various details, starting with choosing which email account to add. Options include iCloud, Microsoft Exchange, Google, Yahoo!, Aol., and Other (this could include you work email address, for example).

, Your computer/mobile divide should automatically configure your email account from this point onward. Once it’s done, you’ll be able to see your email account’s inbox and any folders you may have in the main window of the Mail app.

, Just to make sure it works, send a test message by clicking on “New Message” in the top left of the Mail window (second from the right), enter your own email address into the “To” field, type “test” into the “Subject” and body fields, and then send it to yourself by clicking on the paper airplane icon in the top left corner of the New Message pop-up window.

, The setup wizard should automatically configure your email account, so once you’ve gone through the wizard, it shouldn’t be long before your inbox fills with messages from the account you added. Depending on your Internet connection and how much data you have saved in your email account, it may take a few minutes for the contents of your email account to show in Mail, so don’t panic if it doesn’t all download immediately after you’ve set it up!

, Ensure that you have the Mail app open and selected, so that in the top left corner of your screen, you see the word “Mail”. Click on “Mail” to show a drop-down menu.

, Selecting “Add Account” from the Mail drop-down menu will bring up the same Setup Wizard that you completed before in order to set up your first email account with Mail.

, As you did with your first email account, enter the relevant details into the Setup Wizard (i.e. your full name, email address/ID, and password). The app will automatically configure the account for you based on these details.

, Just to make sure it works, send a test message by clicking on “New Message” in the top left of the Mail window (second from the right), enter your own email address into the “To” field, type “test” into the “Subject” and body fields, and then send it to yourself by clicking on the paper airplane icon in the top left corner of the “New Message” pop-up window.

, As with the first account that you added, it may take a few minutes to import your messages, so don’t panic if you don’t see all of your messages right away.


If your other email account is open, you may need to scroll a bit to see the new account you’ve added. If you have a lot of folders in your email account, you might find it best to click on “Hide” (to the right of the account name in the scroll-down list) so that you can more quickly/easily see your second account.
To show your folders for an email account, drag the mouse pointer/arrow over to the right of the account name. It may currently have a number next to it (representing the number of unread messages in your inbox). Hover the pointer over that number, or in that area to the right of your account name, until the word “Show” appears, then click on it.

, The “Settings” icon looks like a grey box with a darker grey gear inside of it., In the Settings window that opens, scroll down the menu on the left side of the screen until you reach the line that says “Mail, Contacts, Calendars” (15 lines down in iOS 8), with the Mail icon in front of it. Tapping on this will open a window to the right in which you can edit your mail settings.

, In the “Mail, Contacts, Calendars” window, tap on “Add Account”, which should be the third line down from the top of the screen, beneath the “Accounts” heading. This will open a Setup Wizard that begins by asking you to select which account to add: iCloud, Exchange, Google, Yahoo!, Aol., Outlook, or Other (a work or school address, for example).


Details you’ll need include your full name, email address, password, and a description of the account (for example, My Yahoo! Account).
If all of your details are entered correctly, you'll see blue checkmarks next to each line before the Setup moves on.

, Once you’ve completed the Setup Wizard, you’ll be returned to the Settings screen. Click on your home button (the round button with the square inside of it that sits in the middle of the bottom of your iPad, iPhone or iPod touch) to return to your home screen, then tap the Mail icon to open the app.


You should see the names of your email accounts listed under the “Accounts” heading in the menu beneath “Mailboxes” on the left side of your screen.

, If you use a common email provider such as iCloud, Exchange, Google, Yahoo!, Aol., or Outlook, the Mail app will automatically configure your settings once you have entered your full name, email address, and password. If the Mail app does not does not automatically load your email settings, you’ll need to find them out before adding your email account to Mail.Examples of email accounts that may be classified as “other” when you add an account in Mail include work accounts (for example, yourname@nameofyourcompany.com), school accounts (yourname@nameofyourschool.co.uk), or your Facebook account (yourname@facebook.com).
If you are trying to add your work email address, contact your company’s IT support for the Incoming and Outgoing Mail Server Settings.
If you are a student, you may find that you can find your email settings online. Before calling your school’s IT department, do a search on your school’s website, including the words “email server settings”.
If you have an email address attached to your own business with a hosted website, you’ll likely find your email settings on the dashboard of your admin panel on the web host’s site.

, Open Mail on your device and select “Add Account” from either the drop-down menu in OS X, or the Mail, Contacts, Calendars menu under “Settings” in iOS.

,, Enter your full name, email address, and password, then click on “Create”.

, When the Setup Wizard doesn’t recognize your email server, it will say “Account must be manually configured”. Click “Next” to move forward and enter your account details manually.

, You’ll be given two options for “Account type”: IMAP or POP. Which one you choose depends on how you want your mailbox to behave. IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) temporarily downloads your emails to the Mail app, and any changes you make will be across the server (i.e. if you delete a Gmail message in Mail, it’ll also be deleted from the Gmail server); with POP (Post Office Protocol), your emails go straight to Mail and are not stored on the server (although you can configure settings to have copies left on the server as well).Be careful with POP as, unless you’ve specified otherwise, if you lose your emails locally (i.e. on your computer, in the Mail app), you’ll lose them completely, since they are not stored elsewhere on a server.

, Once you’ve selected an account type, enter your account details as prompted. You’ll want to have your email settings open/available so that you can easily copy them into the appropriate boxes.


Details will include: full name, email address, password, account type, incoming server, and outgoing server.

, Once you’ve completed setting up your account, send a test message to make sure it works."

Don't open any programs, save, create, or delete any files, and if the deleted file is on your startup drive, turn your computer off.

Data Rescue
FileSalvage

, If you can, install the data recovery program onto a disk drive in portable mode. This will allow you to connect the drive to your Mac and then run the program off of the USB drive, preventing anything on your hard drive from getting overwritten.

Select the drive that contained the file you accidentally deleted. You may be asked to specify the types of files you want the program to look for. Narrowing the search can increase the speed of the scan.


You may be able to choose from a Quick or Full/Deep scan. Try the Quick scan first to see if your file can be recovered, as the Full scan can take a significant amount of time. If you can't recover the file in the Quick scan, then give the Full scan a go.
Some data recovery programs come with an image that you can boot from. This has the potential to recover more files than scanning from within OS X.
If you are using PhotoRec, you will need to indicate the file system that the drive is using. You can select ""Other"" unless the disk has been formatted with the EXT2/EXT3 file system., After scanning your drive, you will be presented a list of files that can be recovered. File names will often be destroyed, so you may have to preview each file individually in order to find the one you want.


Not all files can be restored. You may have to sift through multiple files to find the one you want since file names will be unrecognizable.

, After selecting the files you want to recover, you will be prompted to save the files somewhere. If you still have more files to try to find, do not save them to the drive they were deleted from. Instead, save them to an external drive or another connected drive.


If trying to recover a large number of files, recover the most important ones first. Even the recovery process can overwrite and corrupt deleted files, so make sure you grab the ones you need the most first.

Restart your hackintosh.",How to Make a Hackintosh with Mac OS X Mavericks," To help you out, there is a Hackintosh buyer's guide so you can figure out what will and will not work. Follow that guide when choosing your hardware and you should be good to go. , Follow the guides diligently. Read your motherboard and case manuals closely and follow them carefully. You should have a functional machine in little time.

You can search for a guide on how to build a computer on wikiHow or on Google.

, This is generally an image with the name of your motherboard and indicators for a few keys you can press to edit your BIOS.


Before you can install OS X, you first have to make a few changes to the BIOS (your motherboard settings), so you're going to need to press the key that corresponds to the BIOS settings right after you power on your machine. This is almost always a function key (like F12) or the delete key, but reference your BIOS image to be sure. (Click the image to the left to see an example.)

Press and hold down that magic BIOS settings key and wait for the BIOS settings to load.



, For that reason, it is not possible to tell you, command-by-command, where to go to find and make certain adjustments. Here are the settings you will need to adjust (or at least verify) in your BIOS to make your hardware hackintosh-friendly:



Disable quick boot. You may have to look around for this, but it is often found this in a section titled Advanced BIOS Settings. Just look for a Quick Boot or Fast Boot option and ensure it is set to disabled.

Configure SATA as AHCI. By default, your motherboard will configure SATA as IDE and you'll need to change this to AHCI. In some cases you'll be asked if you want to do this when you boot up for the first time. If so, choose yes. If not, go into your BIOS and look for this setting and make the change for everything to work smoothly.

Change the boot device order. Your BIOS will default to a specific boot order, which means it'll look for a startup volume (where the operating system lives) in various places until it finds one. The boot order is the order in which it checks each location.

In general, you want to set your optical drive to first boot device so you can easily boot to a disc by simply putting it in the drive and turning on your machine. The second item in the order should be the hard drive or SSD where you're going to install OS X. The order beyond that isn't terribly important and is entirely up to you.


Adjust the hard disk boot priority. Some BIOS settings pages will also have a setting called Hard Disk Boot Priority. This is used to identify which hard drive to try to boot from first if there are multiple drives in the machine. If you install more than one drive in your hackintosh, be sure to set the Hard Disk Boot Priority to the drive where OS X will be installed.

, In most cases you'll only need to press the escape key a few times to get back to the main screen, and then F10 to save and exit. Your BIOS settings page will tell you which keys save, exit, and so on, so you should have no trouble figuring out the right keys to press.

, This is going to be a fairly in-depth process that requires a number of tools. Before getting started, be sure you have the following:


A copy of OS X Mavericks from the Mac App Store. (Make sure you have the latest version!)
An 8GB thumb drive (or larger).
UniBeast, available from tonymacx86.
MultiBeast, also available from tonymacx86. (You want version 6.2 or later, for OS X Mavericks 10.9.2, as other versions were designed for older versions of OS X.)
The DSDT file for your motherboard of choice If you followed our hackintosh hardware guide in the previous section, you may already have a pre-edited DSDT file for your motherboard. If not, visit tonymacx86's DSDT database, choose your motherboard from the list—making sure you choose the version that matches your motherboard's firmware—and download it to your hard drive. (Note: You can generally discover the firmware version of your motherboard by looking at its BIOS boot image.)

,,,, Click ""OK"" to accept your choice.

,,,,, This should bring you to a drive selection screen. Choose the USB thumb drive you just partitioned and click ""Continue.""

, If you're planning to install Mavericks on a motherboard with an 1156 chipset, you'll likely need the legacy USB support.


It won't break anything if you don't need it, so if you're updating multiple Hackintoshes and not all require it, there's no reason to worry. If legacy USB support isn't working for you, just add your motherboard's patched DSDT file to the hidden /Extra folder on your installer drive and that should fix the problem. Phew! When you're ready, click ""Continue"" and enter your admin password.
Note: In some cases you may need additional boot flags to get to the installer. If you have an unsupported graphics card, you'll need to add GraphicsEnabler=No. If you have an ATI Radeon 6670 installed you'll need to add PCIRootUID=0. You can just type these in at the boot option screen before you press enter to choose ""USB"" and boot into the installer.

, DO NOT unplug the drive or stop the installation while it's in process.

, Plug it into your hackintosh, boot up, and press the key on your keyboard that will take you to the boot selection menu. (If you don't know what it is, just look on your BIOS boot screen.


It is commonly ESC, F10, or F12.) If the thumb drive boots successfully you'll see a thumb drive with the tonymacx86 logo appear on your screen along with a single boot option: USB. Choose it and boot into the installer.
Note: In some cases you may need additional boot flags to get to the installer. If you have an unsupported graphics card, you'll need to add GraphicsEnabler=No. If you have an ATI Radeon 6670 installed you'll need to add PCIRootUID=0. You can just type these in at the boot option screen before you press enter to choose ""USB"" and boot into the installer.

, Do that, but before you can continue you'll need to format your disk. Go to the Utilities menu and choose Disk Utility.

, To format it properly, follow these steps:


Choose the disk in Disk Utility and click the Partition tab.
Set the partitions to one (or however many you want) and their format to Mac OS Extended (Journaled).
Click the options button and set the partition scheme to GUID Partition Table
Click Apply and wait for the disk to finish formatting
With your destination disk ready to go, run the Mavericks installer just like you would on any other Mac. When it completes you might be met with an ""Installation Failed"" message at the end (or not), but that's nothing to worry about. When the installation is complete just restart your machine.
When you do, access your boot menu and choose the USB drive. You still need it to boot up. When you see the familiar boot options screen again you'll now be able to choose the drive you installed Mavericks on. Pick that and press enter, also entering any boot flags you used when booting into the installer previously.

, Now that you've got Mavericks installed, make all your hardware work properly. For that, you need to install some drivers. Copy MultiBeast to your hackintosh's hard drive and open it up. Click through the install windows and get to the options page. What you choose is going to vary based on your build, but you'll most likely follow these steps:

, You'll most likely ignore EasyBeast and need to choose one of the DSDT options. If your motherboard does not require a DSDT file, as many newer ones do not, you can choose DSDT-Free. If you downloaded a DSDT file for your motherboard earlier, choose UserDSDT and put that DSDT file on your desktop

, Again, this will depend on your build but you'll likely need drivers for audio. Find out the chipset on your motherboard and choose the relevant AppleHDA driver for it. You may also need Ethernet drivers. Most everything else will be determined by whether or not you chose other natively compatible hardware like your GPU. Some GPUs require special drivers and others work by default.

,, You'll want to choose a hibernate mode—most likely desktop, as this guide doesn't deal with laptops, turn on Generate CPU States, and turn on Use KernelCache. Changes here will vary based on your hardware choices, but those are the basics.

,, MultiBeast will do its thing.

, After this steps you have fully functional hackintosh with Mac OS X Mavericks on it.

, In order to begin working on your document, you will need to specify a few things in order for LaTeX to understand and format the document. The first of these specifications is the document class. This should look something like this \documentclass{article}. This specifies a document with 12 point font and an article format, which is the most basic setup.

, LaTeX will also need you to specify the beginning and end or your document and you can do this by entering a simple line of code. At the beginning of your document and under the document class, enter \begin{document}. At the end of your document, enter \end{document}..

, In order to input commands, like a paragraph break, you can enter the ""%"" sign followed by your command. For instance, enter ""% New Paragraph"" as the first line of your new paragraph. This spacing will appear when you go to create your document.

, In order to create perfect margins you can use things called ""packages."" These act similarly to the commands we used earlier to specify beginning and ends of documents. To input a package, enter the following command: \usepackage{example package}. For example, if you wish to have 1-inch margins on your document, you would enter \usepackage{fullpage}. You would enter this command in the line following your document class specifications.

, In order to specify your line spacing, enter the following command: \examplespacing on the line above where you wish the spacing to being. For example, if you would like your document to be double spaced, you would enter the command \doublespacing above the section you wish to be double spaced. The document will continue to be formatted with that spacing until you override it with another spacing command.

, To type in bold, enter the command \textbf{example text} and to type in italics, enter the command \emph{example text}. For example, if you would like to write ""Lemon"" in bold, you would enter \textbf{Lemon}.

, Within the perimeters you specified, create your document!

Weekly: Allows for a much broader range of specification than the daily comparison. This is excellent when a task needs to be performed on specific days, or even every weekday. It can also specify once every x weeks, up to 99 weeks apart. For our example, we will choose once every two weeks. We will also select the checkbox beside Friday. Notice that multiple days can be selected.







Monthly: Allows you to specify the months that you want to include and either the specific days of each month that you want the task to occur, or a specific time of the month for a task to occur, such as the first Sunday of a month, without actually knowing what day it will fall on each time. This is especially useful for paying bills.







Once: Allows you to pick one date and time for the task to occur. This is useful if you know you will need to perform a task some time in the future, but only need it to run once.







When the computer starts: The task will run every time that the computer boots up. This is very useful if the computer is consistently used for the same purpose.







When I log on: This is virtually the same as when the computer starts, but it will only occur for your user account, not any other accounts. Useful for shared computers.







When a specific event is logged: This setting is for more advanced users. It can be used to alert the user when a specific error occurs, but it requires a deeper understanding of the behind the scenes activity on your computer.

Send an email: This option will send a generic email as often as specified. You can specify who it is from, to, the subject, the message, and any files you wish to include. You will, however, need to include a SMTP server. The site http://www.e-eeasy.com/SMTPServerList.aspx provides a list of free servers; select the one that corresponds with your email provider.







Display a message: This option allows you to write a message that will pop up in a window at the specified times. This is useful for reminders at a basic level and reporting problems for more advanced users.

Simulate a root environment.,
Give sudo access to another user.",How to Become Root in Ubuntu1," Because Ubuntu locks the root account by default, you cannot use su to become root as you would in other Linux distributions.Instead, start your commands with sudo.;
, “Sudo” stands for “Super User Do.” When you add sudo to the beginning of a command, the command will run as root.


For example: sudo /etc/init.d/networking stop stops the network service, and sudo adduser adds a new user to the system. Both of these tasks require root access.
You will be prompted to enter your password before sudo runs the command. Linux stores your password for 15 minutes so you won’t have to keep typing it.

, For security reasons, Ubuntu does not recommend using “sudo” to open programs with GUIs.Instead, type gksudo before the command that launches the program.


For example: type gksudo gedit /etc/fstab to open the ""fstab"" file in GEdit, an editing program with a GUI.
If you’re using the KDE Window Manager, use kdesudo instead of gksudo.

, If you are an advanced user who needs access to an actual root shell to run specific scripts, simulate a root shell with sudo –i. This command will give you superuser access with root’s environment variables.Enter the command sudo passwd root. This will create a password for root, essentially “enabling” the account. Don't forget this password.
Type sudo -i. Enter the root password when prompted.
The prompt will change from $ to #, indicating you have root access.

, If you are setting up an account for someone who does not currently have root access, you will need to add their username to the sudo group. To do this, type usermod -aG sudo username (but replace “username” with the correct username)."

To safely run commands as root, you should use sudo or gksudo instead. If you absolutely must have a separate root user (if it’s required by a program used by your business, or this workstation will only be used by a single user), you can enable the root user with some simple commands.


Enabling the root user can put your system at risk and is not recommended by Ubuntu., You will be prompted to set a new password for the root user.Don’t lose this password.

,, The root user should now have a password.

, Enter the root password when prompted to arrive at the root prompt.

Understand what causes the error.,
Update your versions of Nero and DivX.,
Rename a few Nero files.,
Disable thumbnail previews.,
Completely uninstall Nero.","How to Stop Vista Showing the ""Com Surrogate Has Stopped Working"" Error1"," The ""COM Surrogate has stopped working"" error usually appears when you're looking through folders containing thumbnails for videos and images. The error is typically caused by codecs (software that processes video files) that aren't compatible with Windows Vista. The most common culprits are DivX and Nero.


There several quick fixes you can try to resolve the problem.;
, If you have either or both of these programs installed, they could be the source of your problems.


You can update DivX by downloading the latest version from divx.com. You can update Nero using the update utility in the program, or by downloading the newest version from nero.com.

, There are a couple of Nero files that can be causing the problem, and renaming them will essentially keep them from running. Doing this will break Nero ShowTime, however, so avoid this fix if you rely on that program.


Open C:\Program Files\Common Files\Ahead\DSFilter\

Rename NeVideo.ax to NeVideo.ax.bak

Rename NeVideoHD.ax to NeVideoHD.ax.bak


, This isn't a very elegant fix, as you'll no longer be able to see thumbnails for your images or videos, but it will keep the error from appearing whenever you open a folder.


Open any folder on your computer.
Click the ""Organize"" button in the upper-left corner of the window.
Select ""Folder and search options""
Click the View tab and check the ""Always show icons, never thumbnails"" option.
Click Apply


, If you don't rely on Nero, you can remove it from your system completely. This will usually solve your problem, but you'll need another utility to remove it completely.



Download and install Revo Uninstaller.
Select any Nero applications from the list.
Perform a Moderate scan at the end of the uninstallation process.

Assess your need.,
Increase hard disk space.,
Acquire defragmentation software.,
Install and run the defragmentation utility.,
Be sure to backup up your computer before beginning the defragmentation process.

",How to Defragment Files on a Mac Computer1," OS X (10.2 and on) automatically decreases the potential for file fragmentation by writing the new data to the largest block of free space on the hard drive. However files can still become fragmented depending on how many times they are opened and if there is not a large enough amount of space to fit the complete file. These are some additional conditions in which Mac OS X will automatically defragment files and reasons that your computer could benefit from defragmentation:


Files that are less than 20 MB in size.
Files that have more than eight fragments.
Files that are not in use.
If you've downloaded many large files (such as video files) over time, your Mac may benefit from defragmentation.
If your hard disk is over about 90% full, defragmentation may help as well.
If your computer meets neither of these criteria, it's a safe bet that disk defragmentation won't speed it up, though it doesn't ever hurt your computer to defragment it.
Computers running System 9 and older may or may not benefit from defragmentation, but it is very difficult to find programs for them these days.;
, If you're defragmenting your hard disk because it's nearly filled to capacity, this is a good time to clear up some of the clutter. Consider investing in an inexpensive external hard drive for media files, or store some excess files on a cloud storage service such as Apple's iCloud or Microsoft's SkyDrive.


SkyDrive, iCloud, and similar services typically offer anywhere between 2 and 7 gigabytes of free storage. To get more, you'll have to pay a yearly fee, which varies but always works out to less than $10 per month.
Hard drives will work with any computer they can plug into. The computer will automatically offer to format the drive so that it can be read the first time you hook it up. There's no need to spend extra money buying a special hard drive “for Macintosh computers.”

, Since most OS X Macs, most of the time, don't need defragmenting, no defragmentation tool is included in the computer's Disk Utility program. To “manually” defragment your disk, you'll need third-party software. A commonly used utility to defragment and optimize your hard disk is Coriolis Systems' iDefrag, which costs about $30. Another software option is Prosoft's Drive Genius 3, Genius 3 addresses both free space and data fragmentation on a hard drive. Is also offers a graphical window that gives you a color coded preview of how fragmented your hard drive is, as well as several other features to maintain the health of your hard drive.


There are other options available. Be sure to thoroughly check reviews and user ratings before paying for any of them, and be sure to download them from a clean site.
Unfortunately, Macintosh computers running System 9 and earlier are now considered so outdated that software for them isn't widely available anymore, even online. To find a defragmentation utility (such as Norton Utilities or Alsoft PlusOptimizer), you'll probably have to get in touch with other longtime Mac users about purchasing or trading for a used copy.

, If you bought your program online, it should download as a file you can double-click to open. Follow the instructions on the screen until the program is successfully installed, and then launch it. In most cases, the available options from this point are self-evident. Choose to defragment your hard disk and allow the program to run until finished.


Generally speaking, you shouldn't move the computer while your hard disk is being de-fragmented. Choose a time to defragment when you won't have to lift, drag, or otherwise move the computer for a while.

A window will appear where you can choose the black icon entitled ""Terminal."" You can also do this by clicking on the magnifying glass in the upper right-hand corner of your screen and typing ""terminal.""

, For example, if you are trying to delete an app called ""LEMON,"" you would enter the following command: sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dock/*.db ""DELETE from apps WHERE title='LEMON';"" && killall Dock. You can find the exact name of the App by going to the Applications folder and searching for it. After you have entered the above command, hit ""Enter."", After you enter the delete command, Launchpad will automatically refresh and the app should be gone.

Back up files.,
Restart from disc.,
Run Disk Utility.,
Reinstall the system software.,
Restart and update.,
Restore your files.",How to Defragment Files on a Mac Computer2," Fortunately, Mac owners have a plethora of options available to them for doing this. Choose whichever method suits you the best. Remember that virtual storage and physical storage each have advantages and disadvantages, and remember that anything you don't back up will be gone forever once you reformat your computer's hard drive. Be thorough.


Back up with iCloud if most or all of your content is legally purchased files from the iTunes store. The iCloud service backs up all such content automatically on a daily basis, as well as details like user settings, text messages, phone contacts, and so on. For most users, iCloud is more of a smartphone option than a computer option.
Back up to an external hard drive. This is the time-honored method most people use to back up their computer. Run a program such as Apple's own Time Machine utility, and point it to the external drive you have connected to your computer. The program will create a backup copy of everything except system files.

You can also back your drive up manually by literally dragging everything you want to save onto your external hard drive's desktop icon en masse, but this is messy, slow, and less reliable than letting a program take care of it for you, in most cases.


Back up to physical media. When all else fails, if your computer has a writable optical drive (such as a DVD/RW drive), you can purchase a stack of blank discs and manually back up content to the discs, one disc at a time. This isn't recommended, as it's easy to misplace or damage the discs, but in a dire emergency it can help you save data and applications that might otherwise have been lost.

, Load your Mac's Install disc into the optical drive and reset the computer. As the computer boots up again, hold down the “c” key to force it to boot up from the Install disc. You'll see a list of language options, and then a menu screen.


From this point until you've completely finished reinstalling your system software and reset the computer, do not remove the Install disc from the drive for any reason.

, Select “Utilities” from the menu, and “Disk Utility” from there. In Disk Utility, choose the hard disk you want to erase from the drop down menu and click the “Erase” tab, then click and confirm the “Erase” button. Disk Utility will erase that entire drive.


Erasing a hard drive takes time. Be prepared to wait a while and, as before, don't jostle or move the computer while it's erasing.
Be very careful not to select your backup drive by accident. If you're worried you might, just unhook it from your computer before you restart it.

, Once you're done erasing your hard disk, quit Disk Application to find a Mac Installer window. Click the “Continue” button to view the license agreement. Read it if you want, then accept it and click the hard drive you just erased on the next screen. Click “Install” to install the system software.

, Once you've finished installing the system software, click “Restart” to restart your Mac and boot up as normal. Your Mac will guide you through initial setup; once you've finished, it's time to update to the latest version of the OS you were using. Visit your account at Apple.com and download and install all the updates you previously purchased.

, Depending on the method you chose, either load your optical discs sequentially, drag files from your external hard drive, or run Time Machine (or another backup utility) and choose to restore your old files from an external hard drive. All three methods take time, so be patient.


If you have data backed up on iCloud, you can simply log in and copy it back to your hard disk.

In order to complete the build for the GNU Compiler Collection, we are going to need the following libraries and packages: GMP, MPFR, MPC, ELF and GCC.,
Put the downloads in a temp directory ( you can use whatever directory you want ) for example, /home/”your_username”/gcc_archive


Build the infrastructure in a temp directory that is different than the downloads directory or its sub directories: /tmp/gcc
Configure the infrastructure using static libraries like this:
./configure --disable-shared --enable-static --prefix=/tmp/gcc
The --disable-shared flag may be worth a closer look depending on your needs.,
Open up a terminal and enter the following command:



Type/Copy/Paste: mkdir gcc_archive

Download and place all GMP, MPFR, MPC, ELF and GCC packages in this directory



Type/Copy/Paste: sudo apt-get install binutils build-essential m4 autogen bison flex

Make sure that all of your important documents and files are securely backed up before starting the installation process. See this guide for details on the best ways to backup your data.;
, An ISO file is a disk image that you can burn to a DVD. The ISO is available for free from the Linux Mint website, though the download is on the large size. Depending on the speed of your connection, it may take a while for the download to complete.


There are several options when you visit the Downloads page of the Linux Mint website. Most users will want to choose the ""Cinnamon"" version located at the top of the list. This is the default desktop style for Linux Mint. There are other options available for more advanced users.
You will need to ensure that you select the correct version for your system architecture: 32-bit or 64-bit. See this guide for details on how to determine what kind of hardware you have in Windows, and this guide for Ubuntu.

, In order to copy the ISO file to a DVD, you will need an image burning program. One of the more popular free options is ImgBurn, though there are a variety of others from companies such as Nero.


If you are running Windows 7, 8, or 10, you can use Windows' built-in burning software. Right-click on the ISO file and select ""Burn disc image"".

, You can also write it to a USB drive. Use your image burning software to select your DVD recorder drive with a blank DVD in it. If necessary, select the downloaded ISO file as the source file (this isn't necessary if you right-clicked on the file to use Windows' burning software). Click the Burn button to begin the burning process. This may take several minutes to complete.

, In order to run the Linux Mint disc, you will need to boot from it instead of your hard drive. You can use your computer's BIOS menu to change the boot order. See this guide for instructions on opening the BIOS menu.


Once in the BIOS, look for the Boot menu. Change the boot order so that your DVD drive boots before your hard drive. This will ensure that your disc is loaded first before your existing operating system.

, When your computer boots from the Linux Mint DVD that you created, you will be greeted with a short list of options. Select ""Start Linux Mint"" to boot the Linux Mint operating system from the DVD.


This does not install Linux Mint. Booting the operating system from the DVD allows you to test out Linux Mint and see how you like it before committing to the installation. You will not be able to change any settings or delete or create files while in the preview mode, but it is a good way to get used to how Linux Mint works.
When running Mint from the DVD, it will run slower than if it was installed. Keep this in mind when using it, as the installed version will perform much better than the preview.

, After you have taken some time to get familiar with the Linux Mint desktop, you can begin the installation by double-clicking the ""Install Linux Mint"" icon located on the desktop. This will begin the installation program. Select your language and click ""Continue"".

, In order to use the bundled installer, you will need to have at least 3.5 GB of free hard disk space as well as an active internet connection.


If you are installing Mint on a laptop, ensure that it is connected to a power source during the installation.

, The next screen will allow you to choose what hard disk space you would like allotted to your Linux operating system. There are two main options to choose from:


Erase disk and install Linux Mint - This option will delete all of the data on the selected disk and install Linux Mint on it. Any existing operating systems or data will be deleted. Use this option if you want Linux Mint to be the only operating system on your computer.
Something else - This option will allow you to use the free space on your hard disk to create a separate Linux Mint partition, which will allow you to have Linux Mint installed alongside another operating system. This option also allows you to choose the size of the Linux partition.

, In the next screen, use the dropdown menu to choose which drive you want to install Linux to. If you chose the ""Something else"" option, you will be able tot use the slider to set the size of the Linux partition.


Linux Mint requires at least a 6 GB partition, and the swap partitions should be 1.5 times the amount of RAM you have installed.
If you selected the first option for the install type, the entirety of the selected disk will be deleted during the installation process.

, After the installation begins, you will be asked to choose your timezone and keyboard layout. You can use the Detect Keyboard Layout button if you are unsure about your keyboard layout.

, After selecting your input preferences, you will be asked to enter your name and create a user. When you enter your name, your username and machine name will automatically fill with your first name. You can change your username to whatever you'd like.


The machine name is the name your computer will display to other computers on the network.
You will need to create a password as well. This username and password combination will be your administrator account, and will need to be entered when making changes to the system
You can opt to login automatically or be prompted for the username and password. Choose the option that works best for your security needs.
You will be able to create more users after the installation has finished.

, After entering in your information, Linux Mint will begin copying files. You can monitor the progress by looking at the bar at the bottom of the window. After the files are copied, installation will begin and your hardware will be configured.


This process may take a while, especially on older machines. It's all automated from this point on, so you can leave and come back if you need to.
The installer will download additional files during the installation process, so you will need a valid network connection.

, Once installation is complete, you will be prompted to restart your computer. Click the ""Restart Now"" button to reboot your computer and load your newly-installed operating system.

, Depending on how you installed Linux Mint, you may be given the option to select it from a list of installed operating systems, or your computer may boot directly to Mint. Either way, start up Linux Mint and log in to your account to get to the desktop.

, When Linux Mint first starts, you will be greeted by the Welcome screen. This contains links to user guides and tutorials, so take some time and look through the available resources.


This window will appear every time Linux Mint starts unless you uncheck the box in the lower-right corner.

, By default, Mint will start with a link to your Computer and your Home directory on the desktop. You can add the Trash icon to make it more like a Mac or Windows machine. To do so, click the Menu button in the lower-left corner and select System Settings from the left side. Click the ""Desktop"" option in the Preferences section, and check the icons that you want to appear.

, Mint comes with a few essential programs installed, such as Firefox, LibreOffice, GIMP Image Editor, and VLC Player. You can install a variety of other programs as well, most of them for free. To do so, click the Menu button, hover over Administration, and select Software Manager.


You will be asked for the administrator password.
Programs are sorted by category, but you can also search for specific programs. Keep in mind that most Windows and Mac programs are not available for Linux, so you will need to find alternatives that perform the same functions.
Double-click a program to open up details. Here you can see the size as well as reviews from other users. Click the Install button to begin downloading the program.
You can see the progress of your installations by monitoring the bar at the bottom of the window.

, Once a program has been installed, you can access it through the Menu. Hover over the category that the program belongs to, and you should see it in the list of programs installed on your computer. Simply click the program to begin running it.

, The desktop background is the easiest way to show others that this is ""your"" computer. Right-click on the desktop and select ""Change Desktop Background"" from the menu.


You can choose from a selection of included backgrounds, or click the ""+ Add"" button to load your own images.

, You can get the most out of Linux by using the command line to do just about anything. You can quickly access the Terminal by clicking the Terminal icon in the taskbar at the bottom of the desktop. See this guide for information on basic Terminal usage.

, Linux Mint, like all Linux distributions, is incredibly customizable. There are countless tips and tricks available online from a variety of Linux communities. Browse through the official Linux Mint forums, and check out some Linux enthusiast sites to find programs and tweaks that you didn't even know you needed.

Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s dpkg -i *.deb


this command will install all the kernel deb packages

,
Type/Copy/Paste: sudo -s update-grub


This command will update your GNU GRUB bootloader letting your system know you have installed a new kernel and to boot this newly installed kernel

,
Reboot your Linux Mint operating system with your newly installed kernel and log back in and run the following command below.

,
Check to see if the installation was successful by typing the following command.",How to Install and Upgrade to a New Kernel on Linux Mint,"

;
,


Make a note of the latest stable kernel. For example, the website will tell you which is a stable kernel. You should always select the stablest kernel in order to make sure your system doesn't crash and burn with a research or development kernel.

, You can find this information out by opening up a terminal and typing the following.



Type/Copy/Paste: file /sbin/init

this will inform you about the bit version of the operating system, whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit



, In this example we will simulate installing/upgrading stable Linux kernel 3.10.4 for a 32-bit and 64-bit system.

, You may have to scroll down a long list of folders until you find the correct folder. In this case we will select the /v3.10.4-saucy/ folder.

, In order to perform the installation and upgrade, you will need to download three important files.



32-bit

Download these three files if you are on a 32-bit Linux Mint operating system.

Install Linux Mint.,
Install Compiz Fusion.,
Configure Compiz.,
Install Emerald/Compiz Window Decorator.,
Configure Emerald/Comfiz.,
Install Synapse to launch programs easily.,
Get a dock.,
Install other programs.,
Need to install Windows Software?,
Install gstreamer plugins, restricted extras and other useful stuff.,
Browse through blogs like webupd8.org and omgubuntu.co.uk.",How to Install and Configure Linux Mint," It is one of the most elegant and user-friendly OSs out there. Check out this article for instructions.;
, Open Synaptic Package Manager, type 'simple-ccsm' (without quotes) right click and mark for installation. This should also install 'ccsm', if it doesn't, install that as well. We also need compiz, compiz-plugins, compiz-core, compiz-gnome and compiz-fusion-plugins-extra. Make sure they are all marked for installation (use the search box at the top) and click apply.

, Ok, this is the fun part. Compiz is a window manager that takes full advantage of your graphics card (however good it is) and adds many effects, eg. 3D desktop rotation. Right click on your desktop and click on 'change background' to open Appearance preferences. Navigate to 'Visual Effects' and select 'custom'. Now click the preferences button to open the Simple CompizConfig Settings Manager, and click on the 'Desktop' tab. Select 'Desktop Cube' under Appearance. Use 3 to 5 Desktop Columns and one Desktop Row. Now go to the Effects tab. Select 'Shift Switcher (Cover)' as your Alt+Tab window switcher. Select Deformation: Cylinder, change the opacity to about 70, and tick every box EXCEPT Blur, unless you have a graphics card that can handle it. If your graphics are relatively old/integrated, don't even touch this option. Close the simple manager. Try things out, eg. hold down Ctrl+Alt and click&drag with the mouse. Next, we will customise what you are seeing there. Open the CompizConfig Settings Manager (ie. the non-simple one). On the main screen, untick Negative and tick 'Show Mouse'. Click on 'Rotate Cube' and change Zoom to about 0.4. Go back, in the 'Effects' section (left menu), tick 'Bicubic Filter' and 'Trailfocus'. Try out the 'Paint Fire' and 'Water' Effects if you want (Simply Enable them and use the shortcuts from the settings page). Now go to 'Cube Reflection and Deformation' (tick it if it isn't ticked already), expand appearance and click on the top image file. Click Edit and replace everything with '`' (without quotes). To the same for the bottom image. Go the top and bottom cube colours and change opacity to 0 for both. Now go back to the main screen and tick 'Window Previews'. Feel free to try out other things, too. Everyone has different requirements and a different taste.

, Go to the Package Manager (Look in Main Menu). Type emerald in the search box at the top. Right click emerald and mark it for installation, then apply. After it has installed, press Alt+F2 (run dialog) and type 'emerald --replace' (without quotes). You should notice the change instantly. To make sure emerald loads at every system boot, add it to the list in 'Startup Applications' (see Main Menu). Use the same command.

, You can make your window borders look absolutely any way you want, whether that's like Mac Snow Leopard or Windows 7. For this, you need the Emerald Theme Manager. If it's not already installed, go back to Synaptic (the package manager) and install 'emerald/comfiz-theme-manager'. Then open it and have a look around. There are literally thousands of themes to choose from and configure to your liking, just go to gnome-look.org -> beryl and download some. Then add them through the theme manager. You can try my theme: Earth Magic. You can see screenshots there as well. If you want something more blue you can go for this one (more like Windows 7). Still, you can always change the colours to what you prefer.

, Just add ppa:synapse-core/ppa to your software sources, update and search for ‘Synapse’ in the Ubuntu Software Centre. Open it from the main menu. You can now trigger it by tapping Ctrl+Space. Type to search for a program and hit Enter.

, A dock is an application launcher and window manager. Think Mac OSX - they have one at the bottom of the screen. You have many different options for this, including: Docky, Cairo-Dock, ADeskBar and AWN. Personally I found AWN to be very customisable, powerful and stable. Simple instructions (copy&paste the commands in Terminal) for install: http://www.webupd8.org/2010/06/awn-lucido-gets-its-own-ppa.html

, Don't forget to install other programs you may need. Linux Mint does come bundled with loads of software already, but they can't put everything on their CD. Pimp out FireFox with add-ons and themes. Before you jump over to Chrome or Opera, consider that you can configure FireFox to do pretty much everything they can and still be faster and secure. Say hello to Google Earth (now easily installable through the Software Manager).

, Install Wine and/or VirtualBox Wine tries to emulate Windows and can often install or run Windows programs. However, it can be quite tricky to get to work; it may not work with every program. I would recommend installing PlayOnLinux (http://www.playonlinux.com/en/), it is a program that makes installing Windows Software (eg. MS Office 2007, games) from a CD really easy. Your second option for running non-Linux software is installing VirtualBox, which creates a virtual partition on which to run the OS. Basically, you can install and run Windows (or anything else) inside Linux, just like in another window. Then you can install your software on that. You also don't risk ruining Linux Mint.

, Go back to synaptic and install Ubuntu restricted extras, gstreamer extra plugins, ms core fonts, and Flash.

, Of course a blog is a lot more up to date than this article!

Cookies are the files that are saved on your computer when you visit a website to make opening that page faster in the future. Passwords are any passwords that you have requested your browser to remember for certain sites. Form data is anything that you have filled into a text box, such as your name.

, Internet explorer is a bit different, it allows you to delete them all individually, or to delete them all at once by clicking the button at the bottom. If a popup comes up and asks you yes or no, select yes.

, Because of the way that windows places files and data on the hard drive, these files get to be quite a mess and because things are harder to locate, it takes your computer longer to find what it is looking for. Also, since a hard drive is a spinning disk, data can be retrieved faster if it is closer to the inside of the spinning disk. Fortunately, windows has a built in program to sort all of this out.

,, This will open a new window.

,, *Note when choosing a time, it is best to choose a time when the computer will be on, but you will not be using it, since the process will consume system resources and anything that you are doing will run slower. Click ""Ok"" to return to the previous window.

, This will allow you to select when hard drives you wish to sort, if you have more than one hard drive, or partition. If you only have one hard drive, then it should already be selected, and you can click ""Ok"" to return to the previous Window.

, This step can take anywhere from about a minute to many hours depending on how often you defragment, how many files there are, and the speed of your hard drive and computer. If this is your first time running this program, it is recommended that you leave your computer on overnight to allow it enough time to finish, because this process can take many hours.

, Your computer should be running more efficiently, and in most cases you will notice a boost in your computer's performance after finishing these steps, enjoy!

, This should be the network associated with the router in your house. If you didn't name your router when setting up the network, the network name will probably be the name of the router's company followed by a numerical tag.

, If you never set a wifi password but you're being asked to enter one, look at the bottom of your router--you should see a router network name and a random password listed there.

, Your Mac should now be connected to the Internet.

, This is the series of radiating waves in the top right corner of your screen.

, If you're in an area with wifi capability, you'll see at least one network name.

, If you have the option of picking a password-protected network over an unprotected one, go with the protected network--being able to connect to a secure network is worth the hassle of having to ask an official (e.g., shop staff) for the password.


Depending on your location, you may have to pay a fee (or purchase merchandise) before you can use a protected network.
If you end up choosing an unprotected wifi network, be careful about the information you view and input while using it. Other users may be able to view this information as well.

Make sure you have an Ethernet cable.,
Plug one end of your Ethernet cable into the router's port.,
Plug the other end into your Mac's Ethernet port.,
Wait for your internet to connect.",How to Connect a Mac to the Internet3," Using an Ethernet cable to connect your Mac directly to your router will increase the stability of an otherwise-unstable Internet connection, and your browsing speed may increase. However, being tethered to your router means you have significantly less mobility with your Mac--and you probably won't be able to use an Ethernet cable in most public places.

, There should be a square port on the back of your router labeled ""Internet"" (or ""LAN"" in some cases).


The moral majority of routers have several spare ports.

, Ethernet cables have a plastic box on each end. If you don't have one, you can buy one online for between $5 and $25.

, It doesn't matter which end you use.

, This should be a square opening on the side of your Mac's casing. It may have a <...> symbol above it.

, Your settings should be configured automatically.


Using a local area network (LAN) doesn't require you to enter a password, though your Mac may ask you if you want to trust the source.

, The closer you are to your router, the stronger the signal will be. If you're having issues with your connection's consistency, moving closer to the router may solidify it for you.

, Especially if your router is on a different level of your location than you are (e.g., the second floor), you may notice connection issues. The same can go for if you aren't in the same room with nothing between your computer and the router unit.


If your router is in a cabinet, try opening the cabinet doors.
Anything from basic furniture to walls and appliances can interfere with a wifi signal.

, If you're getting poor results on your end even after aligning yourself directly with the router, try restarting it. Each router is unique, but in most cases, you can simply turn off (or unplug) the router's power source for a few seconds to do this.


Your router should restart upon plugging it back in. Expect this process to take a minute or two.

, If all else fails, you can use your Ethernet cable to connect your Mac directly to the router. While this may be inconvenient from a location standpoint, you shouldn't have any problems with Internet connectivity while tethered to your router.


If you're in a public location, you probably won't be able to connect via Ethernet--though some libraries and airports may allow you to do so.

Install MediaWiki .,
Install mailcap.,
Also install mysql-server .,
Start the servers.,
To make sure that the servers automatically start at boot-up, type the following commands:


chkconfig mysqld on
chkconfig httpd on

,
MediaWiki is installed in /usr/share/mediawiki with files specific to a site installed in /var/www/wiki which contains the following directories and files:

config/
config/index.php
images/
index.php
,
Files in /var/www/wiki are used as a template and Apache can only access /var/www/html if not modified.,
You might have successfully installed the wiki but the skin (the design and the css and js and images of the wiki) are still in /usr/share/mediawiki/skins which is not accessible by web server.,
Navigate to http://localhost/wiki with your favourite browser.,
Fill in everything and click install button.,
After clicking Install MediaWiki, if everything goes right, MediaWiki installation successful page is displayed.

,
LocalSettings.php, which is one of the most important configuration file for mediawiki, has to be moved from config/ directory to the parent directory.,
Also delete the config directory for security reasons.,
Go to your wiki (http://localhost/wiki) and the main page should be displayed.",How to Install MediaWiki on Fedora," 'Yum' (Yellowdog Update Modified) is a package manager that will install all the required dependencies of mediawiki . Navigate to Applications->System Tools-->Terminal and become root. Then install mediawiki. Yum would also install php-mysql, php-pgsql, php, httpd because they are dependencies.


su
yum install mediawiki;
,

Apache (httpd) requires mailcap, but yum doesn't detect apache's needs and therefore you have to install it manually.
yum install mailcap

, For running mediawiki you also require a database server. The database server is not defined as a dependency for mediawiki because the database server can be either MySQL or PostgreSQL, and it does not have to be on the same computer. For installing mysql use:


yum install mysql-server mysql

and if you prefer PostgreSQL, type the following command:

yum install postgresql-server postgresql

, Start the web server (httpd) and database server (mysql or postgresql) for them to function.


service mysqld start/service postgresql start
service httpd start

,,, So run


cp -a /var/www/wiki /var/www/html

to copy the template directory to /var/www/html. After running the command your wiki configuration files are being copied to /var/www/html/wiki and wiki pages are stored in database server.
, You can make them accessible by copying them to the wiki directory:
cp -a /usr/share/mediawiki/skins /var/www/html/wiki


or create a soft link to the skins directory.


ln -s /usr/share/mediawiki/skins /var/www/html/wiki/skins

, If you are accessing that page for the first time, it would ask you to setup the wiki. Follow http://localhost/wiki/config/index.php which should take you to the setup page.

, Going with the default options will not do any harm. Choose either MySQL or PostgreSQL as your database server. It is highly recommended to use the superuser account and enter the username of the database superuser account and password. The default superuser account for MySQL is root and that of PostgreSQL is postgres. Also provide a suitable database prefix.


(Note: under Fedora 13 this step will fail due to write permissions on the config directory. hint: for SELinux cd /var/www/html/wiki; chcon -t httpd_sys_content_rw_t config. Also initialize the wikidb as described in https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Installing_MediaWiki#MySQL .),,
mv /var/www/html/wiki/config/LocalSettings.php /var/www/html/wiki

rm -fr /var/www/html/wiki/config

Put back your files and software.",How to Install Windows XP on a Windows Vista Computer," The most problematic issues with Windows Vista only apply to the original 2006 version of Vista, not the newer SP1 version that comes with computers sold today. Windows 7 also doesn't have these issues. Windows Vista (7) also includes many features that enhance productivity, including instant desktop search, and features improvements in security.;
, If you have any pictures or documents you want to keep, or programs that are hard to find, write them to a USB flash drive, external hard disk, or CD or DVD. Do this because everything on your hard disk will be destroyed during the process of installing Windows XP.
Also make a set of Windows Vista recovery DVDs to ensure that you can return to Windows Vista if Windows XP doesn't work on your new computer. The exact location of the program to do so differs depending on the brand of your computer, but usually there is a reminder pop-up that periodically appears at the lower right corner if you have not made the discs yet.

, This is necessary because these drivers add support for newer hardware that did not exist when Windows XP was released. Save the drivers onto your backup disk (along with your personal files). Make sure you get the drivers for ""Ethernet"" and ""Wireless"". Otherwise, you might not be able to connect to the Internet to download others. And if you use a wireless network with WPA2 security (or if you're not sure), also download the Wireless Client Update and save it to the backup disk. Also find the driver discs for all printers, scanners, PDAs, music players, and wireless network adapters you will use with the new computer. Some of these drivers might be available from the manufacturer's website if you have lost your CD's.

, Put in the CD and then restart your computer. Wait for the setup files to finish loading. If the computer starts into Windows Vista instead of Windows XP Setup, you may have to press a key to boot from the CD. Restart your computer and press the key for the boot menu. This key is different for every computer depending on the BIOS.

, Press ENTER and then press F8 to accept the license agreement.
If the setup program asks you for the disc for a previous version of Windows, insert a Windows 98 or Windows Me disc and press ENTER. Then switch back to the Windows XP disc. This is perfectly acceptable as long as you are not using that copy of Windows 98/Me.
,, Then wait for the files to copy. When the Setup program asks for a Product Key, get the folder that your Windows XP CD was in and look at the yellow label on the back. The ID number printed on it is what it wants. Type it in accurately. If Setup says that the code is invalid, carefully check your typing against the label and try again.
If, however, Setup does not detect your hard disk, check your computer's BIOS settings and change any ""AHCI"" or ""RAID"" setting to ""IDE"". (Change it back if you want to go back to Windows Vista.) If there's no such setting, you're out of luck and will have to continue to use Windows Vista. (In this case, just remove the CD and reboot; no files were erased.)

, Before running Windows Update, install the WPA update (if needed), and the drivers you downloaded before installing Windows XP.

, To save time, remember to activate Windows first. When updating your computer, you will need a high-speed Internet connection, and several reboots will be required as Service Pack 3 and other updates are installed; after each reboot, you should run Windows Update again until there are no more updates.

, Download and install any drivers you need that you have not already installed. Get the software programs you want and reinstall them, and put back your pictures, documents, and other files you saved. Then install an anti-virus program, such as AVG Anti-Virus (free for personal use) or Microsoft Security Essentials (free for all Windows users).

, The process for this varies a lot depending on the computer that you are using. Traditionally, you would open the BIOS menu and change the order of drives in the BOOT menu. Newer computers use UEFI instead of BIOS, which needs to be accessed in a special way if you're using Windows 8.


Reboot your computer and look for the BIOS or BOOT menu key when the manufacturer logo appears. Press this key to open the menu and change your boot order. The setup key is typically F2, F10, F11, or Del. Make sure that the USB drive is listed as the primary boot device.
If your computer boots directly into Windows 8 without showing the manufacturer logo, open the Charms bar (⊞ Win+C) and select ""Settings"". Click the ""Change PC settings"" option and then select ""Update and recovery"". Select the ""Recovery"" option and click ""Restart now"" under ""Advanced Startup"".

This is correct, and will display if you've selected your USB drive as the primary boot device.

, Before Windows 10 installs, you'll be prompted to select your language and keyboard settings. The language that you install will be your default base language.

, The installation process will begin.

, When prompted to enter a product key, click the ""Skip"" or ""Do this later"" option. After installation, Windows 10 will automatically check with Microsoft to see if the Windows 10 upgrade was activated for that computer. If you purchased a product key for Windows 10, enter it now.

, This will allow you to completely format the partition and install a fresh copy of Windows. Installing Windows this way will delete anything that is currently on the drive.

, If you're replacing an existing version of Windows, select the partition that it was on. It can be difficult to get multiple versions of Windows working together correctly, so it's recommended that you only have one version of Windows installed.


You can delete and extend existing partitions to create a new partition for your Windows installation. This will delete any data on the existing partitions.
It is recommended that you install Windows 10 on a partition at least 20 GB in size.

, Most of the installation process is hands-off. You will be asked to set a few privacy options. Read each option carefully before moving on to the next screen. You can change these settings later from the Settings menu.

, After the installation process is complete, you'll be taken to your new Windows 10 desktop. Long-time Windows users will find things in familiar spots, but a lot has changed. Click here for tips on getting the most out of Windows 10.

If you chose to automatically update, your computer will start downloading and installing updates as soon as it is connected to the internet.

, Most of your hardware should be installed automatically, but you may have to get drivers for more specialized hardware, or download the latest versions from the manufacturers. You can see what needs drivers from the Device Manager.

, While Microsoft provides a free antivirus solution called Microsoft Essentials, it is barebones and not a strong deterrent against viruses. Instead, install a third-party antivirus program that will help to protect your computer and information. You can find both free and paid antivirus software.

, This method shows you how to access the folder where all system icons are stored. This lets you change the icons for special items such as Finder and Trash, or to change default icons for an entire file type. Overwriting important icons or making a mistake here can make your computer very confusing to use.

, Only an administrator account can access this folder.

, Click the Finder icon in your Dock, then use the command + Shift + G command (or Go → Go to Folder in the top menu.

A standard audio CD can accommodate a max of 80 minutes of playback, meaning that your playlist should run at around 1.2 or 1.3 hours maximum. (This can be found at the bottom of the window.) Since this is an imprecise way of measuring, some 1.3-hr playlists will be shorter than 80 minutes and some will be longer. (You will find out for sure when you try to burn.)

, There is a dropdown menu above the entries in your playlist, below the title. Select the method that you would like to sort the playlist. To put the songs in the order you want, click Manual Order and then click and drag the songs around inside the playlist.

, Click File, then select Burn Playlist to Disc. If the playlist is too long, you will be given the option to spread it across multiple discs. You can do this if desired or cancel the burn and modify the playlist.


If you’re not sure how to open the CD slot, go to Controls in the iTunes toolbar and click Eject Disc. This should open it regardless of whether or not there’s anything in there.
You usually need to use a CD for audio discs. There are DVD audio players, but they are quite rare.

, In iTunes 10 or earlier, the burn will begin automatically. In iTunes 11, you are given the option to adjust your burning preferences before the burn process begins.


You can adjust the burn speed. Higher is faster, but very high speeds may cause disc errors on older systems or cheap CDs.
You can choose whether or not to place a gap between songs.
You can select your format. Audio CD is the most common and will work in virtually any CD player. MP3 CDs require special players to run. Only do this if you’re sure your player is compatible and all the songs on your playlist are MP3s (and not AACs, for example).

, The iTunes display will show the progress of the CD burn. iTunes will play an alert sound when the burn process is complete."

",How to Decide What Version of Windows Vista You Need,"



Windows Vista Starter - This is only shipped with computers bound for poorer countries. This includes only the necessary bits to run windows vista and a computer. You can use the internet, connect to networks, run Microsoft Office and more, but it can't support the Aero GUI or more advanced software.

Windows Vista Home Basic - As above, but can be purchased in all countries. Home Basic lets you do more though. It has built in Windows Media Player 11, quick search and IE7, but doesn't boast the Aero feature. This is more for people who are using home desktops.

Windows Vista Business - As above but this version is a big improvement. This edition is recommended for laptops and has a massive feature: Aero. It also has windows MeetingSpace for sharing documents and Windows sideshow to extend your display onto 2 monitors. Windows Vista Business has some exclusive features too. you can backup entire PCs instead of just files, scan and fax and easier and more advanced remote control.

Windows Vista Home Premium - As above without fax and scan, entire backup and advanced remote control. Windows Vista home premium is even better than Business. You can create HD movies in windows movie maker, burn them to DVD, use the Aero and Flip 3D features, use a completely different operating system - Windows Media Center Edition, Schedule backups, run 3 premium games and more. Windows Vista home premium is also recommended for laptops because of its mobility center. I recommend this version as it doesn't use as much RAM as ultimate and you don't really need the extra features for a home PC.

Windows Vista Ultimate - Includes EVERYTHING above, and has some special extras like Windows Bitlocked Drive Encryption and Windows Ultimate Extras.

Windows Vista Enterprise - Windows Vista Ultimate for large businesses.;

, To make a movie with iMovie, you must first import the video from your camera to your computer. Most cameras make this a fairly painless process using either USB or Firewire cables directly from the camera, or flash memory cards such as Secure Digital (SD) or CompactFlash (CF) connected through a card reader. You can also import movies from the iPhone or the iPad through the normal 30-pin or Lightning connector.


Connect the most appropriate cable to your camera. Using the cable that came with your camcorder, connect the small end to the camera, and the larger end to your computer.
Power on your camera, and set it play out through the cable. This function will have different names depending on the brand and model of camera you are using. It might be PC
Select the image definition of your movie. If you are shooting HD video, select that, or select ""Large,"" or ""Full"" in the import window. If it doesn't open automatically, select ""Import from Camera"" from the File menu.

, The Import window will show you all the clips available on your camera. (Every time you stop and start your camera, you're creating a new clip).You can choose to import all the available clips, or click to deselect the clips you don't want to import, then click ""Import Checked.""


If you're using a tape-based camcorder, you can import everything, or use the on-screen camcorder controls to fast-forward or rewind to locate a particular piece of film you want to import, and use the Play and Stop controls to start and stop the import.

, Make sure you choose a location with a lot of room: video files, especially HD files, can be quite large. You don't want to run out of room before you even get started!

,


The first time you import video from your camera, there won’t be any existing events in your Event Library.
To create a new event, type a name for it in the “Create new Event” field.
If you’re importing video that recorded on different days, you can have iMovie create a new Event for each of those days by selecting “Split days into new Events.”
To append the new video to an existing event—video that you imported into iMovie previously—select “Add to Existing Event”. Edit the new event’s name from the pop-up menu.

, Choose ""Stabilization"" from the ""After import analyze for"" menu. iMovie will analyze your footage, and smooth any shaky cam motion (such as you might remember from a film like ""The Blair Witch Project.""


The other option in the Analyze menu is to search your footage for people. This will place markers in the footage when iMovie detects the presence of humans.
Both stabilization and searching for people can take a long time to complete.

, If you are importing HD video, choose a size for the movie from the ""Optimize video"" popup menu. When all your settings are set, click the OK button and take a break. It will take anywhere from a few minutes to over an hour.

, First, from the File menu, select ""New Project…"" or press Command-N. This will create the basic project framework. With that created, you can add a theme to your movie. iMovie comes pre-loaded with a number of unique and interesting themes that help give your movie a unique, interesting look and feel. There is everything from a scrapbook theme to a Hollywood blockbuster movie. Preview the options, select the one you like—or select ""No Theme"" if you want to roll your own, then click the Create button.

, Before you add content, you have to give that content somewhere to go.


Next to the Themes list, assign a name of your project in the ""Name:"" field.
Choose an aspect ratio for your movie. The aspect ratio is a dimension describing the height and width ratios. For example, iPads and iPhones before the iPhone 5, standard TV screens, and older computer monitors have a 4:3 aspect ratio. Newer televisions and monitors will use the widescreen 16:9 format.
Choose a frame rate for your video. Use the same rate the video was shot using. Most video cameras in the U.S. use ""30 fps - NTSC,"" whereas European cameras generally use ""25 fps - PAL."" If your camera supports 24 fps, and you elected to shoot with that format, then choose that option.

, When you join two clips together, you have several ways of moving between them. You can set up iMovie to always chose a particular transition, though you may switch any preset transition at any time.


The Project Themes automatically add cross dissolves (gradual crossfades between one clip and the next) and other transitions, but allow you to deselect that option if desired.

, When you're done setting up your project, click the ""Create"" button, and the new blank project will open in the Project Browser window.

, Once you've defined a new project, you can add video clips into the movie. All the clips you imported will be listed in the Event Library section below your Project Library and Preview screen.


If you closed iMovie before beginning this section, launch iMovie, then double click on the Project Name of the project you created earlier.
If you want to change projects, click on the Project Library button, and choose one from the list.

, In the Event library, all events available will be listed. Select the event you wish to work with by clicking once on it.


If you don't see the event list, look in the lower left hand corner of the iMovie window.

, Select clip or a range of video frames from the film strips in the Event Library.


To select an entire clip, hold down the Shift key, then click once on the clip once, so that it’s outlined in yellow.
To select a specific range or section of a clip, click and hold on a section of the clip, then drag across the clip while holding down the button on your mouse or trackpad. Selected frames are outlined in yellow.
Drag your video selection to the Project browser in the top left of the screen. A vertical green line, along with a green Add (+) symbol, appears anywhere you can place the clip.

, Drag in each clip, or section of a clip, into the Project browser in any order you prefer. You can place the clips sequentially, or place a clip between two others.

, You can add more than movies to iMovie, and add a documentary feel to your film by adding still photographs. Whether scanned or shot digitally, the process is the same.

, Click on the camera icon located on the lower right side of the screen, above the video clips. The Photo Browser will slide in from the right, and lets you choose all the files in your iPhoto library.


If you haven't imported you're stills into iPhoto, you can do so, then click on the Last Import button to see only those images. Otherwise, you can simply drag them in from wherever they are located on your hard drive—though keeping all your images together in one folder is best.

, If you drag it before or after a clip, there will be a green vertical line, indicating that it's safe to place the image in that spot.


If the line is red, you are placing the image in the middle of an existing clip, and you'll be asked if you wish to replace the existing clip, insert the clip, or cancel the operation.

, You can intersperse still images in between a clip of an action scene—for example, grabbing a clip of a snowboarder catching air, extracting a single frame in mid-jump, and then placing that in the video where it was cut from.


You can set the duration of the still, so the end result will be something like: jump begins, boarder starts to lose balance, freeze! The clip lingers on the boarder, giving your audience a moment to realize what's about to happen, then unfreeze! The jump completes, and the boarder does a yard sale—exactly as expected. You could top it off with another still of the the boarder smiling with a face full of snow!

, Once you have everything in place, you can add elements to your film to really make it look special. You can use (or change) themes, add transitions, music, and titles.

, If you didn't choose a theme at the beginning, you can add one now. From the File menu, choose ""Project Theme…"" or press Shift-Command-J.

, Fine one of the thumbnails that you like (you can preview them by clicking them), and choose whether or not to include the automatic transitions.


When you select a theme, you will see a 30-second sample video so you know what to expect.
If you're new to iMovie, use the automatic transitions and titles option. It will help you get a feel for how they work, and you can always change or edit them later.
Make your choice by selecting or un-selecting the ""Automatically add transitions and titles"" checkbox.

,, You can add transitions between clips by opening the Transitions browser on the iMovie toolbar.


Select the desired transition, then drag it between two clips. iMovie will automatically manage the transition. You can easily change transitions by double clicking on the transition icon in your movie, and selecting a new one from the popup menu.

, A movie without music is what they used to call a ""slide show."" Nobody liked to sit through those back when that was the only way to see those vacation pics, let alone now, when it's so easy to do.

, This will switch the browser from your photo library to your iTunes library, as well as your Garage Band folder and Sound Effects folders.


Look through your list of music until you find the song you want to add. When you find an appropriate selection, click on the song, and drag it to the end of the video clips in the Project browser. Don't drag it over a particular clip. When you see the green vertical line, release the mouse, and your clip will be placed into the movie.
The background behind the movie clips will be shaded green for the duration of the music clip, beginning at the first clip in your movie, and ending at the end of the music. Note that this may end before your video track, or go beyond your video track. If the music is too short, you can always add another clip at the end of the project. If it's too long, you can fade it out at the end.

, In the Music and Sound Effects browser, there is a sound effects folder. Click on that, and select a sound effect for a spot in the movie. For example, if you have a clip of people walking, you can add footsteps to the movie, even if you have background music! Drag the sound effect to the first frame you want it to appear. If it's too short, add another sound effect, or if too long, trim and fade out as desired. (See following).

, If the music or effects are too long, too loud, or you want to add some studio effects, click the Action pop-up menu (the gear icon at the top left of the green audio clip), and then click on Audio Adjustments. Play your movie. As long as the Inspector window is open, your movie will loop through the selected sound—making it easy to adjust the settings for short snippets of audio like sound effects, so they're not too loud, or too soft.


In the resulting Inspector window, you can adjust the volume, fade in or fade out, EQ, and other adjustments as desired.
Volume: adjusts the volume of the selected audio track.
Ducking: drops the volume of all other audio tracks. This is useful if you have a clip of somebody talking over background music. Ducking makes the volume of the background music lower, so the voice can be heard more clearly.
Fade In/Fade Out: lets you ease in or out of a sound by a specified duration. Click on which one you want to alter, then drag the sliders to the set the length of time for each.
Reduce Background Noise: reduces ""noisy"" sounds, useful for traffic, crowds, etc., to make voices more intelligible. Too much can eliminate background sounds completely.
EQ: this is just like the EQ on your stereo, and adjusts the tonal qualities of the sound.
Normalize Clip Volume: this will make the loudest sound in the clip as loud as possible without distortion, making every other sound in the clip louder as well (unless the loudest sound is already at maximum, in which case this will have no noticeable impact on the sound. You can remove added normalization by clicking the ""Remove Normalization"" button below it.

, At the top of the audio Inspector window, click the Clip button, and then the ""Audio Effect:"" popup menu.


Audition the reverbs, echoes, and pitch effects by rolling over them (not clicking), and if any are desirable, click on them.
When you're satisfied with all adjustments, click Done, and your choices will be saved.

, You can add text anywhere within the movie, and at the beginning or end as credits.

, A series of different text treatments appear. To add those to your movie, click and drag one to the relevant clip.

, Replace the temporary text with words of your own, as necessary. To alter the font, right click on the text and select ""Show Fonts"" from the menu. Choose from the available list or click ""System Font Panel"" at the bottom left of the window, and choose from your available fonts. There are 9 different color options in the basic panel, but you can set any desired color in the System font panel.

, Select the title clip in the Project browser, and adjust the length as desired by clicking on the side, and dragging in necessary direction.


To view the Title inspector, double click on the title clip.

, If you didn't use a stock theme, you can add credits at the end by dragging the Scrolling Credits title to the end of the movie, and filling in the correct credits.

, iTunes will build your project, with all transitions, effects, titles, and settings baked in. Depending on the length and complexity of your movie, this could take an hour or two, so be ready to take a break!


When you're done, your movie will be ready to play, burn to DVD, or upload to YouTube. Congratulations!

Use the Straighten Photo edit in Windows Live Photo Gallery for photos that are not straight.,
Use the Straighten Photo edit when straightening a scanned page of text.,
To avoid making excessive mouse movements, lightly rest the heel of your palm on the desk.,
Alternatively, rest the heel of your palm on the desk and use the heel of your palm as a fulcrum of movement.,
A ""small"" technique to move the mouse is to rest the heel of your palm on the desk and rotate the mouse with just your thumb.,
Move the mouse a bit diagonally when precise movements are required.,
Another way to straighten a photo requires knowing how moving the slider bar will affect the photo.,
Moving the mouse quickly with just your arms is quick, but when you are tired, or it is the end of the day, you should do it differently.

,
Apply these techniques to other situations.

",How to Improve Mouse Accuracy in Windows Live Photo Gallery,"


Align a grid line with the horizon.
Align the grid line with an object that is vertical like a post or a building. Since there might be distortion, use objects in the center of the photo.;
, Occasionally, when using a sheet feed scanner, a page has to be edited with straighten photo because the sentences are not horizontal.

, Instead of moving the mouse from your wrist, try moving it from your shoulder or your body. Moving the mouse with a bigger movement, moves the mouse less, because moving the mouse with your wrist creates a bigger angle of movement.

, With this ""big"" technique, your palm heel is fixed and you will be shifting your body to move the mouse. This technique takes very little effort.

, Be prepared to trial a variety of techniques.

, It is hard to move a mouse accurately for a few millimeters, so by moving it diagonally you have a bit more control of it. If you can accurately move a mouse 2 mm and an adjustment requires 1.75 mm of movement, by moving the mouse diagonally, the actual sideward movement is less than 2 mm. The Windows Live Photo Gallery slider control can make sidewards adjustments and will not note any diagonal movements.

,


With this technique, look at slider bar, without looking at the photo, and move the bar just a bit.
A variation of this is to look at the slider bar and the photo, but with more of your vision focused on the slider bar.
When making diagonal movements with the mouse, look at the effect of what your mouse movements has with your photo or page. This is like driving, where you are looking at the road and not at the steering wheel.

Generally, mp4, m4v and mov can be easily transferred.
Conversely, mkv, wmv, webm, and avi are usually difficult to transfer or incompatible entirely.

, Mp4 files are easy for AppleTV to play, so, if you can convert your incompatible file from its original file type to mp4, you should be able to play it. Luckily, several converter apps are available for free online - simply Google, download, and install the software, then convert your file to mp4 (or another supported format).


Some converters will even have a special Apple TV profile pre-programmed for easy conversion.
Below are just a few popular video converters available for download:

Find something that appeals to you.,
Consider the build quality.,
Choose between Touch or Buttons.,
Look at what apps you can use with the device.,
Consider the operating system.,
Check out the interface.,
Determine its Compatibility.,
Always consider the cost.,
Make sure when you buy the Device you are buying something that can take all the files you need it and leave you some more room for later times.

,
Find out what your friends have.",How to Choose the Best Music Device," Firstly before you even consider the things that the device does you will want to pick something that looks attractive. For example Apple iPod touch 4th generation uses a flashy glossy glass screen with a chrome back plate and looks very nice to the eye. Samsung have brought out what's called the Samsung Galaxy player which is slightly bigger than the iPod touch but is all black with a chrome essence around the home button and screen. If you like a very shiny screen made with a nice tough glass and a weighty back plate of chrome the iPod is the choice. If you prefer the bigger screen but isn't to bothered about other looks then the Samsung is is for you. There is also the Zune which operates on windows which is a mix of chrome and plastic.;
, As mentioned The iPod touch is made using Glass and Chrome. It feels very solid in the hand but yet is very thin. Other iPods such as the Nano, Shuffle and Classic use mostly a plastic front panel as well as the back plate but still revert to the glass screens. Other devices such as the Zune, Galaxy Player, Zen and others usually go for the all plastic model with some sliver of gold trimmings around the buttons and screen. Its known however that when an iPod is dropped the screen will either crack or smash and cost up to 80 pounds to replace only through Apple. The plastic builds take more of an impact on a sudden drop.

, If you are someone who likes to really prod your device and like the big chunky feel then buttons will be for you but likely thing is right now buttons are becoming less common and everything is going down a touch route. It's a chance that most devises with just buttons will not support apps. The touch screen offers a range of all features such as Games, Music, Photos, News reading and social networking. The best button used device proves to be the Samsung Galaxy player. The best touch goes iPod but this Galaxy player can be overwritten in greatness due to older models of the Sony Walkman.

, For example Temple Run which seems to be the most popular mobile device game out took ages to come to the other devices after it was launched for Apple. If you get a device running on an older version of Android chances are some apps wouldn't have hit its android 2.0 market yet. Also some apps need a bigger screen to operate certain apps. Also look at the apps that it offers. If you prefer Apples app store then the iPod is for you If you wish to have a lower end market for apps but still have the basics such as YouTube and Facebook then the Samsung might be for you. Some older devices on touch screen for example the ARCHOS 3 Cam Vision don't support apps.

, The operating system is something to look at. Do you like the Apple iOS or do you like Googles/Windows Android. The Android devices are often Sync-able with Windows Windows Player where you simply plug the device into the PC USB port using the Date Sync cable and dragging your imported music to the device. Apple IOS runs off the iTunes software which can only be used with Apple devices. Apple iTunes gives you the opportunity to buy music from the store other services tend not to.

, The interface and layout is something you may wish to consider. If you like your apps in neat tidy little box shape icons then Apple may be for you. If you are not to fussed and don't mind messy icons go for the Samsung s range. Also lock screens vary from device to device. Apple allow you to have a different Lock screen image to the home screens. Also apple have the slide to unlock bar other devices seem to just allow you to swipe the screen to unlock. Some people are very fussy about these things others don't seem fussed at all. The music player screens are also something to look at if you like a big image of the album art on the screen its Apple if you like the smaller image with big touch screen buttons below it go for Android.

, This don't just apply for music devices but to all technology and devices. You must look to see if it can be used with your PC so you can Sync your files across. You'll be looking to see for example you have Windows 7 but the device only works on windows 2000 and below it will not connect or charge with your Windows 7.

, Prices are something to think about. Chances are the better of all these specifications mentioned the more expensive your buy will be. In all honesty If you pay big expensive price your going to be getting the best device of them all. We understand some of you are on a budget so the Android devices will be better for you in that case. However if you really want the Apple iPod but find it very expensive there are different GBs you can choose in Apples case its an 8,16,32 or 64 GB. the bigger the number the more files you can put on.

,, Lastly even though it isn't important we think it is. What devices do your friends have? reason we say this is because with Apple you can use iMessage which as long as your friend has it to you can use free texts. Android uses Chat.

Remember that the bandwidth specification of an oscilloscope is the frequency of the ""-3 dB point"" of a sine-wave signal of a particular amplitude, e.g.,
Understand that today's signals are no longer pure sine waves, but most of the time square waves.,
Consider rise (fall) time.,
Choose your sample speed.,
Decide on the number of channels.,
Calculate how much memory you'll need.,
Think about repetition rate.,
Check what kind of errors you expect to be looking for.,
Think about resolution and size of LCD display.

",How to Choose an Oscilloscope," 1 Vpp. As the frequency of your sinewave goes up (while keeping the amplitude constant), the measured amplitude goes down. The frequency at which this amplitude is -3 dB lower, is the instrument's bandwidth. This means that an oscilloscope of 100MHz would measure a 1Vpp sinewave of 100MHz at only (approx.) 0.7Vpp. That is an error of about 30%! In order to measure more correctly, use this rule of thumb: BW/3 equals about 5% error; BW/5 equals about 3% error. In other words: if the highest frequency you want to measure is 100 MHz, choose an oscilloscope of at least 300MHz, a better bet would be 500MHz. Unfortunately this has the most influence on the price...;
, These are built by ""adding"" the odd harmonics of the fundamental sine wave together. So a 10 MHz square wave is ""built"" by adding a 10MHz sine wave + a 30MHz sine wave + a 50MHz sine wave and so on. Rule of thumb: get a scope that has a bandwidth of at least the 9th harmonic. So if you're going for square waves, it's better to get a scope with a bandwidth of at least 10x the frequency of your square wave. For 100MHz square waves, get a 1GHz scope... and a bigger budget...

, Square waves have steep rise and fall times. There's an easy rule of thumb to get to know what bandwidth your scope needs to be if these times are important to you. For oscilloscopes with bandwidths below 2.5GHz, calculate the steepest rise (fall) time it can measure as 0.35/BW. So an oscilloscope of 100MHz can measure rise times up to 3.5ns. For oscilloscopes above 2.5GHz up to about 8GHz, use 0.40/BW, and for scopes above 8GHz use 0.42/BW. Is your risetime the starting point? Use the inverse: if you need to measure rise times of 100ps, you'll need a scope of at least 0.4/100ps = 4 GHz.

, Today's oscilloscopes are almost all digital. The above steps involved the analog part of the instrument, before it gets to the A/D converters to get ""digitized"". Here the bandwidth-to-risetime calculation can help you out: an oscilloscope of 500MHz has a calculated risetime of 700ps. To reconstruct this, you need at least 2 sample points on this edge, so at least a sample each 350ps, or 2.8Gsa/s (gigasamples per second). Scopes don't come in this flavor, so choose a model with a faster sampling speed, e.g. 5Gsa/s (resulting in 200ps ""time resolution"").

, This is easy: most scopes come with 2ch or 4ch configurations, so you can choose what you need. Fortunately prices don't double from 2ch to 4ch, but it does have a big impact on the price of the instrument. High-end scopes (>=1GHz) have always 4ch.

, Depending on how much of your signal you want to see in a ""single shot acquisition"", get your math right: at 5Gsa/s, you have a sample each 200ps. A scope with a memory of 10.000 sample points, can store 2µs of your signal. A scope with 100M samples (they do exist!) can store 20 seconds! Looking at repetitive signals or ""eye-diagrams"", memory is less important.

, A digital oscilloscope uses a lot of time calculating. Between the moment of triggering (see next step), having the captured signal on the display, and capturing the next triggered event, most digital scopes ""consume"" several milliseconds. This results in only a few ""photos"" of your signal each second (waveforms per second), typically about 100-500. One vendor solved this problem with so called ""Digital Phosphor"" (from about 4.000 wfms/s to >400.000 wfms/s for the top models), others followed with similar-like technologies (but not always sustained/continuous, rather in bursts). This repetition rate is important because those rare errors and faults in your signal might occur just then when the scope is not acquiring, but busy calculating the last taken acquisition. The higher the repetition rate (wfms/s rate), the higher your chances are of capturing that rare event.

, All digital scopes have some sort of intelligent triggers on board, meaning you can trigger on more than just the rising or falling edge of your signal. If your repetition rate is high enough, you've probably seen that rare glitch every other second. Then it's nice to have a Glitch trigger.

Remove the tracker from the band.,
Dampen a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol.,
Wipe off the tracker.,
Dry it with a microfiber cloth.",How to Clean a Fitbit1," The tracker on some versions, including the Blaze, can be pushed out gently from behind. Others, including the Flex 2, require you to undo the band clasp first.Consult your owner’s manual for instructions on how to remove your version’s tracker.;
, Cotton swabs and rubbing alcohol can be found at general stores and drugstores. Water should not be used, since it can get inside the tracker and damage it. Also, abrasive scrubbers should not be used., Apply the rubbing alcohol with the cotton swab. Don’t use a lot at any time. While rubbing alcohol does dry quickly, too much of it can still damage the tracker.

, Remove leftover moisture with a soft cloth. Make sure all moisture is removed before returning the tracker to the band. The “pebble” tracker in the Flex 2 can be dried completely with a paper towel. Avoid using paper towels or glass cleaners on tracker screens.

Dry the tracker and cable before use.",How to Clean a Fitbit2," Rubbing alcohol can be found at any general store or drugstore. Water should not be used, since it can damage the electrical parts inside the tracker. Use a toothpick or old toothbrush rather than a metal scrubber so you don’t scrape the tracker’s plating.

, Locate the gold-colored charging port on the back of the tracker. Scrub using the toothbrush or use the toothpick to pick out any debris you find., Cotton swabs (Q-tips) can be purchased alongside rubbing alcohol at general stores and drugstores. Again, avoid introducing water into the electrical circuit or using abrasive scrubbers that damage the metal.

, Clean out both ends of the charging cable. Push the swab into the openings and brush off the pins inside them. Make sure all debris is removed before you finish., Excess moisture can be removed on the charge port by using a soft cloth or tissue. Otherwise, the ports and pins should look dry within a few minutes. Then it is safe to charge your tracker again.

Lightly dampen a microfiber cloth.,
Treat fabric bands with soap-free cleanser.,
Scrub with a soft-bristled toothbrush.,
Dry off the band.",How to Clean a Fitbit3," After each use, take a microfiber cloth and wipe off the entirety of the band. This will prevent buildup of dirt and oils that damage the band and irritate your skin.

, For stuck-on debris, a dampened microfiber cloth can help. Make sure the cloth is only slightly damp, not dripping. Use it to wipe over the band’s surface. This can be used on any band type, including leather and metal.


Excess water will damage leather and tarnish metal, so minimize your water usage as much as possible.

, Oils, deep stains, and smells on elastomer and nylon bands can be treated with a cleanser such as Cetaphil Gentle Skin or Aquanil. Place a small amount on the tip of your finger and spread it over the band. Afterwards, wipe off the band again with a dampened towel.Nylon bands can be treated with a neutral pH liquid detergent such as Dawn and washed in cold water.
Treat leather bands with a leather cleaner and conditioner. This helps remove stains as well as protect against new ones.

, Use an old toothbrush to loosen stubborn debris and tough stains. These brushes are soft enough that they won’t wear out the band’s fibers. You may also dampen a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol and wipe down the band., Pat away as much moisture as you can with a microfiber cloth. Water must not be allowed to sit on metal or leather. Once this is done, place the band aside in a safe location. Keep it out of direct sunlight, heat, and humidity."

To add the imported video to an existing event (video you’ve already imported), select “Add to Existing Event,” then choose the event’s name from the pop-up menu. The first time you import video, there won’t be any existing events in your Event Library.
To create a new event, type a name for it in the “Create new Event” field. If the video you’re importing was recorded on several different days and you want iMovie to create an individual event for each of those days, select “Split days into new Events.”

, iMovie can smooth shaky video through a process called stabilization, and can analyze your video for the presence of people. To do this, select “After import analyze for,” and then choose an option from the pop-up menu:


Stabilization reduces the camera motion in your video so that shaky parts can be played back more smoothly.

, The aspect ratio refers to the width-to-height ratio of your movie, and will affect how it will appear on screens and monitors.



Standard (4:3) is almost square, and is the ratio used in standard-definition TVs. A video in 4:3 will fill the screen of those TVs. On an HDTV or widescreen monitor, there will be black bars on either side of the picture so that it still looks correct. This is a good choice for standard TVs, and for iPad or iPhone playback.

Widescreen (16:9) is much wider than it is tall, and is suitable for widescreen monitors and HDTV televisions. When viewed on a standard-definition monitor or TV, there will be black bars on the top and bottom so that it displays correctly.

, Chose one of the three options from the menu. Use the same frame rate that you used when you recorded your video you'll be using in your project.



30 fps - NTSC is the frame rate you will use if using a camera sold in North America, South America, Japan, and South Korea.

25 fps - PAL is the frame rate you will see in cameras sold in Europe, Hong Kong, and most other countries.

24 fps - Cinema is the setting you will use if you set your camera (either an NTSC or PAL camera) to record in Cinema mode.

Find out how you will receive your prepaid phone card after purchase.",How to Choose the Right Phone Card," Confirm rates before you call and remember that some rates may fluctuate. Also, calls made to international cell phones are generally billed at a higher rate.


Do the rates vary depending on the hour of the day? Be sure that the rate you receive remains constant throughout the entire day. Unless otherwise stated, the advertised rate should be constant no matter what time of day.;
, Rounding (minute billing) refers to the increments in which phone calls are billed. For example, with 3 minute rounding, a 4 minute phone call would be billed as a 6 minute phone call. With 1 minute rounding, the same 4 minute call would be billed as a 4 minute call.

, Confirm this with the carrier by contacting their customer service department.

, Adding these fees allows carriers and retailers to to keep their advertised rates extra low. You can avoid many types of additional fees and taxes by using all of your minutes in one call. Remember... fees and taxes effectively reduce the number of minutes you'll receive. Further, not all phone card retailers are created equal. Many will not disclose all fees and taxes, so be sure to ask before you buy. A retailer using best business practices will reveal all known taxes and fees to you up front.

, Being able to get a hold of your phone card's customer service department is important because they will be able to help you with any unforeseen issues that may arise at any time during the day.

, If yes, any remaining minutes on the card past this date will be lost.

, Most prepaid phone card companies do not offer any guarantee on their products. There are, however, a handful of companies that do. A guarantee will further ensure that you get the minutes you pay for. Also, look for signs of generating trust: Visible phone numbers, privacy policy, BBB membership, secure transactions, warranties and guarantees.

, Typically, if purchasing over the Internet, your phone card will be presented to you via email or right on screen pending a successful transaction and acceptance by your bank. Some companies may send you a physical card, but in most cases the delivery occurs by email or right on your screen.

Look into each library on each platform. 3DS has the most and best exclusives so it will be best if you are looking for a different experience, PS VITA has the best multi-platform games, games ported to the vita are usually done well but the exclusives are a bit lacking, and Android has lots of games for any type of gamer with a good amount rivaling 3DS or VITA games;
, The PS VITA will be the most expensive at starting price, you'll need $250 for the system, $20 for the memory card and $40 for a game for a total of $310. You can get a decently powerful android tablet for $150, you'll need a moga controller which is $50 and a game which is usually around $10 for a total of $210. The 3DS starts at $169.99 for the original model and you'll want a game and screen protector for the top screen which will be around $220

, If you want to do things outside of gaming then the 3DS might not be down your ally unless the game library makes up for that for you. A vita has a decent amount of extra features like YouTube,dedicated email app, Facebook app, Twitter app and Skype. Android was not built with mainly gaming in mind so it will be almost like a mini PC when it comes to things outside of gaming

, If portability is a must for you then you will find the original 3DS to be the best in this category. It will easily fit into a pocket and it's small.If you want a bigger screen then the 3DS XL is an option. The PS VITA will fit into a pocket but it is pretty big so if you have skinny jeans then you will want a bag or case. For an android tablet you are most likely looking into 7 inch (17.8 cm) models. These will slip into a bag very easily, however keep it mind you'll need to rest the tablet on a table and carry a moga controller if you want to play game properly

Download the software you wish to install.,
Extract the the contents to your Desktop.

,
Open the terminal.,
Make the .sh file executable.,
Finally, execute your .sh file.,
Finish the installation of your program.",How to Execute INSTALL.sh Files in Linux Using Terminal," The necessary files will usually be compressed into a Tar archive or zip package.;
,, The keyboard shortcut to do this is Ctrl+Alt+T. Type in the following command: cd ~/Deskop/rockhopper-0.2.b1-020. Replace rockhopper-0.2.b1-020 with the name of the folder on your Desktop. Then press ↵ Enter.

, Type in the next command into the terminal to make the file executable: chmod +x install.sh. Replace install.sh with the name of your .sh file. Then press ↵ Enter.

, Type in this command: sudo ./install.sh. Again, replace install.sh with the name of your .sh file. Then press ↵ Enter Note: If that doesn't work, try sudo bash install.sh without the ""./"" (This worked on Ubuntu 16). You will be required to provide an administrative password for this step.

, The terminal file might guide you through some additional steps, such as verifying the installation.

Don't use spaces in file names as far as possible.,
Never name your files with long, nonsensical names.,
If you use some files very often, and you want them to appear at the top every time you see the file list, prefix the names with symbols such as ~, !, @, etc.,
Try to name similar-content files with similar names.,
Remember, all these steps can be applied to folders, too.

",How to Develop a Naming Scheme," Replace them with underscores. You can also use the ""capitalization technique"", where you capitalize the first letter of each word.


Example


Okay: EmpRecord or Emp_Record

Not Okay: Emp Record
You could also go with Emprecord, but that will make it inconvenient to read.

;
,


Example

Okay: EmpRecQ1
Not Okay: EmployeeRecordForQuarterOne



, Please note that /, \, :, *, ?, "", <, > and | cannot be present in a file name. The two most commonly used symbols are ! and _. The others are not advisable.


Example

If you plan on using Emp_Record and EmpRecQ1 very frequently, then rename them as

Okay: _Emp_Record or _EmpRecQ1 or !Emp_Record or !Emp_RecordQ1


Not Okay: Emp_Record_ or Emp_RecQ1!

Please note that Emp_Record_ or Emp_RecQ1! are acceptable as file names but will not serve your purpose of showing up at the top.
Note: For step three to work, you must sort the file names in ascending order.





,


Example

Continuing with the above example, if you have two employee data files, one for the first quarter and one for the second, name them like this:


Okay: EmpRecQ1 and EmpRecQ2


Not Okay: EmpRecQ1 and EmployeeRecQ2

Please note that Emp_Record_ or Emp_RecQ1! are acceptable as file names but will not serve your purpose of showing up together.

Note: For step four to work, you must sort by filename (ascending or descending, it does not matter).

Check for compatibility with your mobile phone.,
Choose the design that best fits your lifestyle and what you plan on doing with this watch.,
Examine its battery life.,
Know the Android watch's exact functions.,
Be sure that it’s easy to use.,
Check for water-resistancy.,
Check the price of the watch that you are considering buying.",How to Choose an Android Smartwatch," Sometimes out of excitement, you may buy a smartwatch just by looking at its design, but then you realize that it isn’t compatible with your Android device, so it can be rendered practically useless for you.


That’s why before buying a smartwatch, check if it is compatible with your Android. Ask the store where you plan to buy it, about it's features and whether or not it is compatible with your currently existing Android mobile items. If they have no clue, research for this watch's information on the Internet, right inside the store.;
, Smartwatches vary quite widely in design, so choose an Android smartwatch that suits you.


For example, if you’re a tech geek, go for techy Android smartwatches. If you’re a fashion bird, go for fashionably-designed Android smartwatches. If you like to read the entire messages or emails on your smartwatch, then opt for a smartwatch with a larger face.

, The battery is the ultimate powerhouse of your smartwatch, and if you will be constantly using your smartwatch, you will want to make sure that its battery life lasts long.


Normally, the battery for monochrome (black and white) screen smartwatches are made to run for about 4 to 5 days (when fully charged), while batteries for colored-screen smartwatches are made to last for 1 to 2 days between charges.
To be sure, check online reviews of the particular Android smartwatch you are planning on buying. A lot of users usually posts their experience with their devices for other would-be users to know.

, Now this comes as one of the most complex factors of choosing a smartwatch. Some smartwatches are only meant for calls and messages, whereas some also have access to social networking. Most of them have regular organizer functions, like calendar and date, but not all. A few even have voice control features as an additional bonus.


In choosing an Android smartwatch, get those with functions that suit you. If you don’t want to be bombarded with post notifications from your social network accounts, then don’t get the smartwatch that has that feature.
Likewise, if you’re the kind who doesn’t want to miss emails or appointments, get the Android smartwatch which has features access to emails and has organizer functions.

, Being consumer-friendly is one of the most important thing to consider when buying an Android smartwatch. The user must be able to operate the smartwatch with simplicity without having to go back and forth to the user manual, so choose a smartwatch that you feel is easy and convenient to use.


Again, if you’re not sure, you can always read customer reviews online on a particular smartwatch you want to buy.

, Water-resistant Android smartwatches can be handy if you work out a lot or if your work involves dealing with water. This way, you won’t have to worry about your new Android smartwatch when it gets wet.

, The cost of Android smartwatches range from $149 to $455, so find one that fits your budget and keep the features and other functions into consideration.

Re-open your text file.",How to Create and Edit Text File in Linux by Using Terminal," To do so, click Menu, then find the Terminal app--which resembles a black box with a white "">_"" in it--and click on it. You'll typically find Terminal in a bar on the left side of the Menu window.


You can also click the search bar at the top of the Menu window and then type in terminal to search for it.;
, Terminal opens to your home directory, but the ls command displays every folder in your current directory. To create a text file in one of these directories, you'll need to change the current directory.

, Any directory name listed beneath the ls command (e.g., ""Desktop"") is a place to which you can navigate., You'll replace ""directory"" with your preferred directory's name. This command changes Terminal's focus from the current directory to the one you name.


For example, you would type cd Desktop to shift Terminal's command location to the Desktop directory.
If you want to create a text file in a specific folder within your selected directory, you'll place a ""/"" after the directory and then type in the folder's name. For example: for a folder named ""Misc"" in the Documents directory, you'd type cd Documents/Misc.

, Doing so will run your command, thereby shifting Terminal's target directory from your home directory to the one you specified., You can create a simple text file quickly, or you can use either Vim or Emacs to create and edit an advanced file. Now that you're in the directory in which you wish to place your text file, it's time to proceed with actually creating it., You'll replace ""filename"" with your preferred text file name (e.g., ""sample"").

For example: when creating a file named ""kitty"", you'd type cat > kitty.txt.

, Doing so will create a new text file with the specified name in your current directory. Your cursor will appear on a blank line in Terminal., You can simply type as you typically would for any other text document. To save the current line of text and jump to the next line, you'll press ↵ Enter.

If you have the text file's directory open, you can also simply double-click the text file when it appears to perform this step.

, This key command will save your work and return you to the Terminal command line, allowing you to continue entering commands., You'll replace ""filename"" with the text file's name. This command will locate your file, thus ensuring that it was safely created in your directory.For example: to open a file named ""textfile"", you would type ls -l textfile.txt.
The letters in this code are lowercase ""L"", not uppercase ""i"".

, Doing so should display the time, date, and name of your file on the following line, thus indicating that it was created and saved in your selected directory., The ""vi"" part of this command selects the Vim text editor as the program to use. You'll replace ""filename"" with the name you wish to assign to your new file.


For a file named ""tamins"", for example, you'd type vi tamins.txt.
If your current directory has a file by the same name, this command will instead open that file.

, This will create your new file and open it in the Vim editor. You should see a blank Terminal window with a tilde (~) on each line, as well as your text file's name at the bottom of the window., Doing so will place your document in ""Insert"" mode, wherein you can enter text as needed.

You should see -- INSERT -- pop up at the bottom of the window when you press the I key.

, You can simply type as you typically would for any other text document. To save the current line of text and jump to the next line, you'll press ↵ Enter.

, It's typically in the upper-left corner of your computer's keyboard. This key will place Vim in ""Command"" mode.


You should see a cursor appear at the bottom of the window.

, This command will save your document as it currently is., Doing so will quit out of Vim and return you to Terminal's main interface. Your text file is now in your specified directory.

You can check for the text file by typing ls into Terminal and pressing ↵ Enter and then looking for the file's name.
You can also type :wq to save and quit in one command.

, Just as you did to create the file, you'll type vi filename.txt to open the file. This time when you open the file, you should see any saved changes that you made.

, You'll replace ""filename"" with your preferred name for the text file.

, As long as your text file's name isn't a duplicate of an existing text file in your current directory, this command will open a new text file in the Emacs editor.


For example: a file named ""newfile"" would require you to type emacs newfile.txt.
If you entered an existing text file name, this command will instead open the file in question.

, Emacs comes complete with tons of powerful commands that let you navigate around a document, look up related or help information, manipulate text, and understand your code. These commands fall into two types: Control commands and Meta commands.



Control commands are written like this: C-<letter>. To execute a Control command, you'll hold down the Ctrl key and press the specified letter key at the same time (e.g., Ctrl and A).

Meta (or Escape) commands are written like so: M-<letter> or ESC <letter>. The ""M"" refers to a computer's Alt key or Esc key, since not all computers have the Alt key.
A command written like C-a b (or M-a b) will require you to hold Ctrl (or Alt or Esc) while pressing the first key (e.g., a, then release both keys and immediately press the second key (e.g., b).

, You can simply type as you typically would for any other text document. To save the current line of text and jump to the next line, you'll press ↵ Enter.,, This will exit the Emacs text editor and return you to your directory in Terminal. Your text file should now be saved under your selected name in this directory., To do so, simply type emacs filename.txt into Terminal. As long as you're in the same directory as is the file, doing this will open your text file in Emacs, at which point you may resume editing it if you please."

Do some research into each version.,
Examine the system which you already have, and list the problems you are having with it.,
Decide if the switch from block mapping to extents will benefit you.,
Think of the potential for data loss when the power loss does occur.,
Do the depth parse of your current system.,
Do the fragmentation parse of your current system to make checks of physical locations of logical data groups.,
Have consideration for the interruption to the system as there will be much time involved in the following process:


A backup of the data
A format of target disk
A reinstall of system
A configuration of system
A restoration of data
A check of system

,
Consider the likely future upgrade to the system, as a backport may not be entirely necessary, and a consumption of too much time, if you intend to do the complete reinstall (as apposed to just the simple upgrade) of the system to new supported operating kernel.

,
Examine your need of granularity of timestamp that is pressed on to files.,
If will you have a requirement for the system to be operational post 2038 then the consideration shall be great, as 2 bits of the expanded timestamp field are added to the most significant bits of the seconds field of the timestamps to defer the year 2038 problem to be the problem in 2538 instead, with minimal additional data consumption.

",How to Decide on an Upgrade to the Ext4 File System,";
, Then check other versions to see whether they will solve these issues.

, The extents are the name for the region of contiguous physical blocks, and is likely to be of benefit for those that store the large media, and the resulting reduction of file fragmentation.

, When you make use of ext2, ext3 but not ext4 - more of the data when you do the write cycle has been immediately put on the hard disk and is safe from the outage of power corruption. However - due to the implementation of persistent pre-allocation, the ext4 version may respond faster with the increased risk of loss of data, as write-back to the physical disk has a delay.

, Are you currently near, or in danger of a breach, of the 32,000 sub-directory limit? Then you may consider ext4 journal system, as it has the benefit of raising this limit by a factor of two. This is most unlikely for the regular user.

, Due to implementation of ext2 and ext3 system, there is a great limit on the ability to reduce the occurrence of fragmentation. Implementation of ext4 has work around for this, so if you suffer from the fragment than you can consider this the positive.

,,, Do you have a mission-critical system that relies on timestamp for some reason? The ext4 journal system has now a measurement of timestamp accurate to the nanosecond.

Tell your so-called friend that you don't like how he or she has a lukewarm friendship with you.,
Explain to your so-called friend that you don't appreciate the gossip and rumors at your expense.,
Tell your frenemy that you don't want to be a part of the friendship anymore.,
Listen to what your frenemy has to say.,
Get on with your life.,
Be alert to the potential for backlash.",How to Ditch a Frenemy," Explain that you're no longer interested in the on-again, off-again nature of your friendship. You might also say that since it's clear to you that your friend cannot be trusted to remain loyal, you'd rather not continue been more than just acquaintances. For example:


""Hey Bill. It has been cool to get to know you. But I just don't feel I can rely on you to keep my private information private because I keep hearing things back that I only ever told you. Also, I don't like how sometimes you don't want to be my friend even though you say that you are my friend. That's just really confusing and I don't know where I stand with you."";
, You could also ask your friend to consider how he or she would feel if you did the same thing back. For example:


""Hey Rachel. I really don't like being gossiped about behind my back. If I have done something to annoy someone, I'd prefer that they tell me, so that I can do something to fix things, not just hear rumors about me. And it's always pretty obvious where the rumors came from. I just wondered if you'd ever thought about how it'd feel if someone you felt you could trust turned around and spread lies and rumors about you. Maybe you'd feel hurt if that happened.""

, Explain that you think you've tried to make things work between the two of you long enough but that you've reached a conclusion that two of you just aren't compatible anymore. For example:


""So Geordie, I really don't think this friends thing is going to work out between us anymore. We're just not cut out to be best buddies and share secrets and dreams together. Anything I tell you just gets its own newspaper headline and isn't private anymore, and I'm not prepared to live with that. I'm sorry that it's come to this but I don't want to be close friends anymore. I'm happy to pair up with you in class to do classwork and sports but that's all from now on.""

, It's probable that he or she will either deny any wrongdoing or will promise to make changes. Either way, you already know you've tried really hard and just want things to move on. However, it is an act of courtesy to listen to your friend and acknowledge what is said. You don't need to agree with his or her version of events, just say that you understand the other person's perspective but it's just not how you see things anymore. For example:


""I appreciate you explaining your side of things to me. I understand that it must be hard for you making friends because someone hurt you badly once but I can't be on the receiving end of your distrust of people while you work it all out. We've been here so many times before that while I understand your side of it, I just can't keep letting this hurt me.""

, Realize that it will most likely be hard initially because losing a friend is never an easy thing. However, remind yourself of why you broke off this friendship and why it frees you up to find friends who will have your back and not gossip about you.


Hang out with other friends. Let them know that you have moved on and will no longer be spending time with the frenemy.
Get involved in doing things that your frenemy has no interest in. This will stop the person from bothering you, in case this is an issue.

, Your former friend may resort to the one thing he or she knows how to do so well––spreading rumors and gossiping about you. Let it be. You know where things stand and that this person is capable of anything. The reality is that for a few weeks, things may be tough. However, you'll soon become yesterday's focus and this former friend will either learn to change his or her ways or will choose a new victim to disappoint and gossip about.


Ignore your former friend if he or she behaves badly. You made an offer to stay acquainted for schoolwork purposes and to be polite, but if the other person is being mean or is pestering you, the best you can do is to ignore it and not engage. The moment that you stoop to your former friend's level, he or she has achieved engagement with you. Don't give this person the satisfaction.

Be a good listener.,
Change the subject.,
Cut off the conversation politely.,
Set limits on how long you will listen to her talk.,
Do not call her back right away.,
Let her know you are uncomfortable with the discussion.,
Make time for just the two of you.,
Suggest a girl’s night out.,
Include her boyfriend in social events.",How to Deal With a Friend Who Constantly Talks About Her Boyfriend," Though you may find it difficult to pay attention to what your friend has to say about her boyfriend on a constant basis, you should still strive to be a good friend and be a good listener. Being a good listener does not mean sitting there passively and nodding at everything she says. Instead, you should try to be an active listener who asks questions and engages with your friend. This will allow you to feel part of the conversation and make it feel less one-sided.For example, your friend may start discussing her latest date with her boyfriend. You may then respond by asking questions like, “Where did he take you?” or “What did you do?” Asking a few questions will show your friend that you are trying to engage in the conversation with her and listen to what she has to say.;
, Once you have felt you and your friend had talked enough about her boyfriend, you should attempt to change the subject. Try to bring up something that happened during your day or what you did the night before. You may share this by saying, “Let me tell you what I did last night,” or “I had a really good day today.” Your friend should then take the cue that it’s time to change the subject and focus on something else besides her boyfriend.


You may also try to change the subject subtly by piggybacking off something your friend has said about her boyfriend. For example, perhaps your friend mentions that her and her boyfriend went to a great restaurant the other night. You may then say, “Oh, I went there last week. I was hanging out with Molly and…”. This could then allow you to shift the conversation to another topic in a subtle way.

, If your friend is really deep into her new relationship, she may not take the hint and continue to go on about her boyfriend, despite your attempts to change the subject. If this is the case, you may have to politely cut off the conversation so you do not become frustrated or upset. Doing this will save you from having to hear about her boyfriend and also really make it clear you want to talk about something else.For example, you may say, “You know, I have to get going. Thanks for the coffee, let’s get together next week!” Or you may politely say, “I’m late for class. Let’s catch up tomorrow?”
Cutting off the conversation politely will give you a way out of the conversation and perhaps signal to your friend that you are getting tired of listening to all the details of her relationship.

, For the sake of your sanity and your friendship, you may decide to set a limit on how long you will listen to your friend talk about her boyfriend. This may be 20 minutes, 30 minutes, or 10 minutes per a conversation. You may keep this limit to yourself and then enforce it once you have reached it. Setting limits will allow you to still be a good friend and support your friend’s new relationship without sacrificing too much of your time or energy.You may also set limits on how often you listen to your friend talk about her boyfriend on a weekly basis. You may decide to spend time on that particular conversation twice a week or only once a week. This may mean you spend less time with friend for at least the first few weeks of her new relationship until she settles into it and talks about it less.
There are many different ways you can enforce the limit you set on your friend's talking about her boyfriend. You can try changing the subject to another topic. You can also move the conversation to something about your surroundings, like the food you're eating or the bird you see in a tree. You can also take a break from talking for a little bit. You can also just say that you want to talk about something else or that you don't want to talk about her boyfriend anymore. You can also leave the situation entirely. You should decide which of these options to take based on your relationship with your friend and the situation you're in at the time.

, You can also set boundaries by giving your friendship some space and breathing room. This may mean not calling or texting your friend back right away. Or, you may set her call aside and make a plan to call her back when you are ready to talk about her boyfriend. Doing this can help you control how often you hear about her new relationship.For example, you may notice your friend has called you in the morning. You may then put off calling her back until the evening when you have set aside an hour of time to talk. You may then call her back and say, “Okay, I have an hour to chat before bed. What’s up?”

, If your friend continues to talk too much about her boyfriend, you may need to sit her down and have a discussion with her about how you are feeling. You may have the chat in person and in a private location, like your home or in a park outside. Bring up the topic with her and be honest about how you are feeling. Communication is key to a good friendship.For example, you may start the conversation by saying, “I value you as a friend and I want us to stay friends. But I am having trouble with how often you talk about your boyfriend. I am interested in hearing about your relationship but I also think we should talk about other things and share other things happening in our lives. How do you feel about this?”
Try to keep the conversation open and honest. Listen to your friend’s response and work together to come up with a solution to the issue. As friends, you should be able to share constructive feedback about how you are acting and be honest with each other.

, You can also deal with your friend’s intense interest in her relationship by trying to still make time for the two of you to hang out, one on one. Spending time together can allow you to build memories that do not have anything to do with her relationship. It will also give you a way to shift the focus from her relationship to your friendship.When you are making plans with her, you should make sure you choose a specific date and time for the hangout. Avoid making vague plans, as these could then change due to plans she might have with her boyfriend.
For example, you may say, “How about we get together on Friday night at 7 pm for dinner?” or you may say, “What about hanging out after school tomorrow?” Put the hangout in your calendar and commit to it so you get time together, just the two of you.

, Another way you can focus on your friendship is to plan a girl’s night out. This could be with other girlfriends you have and exclude any boys, including your friend’s boyfriend. Having a girl’s night can allow you all to hang out and make memories together, separate of your other relationships.You may try to collaborate with your friend on the girl’s night so she is involved and invested. You may ask her advice on what to do or where to go as a ground. You may plan the night together so you can also spend time together one on one.

, Though you want to make sure there is enough time for your friendship, you should not disregard your friend’s relationship when you are planning social outings. If the social outing is not a girl’s only night, you should make an effort to include your friend’s boyfriend. Inviting him will show your friend that you do not have a problem with him and are supportive their relationship.She also probably won't talk about him a lot during the time you're all together, because he will be right there.

Consider whether you are being codependent.,
Consider whether your friend listens to you.,
See if there is consistency in how your friend acts to you.,
Think about how your friend treats you.,
Look at your friend's words as opposed to their actions.,
Consider whether your friend only acknowledges you and talks to you when he/she is not talking to their other friends.,
Heed the warnings of others.,
Admit that you are in a one-sided friendship.,
Ask to have a private conversation with your friend.,
Raise your concerns.,
Ask the ""friend"" to change his/her behavior and act more like a friend to you.,
Keep your word.,
Take time out for your emotions.",How to Deal With a One‐Sided Friendship," It may not be that your friend does not share the same feelings of friendship for you that you do for them, but it may be that they feel that they have been hanging out with you all the time and wants to seek other friends or interests. Remember that just because your friend can't hang out with you every second of the day, doesn't mean you are in a one-sided friendship. They're still interested in being your friend; they just want to find new friends.;
, Listening is crucial in any relationship. If you feel like you're always the one that is listening to what's going on in your friend's life and they do not do the same for you, this is definitely a one-sided friendship.

, If your friend is friendly, kind and helpful to you every day, you have a mutual friendship! However, if your ""friend"" is kind to you on some days and is not so great to you on other days, this is a huge red flag that could mean you are in a one-sided friendship.

, If your ""friend"" is mean to you, puts you down, or treats you like an enemy rather than a friend, you are definitely in a one-sided relationship. For example, if you ask to be in a picture with your friend and their circle of friends and they say ""no"", this likely means that your friend does not want you to be in the picture since they do not consider you a friend.

, The saying ""actions speak louder than words"" definitely applies in this case, so take a close look at your friend's behavior towards you. Do they make plans with you and then cancel or blow them off? Do they reject the offer of spending time with you or talking to you while claiming you're a friend? Do they say they'll text or call you, and then never follow through on it? If your ""friend"" is continuously saying they're your friend but their actions indicate otherwise, you're likely to be in a one-sided friendship.


If a friend makes plans with you and then ends up canceling once, this doesn't mean you're in a one-sided friendship. However, if you're seeing a constant trend in which you offer to spend time with your friend and they keep turning you down or giving noncommittal answers, you may be in a one-sided friendship.

, If your friend only talks to you individually when they're not hanging out with other friends and ignores everything you say in conversation, it is very likely that your ""friend"" does not consider you part of their circle of friends. In addition, if your ""friend"" constantly leaves you out of group activities with other friends, this is a definite warning sign.

, If you talk to another person about the possibly one-sided friendship, you may be able to get some advice as to whether it's one-sided or not. Try getting opinions from both friends and family - if your mother just dislikes this person, it's less credible than if both your parents and your friend group say that they think your so-called friend dislikes you.

, If you don't know or won't admit that you are in a one-sided friendship, you can't do anything to fix it. Think of it this way: the longer you don't admit that you're in a one-sided friendship, the longer you're stuck in it, which means you're just going to be treated badly for longer, and it will hurt more if you have to get out of it!

, Find a public and safe spot for just the two of you, such as a cafe or public park. Be warned, though, that this can make things awkward if there ends up being a scene.


Avoid using texts or social media. If you absolutely can't meet face-to-face, call your friend and talk to them about it over a phone call. Text-based conversation is easy to misinterpret, which can cause a lot more fights than needed.

, Don't be too harsh, but be direct enough. For example, you could say ""Maddie, it hurts me when I ask to play with you and your friends and you always say no and tell me to go away. This makes me feel like you don't consider me a friend and you don't want to hang out with me. Do you think we're friends?""


Only ask this question if you're emotionally capable of handling whatever answer you get. There's a possibility your ""friend"" could be dismissive, passive-aggressive or outright cruel when you ask this question, so be sure you can handle what happens.


, Firmly warn him/her that if he does not change, you are ending the friendship. Stand by your decision.

, If, even after the talk, your ""friend"" does not change and keeps the ""false friend"" behavior up, end it. Cut off the person completely. Life is meant to be enjoyed, and it is so short that you have no time to waste on toxic people. They do not deserve the gift of your time and attention. Stick with your current true friends.


If you don't have any other friends aside from your one-sided ""friend"", then now is a good time to go out and make some new friends. Don't be afraid to try out online friendships, either, but you should be cautious with online-based friendships, as they don't develop the same way as a face-to-face friendship would. You will also be unsure if your online friend is legit; many people online are not who they say they are.

, If you and your ""friend"" end up splitting, this is likely to be a rough time for you, so there is no need to pretend to be happy. Don't be afraid to express your emotions to true friends or family. Don't be afraid to cry, and don't be afraid to feel angry. You can even punch or throw a soft item that cannot be broken easily, such as a pillow. Your emotions are valid, and it's okay for someone to make you feel upset.


If you begin having thoughts of self-injury or suicide, reach out to someone who can help you. Nobody should ever make you feel like you should harm yourself or end your life. There are crisis lines available if needed.

Take care of how you advertise.,

Find out if they're handy about the house and/or house proud.,
Talk to them in advance about how you see the household costs being divided.,
Consider personal habits.,
Ask them if they have any pets.,
Check their references.,
Make no promises after interviewing the potential housemate.",How to Choose a Housemate," Advertising In the newspaper and online will attract the most people, but not all of them will be ideal. There may be other ways of advertising for the space in your house, such as:


By word-of-mouth through friends






Advertising only at work






Advertising on a club bulletin board, or through your hobby






Asking family if they know of anyone, etc.





;
, It is important to get a feel for whether or not you're going to ""click"" with this person. And this is an ideal opportunity to ask them lots of questions, particularly focused on household habits and expectations, finances, and expected length of stay. Find out about their background, such as whether they're working, studying, or in transition. The trick is though, do this casually, not as if you're the Spanish Inquisition!


Note financial warning signs such as long-term unemployment, casual work rather than regular work, etc. It doesn't mean they won't be a good bet if they're conscientious but you don't know that yet.






Ask about their schedule, such as what times they normally work and sleep? It may prove difficult to live with someone if they are clamoring around the house while you are trying to sleep.







, It's hard to live with people who won't pull their own weight, such as washing the dishes, keeping clothes off the floor in the common areas, and skiving off cleaning duties.

, Gauge from their reaction to this discussion whether or not you think they'll be a good fit.

, If your house is non-smoking and the prospective housemate is a smoker, is that something you can put up with (perhaps with outside-only smoking rules), or is it something you can't tolerate at all? Other things to find out about are their preferences about coming in late, holding parties, having friends or family over to stay, dietary needs, and any religious considerations.


Find out about medical issues. Do they need special medication or treatment if anything goes wrong? Can you handle that or not?

, If this is going to be a problem, disqualify this person immediately.

, Get at least two references from places they've lived in in the past. Also ask real estate agents they've rented from because they're less likely to be friends or family.


If you can't contact the referees, be wary as they may not exist.

, Tell them that you've enjoyed speaking with them and that you'll be in touch as soon as you've decided; make it clear that there is a range of contenders and you need to think things over first.

Think about who you are really closest to.,
Think about what you do together that you would miss.,
Make a list of the things that annoy you about them.,
Make a list of the best things about them and your friendship.",How to Choose Between Friends1," Generally it is mutual affection, trust, loyalty, and acceptance that contribute most to our lasting friendships.So think carefully about which of your friends you feel most comfortable and relaxed around. Good friends are people who take you as you are, and like you for who you are. This support is key to mutually great friendships, so think about who you are really closest to, and can really talk to.;
, If you are going to choose one friend over the other, it's unlikely that your overlooked friend will still want to do things with you. If one of your favourite things is going to the movies with Sarah, then think carefully about whether you might actually be closer to her than you thought. Being relaxed around someone is a good indicator of a strong friendship.

, One practical way to measure up friendships is to write down a list of things that irritate you about somebody. This could be a cathartic exercise, but try not to get too carried away. If all the points seem fairly trivial then it indicates that you don’t have major differences.


""Has an annoying laugh"", is less significant than ""always interrupts me"", or ""isn’t there when I need them"".
Compare the lists and mark the points you have written ""serious"" and ""trivial"" to get a clearer picture.

, The more positive side to this list-making is writing up what you really like about your friends. Think about their personality, how they treat you, and what you do together. Don’t put down more superficial things, even if they have got a really cool haircut or a nice house.


Compare the two lists and pick out the most significant things.
""Accepts and likes me for who I am"", ""we always have loads of fun"", and ""completely trustworthy"" are examples of excellent friendship indicators.If you write the positive list last, it will leave you with a warmer feeling about your friends.

"
"
Try to be neutral.,
Tell them how you feel.,
Avoid rushing into a decision.,
Consider stepping back from both of them.",How to Choose Between Friends2," If they are pressuring you to choose a ""best friend"", try to take a neutral stance. It’s not really fair of them to try to force you into choosing a best friend, and you don’t have to just because they say so. Say that you appreciate both of them and tell them why. Say something like, ""I really like both of you, and don’t want to choose just one as a best friend"".


You can be specific and say what you like about each and try to point out what they like about each other at the same time.
""Ella, I really like hanging out with you because you’re so laid back. Sally, you’re really funny and I like joking around with you.""
Point out that the three of you make a good combination and be positive.

, It can be awkward, but it’s best to try to explain your side of it. Of course it is hard for them to be fighting, but it’s not easy for you being stuck in the middle either. They should understand this, but they might be caught up in themselves and have not thought about how tough it is for you. Explain carefully and sympathetically that it’s no picnic for you.


Say something like, ""I know it’s hard for you, but it’s horrible for me to be stuck in middle of you. I want to be friends with both of you, and the whole situation is upsetting for me.""
Be patient and you might help them to put it all in perspective.

, If you have tried to stay neutral and leave them to it, but they are still pushing you to choose, you may feel it is unavoidable. If you are going to choose, don’t rush into it. Think it over carefully and try to weigh up your options before you do anything. Use the steps in the first method, and ask yourself who makes you feel good about yourself.


People who make us feel good about ourselves, and validated in who we are, are often those whom we will be good friends with for a long time., This is a bold option, but you might feel you have no choice but to move away from them both. It’s possible that if they really pressure you, or are horrible to each other, that you might change your opinion about them. If they are pushy and mean you might decide that you don’t actually want to be friends with either of them. Don’t be afraid to tell them this. Some tough love might be enough to make them have a rethink.


It takes courage to say no to this kind of peer pressure, especially from close friends, but if you think it’s the right to do, do it.Say something like, ""I’m sorry, but you’re upsetting me by trying to make me choose.""
Or, ""we’re not having any fun, so can we just move on?""

"
"
Be wary of putting yourself in the firing line.,
Work out how serious the fight was.,
Stay neutral, but don’t let them complain about each other to you.,
Don’t let it take over your life.,
Think over everything that has happened.",How to Choose Between Friends3," If your friends are fighting you will probably think you should intervene to try to calm everybody down. This could work, but be aware that your intervention might be interpreted as siding with one over the other, which will only make things worse. Once you are involved in the fight it’s hard to get back out of it again.

, If you think it might be something which blows over after a couple of weeks then it is good idea to just employ some stalling tactics. They might be really angry to start with and insist you pick a side, but remain neutral and don’t fan the flames. If you can be a voice of reason and de-escalate the tension then you might be able to help them return to being friends. This way you won’t have to choose one or the other!

, If you’re friends have fallen out and you are still spending time with them separately, don’t let a situation develop where you become the passive receiver of all their angst. You might find that one friend says something like ""she’s so annoying, she never listens to me, and she’s so selfish"". Don’t get involved in a slanging match, instead calmly say you disagree.


You could say, ""actually, I think she can be really kind, but nobody’s perfect all the time. If you think she’s really annoying, that’s too bad.""

, It might seem like the most important thing in the world to the two protagonists, but you don’t have to let their falling out dominate your life. If you feel like this is what is happening, you should explain to them that it’s not fair and they are making you unhappy. Use neutral language, try not to take sides, but try to change the subject.


Say something like, ""I know you’re upset, but can’t we talk about something else? Maybe we could just go and do something fun and forget about it for a while.""
Politely but firmly change the subject if you have to.
If you just get back to having fun together, the fight might start to seem a lot less important.

, If it comes down to it and it is impossible for you to stay friends with both of them, it is a good idea to think about how they each reacted to the falling out. Ask yourself how they treated you, as well as each other. If you think one turned on the other, or one of them was especially pushy towards you, maybe this isn’t someone you want to be good friends with.

"
Determine why you are choosing between friends.,
Know if it is only a short-term issue.,
Understand that friendships change over time.,
Have a chat with your parents.",How to Choose Between Friends4," You should make sure you are absolutely certain you understand what brought you to this point. There could be many possible reasons why you feel it is necessary to make a choice between friends, but the circumstances and context will most likely have an impact on how you approach it.


Figuring this out at the start might mean you can find a way around choosing, and can reconcile the situation instead.

, It can happen that two friends have invited you to different events on the same day and you can only go to one. This could be a cause for friction, but needn’t lead to any serious falling out. It’s a good idea to go to the first event you were invited to. Explain to your other friend that you can’t go to her event, because you already promised you’d be somewhere else. Instead, offer a special day for just the two of you to make up for it., Knowing someone for years and years doesn’t always translate into a deep and lasting friendship. As you grow older you change in all sorts of ways and you may find that you don’t feel as close to someone as you used to.You can outgrow a friendship, so think about this and don’t blindly choose the person you have known the longest.

, If you’re struggling to deal with all the stress from the situation, talk to your parents about it. They were young once too, and can give you some advice about how to deal with the situation. They will give you a fresh perspective which can be very useful. Be honest and direct with them, and they will respond in the same way.Bear in mind that your parents’ main concern will be you and your happiness and wellbeing.
You could also talk to other friends about it, but be sure that you can speak in confidence.

Soak up any spilled liquid.,
Wipe down the surface.,
Use a jelly compound.",How to Clean a Mechanical Keyboard1," If you have an accident and spill something on your mechanical keyboard, the first step is to do damage control and clean up the mess. Soak up any of the excess material with paper towels or a regular bath towel.Then let your keyboard air dry completely before trying anything else. This usually takes about 2-3 days.;
, Use a damp paper towel to wipe down the surface of the mechanical keyboard. You should be able to scrub off any sticky residue or grime that is stuck on the surface. This will help minimize the amount of dirt that gets down into the keys that could potentially cause a problem later.

You can also use a disposable cleaning wipe to get this job done.

, A jelly compound is a material that is often used for cleaning keyboards because it conforms to the small spaces and attracts dirt and debris stuck down in your keyboard. Take off all the keycaps and then dab the sticky compound on your mechanical keyboard.You can also try using the jelly material with the keys still on. But you’ll get a more efficient clean if you remove the keycaps.
Be careful not to use a compound that is too sticky, as this could result in residue being transferred to your keyboard that negates the whole point of cleaning it in the first place.
You should be able to purchase sticky compound at any office supply store.

"
"
Remove all the keycaps.,
Wash keycaps.,
Dump the contents outside.,
Clean the keyboard with a pipe cleaner and alcohol.,
Reassemble the keyboard.",How to Clean a Mechanical Keyboard2," Use a tool called a keycap puller (that looks like a little pair of wire tongs) to remove all of the keycaps from your keyboard. Simply push down on each keycap with the puller and then pull back. This should remove each individual keycap.Try to keep the keycaps sorted so that they are easy to reapply. You might consider keeping all of the keycaps from the right side sorted together and all the keycaps from the left side sorted together.

, Take off all of the keycaps and wash them using a gentle dish soap and warm water on a paper towel. Be sure to remove any sticky residue or dirt from each key as you wash them.You can also submerge the keycaps in a bowl containing a solution of warm water and denture cleaning tablets. Let the keycaps soak and then wipe them off.
Let the keycaps dry completely before attempting to reattach them to your mechanical keyboard. This could take 1-2 days.

, Take your mechanical keyboard outside. Turn it upside down and dump all of the dirt and debris onto the ground. Be careful not to shake out any of the internal pieces from your mechanical keyboard, but shake it hard enough to get out most of the debris.You could dump it into the trash, but then you risk all of the debris flying around and settling elsewhere in your home.
You can also spray some compressed canned air on the keyboard while it’s upside down to get rid of some of the extra grime.

, Dampen a pipe cleaner with some rubbing alcohol and gently run the pipe cleaner along the dismantled keyboard. Be careful not to use too much alcohol so it doesn’t drip on the keyboard components.Be sure to let the remnants of the rubbing alcohol dry completely before you put your mechanical keyboard back together and plug it back in. This could cause your keyboard to short out and ruin it.

, Once you have cleaned the keyboard and let it (and the keycaps) dry completely, it’s time to put the mechanical keyboard back together. Snap each keycap back into place until you have reassembled the entire façade of the keyboard.

Make sure you position the keycaps back in the correct place – you may want to consult a diagram of a qwerty keyboard before beginning.

Use a can of compressed air.,
Use an anti-static vacuum.,
Check your manufacturer’s warranty.",How to Clean a Mechanical Keyboard3," One of the easiest ways to keep your mechanical keyboard clean is by regularly spraying it with a can of compressed air. This method involves blowing a strong stream of air onto your keyboard that pushes out all of the dust and debris that has settled in those hard-to-reach places between the keys.You can usually find cans of compressed air at office supply stores for less than $10.
Spray your mechanical keyboard with the compressed air once every few days to keep it nice and clean.

, The biggest problem with using canned air is that it doesn’t get rid of the dust and debris – it simply blows it around to settle elsewhere in the room. Vacuuming up the debris is a good solution; however, regular vacuum cleaners aren’t recommended for use with electrical devices because of the electrostatic discharge that can affect you and your computer. Instead, purchase an anti-static vacuum cleaner to suck up all the gross stuff that accumulates in your mechanical keyboard.This will help your keyboard stay cleaner for longer since you are actually eliminating the dust, rather than just blowing it around.

, Most mechanical keyboards come with a warranty from the manufacturer. Many cleaning options – like running it through the dishwasher or removing and lubricating the keycaps – may void your warranty. Check what the warranty says before proceeding because you don’t want to ruin it.Follow any cleaning instructions in the user’s manual and consider contacting the manufacturer for a replacement if necessary.

Close the deal.",How to Buy a House With Friends," A partnership agreement is a legal contract entered into when a group of individuals go in together on a joint venture. In this situation, the joint venture is buying a home. The partnership agreement will dictate how you and your friends will be required to interact when it comes to purchasing and living in the home. While you and your friends can agree to almost anything, if you fail to address certain issues, state laws (usually called Uniform Partnership Acts) will fill in the blanks for you.To avoid conflict, address as many hypothetical scenarios you and your friends can think of. No issue is too small or too big.;
, One of the first things your agreement should address is how you and your friends will decide on a home to purchase. This might include provisions about what you are looking for in a home and what is a deal breaker. In addition, think about how you and your friends will agree on a mortgage loan. These issues need to be worked out ahead of time in order to avoid disputes down the road.


For example, make it clear if everyone wants a pool, a backyard, a porch, or a large kitchen. Furthermore, make it clear if there are things you do not want (e.g., anything less than a four bedroom home).
With mortgages, decide whether everyone wants a fixed-rate or variable loan. Discuss how much you are willing to take in a loan and what is too much.

, Normally, when someone purchases a home, they take title in fee simple absolute or in tenancy by the entirety. Common with married couples, tenancy by the entirety is a joint tenancy whereby one spouse takes ownership over the other spouse's share upon that spouse's death. However, you and your friends should consider agreeing to take title as tenants in common.


As tenants in common, every partner will have an equal right to possess and use the whole property while maintaining the ability to transfer their interest to anyone they want., If you and your friends take ownership as tenants in common, you will need to agree on how transfers will occur. If you do not, you or any of your friends could transfer their share of the property to anyone whether you know or like them.


If an owner wants to sell, consider providing every other owner with a right of first refusal.If you agree to a right of first refusal, you give any of the other owners the right to buy the seller's interest before anyone else can.This way, if you and your friends desire, you can keep the property in your circle instead of letting someone else in.

, In addition to determining how one owner can sell their interest, you should also decide how an owner's interest will transfer at death. With an tenancy in common, an owner's interest will be passed down to heirs or beneficiaries upon their death. If you want to avoid this, you can agree to allow the other owners to buy out whoever inherits the property., When you and your friends sign a mortgage, each of you will be jointly and severally liable for the debt. This means that if one friend fails to make a payment, you and the other friends will be responsible for picking up the slack. If you and your friends fail to make timely payments, the lender (i.e., the bank) can come after any one of you to recoup their loss.


For this reason, consider stipulating that if one owner fails to make a certain number of payments, that owner will be required to sell their share of the property to every other owner.
If you do this, you should agree to have an appraiser determine the value of that person's share., To avoid problems and disputes, make sure you address who will be responsible for the home's maintenance. This agreement should include as many responsibilities as possible.For example, explicitly lay out who will mow the lawn, take out the trash, pay utility bills, fix broken windows, and any other seemingly mundane responsibility you can think of. The more responsibilities addressed the smoother things will run when you own the home with your friends.

, When you and your friends own a home, things will inevitably break down and repairs will have to be made. With this in mind, decide how funds will be collected to pay for these repairs. While you could collect money from everyone in an equal amount as the bills come in, you may want to consider putting money aside for the repairs. In doing this, you and every other owner will pay a certain amount monthly into an account. The account will then be accessed when repairs need to be made.In utilizing a joint account for the purpose of making repairs, you will ensure money is available when you need it. In addition, you might put it in an interest bearing account where your money can grow so long as it is not needed.

, One of the most contested issues will likely be who gets to use the property when. You and your friends will all want to use it at different times and you want to try and accommodate everyone as best as possible. For this reason, you and your friends need to agree on how use will be allocated.


One possibility is to allow open access to any owner at any time. This may be logical if there are only a few owners who don't mind sharing the property, even if they are there at the same time.
Another possibility is to create a yearly use schedule. Using this method, you and your friends will get together once a year and agree on when each owner will get to use the property. For example, you could split it up by months. You could also determine if there are special dates one owner may want the property (i.e., holidays, birthdays, or anniversaries). No matter how you split it up, agree to a method ahead of time., Address who can access the property apart from you and the other owners. A lot of times, one of your friends may want to allow their friend or family member to use the house, even though the other owner might not be present. You and the others will need to decide how you will handle these requests.


One option is to allow open access to the home as long as one of the owners knows the person using the home. This might be a good choice if you trust your friends and the company they keep.
Another option may be to only allow access to the owners and their families. This is a good option if you want to keep access limited for whatever reason., Before you purchase a home with friends, you need to agree on how the house will be used. Make sure you cover as many scenarios as you can think of. Do not leave any detail out. For example, will you allow owners or their guests to bring pets, will you allow smoking in or around the home, and will you allow parties?, Towards the end of your partnership agreement you should lay out how decisions will be made among you and your friends. If something comes up that is not covered by your agreement, how will you decide how to handle it?


One option would be by requiring a unanimous vote. This may be viable if you are part of a small ownership group and you all agree relatively easily. However, it may be difficult if you are part of a large group.
If you are part of a larger ownership group, you may require a majority vote. In this scenario, whichever option gets the most votes would be implemented., When multiple individuals sign a mortgage agreement, each one of you will be joint and severally liable. If you or someone else fails to pay, the others will have to pick up the slack and make the full payment. You and the other potential co-owners need to have a serious conversation about everyone's financial situation. Make sure everyone understand the responsibility that comes with signing a mortgage together., When a lender looks into your qualifications to get a loan, the lender will use everyone's credit ratings. If even one person in your group has bad credit, your interest rate may rise and the amount you qualify for might go down. Make sure everyone in your group has an acceptable credit rating that will not jeopardize your ability to get a reasonable mortgage.


A small interest rate increase (for example 4.5% vs. 4%) can make a big difference in your monthly payments and how much interest you pay over the life of the loan., Once you have a good group of individuals you feel confident investing in a home with, start shopping for lenders. Different lenders will offer different interest rates, different loan amounts, and different fees. Shop around in accordance with your partnership agreement for the best deal possible. In addition, you can always negotiate with lenders to help get a better deal.


Loans will usually either be fixed rate or variable rate. A fixed rate loan has an interest rate that stays constant throughout the life of the loan. If you think that rates are low and may rise in the future, you might consider taking a fixed rate mortgage.On the other hand, a variable-rate (or ARM) mortgage has an interest rate that fluctuates over time. Variable-rate mortgages can help you afford a home you may not be able to purchase with a fixed-rate mortgage, but you have to be prepared for sudden increases in monthly payments.Every loan has certain fees associated with it. For example, you will usually have to pay ""points"", which are fees paid to the lender depending on the interest rate you have. Usually, the lower the interest rate, the more points you pay. Other fees will include origination, underwriting, broker, and closing fees.Make sure you shop around and find the best deal.

, When you find a lender and mortgage type everyone can agree to, you will want to get preapproved for the loan. When you get preapproved, the lender is verifying your ability to take out a loan for a certain amount. Preapproval will usually last for a certain period of time (generally 90 days).Your preapproval letter can be used to show sellers you are serious about purchasing the home. It will also give sellers the peace of mind that you can make a serious offer.

, When all of your ducks are in a row, you and your friends can start searching for homes. If everyone is busy, you might want to hire a professional to search for you. Real estate agents are relatively easy to find. However, not everyone is created equal and some are better than others. When you talk with potential agents, ask whether they represent buyers or sellers, what neighborhoods they are familiar with, how many clients are they currently working with, and if their license is still valid and in good standing., If you hire a professional, they will talk with you and your friends about what you are looking for. Once the agent has a good idea of what everyone wants, the agent will go out and find properties for you.


If you are searching as a group, start by looking at neighborhoods that fit your needs and budget. While you can go out and search in-person, you should consider using the internet to help you.

, Be aware of restrictions in some neighborhoods regarding how many people can live in a home and other zoning restrictions there may be. For example, every county will have zoning laws dictating what type of homes and businesses can be located in particular places. Some zoning rules restrict how many people can live in a single-dwelling home and how many parking spaces a home can have.Before you put an offer in on a home, be sure your use of the home will not be unreasonably restricted.

, Before you make an offer on a home, determine how much you and your friends will be willing to pay. The best way to do this is to look at comparable homes in the same neighborhood. By searching public records, you will be able to determine what homes sold for in the past. Using that information you will be able to determine what your dream home is worth.


To search public records, go to the county recorder's office where the property is located. From there, ask to search public land records, which will include deeds and other information about properties.

, Most sellers (and lenders) will require you to make a down payment, with the remainder of the purchase price eligible for a loan. As a rule of thumb, most down payments are between 10% and 20% of the total purchase price. For example, if the home you are looking at costs $200,000, you can expect to have to make a down payment of between $20,000 and $40,000.


Once you know what your down payment would be, you and your friends need to gather the funds. Your partnership agreement should discuss how this will be done.

, When you find your dream home, make quick moves and submit a bid. Your initial offer should reflect the value you have placed on the home and how much you can afford. If you really want the home, do not lowball.


Think of creative ways to negotiate a deal. For example, ask if the seller will leave the kitchen appliances in the home if you meet his or her purchase price. You could also ask the seller to remove furniture and offer a lower price., When an agreement is made, you will work to close the deal and take possession of your new home. Before and during the closing period, you will need to get your mortgage loan finalized and put in place. Since you were preapproved, this process is as simple as calling your lender. The purchase money will be placed in an account and transferred to the seller at closing. Once the purchase price has been paid, you and your friends will take possession of your new home.

Unplug the charger.,
Remove the battery from the computer.,
Grab a toothbrush or cotton swab.,
Brush out the charging port.,
Dust off the connector.,
Reset the charging pins.,
Test the connection.,
Clean the charging port regularly.,
Clear out the port with compressed air.,
Replace broken or deteriorating chargers.",How to Clean a MagSafe Port," Before you begin cleaning or otherwise handling your computer’s internal components, it’s important to make sure that it’s disconnected from its primary power source. Pull the AC plug out of the wall outlet, then remove the adapter from the computer’s charging port.In order to clean the MagSafe port and connector, you’ll need to have unobstructed access to both.;
, It’s also a good idea to go ahead and disconnect the battery, since it provides residual power to the computer. To remove the battery, turn the computer over and slide the tab or press the button off to the side of the battery compartment. It should then simply lift out.Always be careful with your computer’s battery. Once you’ve got it out, set it aside someplace where it won’t be dropped or have something spilled on it.
Though it’s unlikely, cleaning an electronic device with an active battery could result in a shock to you or damage to the device., These types of soft, flexible items work best because they can get into cracks and crevices without damaging any of the delicate connector pieces. You may also have success using another type of small brush, like a makeup or razor brush.


It’s important that the object you use be completely dry. Never apply cleaning sprays or any other liquids to your computer’s open connections.Make sure the toothbrush or cotton swab is clean to avoid transferring dirt and other substances.
Avoid using metal objects, such as paperclips, inside the charging port. Not only can this interfere with the port’s magnetic properties, it’s also an electrical hazard.

, Go over the walls of the port with the toothbrush or cotton swab, making sure to sweep out all visible dust and debris. Depending on how dirty the port is, it may take several passes to clear it out. It’s especially vital to clear away any tiny metallic particles you come across, as these can reduce the contact between the charging connector and the port.If you haven’t cleaned your computer’s charging port in a while, you can use the point of a toothpick to break up caked-on dirt and grime.Make sure that no fibers of any kind are left behind inside the port’s pin receptacles., Now that the MagSafe port is clean, take the adapter itself and give the inside a thorough brushing as well to remove dust and metal debris. Be sure to get down around the charging pins with the tip of the cotton swab or the bristles of the toothbrush.Scrub vigorously to remove gunk that’s solidified around the edges of the connector.
Don’t worry about displacing the charging pins. They’re designed to move freely when you touch them.

, Every now and then the brass pins in the connector will get stuck in the “down” position, which prevents them from making a solid connection inside the port. You can usually correct this issue by simply plugging and unplugging the adapter a few times until the pins right themselves on their own. If the pins are still stuck after multiple attempts, press them sideways with your fingertip to pop them back into place.Careful and regular cleaning around the charging pins will make them less likely to stick in the future.

, Try inserting and removing the adapter a few times to see whether it connects securely. If it seems loose or you encounter any kind of resistance, it may be necessary to go over either the port or the connector again more meticulously.Turn the computer on and look for the icon indicating that it’s charging to appear.If the adapter frequently comes out of place, it may be due to a bad magnetic connection. In this case, buying a new charger might be your only option.

, Bacteria, dust, stray hairs and other unwanted intruders can accumulate at a surprising rate. Aim to show your computer’s charging inputs some attention about once a month. The better you maintain them, the better they’ll perform.


Refrain from eating or drinking around your computer as much as possible.Consider cleaning more frequently if you share your household with pets or tend to use your computer outdoors.

, If you really want to deep clean your computer’s MagSafe port, a quick blast of compressed air can flush out any remaining dust or debris. It’s best to do this outside where you’re less likely to make a mess. Point the nozzle of the canister at the port at a slight angle, then press the button in short bursts.Compressed air is also useful for tidying up around the battery compartment, adapter and other components with narrow openings.Don’t forget to replace the battery when you’re done.

, If you notice any frayed wires, chipped metal or damage around the sheathing, it may be time to shell out for a new charger cord. Even if the MagSafe port itself is perfectly clean, it won’t be enough to properly charge your computer without an intact and fully functioning adapter.Faulty chargers can often be replaced at no cost to you. Take your charger to an Apple store to have it inspected for flaws.
Check the warranty information included with your computer's owner's manual to see what types of issues it covers.

Give them a call.,
Suggest plans.,
Ask questions.,
Create a connection.,
Respect their decision.",How to Contact Old Friends," Just about everyone is on social media these days. You can likely use tools like Facebook or Instagram to find the old friend you are looking for. Typing their name into the search area of the social media site may bring up their name and give you a way to get in touch with them.


Some people make themselves private on social media, meaning that the general public can’t view their profiles. Still, you should be able to send them a friend request or write a brief message.;
, Joining an alumni association may help you find a friend you went to high school or college with, if they are also a part of the association. Joining may give you access to their contact information, which could allow you to find them.


Go to your school’s website and look for the link to the alumni association. You can also call your school and ask about joining the association.
These types of organizations typically have get-togethers that allow you to interact with people you went to school with, giving you the opportunity to find the person you are looking for, as well as others you may have lost contact with., Other people you know may still be in contact with the old friend you are looking for. Reaching out to mutual friends via social media may help you get in touch. You may also be able to reach out to connections to obtain their contact information.


Use social media or search engines to find their mutual friends or family members. Make sure you introduce yourself in a way that helps them remember you. If not, they will likely be afraid or hesitant to give you the information you’re looking for., A few different websites are available that help you get in touch with people. These sites are typically a bit more useful than general search engines are, as they often give you more specific information and not as many results. Free sites are helpful, but sites that require payment often give you more contact information.


For example, you can try the free sites wink.com, zabasearch.com, and pipl.com to find your friend. Or you can pay to use peoplefinders.com and intelius.com to potentially receive more useful information., Sending a message through social media is usually welcomed among people you haven’t seen in a while. It doesn’t put them on the spot when talking to you. It gives them a chance to think about what you’ve said, and time to formulate a response.


Contacting them through social media also allows them to look at your own social media account. This can help bring them up to speed about you and your life if if they have trouble recalling who you are., Compose a quick and casual email, if you find their address. Again, writing an email gives them time to decide what they are going to say and if they are going to take you up on your offer. Talking to a person on the phone may make them feel like they have to say yes to you, even if they don’t really want to.


In the email you could say, “Hi! I hope you’re doing well; it’s been a long time! I’ve been thinking about how we used to have so much fun together and thought it would be nice to catch up with you sometime.”
This type of greeting gives them the opportunity to reach back out to you, if they feel comfortable doing so. It is also general and non-threatening, so they may feel more apt to accept your invitation., People aren’t usually too far away from their phones. Additionally, text messages are a common and preferred method of communication these days. Saying something short and quick is casual, and doesn’t put too much pressure on the recipient.


In the text you could say, “Hey! How are you? We should get dinner soon!”, Use the phone to get in touch if you can’t use the other methods or are more comfortable with this way. Getting a hold of them like this may help you to make more of a connection, as it is more personal. The person may appreciate you reaching them out to them in this manner.


Be sure to leave a message if the phone isn’t answered. People tend to screen their calls, especially if they are unsure of the number calling them., Leaving the conversation open by just recommending that you do something together could end in nothing happening. Prevent this by suggesting plans. Choose activities that just about anyone would like and not just something that you would enjoy.


For instance, you could ask to meet for dinner or coffee, suggest taking your children to the park together, going for a walk, or catching a movie., Showing interest in an old friend helps re-spark your connection. Don't spend the entire gathering talking about yourself. Give the other person a chance to claim the spotlight. Ask them what they've been up to over the years. Inquire about family, other friends, or hobbies they once had.However, stay away from touchy subjects such as politics, religion, or intimate experiences. You want to appear friendly and trustworthy, not creepy.

, Keep the friendship going after your first meeting by staying in touch and building trust. You can do this by sending a text or calling a few days later. If they don’t call back or respond after a few days, they may not want to continue the relationship.


Offer to help out to build the friendship. Volunteering to babysit, run an errand, or make dinner for your old acquaintance can show them you want to be their friend. These acts of kindness can show your friend that you are genuinely interested in having a relationship again., The person may not be ready to have a relationship with you again. Perhaps they aren’t at a point in their life where they can have a friendship or something that happened in the past prevents them from being able to trust you. The best thing you can do is to accept the decision and move on. Having reasonable expectations about the situation will help to make it easier on you if they decide not to reconnect.


Avoid sending additional texts or messages and don’t call if they are showing signs that they aren’t interested in reestablishing the friendship. Remember it's up to them whether they want to reconnect with you."

Breathe deeply with her.,
Do progressive muscle relaxation.Another technique you can try to get her to loosen up and relax is progressive muscle relaxation.,
Get some exercise.,
Do a guided imagery exercise together.,
Listen to soothing music.",How to Calm a Girl Down1," When you see her struggling to calm down on her own, lead her into a deep breathing exercise that promotes the natural relaxation response. To practice deep breathing:Find a quiet, comfortable place in which the two of you can sit without distractions. Either sit up straight with a cushion or use a chair for support. Relax your shoulders and rest your hands on your thighs.
Both of you should place one hand on your chest and one on your abdomen. Breathe in deeply through your nose for 4 to 8 counts. The hand on your abdomen should expand with your belly. Hold the breath briefly, for 1 to 2 counts. Then, release the air out through your mouth, watching your hand fall with your belly, for the same number of counts as the inhale. The hand on your chest should move very little.
Repeat the inhale-exhale process for 5 to 10 min, or until she becomes more relaxed.;
, This exercise helps you to notice where you are holding tension in your body and know what relaxation feels like in these tense areas.


Grab comfortable seats in chairs or on the sofa. Start with a few minutes of deep breathing to stimulate calm.
Start at your feet and move up. Notice how your feet feel. Take several seconds to become aware of this feeling. Then, gradually contract the muscles in your feet until they are extremely tense. Hold for 10 counts. Release the tension, taking note of how it simply melts away. Stay in this state for about 10 counts, continuing to breath deeply.
Move slowly up through the body contracting and releasing each muscle group.

, The intensity of working out may not immediately come to mind when thinking of way to help calm someone down, but physical activity is a terrific way to relieve stress and promote a positive mood. Exercise generates those feel-good chemicals in the brain called endorphins that tend to make you feel more energetic and brighter about life.If you see her having a tough day, steer her towards a group fitness class like Zumba to get moving and form social connections.Other ideas include running, walking, yoga, playing basketball, swimming, and hiking.

, Guided imagery or visualization is another approach that promotes the body's natural relaxation response. This practice can be carried out by listening to an audiotape or following along to a YouTube video. Here's how it works:Find a quiet, serene place to listen to a guided visualization exercise or choose to use your own minds. The idea is start by deep breathing. Then, begin visualizing a place that makes each of you feel safe or happy, such as grandma's house, the local water hole, or an exotic beach.
Use at least three of your senses to envision this place. Don't just stop at how it looks in your mind. Also, bring to mind how it smells (e.g. freshly baked cookies or coconut) or tastes (e.g. chocolate chips or salty air). Move deeper and deeper into a state of relaxation as you take in the sensations and surroundings of your special place.

, Research shows that classical music is especially effective at producing a calming state of mind.However, it really depends on her, maybe she just wants to forget her problems temporarily and shake her hips to a tribal drum beat. Or, she may want to commiserate by listening to songs that describe her feelings.


As long as it's relaxing to her, it doesn't matter what type of music it is."

Avoid saying ""calm down"".,
Offer help.,
Make her smile.,
Offer physical touch.",How to Calm a Girl Down2," When she's upset and shouting at the top of her lungs, the last thing you want to say is ""calm down"". Although calming her down may, indeed, be your focus, those two words actually have the power to rile her up even more. In addition, saying this can make her think you are minimizing or dismissing her feelings.Instead, try something like this: ""I can see you're upset/frustrated/anxious...what can I do?"" or ""I can't make out what you're saying. Let's take a few deep breaths and start over"".

, If you see her all hung up over something that's getting her down, ask what you can do to take the burden away, even temporarily. Maybe she would like you to help her with a project at school or a chore around the house. She may even just like to go to lunch or take a walk to the park with you.

, One way to take her mind off what's stressing her is to change her perspective. Do something to make her smile. Tell her a joke or watch a funny video or movie together. Splurge and buy her that new book/pair of earrings she's been wanting. , Human touch has amazing calming properties. Since touch is one of our earliest and most basic forms of communication, mostly everyone responds to it. Physical touch in the form of hugs, a caress, a pat on the back, or hand-holding can offer comfort that perhaps words cannot. Physical touch has been shown to lower stress, improve health outcomes, and lift mood.Ask her if it's okay, then give her a hug, rub her back or shoulders, or hold her hand. This seemingly small physical connection with you might be just what she needs to calm down.

Wait until she is ready.,
Listen actively.,
Validate her feelings.,
Help her problem-solve.",How to Calm a Girl Down3," When we see those we care about in trouble or pain, we instantly want to fix the situation. Overcome the urge to ""fix"" her problem or rush her into talking about it. The best case scenario is to just be there. When she's ready to talk, she will., The best listeners don't listen to reply, they listen to understand. Active listening is the process of focusing your attention on her message and responding so that you can achieve mutual understanding.Active listening involves four key principles:Seek to understand before being understood. You must collect information about what she is saying before you can adequately provide a response to her.
Be non-judgmental. Refrain from expressing any judgment about her circumstances. Demonstrate unconditional positive regard and emotional intelligence. You can be with, talk to and provide support without necessarily agreeing with everything she says.
Provide undivided attention. Make eye contact within a ratio that feels comfortable to you, typically about 70% of the time you're listening (about 50% when you're speaking).Turn off your phone. Turn to face her with your arms and legs uncrossed.
Make appropriate use of silence. Sit quietly no matter how much you would like to interrupt. She may have an important revelation that never comes out because of an untimely interruption. Offer feedback by nodding, smiling, or saying short remarks such as ""Umm hmm"" or ""Go on"" to let her know you're listening.

, More than likely, if she is overwhelmed by stress or emotion, she may just want to feel heard and accepted. When loved ones are upset it can be terribly easy to overlook their core feelings in an effort to resolve the situation. When she calms down a bit, ask her to describe her feelings to you without minimizing her circumstances or offering unsolicited advice.Helpful validating statements may sound like:


""Aww, that sounds terrible.""
""I'm so sorry you're having such a tough time.""
""I can see why you're upset. That doesn't sound fair.""

, Only after actively listening to and validating her feelings may you move into the resolution stage. And, still, you should only try to help her with the situation if she expressly asks for your help. Otherwise, your job is done. If she asks for advice or help solving an issue, work together.


Clearly define the problem. Then, ask her ideally what she would like the end result to be. Once you've identified her goals, then outline a list of possible solutions that can meet them. Go over each solution aloud and consider the pros and cons of each. Allow her to make the final decision. Remember, you are there to be a source of support, not to take over her life.If her problem is too big for you to help with alone, offer to go with her to talk to her parents, another adult, the school counselor, or a professional counselor.

Purchase a soft cotton cleaning cloth for maintenance.,
Keep the cleaning cloth in a dust free area.,
Remove any powder that appears on the monitor during shipping.,
Use the cloth to wipe up smudges and fingerprints as needed.,
Dampen the cloth with water to clean more stubborn streaks or smudges.,
Make a cleaning solution to clean the flat screen monitor.,
Use care around the monitor.,
Tell others how to clean a flat panel monitor.",How to Clean a Flat Panel Monitor," Microfiber cloths designed for cleaning electronics are available at department stores, electronics departments and office supply stores. Other soft materials that can be used include soft, worn cotton or flannel. Paper towels or unwashed, new cloth is too abrasive for the surface.;
, The cloth should be dedicated for use on the flat screen monitor only. Using it on other items can pick up dirt and debris that can scratch the surface or spread dirt., This can easily be removed with the soft cloth.

, To keep away dust, establish a routine of wiping the monitor at least once a week. Wipe the cloth across the screen. Move it from one side to the other, in one direction, from the top of the screen to the bottom. Do not rub at an area of the screen or apply pressure.

, Wring it out thoroughly so that it is slightly damp, not wet. Use this to clean the surface of the screen as well as the plastic casing of the monitor.

, This will help to get rid of grime or marks that cannot be removed with dry wiping or a damp cloth. Mix 1 part diluted isopropyl alcohol to 1 part water. Spray the solution on the cloth only, never directly on the monitor. Alternatively, you can purchase a commercial cleaner at an electronics or computer store.

, Do not touch it with fingers, pens, pencils or other sharp objects. Be careful with food or liquid that could splash the monitor. Teach children not to touch the monitor.

, If you have other household members or outside cleaning help, make sure they know how to properly clean the monitor. Regular household cleaners should never be used on the monitor screen or frame. Most are too abrasive and can cause scratching or fading. Window cleaners like Windex contain ammonia which can cause etching and cloudiness.

Buy a can of compressed air.,
Point the nozzle at the headphone jack.,
Release the air.",How to Clean a Headphone Jack1," These cans can often be found at electronics stores like Radioshack or Best Buy. Compressed air is also used for clearing debris from computer parts, so look where computer parts are sold. Air is least likely to damage your jack since you don’t have to put anything inside the hole other than the air., Get the air dispensing opening right up next to the jack. Some bottles come with thin tubes that stick out from the can. These may be easier for you to use since you can point the tube directly at the jack and focus the air into the small opening., Press the button on the top of the can to start dispensing air. You should only need a blast or two to loosen most debris inside the jack. Make sure all it comes out of the hole.

Power down the monitor.,
Wipe the dust off with a dry cloth.,
Apply cleaning solution to the cloth.,
Clean the grime off with the cloth.,
Let the monitor dry.",How to Clean a Computer Monitor/LCD Screen1," This not only lowers the risk of electrocution, but will allow you to more easily see dust and grime on the screen.;
, Go in slow, circular motions. Do not apply too much pressure to the screen. Make sure to use a lint-free, non-abrasive cloth to wipe. A large cloth is best, since it will help to reduce the risk of leaving streaks across the screen from finger pressure.


Suggested non-abrasive cloths:

Microfiber
Cotton T-shirt
Cotton handkerchief
Cotton tea towel


Avoid the following, as they are too abrasive:

Paper towels
Dish towels
Facial tissue



, Do not spray the solution directly onto the monitor. Drips can lead to malfunctions and permanent damage. Instead, spray the cloth with the cleaning solution. Apply a small amount of cleaning solution at a time, as excess moisture on the screen can damage it in the long run.


See the sections below on making or purchasing cleaning solution

, Work in small circles, and avoid direct pressure on the monitor. Do not scrape at any smudges; allow the cleaner to dissolve them.


You may have to repeat the application and cleaning process several times for tough spots.
Wipe off any excess moisture when you are finished cleaning.

, Make sure that the monitor is completely dry before powering it back on. This will minimize the risk of moisture damaging the internal components.


Do not use blow driers or any other heating mechanism to speed up the drying process. Let the drying occur by air.

Purchase cotton swabs.,
Remove cotton from the swab’s tip.,
Gently brush the jack.,
Swab with rubbing alcohol.,
Dry out the jack with a clean swab.",How to Clean a Headphone Jack2," Cotton swabs, also known as Q-tips, can be found at general stores and other locations where health and beauty products are sold. Try to get ones that don’t look very fluffy so that pieces don’t get left behind in the jack. Swabs with thinner tips work better, because they are easier to fit inside the jack.

, On one end of the swab, begin tearing or cutting off cotton. Make the tip as close to the width of the swab’s middle portion as possible. Once the swab tip is this size, it should fit comfortably inside the jack., Don’t jam the swab into the jack. Slowly push it in until it rests inside the hole. Spin the swab to brush off all sides of the jack. Remove the swab and most debris will fall out., For difficult debris, you can dip the swab in some rubbing alcohol. Make sure the swab is lightly coated, not soaked or dripping. Squeeze out excess moisture first. Put the swab back inside the jack and spin it again.Rubbing alcohol can corrode the metal, so use it sparingly.

, The rubbing alcohol should dry quickly on its own. However, you can remove excess moisture to minimize the jack’s exposure. Stick a clean swab into the jack. Leave it in there for a moment and spin it around to collect the alcohol.

"
"
Unfold a paperclip.,
Wrap tape around the clip’s end.,
Gently insert the tape into the jack.",How to Clean a Headphone Jack3," Open up the paper clip so that one end is straight. The paper clip can now be used to scrape out debris. However, the metal can still scratch the inside of the jack.


A toothpick can also be used, but the pointed ends can also scratch the jack’s interior.Needles are useful for reaching lint and large debris, but can easily scratch the jack and should be used as a last resort.

, Use standard office tape (like Scotch or Sellotape). Tightly wrap the tape sticky side up around the straightened end of the paperclip. Before use, check to see that the tape is secure and won’t come off., Slowly move the tape into position. Don’t jam it in there. Reach for any debris you see. The tape forms a lint roller and will remove stuck debris and lint.

"
"
Get the right water.,
Add a cleaning agent.",How to Clean a Computer Monitor/LCD Screen2," Avoid using tap water when making a cleaning solution. Tap water often has minerals that can damage the monitor. Instead, use distilled water. Distilled water can be bought at most grocery outlets, or you can make your own.

, The two most popular cleaning agents for homemade solutions are isopropyl alcohol and white vinegar. Choice comes down to personal preference, as both are effective at removing tough grime. Avoid mixing the two though, stick with one or the other.


Do not use any cleaning agent that uses ammonia, such as window cleaners, as this can discolor your monitor.
When using isopropyl alcohol, don’t use more than a 50/50 mix with distilled water. If you’re using vinegar, start with a 50/50 mix and add more vinegar if the solution isn’t strong enough.
Vodka can work as a replacement for isopropyl alcohol.

"
Read reviews.,
Get a full cleaning kit.,
Consider cleaning wipes.",How to Clean a Computer Monitor/LCD Screen3," Most cleaning solutions use proprietary mixtures that they claim work best. See what other users have to say about the product before committing to a purchase.


Some solutions act as more of a polish than a cleaner, so make sure to read the full product descriptions.

, If you don’t have any good cloth lying around, purchase a cleaning kit. These typically come with microfiber cloths suited to cleaning LCD displays.

, If you’d like to avoid using and cleaning a cloth, you can purchase disposable cleaning wipes specifically designed for monitors.

Disconnect your mouse from your computer.,
Remove the batteries.,
Dampen a microfiber cloth.,
Wipe down the outside of the mouse.,
Dry the mouse.,
Clean the scroll wheel, if applicable.,
Replace the batteries, if applicable.,
Reconnect the mouse.",How to Clean a Computer Mouse1," If the mouse is connected by a wire, you'll need to power down your computer first. Wired mice usually connect to the monitor of an all-in-one desktop computer or the central processing unit (CPU) of a traditional desktop computer. If the mouse is wireless, simply remove the USB component from the computer., Different brands have battery compartments in different locations. You can access many brands' compartments on the bottom of the mouse. Look for a small switch to open the compartment and remove the batteries.With other brands, you'll have to pop the top side of the mouse open to reveal the battery compartment.This step only applies to wireless mice. If you have a traditional mouse, you can skip this step.

, Apply a small amount of water. Wring out any excess moisture. Avoid getting the cloth dripping wet., Use the dampened cloth to remove any dirt or grime. Move back and forth over the target areas until the dirt is gone. Try to keep the cloth away from the openings in the mouse., Use a dry microfiber cloth to absorb any moisture left over from the cleaning. Move in gentle strokes. Continue until the outside of the mouse is completely dry., Spin the scroll wheel under a bright light. Look for any buildup of dirt or grime. Gently insert a toothpick between the scroll wheel and the slot it rests in. Being careful not to break the toothpick, scrape outward to remove the buildup. Wipe away any excess that falls on the outside of the mouse.

You could use your fingernails instead of a toothpick. As long as they extend slightly past your fingertip, they should remove quite a bit of buildup., Recall where your battery cover is located on your mouse and open it. When you replace the batteries, pay attention to placement of the + and – symbols in the battery compartment. This tells you how the positive and negative ends of the batteries should be aligned., Place the USB of a wireless mouse back in the computer port. For a wired mouse, reattach it to the CPU or monitor. The correct port should have a small engraved image of a mouse above or below it. Power the computer up and test the mouse to make sure you've reconnected it correctly.If your computer fails to recognize your mouse, consult your user's manual or contact tech support.

Outline the benefits you're seeking from building your own computer.,
Select your motherboard and your CPU (central processing unit) at the same time.,
Motherboards also lean toward supporting one video card manufacturer or another.,
Select your case.,
Select RAM (Random Access Memory).,
Select hard drives.,
Select an optical disk drive.,
Choose an OS (operating system).",How to Choose Components for Building a Computer," Different configurations suit different purposes. The cost implications of choosing between these uses are huge. A cheap work computer might cost only two or three hundred dollars. A server can reach tens of thousands of dollars. Take the advice of experienced users in your field. Spend no more than is required for your usage. Ignore salesmen or others who implore you to waste money on unneeded upgrades.



Basic System. Nothing special, just some good parts from solid brands.

Home System. Mainly more RAM and a dual-core processor so everyone can multi-task.

A Gamer's Rig. You'll need a killer ATI or nVidia graphics card from a well-trusted vendor, a dual-core processor or quad-core processor (some software is catered to a certain CPU set up, in general though the more cores the better.), speedy RAM (good quality RAM is very important), and if you want load times to be faster, a good SATA hard drive.

Music Sound Mixing/Producing. Choose a well-received, non-integrated sound card, such as from the X-Fi or Audigy series, a decent amount of RAM, and a decent processor.

Video Editing Suite. Choose a graphics card good enough at rendering what you need done (these cards may not be the same as gaming cards. ATI has a RAGE series targeted at the professional render market that are more suited to these tasks; nVidia has its Quadro range). A quad-core processor is suggested for multithreaded codecs. A large hard drive will be needed, and multiple terabytes if you do lots of video editing, hence RAID HDD setups are common.

Server System. Not very much is needed if it's a dedicated system. An old computer or a basic system with more hard drives will do well. If your server is going to be performing complex tasks (such as using the PHP programming language or hosting a game), it will need as strong of a processor and as much RAM as possible, and a Gigabit Ethernet port assuming communication to other computers via LAN. The speed and type of RAM do not matter. You will need at least one large hard drive. One TB (terabyte) hard drive would be a great choice. The speed of the hard drive does not matter much, either. Multiple drives is a good upgrade, however, for when you are hosting multiple large-scale sites, for one hard drive can be spinning when the other isn't.;
, The exchange between the CPU and motherboard is named the socket. Sockets are specific not only to the CPU brand, but also to the class and architecture of the CPU. Socket information is readily available on any CPU spec sheet. In addition to selecting the correct socket, advanced builders often do research into the best chipset available. Often there is not much of a choice of chipsets once a CPU has been selected (you can always change your mind! Be sure to decide on all your parts before purchasing any of them!). Mainstream CPUs are either AMD or Intel. Motherboards openly advertise which CPU they support and the sockets supported.

, For a single-card setup, any motherboard should work: almost all motherboards and cards share the common ""PCI Express"" (PCIe) x16 (full-length PCIe slot) interface. For multi-card parallel graphics processing, you'll need a motherboard with multiple PCIe x16 slots and ""SLI"" compatibility with nVidia (GeForce) cards, or ""Crossfire"" compatibility for ATI (Radeon) cards plus, of course, the multiple, generally matching, SLI or Crossfire compatible cards.

, It is preferred that you get an aluminum case because it dissipates heat. Most come with a fan and power supply. Look for a case with either dual 80mm fans or a single 120mm fan. If yours doesn't come with a power supply or if your current one isn't good then get one. If you have extreme graphics cards then get a power supply with extra electrical attachments for peripherals.


Each case and mother board has a form factor which is the size of the case and motherboard. The form factors of both must match in order for them to fit. Make sure that there are matching or higher number of card slots on the case than there are the motherboard; if there are more card slots on your motherboard than your case then you are limiting performance.
Cases come in several sizes. SFF (Small Form Factor) cases are portable small and are the only cases with integrated motherboards. There are other sizes ranging from mini to full tower. If you choose to get small cases then don't put really powerful equipment in it, or it will overheat.

, This must match your motherboards clock speed (Intel motherboards range from 667MHz on the low end to 1333MHz on the high end, while AMD motherboards clock 533MHz to 667MHz). DDR3 is the most common. A Windows 7 system should have at least 1GB of RAM, and 2GB is preferred. 4 to 8 GB is the typical limit of RAM a motherboard can address.


Should you wish to install above 4 GB, you'll have to get a 64-bit operating system to utilise all the RAM you've installed.

, This is where information on your computer is stored. Most computers at least hold 80GB, but at Newegg.com (link below) you can install a SATA 500GB hard drive for $100 and you normally get a GB for under a quarter.


There are two interface types for hard drives:






IDE (also known as PATA). Slower and superseded interface. Cables are flat and are long in width, obstructing airflow. However, rounded IDE cables are available.
SATA. The current and faster interface. It's cables are much smaller than IDE cables, improving airflow.


Hard drives spin a different RPMs, and this is a decent indicator of performance. A higher RPM drive will find information faster. As well, look for a cache (RAM on a hard drive that stores frequently accessed information) of at least 8MB (16MB is better).






Newer motherboards also support RAID (redundant array of independent disks) which allows multiple, lower cost hard drives to function as a single unit. Hitachi and Seagate are both highly rated brands.






You can also go for SSD (solid state drives). They are quite expensive and don't have much capacity, but are very much faster than normal hard drives.







, This is where your CD/DVDs go. Depending on your needs you should choose one that's right for you.


Almost all new DVD writers can make CD-Rs, so look for either a dual burner set-up or a burner and reader set-up.
Living room computers may also consider a Blu-ray drive. Be aware of any issues such as HDCP compliance so that the video and audio quality won't be affected and at it's maximum.
Lite-on, Sony, LG and Plextor are good manufacturers.
If you will be ripping music CDs, its best to get a drive that has excellent error correction capabilities. If you'll be testing CDs/DVDs for quality issues (C1/C2 errors, jitter), you'll need to know what testing features the drive can support.

,


On a budget, Windows 7 Home Basic and Windows 7 Home Premium should satisfy most users. Ubuntu is free, and it is a version of Linux, but it requires some technical knowledge (If you don't know what an ISO or command prompt is then Linux is not for you).
For a business environment, Windows 7 Enterprise and Windows 8 Enterprise are the OS of choice. Red Hat Linux is also a good choice.
Windows 7 Home Premium and Ultimate, both have media center software and are ideal for living room computers
Almost any version of Linux will run on standard hardware. Linux is great and free but may need more attention to install and configure. However building machine from pieces gives you great opportunity to check the list of supported hardware and be sure that your devices (especially video cards) will work.
Mac OS X is available on Apple computers and Hackintoshes. It is possible to install and run Mac OS on standard PC hardware because Apple is now using Intel processors, but it is in breach of the EULA to do so as Apple does not like its software to be installed on any non-Apple Hardware.

If you broadcast live media from your computer (such as a podcast or video blog) or do a lot of online gaming, you’ll want this extra data. Launch the site and click “Begin Test.”
You can also use the speed testing site of your ISP. Verizon, Xfinity and CenturyLink all have their own speed tests.

, Once the test has completed, the results will appear on the screen. If you're not receiving the download or upload speeds you're paying for, there might be a technical problem or honest mistake that can be corrected.


You might also be able to leverage the error for a discount with your ISP.

"
"
Check the Download speed.Once you’ve completed a broadband speed test, you’ll want to compare the results to promises made by your ISP/data provider.,
Check the Upload speed.,
Note the Ping results: This number (shown in milliseconds) represents the response time to the test server.",How to Check Broadband Speed3," Since slow download speeds are most noticeable, start there.


Download speeds affect things like streaming media (such as Spotify or Youtube), downloading documents, and browsing the web.
Cheaper broadband packages for basic Internet access usually include 1.5-3mbps.This should be good enough for basic web use, but you’ll want at least 5mbps to stream high-quality video.Most mid-grade home user packages are closer to 10-20 mbps, which is better equipped to handle HD streaming on more than one computer. Check with your ISP to find out what you have.

, The upload speed results reflect the speed of data you send out, such as when you attach files to an email, upload photos or videos to the web, use video conferencing, or share files using a service like BitTorrent.


Some apps and sites, like Fast.com, won’t report an upload speed. This is because most users tend to be more concerned with download speeds as they affect media streaming and web browsing.
1-4mbps should be fine for users who don’t share a lot of large files or use video conferencing. It’s not common for a home user to have a 10mbps or more upload rate.

, Higher ping times (such as 100ms or more) indicate network trouble between your modem and the server.


ISPs don’t guarantee certain ping results, as such results can be affected by outside networks.

Choose between a consumer or commercial-grade router.,
Understand that the primary difference between a consumer-grade router, and a commercial-grade router is the amount of data which can be transferred and the transfer rate.,
Decide whether or not to install a router with wireless capabilities.,
Determine the number of Ethernet ports needed.,
Understand the performance specifications.,
Choose an ""IEEE 802.11n"" compliance standard wireless router when superior range is required.,
Choose a router that transmits on the 2.4 GHz frequency for superior data transfer rates.,
Consider the amount of RAM memory installed on the router.,
Consider the amount of flash memory installed.,
Confirm that the router has the following features.",How to Choose the Best Broadband Router for Your Network," A commercial-grade or ""enterprise"" router is designed for medium to large-size organizations. A consumer-grade router is designed for use in a home or small office network.;
, A commercial-grade router is designed to transfer much larger quantities of data at a much faster rate and therefore will exceed both the needs and the budgets of the average user. Typically, only users whose activities require the transfer of large amounts of data, such as online gamers, and users viewing or hosting streaming video.

, Wireless routers have become the standard in recent years because they eliminate the need for a direct, physical connection with the server computer via Ethernet cable. The downside to wireless routers is that the connection can be slightly slower in certain situations. However, wireless routers typically provide ports for making a physical connection when faster data transfer rates are required.

, The router will need to have enough ports for each device you plan to physically connect to the network. For example, if you plan to connect a printer, a scanner and 2 computers to the network, at least 4 ports will be required. The Ethernet ports are located on the rear panel of the router.

, Most users will find the standard router specifications more than adequate. However, some users, such as online gamers and others who need to transfer large video or data files quickly, will require a higher level of performance than will the average user.

, A standard wireless router will have a range of about 120 feet (32 m) indoors, and about 300 feet (95 m) outside. However, an ""IEEE 802.11n"" class router will have an outdoor range of roughly 400 feet (96 m), and an indoor range of approximately 900 feet (285 m).

, Wireless routers broadcast on 2 frequencies: 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz. The 2.4-GHz frequency provides a greater Wi-Fi range; however, the 5-GHz range will have increased bandwidth of 20 percent or more. A dual-band router can broadcast on both frequencies, but are typically considerably more expensive than routers broadcasting on the 2.4-GHz or 5-GHz frequencies.

, The amount of RAM memory installed on a router will range between 8 and 128 megabytes (MB) and will have a dramatic effect on a router's performance. Gamers and other users who regularly transfer large amounts of data over the network and the Internet should choose a router with a minimum of 64 MB.

, The amount of flash memory installed will range between 1 to 8 MB and will also impact the performance of the device. Users who regularly transfer large amounts of data should choose a router with at least 4 MB of flash memory installed.

,


Understand that firewall protection is an important security feature, standard on most broadband routers. Just like a computer firewall, a router firewall prevents unauthorized users from accessing the network by blocking access to all unrecognized connections.
Consider the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) support feature. DHCP support allows the router to assign a static IP address to each device connected to the network and is typically included as a standard feature.
Confirm that the router provides Virtual Private Network (VPN) support. The VPN feature allows mobile and portable devices to establish a secure connection to the network.
Consider a device with full duplex capability. The full duplex feature increases the performance of a router in terms of the speed in which data can be transferred over an Ethernet connection. The full-duplex feature allows for simultaneous 2-way communication between 2 devices across an Ethernet line, doubling a router's data transfer rate.
Purchase a router with a ""De Militarized Zone"" port (DMZ). Also referred to as ""isolated network support,"" DMZ is a security feature that allows a device to accept incoming connections through the Internet without providing access to the entire network. This feature is often used by online gamers to connect a gaming console to the network and allow incoming connections while, at the same time, preventing access to the entire network.
Confirm that the device provides support for the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP). BOOTP is a legacy protocol used by a workstation to identify the host IP address. BOOTP support provides network access to clients who do not use the DHCP static IP address protocols. While DHCP has become the standard, some clients still use BOOTP, making BOOTP support a valuable feature in certain situations.

Consider the number of users that your network will have to support.,
Consider your basic network infrastructure.,
Determine the network needs of the users.,
Choose the role of the switch.,
Choose any other features that you may desire.,
Pick a vendor and/or company.,
Factor in the price.,
For an even greater price cut, look for used switches.",How to Buy a Network Switch," If you only have 5 or 6 users, then a small 8-port switch will probably be enough for your needs. Number of ports is one of the biggest factors in the cost of a switch, so if you buy a switch that only supports the number of users that you will have, you will likely save a fair amount of money. Common numbers of ports on ethernet switches are 5, 8, 10, 24, and 48 ports.;
, For a small network, up to around 40 to 50 users, one switch might be sufficient, whereas if your network will need to support more people, you may have to invest in additional switches.

, Do your users need a fast network with low latency, or do they need to transfer large volumes of data? If so, then a switch supporting Gigabit Ethernet might be appropriate. If the network is more for Internet and network resource access, 100 megabit ports probably will be sufficient..

, If you are planning on building a large network, you may have one or more switches acting as a ""core"" -- these switches will need to be fast, and able to handle a fairly heavy traffic load. Usually, a gigabit switch will work for a core switch. Access switches, where the individual users connect, will probably be slower than a core switch would be. If you are just looking to connect a small number of computers, a single access switch will be all that is necessary.

, There are many other features that switches often have that may need to be factored into your decision: whether the switch is managed or unmanaged, how to access its configuration interface (if it is managed), whether it is a layer 3 capable switch or not, and many others. These features are mostly only useful in larger enterprise networks; if you are building a large network, it's a good idea to research what some of these additional features can do for you.

, Chances are that you will not be buying directly from a manufacturer of network switches, however you may prefer one brand over another. Popular brands of networking equipment include Cisco, 3com, Linksys, and D-Link. Smaller switches can often be found at major retailers such as Walmart, Radio Shack, and Best Buy, while larger ones are more often found online. Best Buy does sometimes stock up to 24 port switches, but for larger switches online retailers may be a better choice. Newegg.com and CDW.com are excellent websites for researching and buying network hardware.

, For many people, price will be a higher priority, but sometimes it makes more sense to consider features over price. Companies like Linksys (a subsidiary of Cisco) and D-Link make affordable, lower-end switches for homes and small businesses. These switches can work very well for a small network, but they are often lacking the features found in more expensive switches. 3com offers moderately priced hardware in the medium range -- while their switches won't have the features that Cisco switches will, they are more than adequate for a medium to medium-large network. Cisco switches are top of the line, offering the most functionality, but with the highest price tag. Cisco switches can also be very difficult to configure.

, Sometimes companies may throw out perfectly good switches that simply don't meet their needs anymore -- but they may meet yours. If a company is not willing to give them away, you may still be able to purchase them for much less than a brand new switch with similar capabilities.

Check the router or user manual.,
Download the electronic version of the manual.,
Locate the IP address with TCP/IP software.,
Know the default password and username for your router.,
Reset your router to its factory defaults.If you changed your log-in information for your router but cannot find it, the only practical thing to do is to reset your router so that its information returns to those defaults.,
Open a web browser.,
Type in your router's IP address.,
Log in.,
Find the right tab.,
Alternatively, find these instructions in your manual.,
Type in the new password.,
Log in using your new password.",How to Change a Router Password," If you have never changed your log-in information, that information is probably still set to the default. You can usually find the default IP address, username, and password on either the side of the router or somewhere in the user manual.


Note that the manual may only have the default IP address. It does not always have the default password. The side of the router, on the other hand, will almost always have all necessary pieces of information.
The default for most routers is 192.168.1.1. This is true of Linksys, Actiontec, and VersaLink routers, as well as many others.
The default can vary from this, however. For AT&T routers, the default is usually 192.168.1.254. For WRP400, the default IP is 192.168.15.1.;
, If you cannot find your router's user manual, you can usually find an electronic version of the manual on the company's website.


The electronic manual will only give you the default IP address. It will not work if you have changed your router's IP address at some point.
To find the electronic version of your router's manual, you will first need to do an Internet search for the manufacturer's website. From there, use the website's search or browse tools to navigate to the manuals for any routers it creates and look through the results until you find the manual that corresponds to your router's model number.

, You can run this software by opening a command prompt window and typing in the ""ipconfig"" command. The IP address of your router will be located under the listing for ""Default Gateway""When using Windows, press the Windows key plus the ""R"" key simultaneously to bring up the ""Run"" dialog box. Type in ""cmd"" to bring up the command prompt, and type ""ipconfig"" followed by the ""Enter"" key to display the router's IP address.
If using a Mac, navigate to the ""Application"" menu and click on the ""Utilities"" section. From there, click on ""Terminal."" Type ""ipconfig"" followed by the ""Return"" key to display various IP information.
For Linux, open the Terminal by typing ""Ctrl"" + ""Alt"" + ""T"" on your keyboard simultaneously. Inside the terminal, type the ""sudo ifconfig"" command to bring up the information you need.

, If you have never changed your password, it might still be set to a company default. This default varies by brand.


You can check for the default router password online by going to: http://www.routerpasswords.com/

Select the make of your router from the drop-down list and click on the ""Find Password"" button.
You will be given a list of models under that manufacturer. Locate yours and take a look at the username and password sections of the chart to determine what your router's defaults are.


For NetGear, LinkSys, Actiontec, and VersaLink routers, the default username is usually admin.Note that some routers, like Belkin routers, do not have usernames.
For LinkSys, Belkin, and some Actiontec routers, leave the password blank.For Netgear, VersaLink, and other Actiontec routers, try the default password, password.,


For most routers, you can reset the IP address by pressing the ""Reset"" button on the back of the router box for 30 seconds. Usually, to reach this reset button, you will need to use a toothpick, unwound paper clip, or other small pointed object to reach into a protective hole and press the button inside.
Resetting the router will erase any special settings you have created. Your password and username will be reset, as well.

, Any web browser should be fine, whether it's Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, or Google Chrome.

, This information should be typed directly into the address bar of the web browser. Hit the ""Enter"" or ""Return"" key on your keyboard, or click on the ""Go"" button next to your address bar to go the your router's page.


After you type in your router's IP address, you should be taken to a webpage that specifically controls the settings for your router. The steps from this point on will vary depending on the make and model of your router, but there are still a few basic steps that you can expect to face.

, In most cases, you will be asked to type in the username and password you hunted down previously. Once you have this information, hit the ""OK"" or ""Submit"" button.


Note that in some instances, you will not be asked for a username or password until you actually try to make a change to one of the settings.

, Once you access your router's webpage, you will need to hunt around for a while until you find the spot on the page from which you can change the password.


In most instances, this portion of the page will be located under the “Administrative” or “Security” tab.For Linksys routers, click on the ""Administration"" tab. If you have an older Linksys router, however, you might need to click on the “Password” tab.For some VersaLink routers, you will need to look under the ""Maintenance"" menu.
On NetGear routers, the right section is labeled under the “Advanced” tab. From there, you will need to navigate to ""Setup,"" and then to ""Wireless Setup.""For AT&T routers, you will need to click on the ""System Password"" link. Note that you will not be asked to type your current system password in until you reach this screen. From there, you will go to the ""Edit System Password"" screen, where you will be asked to enter a new password and password hint., If you have a PDF version of your router's user manual, you might be able to do a search for ""password"" and find the information about where to change your password among the search results.


The difficult part about searching for the word ""password"" in the PDF manual is that there are many passwords associated with your router, and you may get many results that do not relate to the password you are looking for. For instance, the log-in password is not the same as the PPoE password, PPTP password, or L2TP password, nor is it the same as the password for your wireless network.

, While ever router works a little differently, in the vast majority of cases, you will simply type the new password into the ""Password"" field and re-type the password into the ""Re-enter Password"" field. Click on the ""Apply"" or ""Submit"" button to confirm the change.

, Most routers will kick you off your user settings and force you to log in using your new password. Do so to verify that the new password works correctly.


After you verify that you new password works, write it down and keep it someplace where you will be able to find it. A good idea is to write it on an index card and to tape it to the side of your router. Along with your password, consider writing down your username and IP address so that you will not need to go searching for these pieces of information again, either.

For a classful network total bits is 8.,
From the previous step, you got the ""Number of bits used for subnetting""(n) and you know the ""Tb"", then you can get ""Number of bits left for host""(m) = Tb - n as total bits is the summation of number of bits used for subnetting and number bits left for host i.e.,
Now you have to calculate ""Number of subnets"" = 2n and ""Value of last bit used for subnet masking""(Δ) = 2m.,
Now you can find previously calculated number of subnets by separating subnets each having ""Value of last bit used for subnet masking"" or Δ addresses.,
Now you have to find that your IP address is in which subnet, that subnet's first address is network address and last address is broadcast address.",How to Calculate Network and Broadcast Address1," So Total bits = Tb = 8.

Sub-net mask can be 0, 128, 192, 224, 240, 248, 252, 254 and 255.



 


Below table gives you the ""Number of bits used for subnetting""(n) to their corresponding subnet mask.






For subnet mask 255 is default, so it'll not consider for subnet masking.
For example:
Let, IP address = 210.1.1.100 and Sub-net mask = 255.255.255.224
Total bits = Tb = 8
Number of bits used for subnetting = n = 3
(as subnet mask = 224 and its corresponding ""No. of bits used for Subnetting"" is 3 from above table)




;
, Tb = m+n.


Number of bits left for host = m = Tb - n = 8 - 3 = 5







, Number of host per subnet = 2m - 2.


Number of subnets = 2n = 23 = 8
Value of last bit used for subnet masking = Δ = 2m = 25 = 32







,


The 8 subnets (as calculated in previous step) are shown above.
Each of them has 32 addresses.

,


Here the taken IP address is 210.1.1.100 . 210.1.1.100 comes in 210.1.1.96 - 210.1.1.127 subnet (see the previous step table). So 210.1.1.96 is network address and 210.1.1.127 is broadcast address for the taken IP address i.e. 210.1.1.100 .

Understand how an IP address works.,
Understand the basic concepts of a proxy.,
Know the different types of proxies.",How to Block Your IP Address1," Anytime you connect to the Internet, your computer is assigned a long number called an IP (Internet Protocol) address. This IP address is transmitted to any servers that you visit and is logged on those servers, leaving a trail of your Internet activity.
, A proxy is a server that you connect to that allows you to get “outside” of your network. You connect to a proxy and route your traffic through it, so that your IP is masked and traffic appears to be coming from the proxy server., There are several types of proxies that you will run into as you research proxies. Each offers a certain degree of anonymity, and some are more secure than others. There are four main types of proxies:

Web-based proxies: The most common and easiest to use proxy. These are servers that you connect to through a browser to visit a website anonymously.
Open proxies: These are proxy servers that are either accidentally left open or are hacked. They are often not secure and can contain malicious software. It is recommended that you avoid open proxies.
Anonymity networks: These are private networks that are run by users donating bandwidth. They are often incredibly slow and due to the fact that anyone can host bandwidth, they are fairly insecure.
Paid proxy software programs, such as IP Hider Ever, is often used to hide your IP address so that you can hide your internet traffic and the real location while surfing the web. Software programs like IP Hider Ever makes nobody know what you do on the internet. So you can surf wherever you want on the web without worrying about any of the information leaked. But the question is still that whether you trust the software company.
VPN (Virtual Private Network): These are private networks where you directly connect to a proxy server maintained by a proxy company or organization.
Proxy Chain. Currently, the most untraceable VPNs use TOR, where all the network traffic is redirected to use TOR. This redirection can be done simply with the built-in system package iptables of Linux. If you do not want to setup the proxy chain yourself or using windows as your OS, softwares like iProxyEver can do all the job for you.

Divide Kilo Bytes by Seconds to get the rate.",How to Calculate Data Transfer Rate," Since a Mega byte is roughly 1000 Kilobytes we will multiply it by 1000. We get 25,000 Kilobytes.;
, Since a minute is 60 seconds we know that 2 minutes is 120 seconds (2x60=120).

, 25,000/120=208.3. We'll round it too 210. So now we have a rate of 210 KB/s.

In CIDR, you have a IP address followed by bit-length prefix separated by slash(/).,
Total bits = Tb = 8.,
From the previous step, you got the ""Number of bits used for subnetting""(n) and you know the ""Tb"", then you can get ""Number of bits left for host""(m) = Tb - n as total bits is the summation of number of bits used for subnetting and number bits left for host i.e.,
Now you have to calculate ""Number of subnets"" = 2n and ""Value of last bit used for subnet masking""(Δ) = 2m.,
Now you can find previously calculated number of subnets by separating subnets each having ""Value of last bit used for subnet masking"" or Δ addresses.,
Now you have to find that your IP address is in which subnet, that subnet's first address is network address and last address is broadcast address.",How to Calculate Network and Broadcast Address2," Now you have to convert bit-length prefix to quad-dotted decimal representation. To do this follow below steps.

Write the the bit-prefix in below format.






If it's 27, then write it as 8 + 8 + 8 + 3 .
If it's 12, then write it as 8 + 4 + 0 + 0 .
Default is 32, which is 8 + 8 + 8 + 8.


Convert the corresponding bit according to the below table and represent in quad-dotted decimal format.






Let an IP address be 170.1.0.0/26 . Using above table, you can write:

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
26
=
8
+
8
+
8
+
2


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
255
.
255
.
255
.
192


Now the IP address is 170.1.0.0 and subnet mask in quad-dotted decimal format is 255.255.255.192 .







,

Sub-net mask can be 0, 128, 192, 224, 240, 248, 252, 254 and 255.
Below table gives you the ""Number of bits used for subnetting""(n) to their corresponding subnet mask.







For subnet mask 255 is default, so it'll not consider for subnet masking.
From the previous step, you got IP address = 170.1.0.0 and Sub-net mask = 255.255.255.192
Total bits = Tb = 8
Number of bits used for subnetting = n = 2
(as subnet mask = 192 and its corresponding ""No. of bits used for Subnetting"" is 2 from above table)







, Tb = m+n.


Number of bits left for host = m = Tb - n = 8 - 2 = 6

, Number of host per subnet = 2m - 2.


Number of subnets = 2n = 22 = 4
Value of last bit used for subnet masking = Δ = 2m = 26 = 64







,

The 4 subnets (as calculated in previous step) are






Each of them has 64 addresses.







,


Here the taken IP address is 170.1.0.0 . 170.1.0.0 comes in 170.1.0.0 - 170.1.0.63 subnet (see the previous step table). So 170.1.0.0 is network address and 170.1.0.63 is broadcast address for the taken IP address i.e. 170.1.0.0 .

Download and install VPN (Virtual Private Network) software.,
Manually set VPN settings.",How to Block Your IP Address2," You will need administrator access on your computer to do this. Most VPN software requires a subscription. In return you gain access to thousands of anonymous IPs that you can use.


VPNs offer much higher levels of encryption than web-based proxies.
VPNs work with all internet traffic on your computer, as opposed to web-based proxies which only work through the browser. This includes messaging and file transfers.

, If you’d rather not download the software, and would instead manually enter the connection details for your VPN, you can setup the VPN from the Windows control panel. Select Internet Options. You will still need to obtain an IP to connect to.


In the Connections tab, click Add VPN. This will open the VPN window. Enter in the IP that you are connecting to.
If your VPN requires a username and password, you will be prompted to enter it.

Find a list of proxies.,
Choose a proxy site.,
Select the URL box.,
Configure your browser to surf through a proxy server.",How to Block Your IP Address3," A web-proxy is useful if you aren't on your own computer because all the work is being done through the browser, so the method works regardless of your computer's operating system. Your IP address remains hidden, because only the proxy server's IP address is transmitted to the web page.


There are several websites that list proxies that you can use. Proxy.org is a great place to start that is constantly updating its list.
There's a good chance that proxy listing sites like Proxify will be blocked by a school or work network. Visit the site at home and make a list of 10-15 proxy sites to try at the blocked computer.
Proxies that are overused get noticed and blocked, so vary which ones you use on a day-to-day basis.
Using a proxy will make browsing significantly slower. This is because the traffic is rerouted through the proxy, reinterpreted and then sent to your location. Be aware that videos and websites may take longer to load.

, If the site is blocked, try a different one. When picking sites from a list of proxies, try using sites that are geographically closer to your location. This will help minimize the loss of speed.

, Enter the address of the website you wish to visit. Since proxy sites reinterpret the data of website you are trying to access, there's a chance that the site won't load correctly. Most commonly the video will not load. If this is the case, try again with a different proxy site.


As long as you continue to browse through the proxy, your IP address will never be visible to the websites you visit.

, Instead of visiting a website and typing URLs into their forms, you can configure most web browsers to automatically hide your IP address through a proxy server. This type of service will require you to download and install a plug-in for your web browser. An example of this type of service is the Switchproxy extension for Mozilla Firefox, which pools all of its users' IP addresses and randomly assigns them to different users.

Change your signal channel.,
Use a software utility to analyze which networks are using which channel and configure your system for an unused channel.

",How to Boost a Wifi Signal2," Routers can broadcast on a series of channels, between one and eleven. Change to a channel that will allow your router a clear signal between other wireless networks.

,"
"
Change your router's network broadcast mode.",How to Boost a Wifi Signal3," Try to use the new 802.11n standard if your router supports it. The 802.11n standard offers far greater range and signal strength compared to 802.11 a/b/g.

Reposition your Router.,
Be aware of external interference.",How to Boost a Wifi Signal4," Sometimes the solution is simple. All you have to do is find a new place to store your router.


Raise as far as possible to increase the effective broadcast range.
Place near the center of your house or apartment for wider coverage.
Move closer to the receivers, if possible.
Move away from any metal including metal shelving, filing cabinets and similar common objects.
Move away from cordless phones and microwaves, which operate on the same 2.4-Ghz frequency.

, Move your unit as far away as possible from your next-door neighbor's WiFi router. In addition, if you're living in an apartment building, there might be multiple routers in operation too. Note: make sure you're using a different channel than everyone else.

Raise your transmit power.,
Replace the Antenna.,
Install a Repeater.,
Install a Wireless Amplifier.,
Make a Reflector lulu with Tinfoil.",How to Boost a Wifi Signal5," Check your router's documentation and configuration utility for the ability to change the Xmit power of your router: the amount of power it uses to transmit the signal. Generally, you can boost this number by up to 50mW. Keep in mind that you risk overheating or damaging your router.

, Unscrew and replace the broadcast antenna on your router with a model that delivers more power. Not all routers allow for new antenna to be attached, but many do.

, A repeater is a piece of hardware that acts like a wireless network expander. The repeater takes the signal from your router and boosts it to increase the range.


Wireless repeaters are increasingly common and affordable and will probably be available in your local computer store, or on the Internet.

, Attach a wireless amplifier, also known as a booster, directly to your router. A booster can be more affordable than a repeater as they only increase the strength of your existing signal, rather than the strength and range.


Use a bi-directional amplifier to increase both your inward and outbound speeds.

, Note that a tinfoil router may boost your signal, but will also make it more directional.


Cut a tinfoil circle with the tinfoil on the inside of a piece of paper or some cardboard large enough to wrap around the router. If you want to get fancier than this, cut a shallow parabola and put the hole for the antenna at the focal point.
Place the tinfoil circle over the router.
Place the antenna in the center of the circle or parabola.

To choose your own name and password, follow the following rules.",How to Use a Wireless Router As a Wireless Card," To use a wireless router as a wireless card, you first need your router set up. A wireless router let you share your broadband internet connection to all your computers, but you first need your router set up.;
, This includes all the cables including the power to your cable or DSL modem also make sure your router is unplugged as well. To do this, simply follow the following instructions.


Remove the power plug from the modem, then pull the existing Ethernet cable out from the modem and plug it in to port #1 of the blue LAN port on the back of the router and leave the other end of Ethernet cord plugged in to your computer.
Take the second Ethernet cable that came with your router and plug one end to any available port on your modem. Connect the other end of this Ethernet cable into the port labeled internet on your D-LINK router.
Now you can reconnect the power supplied to your cable or DSL modem and wait at least 30 second for the modem to start up before continuing.

, After waiting 60 seconds, you can check if the router is set up correctly by launching an internet browser and seeing if you can get to a website on the internet.

, If you see it’s not connected properly or if you can’t open a website, you should follow the same rules over again to see if you have missed any steps. And to insure all your cords are plugged in to the correct ports. Also another suggestion is to unplug your modem for at least 10 minutes and follow the steps again.


Using more Ethernet cables you can plug other computers into available ports on your router to share your broadband internet connection. Plug one end into available port on your modem. Plug other end into “internet” port on your router and reconnect power cord to your modem.

, Open an internet explorer and in the address bar, put the IP address of your router. You will be popped into the device for the username and password. Once logged in to get to the menu. Click on the wireless tab on the left hand side of the opened page. The name on the top of the page is your wireless name which can be changed. Make sure to choose a name that you are fine with because it will be shown on the public when others search for wireless internet.


The web enables you choose a security code/password that so that no one is able to access your internet. Only the people who have the right key can access your internet connection. You can choose up to 26 character code so that no one else can use your connection.

Click ""OK"" or ""Apply"" to save your changes.",How to Change Screensaver Settings in Windows2," Unlike in Windows 10, you can access the screen saver settings from directly within the ""Personalize"" menu.


Alternatively, on Windows 7 you can open the Start menu and type ""Personalize"" into the search function, then click the ""Personalize"" option when it pops up.
For Windows 8, tap the ⊞ Win key to bring up the Start menu if you're trying to search for the Personalize option.

, You can find this in the bottom right corner of the Personalize window.

, Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 have the same default screen savers as Windows 10 with similar settings; for example, you can only customize the ""3D Text"" and ""Photos"" options., You'll find a list of the same seven screen saver options here as you would in Windows 10.


On Windows 7, the ""Photos"" option is labeled ""Windows Live Photos"".

, You can only do this for ""3D Text"" and ""Photos"".

, This value--which dictates how long your computer has to be inactive before your screen saver kicks in--is to the right of the ""Wait"" text. You can click the up or down arrows next to the number to increase or decrease wait time.


Check the ""On resume, display logon screen"" option if you want your computer to lock itself upon screen saver activation. This is a good idea if you're using a shared/work computer.

Hold down the keys Ctrl+Alt+Delete all at the same time.,Click on the ""Processes"" tab (2nd from left)

,
If you don't know which process you want, you can go to the ""Applications"" (left-most) tab, right-click on the window or program you want to speed up, and click on ""Go to Process"" - takes you right there!

,
Now right-click on the process you want to speed up.

,
Mouse over ""Set Priority"", OR just press the letter ""p"" on the keyboard, and click on the priority level you want for your program, OR, again, press the shortcut letter: L=Low, B=Below Normal, N=Normal, A=Above Normal, H=High, R=Realtime.,
Click ""yes"" when a confirmation window pops up.

,
You can vastly speed up this three-stroke process of choosing the priority level by using the keyboard.",How to Change Process Priorities in Windows Task Manager," A window will pop up, called ""Windows Task Manager"". If not, a window with various options will pop up; click on ""Task Manager"".


Alternatively, the keyboard shortcut to go directly to Task Manager is Ctrl+⇧ Shift+Esc

Another option is, right click on the task bar, anywhere on the empty space, you will see options, click on the Task Manager.;
,,,, (These are underlined in the pop-up window.)


These priority names are intuitively obvious; they mean just what they say.
The priority level starts out at ""Normal"", and stays there unless YOU change it.
The higher (or lower) you set the program's 'priority', the more (or fewer) system resources will be allocated to it, so it will run faster (or slower) than it did before. ""Low"", for example, is fine for a program running in background that you do not need to have finish up soon, so that more resources are freed up. ""Realtime"" is best for something that absolutely has to have maximum resources right now!

,, Once you have right-clicked on the process, just hit the letter ""p"" to choose ""Priority"", then the letter that corresponds to your desired level (e.g., ""A"" for ""Above normal""), then ""Y"" for ""yes"". A lot faster than mousing or clicking!

Review your system protocol.,
Open the registry editor.,
Expand the relevant data tree.,
Change the registered owner.,
Finalize your username.,
Confirm your changes.,
Reboot your computer.",How to Change the Registered Name on a Windows PC1," If you're on a work computer or an otherwise non-personal machine, chances are pretty high that you won't have access to the registry editor--and even if you do, you probably shouldn't be making changes to the computer's registration.


Even if you don't think there will be an issue, remember that there can be legal ramifications to tampering with a machine's registration. Check with any system administrators first!
Changing a personal computer's registration can render the computer unclaimable in the event that it is stolen; it can also reset your saved wifi networks, as workplace and school wifi providers rely on your registration staying consistent.;
, Registry editor allows you to make changes to system software and hidden files, which is what you'll need to do to edit the default username. To open the registry editor, go to Run, type in ""regedit"", and click ""OK"". This should bring up the registry editor, in which several folders should be viewable in the left-hand corner of the window.


You may encounter a pop-up window asking you if you're sure you want to open registry editor. Click ""OK"" to continue.
If your system sends you an error message that states your ineligibility to access registry editor, you're probably not cleared to make changes to software on that specific machine.

, Locate the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE file and expand it, then do the same for the ensuing files SOFTWARE, Microsoft, and finally Windows NT. Make sure you're expanding these files, not just clicking on them. To expand a file, click the chevron-style arrow next to it. This should result in an extensive list of all the sub-folders appearing.

, Click on--but don't expand--a file labeled ""CurrentVersion"", then scroll down to an item labeled ""RegisteredOwner"" in the right-hand pane and double click it to bring up the value editor. You can change this value from the current name to whatever you see fit. You can also change the registered organization in the same location by double-clicking the item labeled ""Registered Organization"". Again, make sure you have explicit permission to make this change before doing so if you're on a shared computer.

, Though you've changed the registered user at this point, the default name that will show on the login screen isn't bound to this registry item. To finalize your changes, scroll through the contents of ""CurrentVersion"" until you find a folder entitled ""Winlogon""; click on this file, find the registry item labeled ""DefaultUser"" (or ""DefaultUsername"") and double-click it to change its value.


Make sure this value perfectly matches the change you made to the registered owner above.

, To ensure your changes carried over, open the file explorer by accessing the Start menu and clicking on ""File Explorer"" (Windows 8 and 10). Find the ""File"" tab in the upper left-hand corner, click it, and then click on ""Help""; click ""About Windows"" in the resulting menu. A window should pop up with your PC's details, including its registered name. If the name on the window matches the name you entered, you're good to go!


A much easier and more consistent way of verifying your name is by opening System Information and scrolling through your system's details until you come to your registered name. To access System Information in any operating system, open Run, type in ""msinfo32.exe"" without the quotation marks, and click ""OK"".
On Windows XP, you'll open ""Explore"" from Start, then go to ""Help"" in the upper left-hand corner and click on ""About Windows"" in the menu.
On Windows Vista and Windows 7, you'll click ""Open Windows Explorer"" from Start, then click the ""Help"" tab in the upper left-hand corner and click on ""About Windows"" in the menu.

, When you log back in, your computer should display your newly-entered name above the login information section. This will finalize your process.

"
Decide on a name change.,
Open Control Panel.,
Select ""User Accounts"".,
Click ""Change your account name"".,
Restart your computer.",How to Change the Registered Name on a Windows PC2," If you're simply trying to change the name that displays upon boot-up and on the start screen--not the official registration--then your accuracy doesn't really matter. Be creative!


Nicknames, pet names, or other monikers are great ideas if you're looking for a change in scenery, so to speak.

, Control Panel allows you to make changes to system processes and apps. The easiest way to find Control Panel is by typing its name into the search bar located in the start menu, then clicking the relevant app as soon as it pops up. On older systems, it is possible to access Control Panel through system settings; on newer systems such as Windows 8 and 10, however, it's easier to simply search ""Control Panel"" and click on the resulting app.
You can also open Run and type in ""control panel"" to open this folder.

, Once Control Panel opens, look for and click on a subcategory labeled ""User Accounts"".


Make sure you don't click on the link entitled ""Type of account""; this will open a series of settings that can potentially harm your computer or your ownership thereof if handled incorrectly.
User Accounts may redirect you to a subfolder with another link entitled ""User Accounts""--if so, click this link.

, Once you've accessed the User Accounts folder, find the link entitled ""Change your account name"" and click on it. This will bring up the option to type in a new account name. Type in the name of your choosing and click ""Change Name"" to finalize the process.


Note that, while this change does affect the login name above your password entry box, the official registration of your computer and the default username will remain the way it appeared before.

, When you log back in, your computer should display your newly-entered name above the login information section. This will finalize your process.

Speak to customer service.",How to Choose a Wireless Router," This is doable by contacting your Internet Service Provider (ISP), or by looking at your account details. Internet speed, which is typically measured in megabytes per second (MB/s), will dictate your router's bare minimum speed.


For example: if your Internet's top speed is 100 MB/s, you'll need a router that can handle at least 100 MB/s.;
, There may be better alternatives than what you're already using, and your current local internet service provider may dictate the kind of router you use.


Some ISPs have the option of renting a router/modem combination. These typically cost a small fee per month, but are a good choice for people who can't afford to replace or update a several hundred-dollar router every few years.

, If you're starting from scratch, you'll need to purchase both a modem and a router. The modem interfaces with the Internet access point (e.g., the physical cable), while the router plugs into the modem to broadcast the Wi-Fi signal.


If you already have a modem from a different service provider, be sure to check with your current ISP to ensure that it will work with their services.
You can buy modem and router combination units for a lower price, though these units tend to be more expensive to fix or replace., It's easy to spend much more money than is necessary on a router and modem. Knowing how much you're willing to spend (and how much you absolutely can spend) will help eliminate some of the higher-end routers from your search.


Collectively, you can usually expect to spend around $200 total on a good-quality modem and router.Be aware that your budget should be a bit flexible, as a router just outside of your budget might be worth the price in reliability and performance.

, A good way to do this is by figuring out where the router needs to be (e.g., where the cable hook-up is) and then walking from that point to each room or area where you'll need the router signal to reach.


Walls and floors impede a wireless signal, meaning you'll need a router with a greater signal strength for a multi-floor or multi-room area than you would for a smaller space (e.g., an apartment or a classroom).If you're working with multiple floors of space or a wide area, you'll likely need to purchase more than one router and place them on the same network.

, Writing down a list of devices that will be connected to the router (e.g., phones, computers, consoles, etc.) will help determine the router's size, since you'll need a large router to support several active devices at once and vice versa.


A small, average-power router can typically take care of a group of standard computers performing low-bandwidth operations, while you'll need a stronger router to handle high-bandwidth operations and other devices (e.g., printers).Also consider how you'll be using the Internet, since casual browsing and light work will take significantly less processing than gaming or constant file transfers (e.g., uploading and downloading).

, It can be tempting to pick up the fastest face-value router you can afford; however, your router can at best provide the top speed of your Internet connection (e.g., 100 MB/s). Some other things to keep in mind include the following:Advertised speed - A rounded-up combination of all router bands' speeds. This is the number you'll see advertised on your router's product description. Since most devices can't connect to more than one band at once, this number is a technical fallacy.

Ceiling speed - This value determines the highest speed at which your devices can use the Internet. For example, a router that supports a speed of 800 MB/s won't help a device that only reaches 400 MB/s achieve a higher ceiling speed.

Router range - Your router's maximum range dictates how far from it you can be while still receiving a serviceable signal. For larger areas, you'll need to either pick up a router with a strong signal, or look into purchasing a mesh net system, which uses multiple routers spaced throughout the area., Every router has a numerical classification of ""802.11"", which is the international Wi-Fi standard. However, the letter (or two letters) in front of the router's model number refers to its version and, by association, top speed.For the best possible performance and compatibility, buy a router with ""AC"" in front of its model number.
Designations A, B, and G are considered obsolete.

, There are many different security types, but WPA2 is the most recent--and, therefore, most secure--version of encryption. Any router with the ""AC"" designation should support WPA2 encryption.Avoid WEP and WPA, since both are outdated as of 2006.
If you can't find a WPA2 certification on the router's packaging or features page, contact the manufacturer or customer service department and ask about the router's supported encryption.

, Once you've narrowed your search enough that you're looking at specific models, do an in-depth search for reviews, user feedback, and usage reports. This will give you the best possible idea of how the router will perform in the circumstances under which you'll be using it.This is also a good time to call your local ISP and ask about their recommended routers.
When reading other users' reviews, pay close attention to the poor ones. These tend to be the most telling of any gaping flaws in the router, especially if other users have the same criticisms.
If your specific model of router has overwhelmingly positive reviews and is clearly being purchased by a large user base, it's likely a good choice.

, If you go to a physical store location to purchase your router, you can request input from someone in the tech department. They may be able to disclose more information, personal or otherwise, about the router's performance.


Specifically ask them what the return rate is like on your selected model. The lower the number, the better.
If you are purchasing your router from a place like Amazon or eBay, consider finding a physical store (e.g., Best Buy) that stocks the same model and calling their customer support team to inquire about the router's performance.

Save your settings.",How to Optimize Your Cisco WiFi Router with the Optimal Channel," There are many tools available that can do network scanning. One good tool is inSSIDer.


inSSIDer can be downloaded from http://www.metageek.net/products/inssider/.;
, Choose between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz channels.


Most newer models of Cisco Wi-Fi routers support 5 GHz. This frequency has less traffic compared to 2.4 GHz since less devices are able to broadcast through it. If your router has this, use it. Otherwise, you’re left with 2.4 GHz.

, Sort the networks by channel and scan the results. Select the channel with the least number of networks. This is the optimal channel that has the fewest number of users or routers broadcasting through it.

, To do this, go to the Cisco router’s configuration page. The default IP address for Cisco routers is 192.168.1.1.


Note that this may have been changed during your router setup, so make sure to use the correct one.

, Use your admin username and password to log into the configuration page. Other user types may not have the needed access to make the changes need.

, From the top menu bar, click on “Wireless” to access the Wireless Settings page.

, You should see two sets of wireless settings here, one for 2.4 GHz and one for 5 GHz. Review the settings here to make sure everything is still correct.


You will want to focus on the settings for 5 GHz if that’s the one you’re using. This is the one on top.

, Look at all the settings available and choose the settings for ""Channel."" Select the optimal channel you got from the scan results.

, Click on the “Save Settings” button on the bottom part of the page to save the changes you’ve made.


You have now successfully optimized your Cisco Wi-Fi router’s channel.

Slip the tubing over the bent part of the paper clip.,
Shrink the tubing with the lighter.,
Insulate the antenna.,
Insert the paper clip into the antenna port.",How to Make a Wifi Antenna1," In order to make the antenna, you will need a large paper clip, an empty Bic ballpoint pen, and a roll of electrical tape. You will also need a metric ruler, scissors, and a lighter.;
, Unfold the paper clip into straight piece of metal.

, In order to get the best signal, your paper clip should be 61 mm long. Try to get as close to this measurement as possible for the most effective antenna.

, Bend about 19 mm (3/4 inch) of one end of the paper clip at a 90° angle. This will be the part that inserts into the WiFi antenna port.

, Since you're going to be clipping the ink cartridge, it's best if you use a pen that doesn't write anymore. Clip off about 12-18 mm (1/2 inch to 3/4 inch) of the tubing that contains the ink. This can get messy, so be sure to hold the tube away from you when you cut. Cut the tube over a surface that you don't getting stained.

, Place the cut-off piece of tubing over the bent end of the paper clip. Make sure that the tubing extends past the end of the paper clip by about 1.5 mm (1/16 inch).

, Take a lighter or other heat source and GENTLY heat the tubing on the paper clip. This will shrink the tubing and make a tight fit to the paper clip.

, Wrap the paper clip in electrical tape to prevent excess interference with the wireless signal.

, Insert the 'tubing' end of the paper clip into the antenna connector, ensuring that the connector pin and the paper clip are pressed together inside the tubing. If you can get them to overlap the signal will be even better.

Connect the can to the wireless card using the pigtail cable.,
Point the can at the physical access point.",How to Make a Wifi Antenna2," To build this directional antenna, you will need an N-Female chassis mount connector, four #6x1/4"" nuts and bolts, 1 1/4"" (32 mm) copper wire, pigtail patch cable, and an empty aluminum can.


You will also need a drill, a soldering iron, and a screwdriver that fits the bolts
A pigtail cable is a patch cable with a connector at both ends of the cable.
The aluminum can should have one side without a lid and one side with a metal bottom.

, The can's diameter determines where the connector is mounted. Your can should be at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide, but can be as big as 6 inches (15.2 cm).

, Measure up from the bottom of the can and mark the outside where the connector will be. The measurement will vary depending on the diameter of the can. This measurement is determined for maximum signal strength. Below are some common measurements:


3 inches (7.6 cm) - 3.74 inches (9.5 cm)
3.5 inches (8.9 cm) - 2.07 inches (5.25 cm)
6 inches (15.2 cm) - 1.38 inches (3.5 cm)

, Use a drill bit the same size as the small side of the N-Female connector to drill a whole where you measure. You can also use a hammer and nail if you don't have a drill.


If your N-Female connector has screw holes, drill smaller holes around your larger one to allow you to mount it with the nuts and bolts.

, Take your copper wire and line it up the the metal connector on the small side of the N-Female connector. The little brass tube and the length of the wire should total 1.21 inches (3.07 cm) when lined up. Get as close to this measurement as physically possible for the best connection.

, Use the soldering iron to attach the wire to the brass tube on the back of the N-Female connector. This creates the probe. See this guide for details on soldering. The wire should be sticking straight out from the connector.

, After the solder has finished cooling, mount the probe to the can with the wire on the inside and the screw connector on the outside. Use the nuts and bolts to secure the probe to the can.

, Screw the pigtail cable onto the probe mount, and then connect the other end to your wireless card's antenna connector.

, The can will need to be pointed directly at the wireless access point. You can mount it to a camera tripod with a zip tie for easy pointing.The range you can achieve with your antenna will vary depending on the size of the can, the accuracy of your measurements, and any interference between the antenna and the access point.

Gather the materials for your can-tenna.,
Create a hole in the bottom of the can.,
Mount your antenna for a USB-dongle receiver.,
Prepare your USB-based can-tenna.,
Mount your can-tenna.,
Position your antenna properly.",How to Increase the Range of Your Wifi1," To create a can-tenna, you need a beer can (or a Pringles can), a pair of scissors and duct tape. You can use this type of antenna for traditional routers as well as for USB-dongle-style Wi-Fi receivers.;
, For traditional routers, create a hole in the bottom of the can. Make this hole as close to the center of the can as possible. The closer it is to the center, the better will be its chances of enhancing Wi-Fi signal strength.

, For this, you need a USB male-female cable. You can purchase this at any dollar store.

, Here is how you can prepare your USB-based antenna:


Cut a rectangular hole in the bottom of the can. This will hold the receiver in place, helping it to sit snugly inside the can.
Attach a piece of the duct tape to the back of your receiver. Place another piece of the tape in such a way that it covers the bottom of your can.
Carefully tape the can-tenna to the receiver.

, Make sure that your can-tenna is securely taped up. Allow enough space for the wire to sit neatly in front. You can use flexible clamps to offer more support to your antenna and hold it in place.

, The can-tenna is capable of increasing your Wi-Fi range, provided that you do the following:


Make sure that your antenna directly faces the area that you will be accessing the internet from.
Keep changing your antenna’s angle and note the signal strength on your receiver in each position. Use the position which indicates the highest signal strength.

"

Prepare the materials to create your parabolic antenna.,
Set up your parabolic antenna.,
Position your antenna.",How to Increase the Range of Your Wifi2," This antenna, which looks somewhat like a satellite dish, is known to offer better results than the can-tenna.


To build a parabolic antenna, you need a dome-shaped piece of metallic cookware. You can use a metal bowl, strainer or anything that falls under the category of Asian parabolic cookware (such as a small wok).

, Drill a hole in your utensil or strainer. Make sure that your antenna is as close its center as possible. Then fix it to the receiver with tape or superglue.

, Once you have made sure that your bowl/strainer has stuck to the receiver, face it toward the area that you will be accessing the internet from.


Keep changing your antenna’s angle and note the signal strength on your receiver in each position. Use the position which indicates the highest signal strength.
Note that the larger the circumference of your bowl or strainer; and the closer it is placed to the center; the better are its chances of enhancing Wi-Fi signal strength.

Prepare your aluminum foil sheet.,
Set up the aluminum foil.,
Stabilize your aluminum foil.,
Position the foil properly.",How to Increase the Range of Your Wifi3," This is another easy method you can use to help boost your house’s Wi-Fi signal. For this, you will need aluminum foil, a pair of scissors and a router.

, In order to set up your DIY booster, you will need to do the following:


Cut a piece of foil in the shape of a rectangle. The piece should be about a foot or so in length.
Fold all the edges of the foil to about a centimeter. This will form a sort of frame for it.
Give the foil a slightly curved shape, resembling a parabola.

, Make sure to stabilize your foil, so that it can sit on or behind your router, without falling off.


If your router is mounted on a wall, you can make holes in the foil and insert it into the antenna. This way, it will stay as close as possible to your antenna.

, Turn the router and antenna to face it toward the area that you will be accessing the internet from. Your aluminum foil will reflect the wireless signal; focusing it on the chosen area in your home.

Know which businesses always have free WiFi.,
Use a hotspot database.,
Sign up for loyalty programs and use coupons.,
Get into MAC spoofing.",How to Get Free WiFi from Your City or Town1," As free internet becomes more and more par for the course, businesses are hard-pressed to offer their clients (or passersby...) free, unlimited WiFi.


Obviously, Starbucks, McDonald's, and Panera (to name just three) offer free public WiFi. But maybe you're cappuccino-ed out?

Truck stops, car washes, and auto shops offer WiFi to waiting clients.
Libraries, city halls, and even parks are starting to offer free WiFi now. It all encourages local citizens to get more involved.
Plenty of hotel chains are now starting to jump on the bandwagon. Do a minute of research to find hours of gold.

;
, So maybe you're not near a Mickey D's (...where could that be?) or you're just sick of the smell of coffee in the morning. You can still find hotspots using sites like WeFi.They currently have a running list of over 165 million hotspots.


Still not near a hotspot, huh? Doesn't mean you can't find free, hidden networks. Depending on your setup, you could use NetStumbler, iStumbler, JiWire, Hotspot Haven, or WiFinder.Plenty of apps abound to get you out of this pickle.

, This one involves a little bit of forward-thinking. But if you know you'll be on the alert in the not-so-distant future, load up and sign up now.


Many hotel chains have loyalty programs that will offer you free WiFi if you join. You don't even have to book a room!
Websites like RetailMeNotalso offer WiFi coupons from your favorite hotel chains. And a whole bunch more nifty things.

, This one requires a bit of ingenuity and amorality, but it will get you to your end goal. Justifies the means, right? If your WiFi area has a time limit that you are running up to, consider MAC address spoofing.


Download an app like MAC Makeupto get the process rolling. Even changing one number should be sufficient. You can either just extend your time a bit or hack into someone else's MAC address that has paid for the WiFi already. It's not the most honest of solutions, of course. But it'll do.

, Tap the Reaver for Android icon in your App drawer. After confirming that you are not using it for illegal purposes, Reaver will scan for available access points. Tap the access point you want to crack to continue.


You may need to verify Monitor Mode before proceeding. If this is the case, bcmon will open again.
The access point you select must accept WPS authentication. Not all routers support this.

, In most cases you can leave the settings that appear at their default. Make sure that the ""Automatic advanced settings"" box is checked.

, Tap the ""Start attack"" button at the bottom of the Reaver Settings menu. The monitor will open and you will see the results of the ongoing crack displayed.

If your warranty is still available (this can be checked in Settings > General > About > Warranty), go to your nearest Apple Store or official retailer/reseller store and ask for the warranty service and they will take care of it. It is also possible to complete this process online from www.apple.com/support/.
If your warranty service is not available, you will need to use the paid service from an Apple store or authorized retailer/reseller. You may also check out online paid services from www.apple.com/support/. The genius troubleshooting is only available in the Official Apple Store or authorized retailer/reseller. It is cheaper than paid services but it is not available online and there aren't may Apple stores, retailer/resllers that have genius troubleshooters at your service.

Factory reset your device if you still can't get it to connect.",How to Fix Your Internet Connection2," There are two ways that mobile devices can connect to the internet: cellular data or Wi-Fi networks. If you don't have any signal and are not connected to a wireless network, you won't be able to access the internet.If you don't have a mobile data plan with your carrier, you won't be able to access the internet unless you're connected to a wireless network.

, If you're trying to use a public Wi-Fi hotspot, there's a good chance that you'll need to register through your web browser first. Many devices will display a notification that you need to register, but if you don't see it you can open your web browser app and try to load any website to bring up the registration screen.

, A quick way to fix a lot of connectivity problems is to put your device into airplane mode, which will turn off all of the network adapters, and then turn airplane mode back off.


For both iOS and Android, you can open the Settings app and tap the ""Airplane mode"" slider to turn it on. Android users may need to tap ""More..."" to see the Airplane Mode option. Wait a few moments after enabling it for your networks to disconnect, and then tap it again to reset your network adapters.

, If you're trying to connect to a wireless network, your device's Wi-Fi adapter needs to be turned on. You can toggle Wi-Fi on from the Settings menu on both iOS and Android.

, Sometimes corrupt settings can cause network connection problems. Resetting your network settings may solve the problem. This will erase any custom settings you have entered.


iOS - Open the Settings app and select ""General"". Tap ""Reset"" and then ""Reset Network Settings"".
Android - Open the Settings app, tap ""More..."", select ""Mobile Networks"", then ""Access Point Names"", tap ⋮, and then ""Reset to default"".

, If nothing above has worked in getting your device to connect to the internet, you may need to perform a factory reset. This will wipe everything off of your device and reset it to the state it was when it came out o the box.

Decide where and when you will need to use the internet and how much.,
Start with your hotel.,
Decide what devices you need to connect on.,
Find out how much your carrier charges for internet data abroad, whether it be for per use or a plan.,
Get a sense of how much data is typically is used by different actions you perform.,
Considering renting a smartphone for the country you are traveling to.,
Plan differently for a cruise.",How to Get Internet Access While Traveling Abroad," Will you need it only at your hotel? Or will you also need it on the road? Can you wait until you reach a hotspot? Or do you need it in your vehicle?;
, When choosing a hotel, learn if the hotel has WiFi, and whether or not there is a fee for its use. If this is important to you, this may impact you choice of hotel.


If you can get by using WiFi at your hotel only, all you will need to do is bring a WiFi-capable laptop, tablet computer, or smartphone. Your hotel may or may not charge for this service. Aside from that, you will not need to pay any additional fees.

, If you will need internet access beyond the hotel room, consider which type of device you plan to use. It could be a smartphone, tablet computer, or e-reader.


Consider using a Kindle 3G Keyboard. It offers free mobile internet access in over 100 countries. Though it has a monochrome screen and cannot perform every internet function, there is quite a lot it can do, including reading and sending email, Facebook, and a lot of other common sites. Its manufacture has been discontinued, but there are still plenty of used ones available for sale on the Amazon site and in other places.

, Compare it with how much you traditionally use over a period of time, and see which plan is good for your needs and what you are willing to pay for.

, To do this, before your trip, experiment by first going to the data meter in the phone's settings and checking the data. Then, while on a mobile (not WiFi) connection, perform various actions you might perform while abroad such as reading an email, sending an email, visiting a web page, looking at a map, etc. After each individual action, check how much data has been added to the previous number. Do not rely on the carrier's website; these provide averages but do not reflect each individual user.


Check your months usage from previous months. Prorate it down to the amount of time you will be traveling. For example, if you typically use 600 MB in a month, and your trip is 10 days, you can assume you will use around 200 MB over a 10-day period. Be aware that often, you may use more than usual while traveling due to the amount of time you spend on the road, the use of high-data applications such as maps, and possible lack of access at some places where you may be staying, such as a hotel.

, This is an alternative to a plan on your carrier. Do a Google search of phone rental companies, and compare prices and offerings.


If you own an older smartphone that is still functional, it may be possible to rent a SIM card for a lower price than that of a phone rental. You may have to have the phone unlocked by the carrier for this to work.

, If you are going on a cruise, a different set of suggestions apply. Few carriers allow their 'international data' plans to be used on cruise ships.


If you can go for long breaks between internet usage, consider accessing internet on shore. Options include hot spots, your smart phone with an international data plan, or the Kindle Keyboard as described above.
If you must access internet while out at sea, most likely you will need to use the ship's wifi service. On most ships, this costs 75¢/minute (give or take) if paid for by the minute. But with the purchase of a minutes plan, it can be reduced to as little as 20¢/minute.
Satellite internet used by ships is slow, and minutes can drain quickly. To save minutes, log on, upload all you email and web pages you plan to read, then log off. If you are sending an email, compose it while offline, save it in your drafts, then log on, and it'll be sent in a matter of seconds to minutes.
Video and voice sites, such as YouTube and Skype, are unlikely to work while using the ship's internet.
Some carriers have arrangements with some cruise lines to offer data packages for while on board the ship. These are often very limited.
Some routes of some cruises are pretty close to the shoreline and one's smartphone may be able to pick up the land signal and use the data allotment purchased for the land. Also, if you are using a Kindle, as described above, the Kindle may be able to pick up a signal and obtain free service.

If Ethernet isn't an option, you'll have to reset the router to its default settings.

, In order to access your router's page, you must know your router's IP address:


Windows - Open Start, click the Settings gear, click Network & Internet, click View your network properties, and view the address next to ""Default gateway"".

Mac - Open the Apple menu, click System Preferences, click Network, click Advanced, click the TCP/IP tab, and look for the number to the right of ""Router:"".
Common router addresses include 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, and 192.168.2.1, as well as 10.0.0.1 for Apple routers.

, Open your preferred browser and enter your router's IP address into the browser's address bar.

, After entering the correct address, you may be asked for the username and password; if so, log in with your router credentials. These are typically different credentials than you use to connect to the Wi-Fi.


The default username is usually admin, and the default password is usually admin, password, or blank. Most people change these after configuring the router, however, so if you can't remember the username and password you may need to reset the router.
If you didn't change the default username and password, it should be printed in the router's documentation or on the router itself.

, Once you are logged into the router, find the ""Wireless"" or ""Wi-Fi"" section. This can usually be accessed by clicking a tab at the top of the page or finding it in the navigation menu.


Each router page interface will vary, so you may have to navigate through a couple of different menus.
Your router's password may also be at the top of the main router page.

, On the ""Wireless"" page, you will see your wireless network name (SSID) as well as the security or encryption type (e.g., WEP, WPA, WPA2, or WPA/WPA2). Near the security options, you should see the ""Passphrase"" or ""Password"" field. This is your wireless password.

Look for your router's default login information.,
Connect to your network.",How to Find Your WiFi Password when You Forgot It4," This button is usually on the back of the router. You'll probably need a paperclip or needle to press the ""Reset"" button.


Resetting your router will also disconnect every device you have connected to the router. For this reason, resetting the router should be your last resort.

, Do so for at least 30 seconds to ensure that the router completely resets.


The lights on the router should flash or briefly turn off when the router has officially reset.

, This information is usually found on the bottom of the router, and includes the following:


Network name or SSID - Your network's factory name that you'll see in the Wi-Fi menu.

Password or Key - Your network's stock password.

, When entering the password, you'll use the factory password that's printed on the bottom of your router.


You may have the option of changing the password before you connect to the Internet.

Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) service.",How to Determine Which Disadvantages of WiFi Will Have the Greatest Impact," Most wireless networks are slower than wired networks. There are a couple of more expensive and newer wireless networks today that are faster, but the methods employed to obtain the speed increases have not been formally adopted (unlike the 802.11b/g/n). The wired networks are probably still the best choice for the fastest residential setup, particularly when hardware costs are concerned. This of course changes with time as prices fall and new standards are adopted. Investigate the different technologies available before purchasing.;
, Most 802.11b and 802.11g networks have a maximum limit of 200 to 300 feet (61.0 to 91.4 m) under optimum conditions (properly installed wired networks work flawlessly through 325 feet). Speed and connection reliability fall quickly as distance between the network hardware and the computers (transmitter and receiver) increase. Like an FM radio in a car, the signal quality suffers as the distance between the radio station and the car increases. The best speed and reliability come when there is a ""line of sight"" between the computer and network hardware with minimal distance.

, Speed and connection reliability also falls quickly when there are obstructions between transmitter and receiver. Relocate hardware to avoid having to penetrate aluminum siding, metal studs, brick and concrete walls, etc., all of which are significantly more difficult for radio signals to penetrate than free air or wood and gypsum board.

, Speed and connection reliability also falls quickly when other devices operate in the same frequency range as the network. Like the FM radio in a car, as you travel away from a broadcaster on 100.1 in one city and get closer to a different broadcaster also on 100.1 in another city, interference results, leaving little of it intelligible. WiFi is networking via radio, but instead of talk or music being transmitted like the FM radio, it is data. The radio frequency for most WiFi is 2.4 GHz. Many cordless phones, wireless home audio speakers, baby monitors (and neighboring wireless networks) operate on this popular frequency, and all have been known to cause problems in the past.

, Security is a must. Failure to implement it properly leaves too many wireless systems wide open to anyone close enough to access it. Improperly secured networks bring unauthorized access, which can lead to exploitation of the network and/or the devices (computers and their data) that are connected to it. WPA is a far better protection than WEP and easier to disseminate since it uses a password rather than a long string of numbers and letters. Even if you publish your WPA password, using WPA will protect users on the network from each other!

, Security, while getting better all the time, is still probably easier to be compromised in a wireless network setting compared with trying to gain access to the physical cable of a wired network. Anyone within range can attempt to hack your wireless network from their parked car or the comfort of their own home, most likely undetected.

, Costs can increase significantly if external antennas, amplifiers and cables are needed to extend the reach and reliability of wireless networks.

, A VPN encrypts all data sent between the host (source of the information) and client (your computer, smartphone, etc.). This encryption makes it impossible (thus far anyway) for anyone to ""monitor"" the data as it is exchanged between host and client. VPNs add more ""overhead"" to data packets, so a slight slow down in speed often results. It is a small price to pay for peace of mind about the security of your connections and the data passed between them."

Most modern WiFi gateways employ Wireless 802.11 N technology.,
When purchasing, look for a WiFi adapter that makes the connection by USB and at least supports 802.11 N for your operating system.,
For the best possible throughput for your gateway consider a ""dual band"" adapter.,
One great example is the TP-Link TL-WDN4200.,
Upon unpacking your new USB wireless adapter you will see an installation CD.,
Once the software is installed you will simply plug the adapter into an open USB port on your desktop.,
Once plugged in you should see a list of available networks.,
At this point your operating system should ask you for a network key.,
Assuming you selected the correct network SSID and entered the proper WPA/WPA2 key from your ISP you should be able to open a browser window and confirm you are back online!",How to Convert a Desktop Computer to WiFi," 802.11 WiFi comes in many flavors but the good news is that Wireless N adapters are all backwards compatible with the previous standards as well, so purchasing a compatible adapter is relatively simple.
, This is the easiest method for adding WiFi to your desktop. You will not have to open the PC and install any expansion cards, a simple plug in device in a free USB port is all you need.

, What that means is that in addition to being able to receive signals broadcast at the typical 2.4 Ghz WiFi band it can also receive signals at 5 Ghz if your gateway supports it. Dual band adapters are only a few dollars premium and ensure that you have something that should perform well in a variety of scenarios.

, It supports Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 8.1 in 32 and 64 bit flavors. If you are running a different operating system, make sure to check the adapter manufacturer for compatibility prior to purchase.http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/cat-11_TL-WDN4200.html#overview

, Run that prior to plugging the adapter in. The CD will install the necessary software and drivers for your adapter.

, Make sure it is at least rated for USB 2.0 to allow enough throughput for best performance from your internet connection. (most modern desktop computers purchased in the last ten years will).

, The names are referred to as the ""SSID"". If you do not know the SSID for your gateway, typically it is written on a label somewhere on the gateway. Find your SSID broadcast name and select it from the list of available wireless networks.

, Most internet service providers have a default WPA2 key written on a label on the gateway/router. Enter that key and check the box that says ""Automatically connect"" so you don't have to enter it each time you want to access your internet. If you have trouble finding your WPA2 security key, call your ISP for assistance.

, If you're using Windows Vista or a newer OS, the Windows Firewall has been set up so that it will ask you what type of network you are using. Make sure to specify that it's public, so the computer can adjust your settings accordingly.


If you use a firewall outside of Windows, make sure you select its settings for a public-network, too.

, Adding an s to the address bar will help encrypt the transferred data between the source server and your computer's browser, and also helps to prohibit peering eyes (behind the scenes) from seeing the same data that is transmitting back.


For example, Facebook has set up a special https connection for your use. However, it is turned off by default.

, Ensure the Wi-Fi hotspots name matches the business. If you're sitting at an airport, and you notice the network is named ""ineedabeer"", it's probably not the airport's official public network. If you don't trust the source, avoid connecting to it or run an anti-spyware/anti-virus (anti-malware) software package on your PC.


If in question, go up to a employee and ask them which network is the correct one to use.

, This will prevent your device from automatically connecting to that network automatically the next time you come within range of the business.

, VPNs hide your real VPN and replace it with other more random IP addresses from the provider. VPNs can add a connection in another country to protect the user from tracking. Some VPNs are free while others are paid, so watch for a hidden cost. The NSA could still watch the connection if it notices weak passwords were used or the end location can be compromised.


If you can afford it, pay for a VPN and choose more local connections near your current country. The distance between the VPN and the country is a trade-off between paid and free VPNs.
Make sure the provider is open and trust about their data storage policies. Some like to keep the user's data while others discard the data once the user signs out of the VPN.
Be mindful if a website or other instance requires location data while using the VPN. VPNs will let you get around location restrictions when companies require location data to be provided.

Open your router's configuration page.,
Enter your router's username and password.,
Open the Wireless section.,
Change the password.,
Check out your security type.,
Change your network name.,
Save your settings.",How to Change Your Wi Fi Password," You can access your router's configuration page through a web browser on a computer connected to your network. If you can't connect via Wi-Fi because you don't know the password, use an Ethernet cable to connect your computer directly to the router. This will bypass the need for the Wi-Fi password.


Standard router addresses are 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.2.1, or 10.0.1.1 (Apple) or 10.0.0.1 (Xfinity). Enter the address into your browser's address bar.
If none of the above addresses grant you access to the configuration page, open the Command Prompt by pressing the Windows key + R and entering cmd. Once the Command Prompt opens, type ipconfig and press Enter. Look for your active connection in the list and find the Default Gateway address. This is typically your router address.If all else fails, press and hold the Reset button on your router for about 30 seconds to revert it to factory default settings. Then, look up the default address for that router model and enter it into your browser.
Some routers come with configuration software. If you've previously installed your configuration software, you can use that instead of the web browser interface.;
, Every router will require a username and password before you can access the innards. If you never changed this when you first configured the router, chances are the username is ""admin"" and the password is ""admin"" or ""password"". Of course this varies from model to model, so you should search your model online to see your exact login info.If you've changed the login in the past and since forgot it, or received the router as a hand-me-down and the previous owner didn't reset it, you'll need to press and hold the Reset button on the router for about 30 seconds. This will reset the settings to default, allowing you to log in with the default username and password.

, Once you are logged into your router, you will need to find the Wireless section of the configuration page. The exact name changes from manufacturer to manufacturer, but generally you are looking for a ""Wireless"" or ""Wireless Settings/Setup"" tab or button.


If your ""Wireless"" section has multiple subsections, open the Wireless Security page.

, Look for the box labeled ""Password"", ""Passphrase"" or ""Shared Key"". You can enter your new password into this box. Some routers will ask that you type the password again to ensure that you entered it correctly.


Try to create a strong password that would be difficult if not impossible to guess. It should not be related to anything personal, and should include a liberal amount of numbers, random cases, and special characters such as ""!"", ""$"" and ""#"".
A strong password is usually at least 8 characters long.

, There are three main types of wireless encryption: WEP, WPA, and WPA2. For the most secure network, you should be using WPA2. You may run into issues connecting older devices, however, in which case you could switch to WPA or WPA/WPA2. Selecting WEP is NOT recommended, as WEP encryption is very easy to break (it can take less than 30 minutes to crack a WEP password).

, While you're here, take a moment to change your network name if you have not already. The name should not include any personally identifiable information, as the name will be publicly broadcast. Changing the name will help deter people from trying to break into it. Routers with default names are seen as easier hacking targets.

, Once you are done entering in your new password, click the Apply or Save button. The button's location is different for every router, but is typically located at the top or bottom of the page. The router will take a few moments to process the change, at which point any devices currently connected would be disconnected.


After your settings are changed, you can connect to your wireless network using your new password.

Get a mesh-covered dish.,
Assemble the system.,
Plug in your antenna.,
Aim your dish.,
Fine tune your dish.",How to Build a Low Cost WiFi Antenna," This small device, about the size of your thumb, provides WiFi capability to your computer. You will need this even if your computer has integrated wireless.


For best compatibility, get one that includes the 802.11b and 802.11g standard.
Check Google Commerce or Pricewatch for good prices—simple ones, which are quite effective at close range, cost around $15 to $20USD.
The shape is important. For cost effectiveness, look for a small thumb-shaped device. Larger ""squashed mouse"" models (~$50-60USD) are generally more sensitive and powerful. Although they may be harder to mount, they perform better in more demanding setups.;
, You want a Type A (male) to Type A (female )cable. (you can find these at the dollar store, your local computer store, or Radio Shack). This will connect the USB WiFi adapter to your computer's USB port.


The antenna is directional, so you'll need to position it so it has a direct line of sight view of the wireless access point. Make sure your cable is long enough to position it where you need, up to a maximum of 15 feet (4.6 m) (5m).
You can link multiple extension cables together if you need.
Active USB extenders (~$10USD) allow further cable runs, which may even allow elevated outdoor antenna placement.

, The easiest to use is an Asian ""scoop"" cooking utensil (shaped like a wok, but mesh) used to fry things—it's the perfect shape and conveniently comes with a long wooden handle!


Other options include sieves, steamers, pot lids, and lamp shades—as long as they are dish-shaped and metal. Any parabolic piece of metal mesh will work—bigger means a better signal, but harder to carry around.
Larger options include discarded DirectTV dishes or mesh covered umbrellas, and although these should give more signal boost, mounting difficulties and wind resistance tend to make about 12 inch (30 cm) (300mm) diameter the most practical.
Flexible stalk desk lamps allow these to be neatly mounted & positioned.

, Attach the WiFi dongle and USB extension cable in the dish with twist-ties, tape, or hot melt glue.


You want the dongle at the focal point ""hot spot"" apex of the dish—radio signals come in and bounce toward the center, a few fingers above the surface of the dish.
The best dongle location spot can be found by simple experiment. One aiming method involves covering the dish with aluminum foil and watching it reflect sunshine—the spot with the most light is the dish's hot spot.
You may need a short support stick to get the dongle off the surface of the dish into this position.
Alternative support methods use string tied across the face of the dish like a spider web, hollowed out plastic garden hose fittings, or even chop sticks!

, Insert the male end of the USB extension cable into your computer, and set that as your WiFi card using your network settings.

, Locate the remote WiFi transmitter that you want to access.


Your WiFi antenna is very directional, so getting the aim right is important. Pointing the dish towards the remote antenna is the best place to start, although stray reflections from buildings etc may sometimes give good signals from unexpected directions.
You can use an inexpensive hand-held laser pointer to verify that you are aimed right at the wireless transmitter. It's great fun with your cat when you're done surfing the web!

, Once you are connected, tune your dish by adjusting the position of the dongle while watching the signal meter on your computer.


A program like NetStumbler for Windows or KisMAC for the Macintosh can greatly help by giving you graphical readouts of signal strengths.
Compared with inbuilt WiFi adapters, which are usually down at desk level and can easily be screened by metal walls, partitions, vegetation, or your body, even a simple elevated ""woki"" setup like this can boost signals and extend ranges enormously!

, All metallic surfaces reflect WiFi signals, including the thin metal layer found in most mirrors.

, Where you place your router has a lot to do with how it performs. When placing a router, consider putting it:


Near the center of the house, on a top floor. Radio waves best travel down and laterally.Off the floor, ideally on a wall mount or high shelf.As far as possible from your neighbor's WiFi router (which, of course, you've made sure is using a different channel).
Away from cordless phones and microwaves, which operate on the same 2.4-Ghz frequency. (There are some cordless phones that are WiFi friendly).
Away from power cords, computer wires, microwaves, baby monitors, and halogen lamps.These wires and waves can interfere with radio reception.

, If your office is inconveniently far from your wireless access point, and you find yourself stretching to the edge of the room to get better reception, install a wireless signal repeater. Wireless repeater extend your coverage without the need for more wires or hassle.Place your repeater halfway between your access point and your computer for an instant boost.


A wireless bridge (also called an Ethernet converter) is used to get better reception for wired devices. If you're having trouble getting reception on your wired devices, try the Ethernet converter for a few extra bars.

, WEP and WPA/WPA2 are security algorithms that keep hackers from breaking into your network. The only problem is that WEP (""Wired Equivalent Privacy"") is a lot less secure than WPA/WPA2 (""Wireless Protected Access"").So if you're still running your internet through WEP instead of WPA/WPA2, consider changing so that unwanted forces don't break into your network.

, The fewer devices your network has to support, the stronger speed you get out of it. (Usually.) Limit the number of devices can access your network by creating a device access list of MAC addresses. A MAC address is a ""Media Access Control"" identifier for devices that you and your family use.Create a device access list of MAC addresses by first finding your devices MAC addresses, and then by going to your access point's configuration screen and setting which addresses get the green light.

, If you don't want other people from potentially mooching off your signal, don't let them know it's there in the first place. (It is possible for software to locate ""hidden"" networks, but the point still stands.) Go to your access point's admin page and uncheck ""Enable SSID Broadcast."" You can still access your network, of course, but it won't be discoverable when a computer is looking at the list of available networks.

Say a warm goodbye.",How to Impress Your Girlfriend's Mother," Learn as much as you can from your girlfriend about her mother’s interests, such as hobbies, favorite books and movies, travel, etc., so you’ll have a better idea of how to approach the conversation. Also ask about do’s and don’ts—what she likes talking about, what she prefers not to talk about, what makes her laugh, and what she values in people.For example, you can ask your girlfriend something like, ""To help me feel more at ease during the gathering, could you give me an idea of your mother's hobbies and other interests? Knowing about these will make me less unsure of what to say."";
, If invited to lunch or dinner with her, men should dress business casual: Wear a well-ironed button-down shirt and slacks,and polished oxford-style shoes.A blazer may be appropriate as well if you’ll be eating at an upscale restaurant. Women have many more options, but can at least make a point to avoid informal wear such as jeans and plain t-shirts, or a top with a low neckline. If you choose to wear a skirt, knee-length is appropriate.If out to lunch or outdoors otherwise on a warm day, men can get by with a nice short-sleeved polo shirt., Ask your girlfriend if she's familiar with her mother’s favorite flowers.Be careful not to buy something too intimate or suggestive, such as red roses. A multicolored bouquet with a cheerful tone should be appropriate. Remember to remove plastic outer wrappers and price tags from the flower arrangement.If you’re set on getting roses, an appropriate color for first encounters is yellow, since it is known to represent friendship and gratitude.If you don’t have time to get a nice bouquet of flowers, try a box of high-quality chocolates from a grocer or sweets shop.
Alternatively, if you find out she drinks alcohol, pick up a bottle of wine., Coordinate schedules with your girlfriend the day of the outing with Mom, so you’ll be sure not to lose time waiting for each other before going to the gathering. Try to set aside at least an extra twenty minutes for your trip to wherever you’ll be meeting her, and twice as much if you’ll be driving during rush hour. This might mean setting your alarm clock earlier than usual if you’ll be getting together for brunch, or asking your boss to leave work early the evening before a dinner with Mom.

, It’s important to show your true authentic self. Any person who does not have a good understanding of who they are and expresses their true self, may come across as fake, pretentious, insincere, phony, strained, and fraudulent. This is not a good way to begin any new relationship, especially not with your girlfriend’s mother. Some things you can do include:

Reflecting upon who you are as an individual, what you tell others about yourself, and when is the appropriate time to speak about certain qualities about yourself. It is okay to speak about your values and beliefs with honesty. However, speak in a way that allows you to remain sensitive to your girlfriend’s mother’s values and beliefs.
Validating her feelings, and positions throughout the conversation, so she knows that her opinions do matter to you despite possible differences.
Not taking things personally if she does not agree with a particular topic or position of discussion.
Avoiding personalization, assumptions, or judgments. Be open minded, and respond with interest to her values and beliefs. The goal is to earn her trust in you by being authentic, so be careful with your words and remember that it is not all about you.

, A sure way to appear self-absorbed and socially awkward is to use your phone for non-emergencies when with company. This is especially the case when you’re making a first impression, so put off text messaging, internet searches, and phone calls until after the gathering. Just turn off the phone and forget about your online social life for a few hours, and focus all your attention on charming Mom., Until she tells you to call her by her first name, address her as Mrs. or Ms. If she is divorced, be sure to find out if she is using her maiden name. Say hello with a clear and enthusiastic tone of voice, and after she greets you, add a follow-up comment or question as a transition to other introductory exchanges.For example, try a greeting such as, “Hello Mrs./ Ms. Brown, it’s a pleasure to meet you! How are you doing?”
Make an effort to maintain eye contact with her, especially in the first minutes, but also throughout the meeting., Don’t wait for her to offer her hand, but extend yours right away. This will show from the start that you’re engaged in the meeting and eager to form a bond with her. Use a grip somewhere between soft and firm, and avoid shaking her hand repeatedly up and down.If she appears to be offering you a hug as you extend your hand, extend the other hand as well and hug her without breaking stride.

, A good way to continue the opening conversation is to offer her compliments on her attire, jewelry, or hairstyle. Not much detail is called for at this stage, so just a general comment about color or style should be enough to show her that you’re interested and observant.For example, you can tell her, “What a pretty hairstyle you have,” or “Those are some charming earrings,” or “That’s such a lovely hat you’re wearing.”

, As the conversation progresses, you may find your thoughts and attention wandering as the topic changes to something that may not interest you. But it is important at this point to stay focused on where you are and whom you’re talking to. If your eyes begin wandering around the room as Mom is addressing you, she will notice and probably wonder about your sincerity in getting to know her.If you realize that you weren’t listening to something she says, politely ask her to repeat the sentence rather than trying to improvise a safe response.

, Mom will surely want to know a little about your background, so give her brief and direct responses that express a positive self-image. Avoid going too far into details unless she asks for elaboration. When talking about your career, assure her that you have a long-term plan that will offer financial stability, regardless of your current employment situation.


If you have a job that you don’t see yourself keeping long-term, one way to explain this would be to say, “I enjoy my job, but I plan on changing careers eventually to something that is more suited to my interests, and offers better financial security.”
If you’re asked about any hobbies you enjoy, ask her in return about hers to show you’re as curious about her as she is about you: “How about you, do you enjoy biking?” Or, “Well that’s enough about me. I’m curious to hear about you. What do you enjoy doing on the weekends?”

, Although it's a good idea not to go on about this, it may help to tell a sweet story about how you and your girlfriend first met. You could also talk about outings you went on together, and things you enjoy doing in general. Giving examples of how you interact will reassure her that you’re spending quality time together and are an important part of each other’s happiness.


For example, you can try something along the lines of, “Until I met , I was a little unsure about yoga. But she’s really gotten me into it, and now we practice it together at least a few times a week.”

, She will appreciate it if you show that you’re carefully listening to her stories, opinions, and questions, since this demonstrates that you’ve been sincerely engaged in the conversation and eager to get to know her. Make an effort to smile and nod your head if you agree with or are pleased with what she’s saying, since it can be discouraging to to speak with someone with a blank expression.


To show her that you’ve been attentive to her remarks, try paraphrasing: Mom says: “We have dinner with the neighbors across the street a few times a year, and their cooking is outstanding.” You respond: “Good neighbors and good food, how fortunate!”
If something she says doesn’t make sense to you or is inaudible, instead of bluntly saying, “What do you mean?” or “What did you say?”, try asking for clarification: “Pardon my asking—I’m not sure I heard you correctly—could you say again why you chose to study biology?”

, Make sure your table manners are in top form. Be sure to chew with your mouth closed and not while talking, and put your napkin on your lap once your sit down. Cover your yawns, coughs, and sneezes, saying “Excuse me” afterwards, and thanking anyone who says, “Bless you” or “Gesundheit.” And don't use inappropriate slurs or informal language when speaking with her.


For example, avoid slangy phrases such as “That sucks,” and “That’s cool,” and instead try, “That’s unfortunate,” and “That’s wonderful.”
Be kind with your words. It is not what you say, but how you say it. Always be mindful and speak to others, especially your girlfriend’s mother a place of kindness and compassion.
If there is a concern that she is currently going through in her life, and she chooses to talk about this during your interaction with her, consider a time when you may have experienced a similar situation and connect with how she is feeling. Everyone needs attention, and to feel seen and heard and recognized. Remember this and consider how you might provide this need for attention to your girlfriend’s mother.

, Remember your alcohol tolerance when sharing a drink with her, and avoid the temptation to “have just one more,” even if she insists. If you usually find yourself tipsy after three to four drinks, resist having any more than one. You can always tell her that you’re driving her daughter home, and she’ll respect you for taking care to stay sober.Demonstrate your good judgement by assuring her, “As much as I’d like another drink, I’ll have to pass, since I’m behind the wheel tonight.”

, If Mom has hosted you for a meal at her home, show your appreciation by thanking her warmly and offering to host her at your residence. Mention something that you enjoyed during the gathering, such as a certain dish from the meal, or a memorable story that she told.


For example, you could express how pleased you are by saying, “Mrs. / Ms. Brown, I’m grateful for your generosity in inviting us to share a lunch / dinner with you. It was really a treat.”
To compliment her storytelling, try something to the effect of: ”I’ll always remember the story you told about your aunt Paula’s unusual bridge club,” or “We all had a good laugh listening to your tale about the New York cab driver, didn’t we?”

, If she hosts you for a meal, take charge of cleaning up afterwards. Once everyone has finished eating the main course, offer to clear the plates and utensils from the table. If there is dessert, ask if you can help with serving it.Announce that you’ll be in charge of the dishes with, “Well, I’ll be happy to clear the table and take care of the dishes. It’s the least I can do to thank you for an excellent meal.”

, If you’re dining out, find a moment to ask your waiter for the check before the end of the meal. A good time to do this is when you get up to use the restroom. If she manages to ask for the check before you do, tell her that next time it will be your treat.For example, you can ask the waiter in private, “Could you please hand the bill to me when the time comes?”

, Extend your hand for a handshake, but if she offers a hug at the same time, extend other hand as well and give her a hug. Tell her a simple but enthusiastic goodbye, and express your eagerness to see her again soon.


”Mrs. / Ms. Brown, it was a pleasure meeting you and spending time with you. I hope we’ll be able to get together again sometime very soon! Goodbye.”

Think about where your friendship currently stands.,
Build trust together, even if it is only a little bit.,
Ask a mutual friend for their opinion.,
Avoid talking excessively about past relationships or other crushes.,
Remember that relationships are about more than physical attraction.,
Spend time alone to see if you make a good couple.",How to Go from Friends to Dating1," Do you talk frequently, hang out together in your free time, or simply know each other through other people? There is no “right” answer that means you can successfully transition into a relationship, but you need to think about where you both stand before you decide to go out together. A strong friendship is often the best base for a strong relationship. You know the person well and already enjoy spending time together. Signs you two might be ready to move to the next level include:


Willingness to tell each other secrets, dreams, and thoughts.
Frequent and honest communication, at least 1-2 a week.
Calm, enjoyable conversation whenever you are face to face.
A few hobbies and ideas that you both share and enjoy.;
, Be supportive when they're in vulnerable situations to show that you care and can be a strong, positive presence in their life. If you cannot trust someone with a secret or a problem then you will never trust them with your heart. Building trust takes some time, but there are ways to get the ball rolling:


Share something about yourself – giving trust is the best way to receive it. Talk to them about your family, your history, your dreams or goals, and your occasional worries or insecurities.
Be dependable, on time, and helpful whenever you make a promise., Ask someone you can trust whether they think your friend has mutual feelings for you. Oftentimes an outside perspective can illuminate things that you might ignore or miss thanks to romantic notions. Be specific and honest when asking for advice: saying “Do you think they like anyone?” will not give you the same useful advice as, “Do you think we could be good together.”


Make sure this friend is reliable and won’t spread the news to any other friends before confiding in them.

, You shouldn't avoid talking about your past relationships at all, as this can be a healthy way to get to know someone's romantic preferences and past life. You do not, however, want to constantly complain about your exes or talk about how ""perfect"" you were together, as this can lead someone to think you aren't over your last girl or boyfriend.If your crush is constantly talking about other lovers, crushes, or ex-partners, they may not be ready for a relationship either.

, This is extra important when trying to date friends, as there is much more to dating someone than “a friend who you can make out with.” Relationships aren't just about sex and physical relations. They are a meeting between two people in all aspects - emotional, social, and physical. If you just want a friend you can sleep with then you don’t actually want to date them. Don't start a relationship you won’t commit to.

, One of the most common scenarios is when a crush develops within a larger group of friends. While there is nothing wrong with this, relationships rely on the ability to be alone with someone else, not always in a group. While you don’t have to go on a date, you should try and find time to be alone with someone before deciding they are right to date. Ideas include:


Ask them to help you get drinks, food, etc. for a party.
Sit across or next from them at the dinner table.
Ask them on casual “dates,” like exercising together, checking out a new bar, or helping out with a project/homework."

Ask yourself if you are willing to potentially lose your friendship when asking someone out.,
Use open, romantic body language to signal your attraction.,
Turn up the heat with subtle flirting.,
Ask them out.,
Avoid grand professions of love, opting instead for sincere, respectful comments.,
Accept the answer you are given.",How to Go from Friends to Dating2," Unfortunately, some people will not be able to return to being ""just friends"" after one person makes a move. The attraction gets in the way, one side is thinking of what ""could have been,"" and it becomes awkward to be alone. This does not mean, however, that you should not make a move. You need to be willing to risk a friendship for something more -- but if becoming a couple is important to you than this is a risk worth taking.

, Body language is often the forgotten branch of flirting, but it is a key way to tell someone you are interested. It also helps you see if they feel the same way. While everyone is different, there are a few gestures that universally signal attraction and respect:


Turning shoulders and hips to face each other.
Making clear, consistent eye contact.
Fixing, brushing, or playing with hair and clothing.
Mimicking posture or speech patterns.
Leaning in or close to each other., Before you make a move, you should see if she/he is going to be receptive to a romantic relationship. While you don’t want to go overboard, subtle advances show someone that you are interested in moving to the next level. This is a great way to get them thinking about romance. As you try the following tips, ask yourself how they respond—do they shy away or laugh it off? If so, they may want to stay friends. However, if they respond with similar behavior, make good eye contact, or make romantic gestures of their own, you may have found a match. To start the flirting:


Make eye contact and smile. Smiling is proven to be the most effective flirting technique you have.Break the touch barrier: a simple hand on the shoulder or upper back, brushing someone’s arm, or going for a longer hug (2-3 seconds) are all paramount to signal attraction.
Use genuine compliments to make them feel good. Everyone loves being complimented, and it shows someone that you care. Make your compliments specific for added effect – “You crushed that last math test” instead of “you seem really smart.”

, Sitting and thinking about asking someone out is not only excruciating, it is detrimental to your chances at starting a relationship. Once you are sure you want to take this to the next level, get them alone and go for it. This doesn’t have to be anything grand or romantic; it just has to be honest. Any answer will be better than no answer at all. Remember this as you muster up the courage to ask the question. Pull them aside or ask them on a casual date and say:


“I’ve really enjoyed our friendship, but I want to take things to another level. Would you want to go on a few dates?”
""We're great friends, but I have feelings for you beyond friendship. I would love the chance to get to know you even more on a date.""
Even something as simple as ""Let's go out on a date next Thursday"" can work perfectly.
Except for large tragedies or life-changing events, there is no “perfect time” to ask someone out. Just go for it!

, No matter how you feel, telling someone that ""they are the only one for you"" and that they ""complete you"" will only scare them away by turning the dial from friendship to relationship too quickly. Keep your calm, and be respectful but sincere when you talk. Some things to consider saying are:


""I care about you and our friendship a lot, and I think we could be really good together.""
""Getting to know you has been incredible, and I would love the chance to get to know you even more.""
""You are a great person, and I'm very lucky to call you a friend.

, If they feel the same way, then you're about to start your relationship together. But if they say no it's time to move on and start getting over your feelings. Continually asking them out, begging for another chance, or giving them the cold-shoulder will prevent your friendship from returning.


If you think you can be friends again, you'll still need to spend some time alone. Try not to hang out for several weeks and see what happens when you return. Though you shouldn't expect to be best friends, time can help you get over your feelings and return to friendship.
Know, however, that some people struggle to return to friendship after romance. This is unfortunately a risk you will need to take."
"
Communicate your expectations early in the relationship.,
Go slowly, even if you feel like you’re ready to rush.,
Spend time with your mutual friends.,
Develop hobbies and activities between just the two of you.,
Stay true to who you were when you were just friends.,
Understand that, if the relationship falls apart, you will likely not be able to return to being friends.",How to Go from Friends to Dating3," Dating a friend can be fantastic: you already know each other’s quirks, you have similar friends, and there is no awkward “feeling out” phase. But dating friends can also get awkward if you don’t talk about what you are looking for in the relationship. Do you want someone you can see casually, or are you looking for your soul mate? Do you see things progressing slowly, or are do you want to go “all-in” and see if you are compatible? This conversation, though not easy, needs to happen.Try beginning the conversation with your own needs, stating something like, “I know we’ve been friends for a while, but I am looking for something long-term.”
Follow up with, ""What are you looking for in this relationship?"" ""How do you see things moving forward?""

, Friends often rush over the early parts of the relationship, getting physical with each other before they are technically “dating.” While there is nothing wrong with this, there is a problem if you don’t slow down and talk at some point. Don’t try and hide your intimacy and attraction to each other. Rather, use this opportunity to make your move and say how you feel. Trying to bury a random hook-up or kiss will lead to relationship issues later on when you are both confused about what happened before. If someone is moving too quickly for you, casually remind them that ""Our friendship comes first, we've got plenty of time for everything else.""
Just because you are dating now does not mean you need to spend every hour together. Keep your space and take things slowly.
Keep remembering that a strong friendship makes the base of a strong relationship.

, No one likes it when a couple gets together and disappears from the world, only to reappear holding hands and ignore everyone else from time to time. Not only is this tough for your friends, it puts a strain on your relationship. If you stop dating, you’ll have alienated your core friends, showing them that you only cared about them insofar as you got a date.Make time for group activities, and maintain plans and traditions you had before dating.
While you shouldn’t hide your relationship, you shouldn’t let it affect your other friends. Spend alone time with them and focus on other friends when you are in a large group.
Be discreet – there is no need to tell your friends all of your ""couple’s stories."" They don’t want to hear them and your partner might not want to share them like you do.

, While you shouldn’t ignore your old friends, you also shouldn’t try and keep things the same now that you are dating. You need to find things you love doing together. Talk together and spend time alone to help your relationship grow from friendship into something more. If you only wanted to date someone without putting in the effort to love them, you would have stayed friends.Maintaining a relationship takes time, energy, and work, but the payoff is a close-knit bond that is unique to just you.

, Just because you are dating now does not mean you should change who you are to make them love you more. They fell for who you were when you were still friends. While everyone will go through changes as they build a relationship, becoming someone’s girlfriend or boyfriend is no excuse for a personality shift.


Your friendship should stay intact no matter how romantic you become.Make sure you are comfortable together. If you feel like you need new clothes, new lingo, or new hobbies to make them love you then you might be better off as friends.

, When you get to know someone romantically, it becomes incredibly hard to remove those feelings and return to friendship. Dating someone is an intimate experience, and you will learn things, good and bad, about the person you never knew about. Coupled with any lingering romantic feelings between you two, you have a mixture that makes friendship difficult if not impossible. Remember the great times you shared together and move on, knowing that you both did the best you could to make things work. Ultimately, this is all you can hope for.

Let them do the talking.,
Use active listening.,
Pay attention to the way you frame your responses.,
Bounce their own thoughts back at them.,
Express concern.,
Act immediately on revelations of abuse.",How to Give Good Relationship Advice1," Even when people ask for advice about their relationship, they may simply be looking for your support. Whether or not they need your advice, the first step is listening.Since whomever you’re speaking with knows more about their own relationship than you do, they likely also have an inclination about how to handle whatever it is they’re talking about.
Let them rant a bit. People may be looking more for validation of their feelings, or simply to vocalize their thoughts on their relationship with someone they trust.
State your willingness to listen. If someone brings up their relationship but is hesitating, tell them you’re glad to hear about how they’re feeling.;
, A key aspect of truly listening to someone is refraining from judging their statements. Disallow yourself from diagnosing or analyzing their statements until they’ve finished speaking.To convey that you’re actively listening, and to ensure that you’re understanding the other person clearly, paraphrase and repeat the key points of their dialogue back to them.
Pay attention to your nonverbal cues as well. Maintain eye contact, square your shoulders towards the speaker, and even use supportive touching to convey that you’re there for someone.

, Avoid responses that may come across as judgmental or critical, as this will not be productive - and you may even offend whomever you’re speaking with.Avoid statements such as “You should have _____” or “Why didn’t you _____?”.
Definitely don’t say anything like, “I would have _____ by now!”Even if you mean to be supportive, this may offend the person you’re speaking with.
Instead, start with statements such as “It may help to consider _______” or “I don’t know if this will work for you, but I’ve found that _______.”

, Even if you have some of your own ideas about what the right course of action might be, emphasize points that they’ve said themselves.If there’s a lull before you have something constructive to say, don’t make something up just to say something.
Instead, try something like, “I certainly don’t know the best course to take for you in your relationship, but I’m happy to work through what you’re feeling with you.”
Ask them to expand on certain thoughts that seem significant by saying things like, “What are your thoughts regarding that?” or simply “Say more about that.”

, Don’t use statements that may seem to minimize their feelings or that don’t offer anything constructive.Ensure that they know you’re hearing both what they’re saying about how they’re feeling.


Avoid focusing on the details of a story – you’re not here to gossip, you’re here to help.
Don’t refer to issues as a “phase.”
If they’ve been hurt, recognize that with statements such as, “I imagine that’s really affected how you’re feeling.”

, Some relationships are objectively unhealthy. If someone tells you about any form of abuse that is taking place, tell them that you’re there for them and urge them to get help.Do not allow a friend or loved on accept a lover’s addiction, recurrent affairs, or emotional or physical abuse as “normal.”
If someone seems to be in danger, notify other people who may be able to help them and make a point of being available for them.
There may be more going on then they’re admitting, and providing them to space to recognize and report serious issues is extremely important.

Be on the conservative side.,
Get your boyfriend's opinion about your outfit.,
Wear something you feel good in.,
Use minimal makeup and accessories.",How to Impress Your Boyfriend's Parents1," Avoid wearing anything that shows too much skin, shows your tattoos, or is too tight. You want to look classic, polished, and well put together. Looking sexy may work for a date night with your boyfriend, but it will not impress his parents.


Also dress for the occasion. You wouldn't wear stilettos or dress shoes to a lunch in the park or a family BBQ.Avoid wearing clothing with language or images that may be offensive.;
, Your boyfriend knows his parents better than you do and can help you choose an outfit.Put together a few outfits that show your personal style, but are also parent friendly. Some sample outfits you may consider include:


If you are going somewhere casual, jeans or pants with a blouse works well. Your pants or jeans should not be too tight.You can also add a blazer or a jacket to your outfit as well.
If you need something a little dressier, a simple dress with a modest hemline works. Choose a dress that hits right above your knee or longer.
A skirt and a top are also an option. Again, the skirt should not be too short. You should be able to sit down comfortably.

, Choose an outfit that makes you feel confident. Your clothing should not be a distraction to you or his parents. When you are confident in your looks, you can focus on spending time with him and getting to know his parents.For example, you do not want to sit through dinner and constantly wonder if your bra strap is showing.
If you have any doubts about an item of clothing, go with something else.

, If you wear make up, go for a natural look. Skip the bold lip colors or dramatic eye makeup. Jewelry is fine, but stick to simple items like studs instead of large hoops.


Your jewelry and makeup should not be a distraction.If you want to wear a larger piece of jewelry such as a statement necklace, keep the rest of your jewelry to a minimum.
If you are wearing nail polish, make sure that it is neat and not chipped.

Be sure your advice is desired before offering it.,
Remind your friend or loved one that most relationships problems are universal.,
Ensure that any suggestions you make are simple, operable, and safe.,
Tell them to write their partner an “I appreciate…” list.,
Remind them that it really is the little things.,
Don’t get caught up on abstractions.",How to Give Good Relationship Advice2," Sometimes, people simply don’t know what to do and are actively looking for guidance. Still, talking with them might allow them to formulate ideas of their own.The point is, always be sure someone wants advice on their relationship before blurting your thoughts out.


One way to avoid giving distracting or unnecessary advice is to ask questions.
A great one to start with is, “Do you have any ideas about how to address _______?”

, Concerns about sex, communication, and financial decision-making are especially common. Though simply a statement of fact, this point can provide comfort in knowing that other people in other relationships go through the same thing., A great piece of advice is a gentle suggestion that they communicate in a new, potentially more clear way with their partner.Offer to role play with them, even, and begin with sentences like, “I wanted to talk with you about what each of our expectations and contributions are regarding ________.”
Recommend the use of “I” statements, both as a method of communicating, and reflecting.
A classic reminder to employ is “If I don’t speak up, I can’t expect other people to know what I want.”

, In the interest of rekindling affection and admiration, have them sit down and write down a few things they appreciate about their partner.Tell them to include examples of how their partner demonstrates the characteristics on the list.
Encourage your friend or loved one to share the list with their partner. This might help kick-start a positive and loving conversation, during which others important discussions can happen too.

, In a committed relationship, simple, everyday interactions matter immensely. If there are concerns about romance dwindling, recommend a few tips to help lovers stay in tune with one another.Though it may seem silly, point out that couple who store up positive sentiments towards one another will be more ready to deal with incidences of stress or conflict.
Remind them to tell their partner that they value their relationship, especially in unexpected moments.

, People often worry about how and whether they or their partner has changed, or might be changing, or will change. Remind your friend or loved one that people do grow and change, and that they grow and change together.Remind your friend or loved one, “You’re a team; you and your partner should change and grow together!”
Advocate for cooperative decision-making and sharing of common ground.
Neither side of a relationship should control everything; encourage your friend or loved one to pursue the middle ground whenever possible.

Recommend something for them to read.,
Make sure they avoid low quality, problematic advice from “women’s” magazines.,
Make sure they aren’t reading “men’s” magazines either.",How to Give Good Relationship Advice3," Fortunately, there are professionals out there who study relationships, and written a plethora of advice on the topic.Arriving at a realization via reading may simple feel better than receiving a lecture, even from a trusted confidant.
Reading some objective advice may help your friend feel empowered and confident by arriving at their own determinations about how to handle relationships woes.
Doing some reading of your own may help you give them advice, and find something that particularly pertains to their situation – even if they don’t recognize it yet.

, Academic studies have examined the information and advice on relationships and sexuality included in such magazines and have come to some startling findings.Magazine advice columns consistently regurgitate assumptions and stereotypes that do not reflect the diversity of the types of relationships people have.
In particular, avoid publications such as Cosmopolitan, that have repeatedly indicated that women are responsible for changing men, as well as themselves, in order to improve and maintain their relationship.

, Most magazines geared towards “men” also include relationship advice featurettes. Do not allow this potentially harmful information to dictate decisions about relationships.Again, messages geared towards one specific gender are often consistent with stereotypical, sometimes problematic assumptions about gender socialization.
In “men’s” magazines, advice often revolves around a predictable obsession with reinforcing male masculinity.
Be wary of relationship advice that makes sex a top priority. Often, this sort of advice is actually contrary to advice on how to form meaningful intimate relationships.

Do some research on his parents.,
Bring a gift.,
Greet his parents with a smile.,
Be polite.",How to Impress Your Boyfriend's Parents2," Ask your boyfriend some questions about his parents. What is their sense of humor like? Are there any topics that are off limits? What books, movies, or television shows do they like? What are their hobbies?Think of some questions you can ask based on your research. This will help the conversation flow and show that you are really interested in getting to know them.

, Don't show up to the meeting empty handed. A gift says that you appreciate being invited and that you are serious about their son. It also shows that you are a thoughtful person.The gift does not need to be large or expensive. Good gifts include:Fresh flowers in a small vase
A bottle of wine (if you are old enough)
A box of chocolates
A thank-you card

, When you meet his parents, smile and address them as Mr. and Mrs. Do not call his parents by their first name unless you are instructed to do so. This shows that you are respectful and have good manners.


Give his parents a hug or a handshake when you meet them. Follow his parents' lead during the greeting. If they extend their arms, go in for a hug.
Always show up on time. If you are running late, call and let them know.

, Practice good manners when you are around his parents. Say ""please"" and ""thank you."" Do not interrupt when someone else is talking. Give genuine compliments. If you like the food that was prepared or his mom's earrings, say so.Do not compliment just to flatter his parents and get on their good side. You do not want to be fake.
Let his parents know that you are happy to meet them and you appreciate their time/hospitality/kindness.Thank them for having you in their house, cooking you dinner, etc.You may say, ""Thanks for everything. It was great meeting you. I hope to see you soon!""

Ask questions.,
Offer your help.,
Be yourself.,
Avoid controversial topics.,
Let them know how much you enjoy their son.",How to Impress Your Boyfriend's Parents3," His parents will ask you questions because they are trying to get to know you. However, the conversation should not be all about you. You need to show them that you are interested in them. If you did your homework, you should already have some questions that you can ask.For example, if you know his mother loves gardening, ask her about her plans for the next planting season. You may say, ""___ told me that you love gardening, what do you plan to plant next season?""
You can also ask them about their profession. You may say, ""Mr. ___, ___ said that you are a dentist. How did you become interested in that?""

, If you are having dinner at his home, offer to help wash the dishes or clear the table. Ask if there is anything that you can do. This shows that you are humbleand a team player.This may also give you some one-on-one time with one of his parents as well.


You can simply say, ""Mrs. ___, let me help you with those dishes."" You could also say, ""Do you need any help in the kitchen?""
Have a positive attitude when you help. If you hate washing dishes, your boyfriend's parents do not need to know that.
Never complain or whine in front of his parents.

, Your boyfriend likes you for the person you are and is excited for you to meet his parents. Show his parents the same person that he fell for. If you try too hard to impress his parents, they will see right through you. You want to come across as a genuine person.If they are talking about something that you don't know about, listen and ask some questions instead of pretending like you are familiar with the topic.
Be honest when you talk to them. If your grades aren't that good and they ask you how school is going, you may say, ""I didn't do well last grading period, but I'm working really hard now,"" instead of lying and saying that you are a straight A student.

, Try not bring up things such as politics and religion. These topics are very personal and can lead to heated discussions. It is easier to steer clear and not worry about offending anyone or becoming offended.If any of these topics come up, do more listening instead of talking. Wait until you know his family better before you discuss these topics.
Also stay out of any family feuds or issues that are brought up.Do not choose a side and remain quiet.

, Do not forget about your boyfriend while you are trying to impress his parents. His parents are interested in seeing how the two of you interact as well.Compliment him and laugh at his jokes.


You could say, ""I have really enjoyed meeting you guys. I can see where ___ gets his manners/sense of humor from.""
Do not criticize him in front of his parents. Even if you tease him as a joke, his parents might not find it funny.
Don't be too touchy-feely in front of his parents. His parents do not want to see that.Some hand-holding may be fine, but talk to your boyfriend about this before the meeting.

The more advanced programs allow you to do a custom scan.


Whichever scanning program you choose, make sure it scans your registry objects. This is where you will first see problems with a hacker. Memory, startup, filesystem, and heuristic areas are also important in your scan.;
, Some have system pre-requisites, be sure that you use one that matches with your computer and system model. The pre-requisites will be listed before you download or install anything. If your computer doesn’t recognize the program, you’ve likely chosen one that doesn’t match the pre-requisites.Find your program either by inserting the disk and navigating to your computer menu or by going into your downloads and double clicking on the program.

Avoid being immediately defensive.,
Respond to their concerns with respect.",How to Get Your Parents to Like Your Boyfriend1," Instead of hiding the fact that you’re seeing someone, discuss with your parents about your boyfriend when the relationship becomes more serious. Tell them more about him, and how long you’ve been dating. Open communication with your parents will likely feel better and healthier for you in the long run.
If you are fearful that they will disapprove, be calm and polite.
Focus on showing them why he is a good fit for you, and what you like about him. Explain how your relationship will not interfere with your work, life, or school.;
, While hearing that they don’t like your boyfriend may be tough, give them a chance to explain themselves. Have them provide clarity about why he’s a bad fit for you. While you may not like what your parents have to say, sometimes it comes from a place of wisdom.Ask them why they have an issue with your boyfriend.
Are they worried that your boyfriend doesn’t respect you? Are they concerned about the way he talks to you? Do they think that he’s controlling? If this is the case, these may be serious concerns to consider.

, While you may want to talk back to your parents, and provide criticism about their choices, this will not help you get any closer to having your parents like your boyfriend. Being overly defensive will likely make them even less approving of your relationship with him.Avoid putting your parents down or stating that their views are wrong.
Tell them that you love them. Explain that you came to them for support rather than judgment.
Focus on being calm even if they make you upset.

, Your parents or family history may be rooted in certain traditions or norms. It may seem like they are outdated in their views or don’t understand your perspective. While there may be differences, focus on keeping a positive relationship with them. Even if you and your parents disagree, that doesn’t mean you should be rude and disrespectful of their concerns.
If you are kind, mature, and respectful, they are more likely to take your relationship seriously, and try to find the positives in your boyfriend.

If your parents say they don’t want to see him, don’t assume that they will always act that way. Your parents may feel initial shock or worry when meeting a new boyfriend of yours. It may simply take time for them to feel more comfortable.
Make your boyfriend feel welcome at your home or in your life. Provide your boyfriend with reassurance that your parents may change their minds with time.

"
Speak to them honestly about dating.,
Get their perspective and understand their values on dating and love.,
Develop solutions to change their status of disapproval.,
Explain who and why you want to date.,
Refrain from yelling or getting emotional.,
Revisit the issue at a later date.",How to Get Your Parents to Let You Date Someone1," The first thing to do is to talk to your parents about dating, and be honest and receptive during the talk. Never start this conversation after a fight, or after they tell you that you can’t date. You want to get their position on the issue, and their level of opposition to dating.


Bring it up at a random time so they won’t become suspicious of your questions.
Listen, and don’t try to interject unless they ask you a question.
You can start the conversation by saying something like ""When did you start dating?"" or ""How did you meet dad?"";
, You parents grew up in a different generation, so dating when they were your age was much different.For that reason, you should get their perspective on dating even if you think it’s old fashioned and you don’t agree.


The more that you understand why your parents are opposed to dating, the more you’ll understand ways to change their mind or ease their concerns.Sometimes your parents don’t want you to date because of your cultural background or religious reasons. In these cases, it may be harder to change their mind.Saying things like “times have changed” may not be the best way to persuade your parents.

, Once you understand their perspective, it’s time to think of solutions to change their mind. Write down the reasons why you parents don’t want to date and prove them wrong. If they say you are too irresponsible, take up more responsibilities around the house.


Write down things that you parents want you to do in order to date and make sure to put effort towards them. If you really want to date, you’ll do what it takes.
If dating is dominating your mind and taking you away from your responsibilities, try to get better at a hobby or sport to sharpen your focus.
Don't talk about how you will change, show your parents through your actions.

, Sometimes parents distrust other people, not you, so it’s important to talk to your parents about who you want to date.

Highlight the positives about the person, like any sports or activities they are participating in, and explain what you have in common. Always stay away from the negative things, and make sure the reasons you want to date them are genuine.

You can bring the person up before you tell your parents you want to date them. Say something like ""There's a person at school named X and they are top of the class.""
The more you talk about your relationship or your desire to date, the more your parents will want to be involved in a positive way.Things that you might find cool about the person are the same things you parents might disapprove of, so it’s important to understand what they want to hear.
If the person you are dating is good in school, this is a huge plus for most parents.

, Yelling at your parents is never going to get them to change their mind about dating, and can actually damage your chances of ever dating while you live with them.Never get in fights about their views on you dating, just remain calm and try to change their minds. If the issue is getting heated, and if you feel like an argument is brewing, just drop it before it gets out of hand.


Accept their decision and change the subject if you feel the conversation is getting negative or you are getting emotional.
Don't walk away in the middle of a fight or ignore you parents. That shows immaturity. Instead try to resolve the issue but respect their opinion at all times.
Say ""I understand your perspective but I don't agree. I love you, so I'll do what you say, but I'd like to talk about it later when I'm not so emotional please.""
You won’t change your parent’s minds in one conversation, it may take a while for them to come around.
Don’t ever act snide or sarcastic with you parents because it will damage your chances of them saying yes in the future.

, Sometimes parents just need time before they get used to the idea that their child is old enough to date someone.If you can show them that you are ready for dating by fulfilling some of their expectations, this will translate into them treating you more like an adult. Wait a couple of weeks or a month, and then revisit the issue once they have had time to think about your side of things.


You can start the conversation by saying ""I know you told me you disapprove of dating in the past, but I've been taking care of all my responsibilities and I want to spend time with this person. You may not think it's important but it's really affecting me emotionally and I think I'm emotionally mature enough to start.""
Don’t ask them or talk about it every day.

"
"
Show them that you are mature.,
Help more around the house.,
Be open and honest at all times.,
Accept their decisions and try to compromise with them.",How to Get Your Parents to Let You Date Someone2," Dating someone requires maturity, and is one of the main reasons many parents don’t want their children to date. Making mistakes or being immature or careless in a relationship can have real, long-lasting consequences. Maturity means taking care of your responsibilities without being asked or reminded and making responsible decisions.


A major reason parents don’t want kids to date is because they are doing poorly in school.
The more that you show you can handle your life and your responsibilities, the more you parents will think you can handle dating someone.
Maturity also means not arguing or bickering with you parents constantly. Try to go with the flow and make life easy for both of you.

, It might seem unrelated, but sometimes parents are just stressed and need more help around the house. Take the initiative at home to help the family. Do all your chores without being asked to do them, and ask your parents if they need help. The more you get on their good side, the more they’re likely to let you date.


Go beyond the chores. Help your parents out with stuff that takes up their time. If you can gain their respect, they will start to open up about dating.
Surprising your parents by taking initiative will always make them happier and possibly more receptive about dating.

, Another main culprit to why some parents don’t want their children to date is a betrayal of trust that has taken place prior. If you’ve went behind your parent’s back before, they can’t trust you won’t do it again. This specifically applies to sex, and the potential of STIs or an unplanned pregnancy.The more open and honest you are with your parents, even if they disapprove, the more they will respect you and will want to be involved in a positive way with your relationships.


Apologize about lying the first time, and tell them that you understand why it was wrong. Convince them by consistently telling the truth even if it doesn't work in your favor because it will show them that you won't hide things from them.
Don’t go against them and date behind their back, because it could have bad repercussions down the line and they may restrict you from dating for an even longer time.
Sometimes the best way to build trust is to tell your parents something that you did that they will disapprove of. If you show that you’re honest even when it looks bad, they’ll start to think that you’ll always be honest with them.
It might be hard to keep truthful if you parents punish you every time you do something wrong, but it’s the only way to build their trust.

, Ultimately you live under your parents roof and they provide you with the food and clothing you have, so you need to respect their final decision. If you’ve taken all the steps to win their trust and understand them, and they still don’t want you to date, try to compromise with them. Things like agreeing not to date for the next year, getting better grades, or not getting into trouble may be a compromise that could open the doors for dating for you.


There is usually a good reason your parents don’t want you to date, so don’t dismiss their opinions immediately.
Be honest with yourself about dating. Even though you may really like a person, it doesn’t mean you are ready to date."
"
Make sure they’re the right person.,
Bring the person around as a friend and let them get to know them.,
Introduce their parents to your parents.,
Explain the situation to the person you want to date.",How to Get Your Parents to Let You Date Someone3," Before you introduce your potential significant other to your parents, you should ask yourself if this person is good enough. If you’re scared they might embarrass you, maybe you should re-think dating this person in the first place.


If your parents don’t want you to date and your date leaves a negative impression, it may hurt your chances in the future.
Think about how this person acts around older people and teachers and you can assume the behavior may be similar.

, A good way to introduce the person you want to date to your parents is by introducing them first as a friend. This will make it so that your parents don’t have immediate bias for the person.


If you get in trouble with your “friend” then your parents may get a negative impression and restrict you from dating them.
Let your parents know they are coming beforehand to avoid an awkward situation.

, One way to alleviate the stress that your parents may have with dating is by introducing them to your date’s parents. If they speak to one another they may develop a friendship and a positive impression of the person you’re trying to date.


Some parents look for a strong family behind anyone you’re dating. If this is the case, this approach may win them over.
You can do this at a public sporting event or at a show.

, If you really want to date someone but your parents won’t let you, you should let that person know. That way they won’t take anything personally, but also so that they know to be on their best behavior when they meet them.


You can say ""I really like you and want to date you, but I can't constantly fight with my parents so please act respectful and try to make a good impression when you meet them.""
If you understand their perspective, you can relay that onto your date and hopefully they will act appropriate and likable.

Reflect deeply.,
Consider the consequences.,
Choose your words carefully.,
Find a time to talk.,
Discuss your concerns.,
Don't tell your friend to break up.,
Spend time to with your friend.,
Keep your judgements out of the conversation.,
Provide healthy distractions.,
Suggest counseling.",How to Get Your Friend to Leave His Girlfriend," Take some time for deep reflection about why you want to encourage your friend to leave his girlfriend. You need to have incredibly good reasons for wanting this.


Who your friends date is a choice for your friends to make, not you. However much you may dislike someone a friend chooses to date, in most cases, you shouldn't interfere.So, think deeply about what is motivating you.
Is it jealousy? If this is the case then you need to address this with yourself. This is not a good reason to encourage a breakup. Likewise, attraction you may feel toward him or his girlfriend is never a good reason to promote a breakup.
Is it because you honestly believe this girlfriend is bad for your friend? There is such thing as a bad relationship. If your friend's girlfriend is engaging in behaviors such as dangerous drug use, cheating, treating your friend as an inferior, or verbally or physically abusing him, these might be reasons to get involved.Simply not liking her attitude, personality, or style isn't sufficient.;
, Be aware that you will be hurting someone you care about if you bring this up. Remind yourself that the world doesn't revolve around you.


Consider what could happen if your friend does break up with his girlfriend because of your interference. Is your friend going to appreciate this meddling? Is the friendship going to withstand this revelation of yours that the two are unsuited?

, If you decide you need to intervene, think carefully about what you want to say. This is a very delicate situation, so you should choose your words carefully.

, Let your friend know you'd like a private chat about something important and personal. This will ensure that the two of you can talk without his girlfriend's presence.

, Stick the facts and tell your friend, honestly and compassionately, why you are concerned about the relationship.Examples of things you might raise include:


That you have seen his girlfriend with another lover during the time your friend and she have been dating. Be sure you know what you saw and that she's not just catching up with friends she's very close to.
You've had to listen to her put your friend down or treat him as lesser than her.
You've seen her taking drugs and you know your friend doesn't like this habit. Remember, she may need help, not ostracizing. Be compassionate.
You've observed her abusing your friend, either emotionally or physically.

, Once you have shared your concerns with your friend, it is up to him to decide what to do with the information.This is not a good time to share your judgements about the girlfriend's character, personality, or other traits. Your judgements will probably be unwelcome. Tell your friend how great he is, not how terrible you think his girlfriend is.It is fine to express feelings of concern for your friend, and to let him know you are there for him in this difficult time. However, unless you have real concerns for his safety (the kind that would lead you to call the police), your intervention should stop here., If your friend breaks up with his girlfriend as a result of what you've shared with him, be there for your friend after the breakup. Spend time together and listen to his troubles.Encourage your friend to talk, and listen patiently. Be aware that he may experience sadness, anger, and a variety of other chaotically changing moods as he works through his feelings., Even after your friend decides to break up with his girlfriend, it is best to avoid excessive criticism of her, or to give him advice about what to do or how to feel.What your friend needs now is someone who will listen as he processes his feelings. He will probably be dealing with conflicting and difficult feelings about his ex, and your judgements may only make matters worse.

, Encourage your friend to engage in activities that will help take his mind off of his ex.Take your friend to a movie, a play or concert. Go on a hike or camping trip. Go shopping. Play video games. Whatever your friend enjoys, take some time to do it with him.
Discourage excessive use of drugs or alcohol during this time. These may temporarily dull the pain, but may make matters worse in the long run., The feelings that result from a difficult breakup are often best dealt with by a mental health professional.This is doubly so if your friend has been mentally, emotionally, or physically abused.If your friend doesn't seem to be healing or can't find any joy in life, even after some time has passed, offer to help him find a therapist.

Be yourself.,
Get some background information before meeting your boyfriend's sister.,
Think about how you're going to use this information.,
Turn your boyfriend into an ally of both of you.,
Start off being polite, interested and engaging.,
Ask for her opinion or advice on something.,
Be friendly and open to sharing a little bit about yourself.,
Try to talk to her in as neutral a setting as possible.,
Do not be overly touchy with your boyfriend.,
Deal with the challenges if they arise.,
Look for a middle way.,
Keep is short and sweet.",How to Get Along with Your Boyfriend's Sister," It's near impossible for anyone to give you a fair shake if you are being fake, trying to pretend to like the things the sister likes when it's clear you're as different as night and day. While it's difficult to act naturally at first, affecting a completely different personality from the beginning is immature and misleading.;
, Rope your boyfriend into helping you out. Ask him about her favourite books, movies, TV shows, etc. Ask what she likes to do, for example: Does she like to ski, take pictures, shop - what? What kind of music does she listen to? Has she got any unusual hobbies? Think of this as research. It's always nice if you can strike up a conversation about something you're already well aware that she has interest in. This will tell her that you bothered to ask her brother about her, and therefore that you are interested in getting to know her.

, Have you got anything in common with her? If you have, aim to bring her into a conversation about it. For example, if you both like the same band, you could say, ""Did you see their gig last month? What did you think of it?"".

, Tell your boyfriend that you're nervous about meeting his sister and that you don't want to cause her to feel that you're intruding or impacting their special relationship in any way. It will give him a chance to reassure you about her and to perhaps suggest some smart tactics for dealing with any particular quirks, preferences or attitudes she might present to you.


Ask him about how his sister has been toward former girlfriends. You might be able to build up a picture of her prior behavior to help you.

, Assume the best and expect that things will go well. They may not but you can remain the better person by not stooping to any level of negativity she might wish to introduce.

, Another example: If she's an avid DIYer, ask, 'I've been thinking about painting my living room, but I'm not sure whether I could just paint over my wallpaper or whether I'll have to strip it. What do you think?'

, No one wants to hear the unabridged version of your life; however, by being open and light you are encouraging the same in return. Even if the two of you hit it off completely, don't lose control and start pouring out everything to her. You risk saying something you didn't want known this early; and furthermore, you will have less to say on the next visit!

, Having his whole family around her could make it feel like a ""me against all of them"" situation. Can you invite her out somewhere?

, No one, especially the family, needs to see displays of your physical interaction. She will feel uncomfortable and possibly resentful, because it will seem as though you are attempting to control his attention. Once you leave, you can do whatever you like.

, If you like her, that's great; however, if you sense that there is tension, do your best to remove yourself from the situation and calmly discuss it with your boyfriend. Make sure that you do not make it sound as though you are blaming his sister. See if he has any explanation for her behavior.

, If she doesn't start showing any signs of accepting you, you need to find some sort of middle-ground or understanding with your boyfriend as to how to handle things. Inform him that you will defend yourself if needed but you won't be provoking anything. It doesn't do to be a doormat just because she's of his family––once that's established, it'll never stop.

, If the two of you have not hit it off, whenever you see her, be friendly but brief. There's nothing wrong with being civil. Not everyone is going to be your best friend; however, do your best to always keep your manners at the forefront. Who knows? In time, the two of you may improve your relationship, but keep in mind that she's known him longer, he already loves her and blood/familial bond is typically thicker than water. Tread with care.

Keep the first interactions simple.,

Establish consistent rules.",How to Get Along With a Significant Other's Children," When first meeting with your significant other’s children, you should keep the meetings short and simple. Pick a friendly and manageable setting for the first meeting. This can be a restaurant the children like or even a quick meeting at the park. Avoid long dinners or all day events by keeping it short.A weekend getaway for a first meeting is not a good idea. Stick to a set manageable time, like an hour or two, or even a short hello, and gradually increase how often the children spend time with you. This helps the children ease into meeting you and getting used to you.
Try asking the children about their favorite subjects in school, hobbies, favorite toys, activities they like to do, etc. For example, you can say something like, “What is your favorite thing about school?” Or, “What do you like to do for fun?”
Try not to talk too much about yourself. Instead, focus on asking questions and showing your significant other’s children that you find them interesting. You can do this by listening carefully and asking follow up questions to keep them talking. For example, if one of the children says she likes to play soccer, try saying something like, “That’s cool! What position do you play?” or “What do you like best about playing soccer?”;
, Though you may instantly feel affection for your significant other’s children, the reverse may not be true. Relationships need time to grow, and this is especially true for stepparent/stepchild relationships. Understand that the kids will take time to look at you as an authority figure or a figure they love. Try to be patient as the relationship develops. Keep being a caring, loving figure in the children’s life while you let the relationship develop at a natural pace.Ask the children about what is new in their lives since you last saw them. For example, you can say something like, “How was school this week?” Or, “What’s new with you?” This will show the children that you are interested in their lives.
Follow up when the children tell you about things they are worried or excited about. For example, if one of the children says she is anxious about a big test, ask her about it the next time you see her. Try saying something like, “How was your math test?” This will show that you are paying attention to what they tell you and you care about what happens to them.

, One way to build a relationship between you and the children is to do activities with the children that they enjoy. Ask the children what they like to do and offer to do it with them. If you really enjoy an activity, offer to let the children come with you or teach them how to do your hobby.For example, if the children love playing video games, offer to play video games with them. If they like sports, go to the park and throw some balls around or shoot some hoops. Take the children shopping if they love fashion or go to a comic book store with them.
If you love tennis, teach them how to play. If you love to cook, teach the kids your favorite recipe.

, Developing a relationship with the child will take time. You will have to build trust between you and the children. To do this, start by listening to the children and remembering things they say. Take an interest in the children and their interests. This will help show the children that you care about them.If the children talk to you about private issues they don’t feel comfortable going to their parents about, keep it private. This only applies as long as the information doesn’t endanger the children or anyone else.

, Many times, it may seem to the children that you are stealing their mom or dad because you are spending a lot of time with them. The children may not be used to having you around doing things their other parent used to do. Make sure that you make time for your significant other to spend time and do things with the children without you around. This will help them to feel more secure and view you less as a threat.For example, if your significant other only sees their children every other weekend or once a month, the children may need quality time with their parent. Letting the children and your significant other spend time together alone may help your relationship with the children more than always trying to spend time with them.Just as important, make sure that you are not resentful or angry that your significant other needs to spend quality time with their kids without you sometimes. Allowing them this time helps keep the children from thinking that you are taking away their parent.

, If you are having trouble with your significant other’s children disrespecting you or treating you badly, then you should discuss it with your significant other. They are the biological parent and should not allow their kids to disrespect you or fail to make any efforts toward accepting you. Sometimes the words of their parent can intervene and help mitigate the problems.If you have any problems early on, do not act like the disciplinarian but ask your partner to intervene on your behalf.

, Getting your significant other’s children to accept you might be challenging. For the children, the situation can be scary, confusing, and hurtful. They might not feel ready to develop a relationship with you just yet. Remember, the children have dealt with a divorce or a death, they may have moved from their home or changed schools, and they may have had to lose friends or even pets along with these changes.Be patient and understanding with the children. Try to put yourself into their shoes and think about how you might feel as a result of all of these changes.

, Sometimes, the children may not be resistant to the idea of you because of anything that you have done. Instead, the kids may be holding on to the hope that their parents are going to get back together. When you enter into the family, you become a reminder that the parents will not get back together. Allow the children time to work through the hurt and grief that their parents will never reunite.This doesn’t just happen with young kids. Many older kids keep hoping that their parents will one day get back together.

, Though you may now be in a parental role because of your relationship with your significant other, this does not mean you should try to replace the children’s birth parent. You are serving a new role for the children, as a third (or fourth) loving adult figure.Don’t tell the children that you are their mother or father. This can cause problems in your relationship if they feel you are trying to take the place of their birth parent.
Some kids may feel guilty when they start to feel love or affection for you. They may start to think that their feelings for you mean that they no longer love their birth parent. Help them to understand that they can love both of you because you are not their birth parent and are not trying to take that role. Help them learn that you have a different role in their life.

, No matter the age of your significant other’s children, they will be able to tell if you are sincere or not. Don’t try to be fake or overly enthusiastic to get them to like you. If you need time to get used to the kids or the situation, then give yourself time. Don’t be rude to the children, but don’t be fake or insincere either. That might cause more harm in the long run.Instead of being insincere with fake affection or showing fake enthusiasm, treat the children like someone you are getting to know. If the children are adults, then treat them like you would any adult you are learning about and trying to form a relationship with.
If the children are younger, talk to them like a person instead of talking down to them. Fake, condescending tones or conversations may do harm to your relationship. For example, don’t use baby talk or change the tone of your voice when you talk to the children.

, Sometimes, you may accidentally cause problems between your significant other and the children. Avoid trying to cause problems between them. If you have concerns about the way things are with your significant other and the children, or you have concerns about the parenting style, talk to your significant other separately to try and come up with a healthy solution.For example, you do not want to force your significant other to choose between you and their kids, because this is an impossible choice - or a choice you may not be happy with if the significant other chooses the children.
You also do not want to try and turn your significant other against the other birth parent. This may cause problems between your significant other and the children.

, You may be tempted to get the children to like you by any means necessary. This means you may decide to try and be the children’s friend or act like the cool sibling. Refrain from doing this. Though you are not their birth parent, you are still an adult figure in their life. You will have to enforce discipline and act as an adult.You can enjoy things they like and spend time with them. But remember to keep it on a caring adult-child level, not as a best friend.
Refrain from engaging in harmful activities with them to get them to like you, like lying or covering up for them or condoning inappropriate behavior behind your significant other’s back.
Even if the children are adults, you should never try to become best friends with them. This could cause problems with the overall family dynamic.

, Never talk badly or disrespect the children’s other birth parent. No matter what your feelings are about the other birth parent, talking badly about them will more than likely lead to problems between you and the children, and probably problems between you and the birth parent. Instead, be positive and supportive of the relationship between the children and the other birth parent.


Even if you are having trouble with the other birth parent in your new relationship, leave the children out of the problems and keep it just between the adults. Never make it seem like you're a threat to the other parent.
Make certain the children understand that you are not trying to replace their birth parent or take the place of the birth parent. Encourage the children to talk about their birth parent or spend time with them.

, If you want respect from the children, you should return the same respect to the children. This means you should respect the feelings, opinions, and interests of the children. If the children don’t like you or the situation right now, back off and try to let the relationship grow naturally. Don’t try to force the children to do anything against their will. Remember, no matter the age, the children are people with feelings, too.Make sure you respect each child’s privacy. Don’t go snooping in their rooms, go through their stuff, or listen in on their phone calls.

, If you are living with your significant other, then you may be tempted to treat the children as special guests and go all out when they come to visit. This may cause a separation between you and the children, or make the children feel like outsiders. Instead, treat the children like normal members of the family.Taking the children to special places every time you are together never allows the children a chance to get used to the new family. Letting them experience everyday situations can help them to get used to the new family arrangement.Include the children in family discussions and major decisions that affect the entire family.
Help the children with their schoolwork, go to their school performances or sports games, and even attend parent-teacher conferences.

, Oftentimes, when children come from homes where the parents are no longer together, they feel undervalued or invisible. Help your significant other create a family dynamic where the child is part of the family. Encourage the child to voice their opinions honestly and openly. Let them know that you are willing to look at things from their perspective and consider their ideas and opinions.Help the children feel appreciated. Give them praise and encouragement when they do things for the family or offer suggestions.
Provide a safe, loving environment for the children. The children need to feel safe and secure, and creating a safe, open environment can help them feel at ease in their new home.

, You and your significant other need to establish ground rules for the children and the house. You need to make sure you give the children love and affection, but also set boundaries and guidelines that are consistently enforced. This gives them a routine and stability that will help them adjust to their new life and know what to expect.Sit down with the children and your significant other and make the rules clear. Encourage the children to have a say in the rules and expectations of the house. This can help the children feel like they have a voice and are not being controlled or overshadowed by you.For example, don’t change the rules or boundaries without discussing it with the children. Also refrain from rewarding the children out of guilt.

, Find a night the two of you can set aside time for each other and stick to it. Hold him accountable for that night every week. You don't have to do anything fancy or expensive, but let him know you want the relationship to be a priority., Take walks. Go out to eat. Try as many different things as you can until you find a few which you both enjoy. Try thinking back to when you first met him and what activities you did.


Be creative and try new things to stimulate your relationship. Offer to do things you know he will like, and encourage him to do the same for you., Laughter can help bring people together, especially in a tense situation. When spending time together, try watching a funny movie, or go to a comedy club. You could even try telling jokes to each other. Don't underestimate the power of laughter.Another way to start laughter is through tickling. Tickling is a show of affection and a sign of play. It's a great example of the give-and-take in relationships.Tickling also has the added benefit of triggering sexual excitement in adults., Accept that your boyfriend may want to do things you don't enjoy. Be mindful of his needs. If he enjoys watching television, and you enjoy going out, make plans to watch a movie one night and go out the next.This also applies to arguments. If you find that a fight is brewing, take time to consider the situation. Don't focus on who will ""win"" the argument. The goal is to preserve the relationship. Remember the phrase ""agree to disagree."", You don't have to change who you are to fit in, just be cheerful and positive. Likewise, invite your man out to spend time with your friends.


In doing this, be sure to respect each other's boundaries. Don't assume you will always get invited to hang out with his friends. At the same time, don't feel pressured to invite him everywhere you go.

, Give your boyfriend space and allow him his independence. Even though the goal here is to get your boyfriend to spend more time with you, do not smother him. This will likely make him pull further away.Do not demand change. Be supportive and come to terms with the fact that your boyfriend has other friends.Don't play games with him. Don't try to ""get him back"" by making yourself less available. Instigating drama will only make things worse., People love confidence. It is a desirable trait in a mate. While you are dealing with a neglectful partner, don't let it get you down. Treat yourself right and stay confident in who you are.If you exude confidence, chances are your partner will take notice and want to spend more time with you.Wear clothes that make you feel sexy. If you've always wondered what you would look like with a new hair color, try dyeing it. Do these things for yourself. It's important that you feel good about you., When your boyfriend wants to hang out without you, and he will, find fun ways to occupy your time.


Hang out with your friends, or take up a hobby you've always found interesting.

, Not only will exercise keep you in shape, it will boost your mood and help reduce stress.Even if things are going well in your relationship, it is important to take care of your body.

, The best way to attract people (even your boyfriend) is to make sure you are happy with yourself. A positive attitude is a surefire way to get your boyfriend to notice you. Happiness is contagious.Try meditating to help clear your mind and promote a positive attitude.

Discover his interests.,
Compliment him.,
Don’t insult or criticize him.",How to Get Along with Your Boyfriend's Best Friend1," You can make positive connections with your boyfriend’s friend by getting to know him. Try to find things you can connect over, such as shared interests, and use these connections to create a bond that is unique to your relationship with him. Ask him what he likes to do on the weekend, or what his favorite movie genre or sport is. You can get to know him on a deeper level by finding out what he studied in college, and why.After you learn some of your boyfriend’s best friend’s interests, make an effort to include him when you and your boyfriend do things he enjoys.


You can ask, “What’s your favorite sport?” “What’s your favorite position to play in the sport?” and “Did you see the game over the weekend?”
You can also ask, “What's your favorite subject in school?” Once they have replied, you can ask, “How did you become interested in the subject?” and “What do you find most fascinating about the subject?”
You might even try spending some time alone with your boyfriend's best friend. Ask him to lunch or to help you pick out something for your boyfriend.;
, Making someone feel less important will only bring tension and frustration into the relationship between you and the other person. Instead, make him feel good about himself by offering sincere praise and appreciation. You can either compliment him on specific past achievements, highlight the great work he’s doing, or let him know that you are having an enjoyable time hanging out.You can say, “Jason (your boyfriend) told me that that you practiced every day in order to get the sports scholarship. I really admire your work ethic and motivation.”

, Try to hold back any criticisms or insults when interacting with your boyfriend’s friend. Disapproving of and judging his actions will only create distrust between you and him. Instead, decline to make a comment, or turn it into something more positive.For example, if he is bragging about his drunkenness and sexual liaisons Saturday night, try not to degrade him by calling him a pig or disgusting. Instead, steer the conversation into another direction, for example, “What else did you do over the weekend?”
Try treat him as you would your own close friend. If he personally upsets you in some way, try to communicate about this and find a solution so that resentment does not occur when your boyfriend wants to spend time with him. However, it is not your job to judge or lecture him for his choices that don't involve you.

Greet her by an acceptable title.,
Dress appropriately.,
Display good manners.,
Obey her house rules.,
Respect family time or traditions.",How to Get Along with Your Boyfriend's Mom1," Some mothers are perfectly fine with you calling them by their first names; some are not. Find out your boyfriend’s mom’s preference and stick to that. You’ll send the wrong message by greeting her with “It’s so nice to meet you, Pam.” Stick to “Mrs. Wilder” unless she suggests something else.
, What you wear shouldn’t matter, but unfortunately it does. If your boyfriend’s mom is really conservative, you might offend her by wearing revealing clothing or tops with graphic images or words. You don’t have to go out and buy a new wardrobe, but wear something modest when you meet with her—at least until you become better acquainted.Dressing appropriately around your boyfriend’s parents is a sign of respect. If you’re not sure what’s appropriate, check with him.
A good choice might be a simple, modest-length dress or jeans and a nice shirt.

, Another way to show respect to your boyfriend’s mom is using your manners. Answer with “please,” “yes, ma’am,” or “no, ma’am.” Say “thanks” for an invitation to dinner. Turn your phone off during the meal and offer to help with the dishes afterwards. These small courtesies really make a positive impression., You’ll have trouble winning over your boyfriend’s mom if you go out of your way to disrespect her. If she has communicated (or you heard from your boyfriend) about any guidelines she enforces in her household, be sure to follow them.For example, if she states “no company after 11pm,” don’t force her to have to kick you out at 11:02. Say your goodbyes before the curfew arrives.

, Many families have special nights just for family. If your boyfriend’s family has a certain tradition they follow, be sure not to intrude. Don’t expect that just because you’re dating him that you’re welcome to join in on family traditions. If Friday evenings are his family game nights, make plans with your friends or spend time with your own family.His mom will appreciate that you allow him to have special time just with his family.

Learn about her dad.,
Talk to her about talking to him.,
Spend time with him.",How to Get Your Girlfriend's Dad to Trust You1," Talk to your girlfriend about her dad and find out what you can about him. Knowing about his personality and interests can help make interactions with him easier.Find out about his temperament and personality, if you don't already know him. Knowing what to expect in this regard will allow you to prepare yourself better mentally for interactions with him.
For example, if her dad is a laid back guy with a good sense of humor, you might want to think about some G-rated jokes you can tell when you're around him. On the other hand, if he's a serious, grumpy, or even hostile man, you'll want to prepare yourself for this so you aren't taken aback if he's unpleasant to you.
Find out about his interests and values. This can help you find things to talk to him about, especially if you can find things you have in common with him. This can be as deep as his political or religious beliefs or as simple as being a fan of some sport, hobby, or TV show.;
, Ask your girlfriend to talk to her father and tell him she'd like him to get to know you better. This will lay the groundwork for spending some time together.If she wants to say some nice things about you to her father when you're not around, that can help too. You might suggest that she brings up some recent accomplishment you've made (e.g. a promotion, a scholarship, or a sports victory), or mention something you have in common. This can help ""grease the wheels"" by giving him something to think about you that's positive.

, For most people, spending time with someone helps increase comfort with that person (assuming that time spent together is a positive experience). Even the most hard-nosed dad is likely to develop more trust for you after awhile if he sees you regularly.If you haven't already met your girlfriend's dad, keep in mind that your first meeting with him will be especially important in creating an impression of yourself as a trustworthy person. As the saying goes, you only get one chance to make a first impression, so do what you can to make it a good one if you haven't already.Spending time with your girlfriend's dad may be awkward and difficult, especially at first. Do your best to tough it out and make the most of it--it will be worth it in the end if you can build a trusting relationship with him.

About a week before you're supposed to meet your boyfriend's parents, talk to your boyfriend about his parents and ask a few questions.,
Familiarize yourself with the occasion and what will be expected of you.,
A few hours before you're supposed to meet your boyfriend's parents, dress for the occasion.,
Tone down on the makeup.,
Make some effort with your hair.,
Lay off on the jewelry!,
Every girl loves their shoes.,
Find something you're confident in.",How to Dress to Meet Your Boyfriend's Parents," However, gently fit it into your conversation with him in a comfortable way to avoid sounding like an interrogator. Once you know that the atmosphere is relaxed and not awkward, ask appropriate but helpful questions that will give you more information about his parents. The more you know about their likes and dislikes, the better. Suggested questions to ask are:


Are his parents conservative or laid-back?






Are his parents strict or lenient?






Do his parents expect a formal or casual evening?






Do his parents dress formally or casually when they're at home?






What types of clothing do his parents approve and disapprove of?






Are his parents allergic to anything (ex: perfume)?





;
, How you dress will depend heavily upon whether the event will be formal or casual. You may dress a little differently if you were all going out for coffee than you would if you were going out for a nice meal. Make sure you have picked out your outfit ahead of time so that you aren't rummaging through your wardrobe at the last minute. Several things to avoid are:


Slightly transparent clothing






Clothing that shows the top of your bra or cleavage






Dresses or shorts that go above the knee






Skimpy clothing/immodest apparel







, Make sure you appear as a modest, young woman, but don't look like you tried too hard either. You can still dress like you, but don't dress the same as you dress around your boyfriend, unless if you do wear modest clothing around him. Be sure that all wrinkles found in your outfit have been already ironed out beforehand and that the outfit is clean and free of stains.

, Covering yourself in it makes you only look like you can't appear pretty without it. If you do want to wear makeup, go for natural colors to enhance your face and avoid overusing it. Less makeup will appeal much more to both your boyfriend and his parents. You may even want to go without makeup for this event if desired, but that is up to you.

, It's recommended that you wash your hair the day before you meet with your boyfriend's parents to avoid greasy or oily hair with dandruff. Although you don't want to look like you're trying too hard, you need to make it clear that you have made an effort. Don't just throw your hair up into a messy bun or ponytail, but do something pretty with it, such as a half ponytail or an elegant bun. However, avoid going too crazy with the glitter and all that jazz.


Curls are a good way to look relaxed and feminine.

, Too much jewelry or make-up makes a girl look high maintenance. Use it elegantly - some stud earrings and a necklace will make you look pretty enough. If you have piercings other than in your ears, it's probably best to put some fairly small studs in them to make them less noticeable or bold.

, You know those adorable peep-toe four inch pumps you got last weekend? Leave those for a date with your lucky guy. Stick with a basic black pump or a preppy tennis shoe or ballet flat to make sure you don't overdress or win his parent's disapproval.

, If you feel good in it, you probably look good in it. There's no point spending ages finding an outfit that you think they'll approve of if you then spend the rest of the day worrying about it. Go for something similar to what you'd normally wear, but adjust it a bit to suit the occasion.

Monitor your body language.,
Try not to sound condescending.,
Switch the topic.,
Make him feel welcome.",How to Get Along with Your Boyfriend's Best Friend2," When interacting and conversing with him, be aware of your body language. Negative body language can cause a negative reaction or create tension between you two. Be extra careful of your tone of voice, how you use your eyes, and the way you greet him.Don’t roll your eyes, sigh audibly, click your tongue, or suck in your teeth.
Remember to smile.

, Through your tone of voice, he will be able to sense that you are talking down to him. If he cannot understand what you are saying, don't slow down your speech so he can understand your point better. This is the way adults talk to children. Instead, communicate better by explaining concepts he does not understand, or by using clearer language.Don't say, for example, ""Do I need to explain it in simpler terms for you to understand?"" Instead, say, ""Let me it explain it better.""
Or, “Were you able to find anything better to do over the weekend than getting uncontrollably drunk?” Instead, say, ""What else did you do over the weekend?""

, If you notice the conversation is beginning to go in direction you do not like, try to switch the topic as soon as you can. Instead, bring up a happy or neutral topic.For example, “I didn’t get a chance to look into that,” or “I don’t know much about that topic, but how was your week, anyways?”

, Whenever you, your boyfriend, and his friend are hanging out, remember to make him feel included and welcome. Try not to make him feel like the third wheel. Instead, include him in conversations, and ask what he would prefer to do.For example, “I thought the movie was boring. What did you think about the movie, Joe?”
Or, “We are trying to decide what to do, do you have any suggestions? We would love your input.”

"

Acknowledge his importance.,
Hang out with your boyfriend and his friends.,
Let them have alone time.,
Voice your concerns.",How to Get Along with Your Boyfriend's Best Friend3," It is helpful to know why your boyfriend’s friend means so much to him. By understanding why your boyfriend values his friendship, you can learn to respect and like him, too. Perhaps his friend helped him through a rough time in his life. By knowing that he is a loyal friend, your views about him might change.For example, you can ask, “How did you and Joe become such good friends?”
You can do other little things to acknowledge his importance to your boyfriend as well. For example, you can reach out to him on special occasions or congratulate him on accomplishments. If he suffers a loss, you can send him a thoughtful card.

, Give his friends a chance. Offer to hang out with them the next time they go out to eat or see a movie. By hanging out with his group of friends, you will be able to see how much fun they have, and why your boyfriend loves to hang out with them.You can ask, “Hey, can I tag along the next time you guys get pizza and wings? I would love to get to know your friends better.”

, By respecting your boyfriend and his friend’s space and friendship, you can change any negative opinion his friend has about you. Your boyfriend’s friend will appreciate your consideration, and begin to appreciate you, as well. This will eliminate any animosity, like jealousy, that has resulted from you and your boyfriend’s relationship.Try to hang back and observe their dynamic. Chime in when appropriate, but do not try to change or direct the conversation.

, You might find yourself in a situation where you are seriously concerned about the effects your boyfriend and his friend's behaviors might have on your boyfriend's health, for example, drinking, gambling, or doing drugs. Address the issue by expressing your point of view without using an accusatory tone. Being accusatory will trigger a defensive response from your boyfriend. This often leads to regretful feelings and miscommunication.Frame your grievances through your own experiences by beginning with the words, ""I feel..."" instead of ""You and your friends...""
You can say, ""I feel that we should spend more time doing activities that are fun and productive, like running, biking, or camping.""

Be yourself.,
Ask about her interests.,
Try to spend time with her one-on-one.,
Share how much you care about her son.",How to Get Along with Your Boyfriend's Mom2," When it comes to building a relationship with your boyfriend’s mom, the best course of action is to keep it real. This doesn’t mean acting like you do at home or with your own friends or family. But, don’t pretend to be someone you’re not. Besides, she’ll eventually spot inconsistencies and think you’re hiding something.Most people greatly appreciate authenticity. Show your real personality, even if you make terrible jokes or cry easily. It’s best that they get to know the real person their son is dating.
There’s a difference between being yourself and being rude, culturally inappropriate or an over-sharer. If you have a naturally uncouth or over-the-top personality, you may want to tone it down just a bit in their presence.

, People just love to talk about themselves and their interests. A well-timed question or compliment may be just what you need to improve the bond you have with your boyfriend’s mom. Use her interests as a way to start conversations and get to know her better.For example, if she spent the weekend shopping in the city, you might ask, “So, tell me, Mrs. Charles, what sales did you catch?” If she is an avid gardener, you might say, “Oh, the azaleas look lovely, Mrs. Peterson.”

, Your boyfriend’s mom will appreciate you trying to develop a relationship with her. This is especially important if your relationship gets more serious. A great way to forge a bond with his mother is by connecting with her passions. Surely, there is something that you two have in common.

For example, if you like the same TV show, you might say, “Would you like to get together on Friday to watch the show?” You might even offer to take her to lunch one afternoon or see a film together.

, Even if you seem to bump heads with your boyfriend’s mom on virtually every subject, you two have at least one thing in common: you’re both crazy about her son, right? Make sure she knows how much you care about him, but also reassure her that you’re not trying to compete for his attention.


You might something along the lines of “Mrs. Jones, I know how close you and Todd are. You have a great relationship and I’m not trying to come in between that. I just want you to know that I really care about Todd.”
Also, show you care about him through your actions. Speak well of him in front of his family, hold his hand, and laugh at his jokes. Keep the PDA to a minimum, though."
"
Ask your boyfriend to step in on your behalf.,
Be polite but direct.,
Listen actively.,
Defer to her experience.,
Stand up for yourself, if necessary.",How to Get Along with Your Boyfriend's Mom3," If you and your boyfriend's mom get into a disagreement, it's best to let him talk to her on your behalf. He knows his mom best, and can rally her to see things your way. Let him know what the problem is and see if he can speak to his mom on your behalf.

You might say, ""I don't think your mom likes me. Can you try to talk to her for me? Maybe arrange for all of us to hang out so she can get to know me better?""

, If you happen to bump heads with the missus, come right out and address the issue head on. This will protect you from having to tiptoe around trying to dodge the problem later. Use your best judgment, but aim to be forthright and respectful.For example, his mom makes a rude comment. You might say, “I couldn’t help but feel tension from you earlier. Did I say or do something wrong?”
If it’s clear she doesn’t like you, you might say, “I get the sense you don’t really like me, which hurts because I really care about your son. I hope we can be civil for his benefit.”

, The worst thing you can do is act like you know more than his mom. If she’s talking, give her your full attention, even if what’s she’s saying is hurtful or difficult to hear. Try not to interrupt until she has gotten her message across.


Lots of people have misunderstandings because they listen to respond instead of listening to understand. Really think about what your boyfriend’s mom is saying. Is she really trying to hurt you, or is she just looking after the welfare of her son?, Even when the two of you agree, you can improve the interaction and earn her respect by showing deference. This means acknowledging that no matter how much you may know, she is older and wiser than you. Plus, she probably knows her son better, too.Show that she knows best by asking for her advice on how to handle a problem. You might say, “You know him better than I do. I think he’s keeping something from me, but I don’t know how to get through to him. What do you think I should do?”

, If your date's mom is extremely controlling or disrespectful to you, you may just have to stand up for yourself. This may mean setting a boundary about how you expect to be treated or calling her out for rude behavior.

For example, you might say, ""I can't help it you don't like me, Mrs. Rhodes, but I expect to be treated with respect just as I do you. Please don't call me names anymore. My name is Brittany.""

Dress well.,
Shake his hand.,
Be polite.,
Act confident.,
Talk about positive things.,
Don't drink too much.",How to Get Your Girlfriend's Dad to Trust You2," When spending time with your girlfriend's dad, dress in a way that will make you look trustworthy. Adult clothing is best, ideally in a ""business casual"" style. You want to look non-threatening and clean-cut.Wear a shirt with buttons and some clean, well fitted pants. Don't wear clothes that are dirty or have images or words on them that might be offensive to her dad.
This is especially important the first time you meet her dad.

, When you greet your girlfriend's father, give him a firm handshake and look him in the eye. This shows respect and friendliness.Don't grip his hand too hard and hurt him, but by the same token, don't give a limp, weak handshake. This can lead to a less favorable impression of you., Whenever you spend time with your girlfriend's dad, be respectful and polite. Say ""please"" and ""thank you,"" don't curse, and generally use your best manners.Many people see good manners as a sign of good moral character.


Always address your girlfriend's dad respectfully. Either call him ""sir"" or ""Mr. ,"" unless he tells you to call him something else. A formal address is a sign of respect and good judgement., However nervous or awkward you might feel around your girlfriend's dad, act as confident and comfortable as you can. Look him in the eye when you talk, stand up straight, and avoid fidgeting.


Showing nervousness can sometimes suggest you are hiding something.At the same time, don't be overconfident or showy. This can also be off-putting to people or suggest you aren't genuine., When you talk to your girlfriend's dad, talk about things you like and feel good about. Don't brag, but talk about things that cast you in a positive light. Involve your girlfriend in the conversation, and talk about things the two of you enjoy doing together.Talk about things you like about school, work, or hobbies. Most people prefer talking to people who are positive. Don't gripe or complain.
If you have hobbies or interests in common with your girlfriend's dad, talk about those. Whether its sports or spirituality, people are more likely to trust others who they feel are similar to themselves., If you are old enough to drink and are offered a drink while you are spending time with your girlfriend's father, it's fine to have one or two (unless he disapproves of drinking altogether). Don't overdo it, however.If you have too much to drink, you are more likely to say or do something that might seem untrustworthy to your girlfriend's dad.
Even if you don't actually do anything that raises red flags, many people see over-drinking as irresponsible or as a sign of weak moral character.

Be affectionate, but not overly so.,
Be attentive to her, but not exclusively.,
Respect his rules.",How to Get Your Girlfriend's Dad to Trust You3," Your girlfriend's dad should be able to see that you have genuine affection for his daughter, but you also have to be careful not to do anything that might make him feel uncomfortable.Do things that show how much you care for his daughter, while also suggesting you are respectful. Behaviors like opening doors for her, pulling out a chair for her to sit in, and generally doting on her can help him see you are treating his daughter right.
Mild physical affection like holding hands, a hug, or peck on the cheek are also probably ok behaviors. Don't get sexual in front of your girlfriend's dad, though. No groping, tongue kissing, or anything along those lines.

, When your girlfriend speaks, make it clear you are paying attention to her, as this shows respect for her. However, don't pay so much attention to her that you are excluding her dad or other people who might be around.You want to make it clear that his daughter is important to you, but you also need to show that you are socially competent and respectful of others. No one wants to feel ignored or excluded.
If you don't engage with your girlfriend's father, he can't get to know you and see that you are trustworthy.

, Respect your girlfriend's father's rules about her, at least when he's around. Don't act like you know better than him what is best for her.


If you stay at his home and he expects you to sleep in separate rooms, do so without complaint.If your girlfriend still lives at home and has a curfew, make sure you always get her home on time. This shows that you respect her father and can be trusted."

Rate the intensity of your feelings.,
Notice physical reactions.,
Compare this relationship to others.",How to Differentiate Between Love and Friendship1," Spend some time thinking about how powerful your emotions are. You can feel many of the same things for both a friend and lover, but the degree to which you feel these things is often an indication of whether or not you love someone. In general, the more intensely you feel about a certain person, the more likely you are experiencing love.


For example, you might feel chemistry with your friend because you both laugh at the same jokes and have an easy time talking to each other. When you love someone these feelings are more intense. You might feel giddy or excited.;
, Your body can help you determine whether you’re in love. Your heart beat might become more rapid, you might feel like you have butterflies in your stomach, or you might become nervous and flustered. You will most likely not experience physical changes like this when you’re dealing with friendship.


When you meet up with a friend, you are probably excited. However, you probably won’t experience any major physical changes when you see them or give them a hug.
With someone you love, you may experience physical changes you can’t control. Your palms may sweat, your voice might become shaky, or your heartbeat could increase., Think about how a certain relationship compares to the other friendships in your life. You probably have lots of friends, but you only feel love for one person. If you love someone, their relationship may be more important to you than the other people in your life. You may also feel a more intense connection to this person."

Consider how open to new experiences you are.,
Consider the similarities your culture has with your potential partner’s culture.,
Ask yourself if you can truly live with the cultural differences that an interracial relationship implies.,
Think about the personality traits you're seeking in your partner.",How to Find Out if You're Ready for Interracial Relationships," For those who are risk averse or have issues with new experiences, dating someone of a different culture will be very stressful and difficult no matter how much you might like the person. Sometimes love can’t conquer all. Think about who you are and your ability to adapt to and embrace new experiences. If you aren’t very good at those things, then you are likely to have some serious problems with the ideals and differences of your love interest’s culture.;
, Some cultures are more passionate about things and communicate those passions very overtly. Others are more subtle and quiet in their daily dealings. Some are more materialistic while others are very unconcerned about material holdings and more concerned with the spiritual. Where do you fall in these veins? Think about this before you say yes to that hottie you think is amazing if you are looking for something long term. Most relationships that are based on similar backgrounds, morals, ethics, culture, interests, hobbies, religion, are more likely to succeed than those based purely on a person's outside façade or sexual attraction. Don’t get us wrong — there’s nothing wrong with interracial dating, or even interracial marriage. If you find your true love in another culture and you are accepting of and interested in their culture (and vice versa) then you have found a good match for you. But not everyone is like you. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter what other people think, but whether you and your chosen love are compatible.

, Think about what truly attracts you to the person and whether you can live with the differences between you in a long term situation. Be sure those differences are ones you can embrace without future resentment. (Let's say you like a big sloppy hamburger, but they’re Hindu and can’t eat beef. Are you willing to give up your burgers and steaks because you might be upsetting them? Can you do this indefinitely for your mate?)

, Personality traits are distinct from someone’s race, creed, culture, etc. Personality traits are just that — the things that shape one's personality, independent of external motivations. Although they may be flavored by the person’s background, and influenced by those around them, ultimately, one's personality is one's own making. Are you family oriented? Are you possibly looking to have a family with the person you are choosing to date? What are the differences between your two philosophies of raising children? Do you believe children should run amok and be happy and playful? What does your love interest think about this? Do they believe children should be seen only briefly daily then raised by a nanny? These are fundamental differences that should be discussed relatively early in a relationship if you are ultimately looking for a parenting partner.

Even if you aren’t thrilled with his choice of a girlfriend, keep your negative opinions to yourself and let them get to know each other.A simple and straightforward way to show support can be by saying something like ""Hey, man, it really looks like Vanessa makes you happy. As long as she's making you happy, she's alright with me!""
The worst thing you can do is pretend the new girlfriend does not exist or refuse to talk about it. If he feels it is a good thing, then it is important that you openly show support for the relationship.;
, Remember why you like and trust your best friend, chances are he is a great guy and is pretty competent in choosing a girl to date. You just may end up liking her, too, or not. You don’t have to like her to support your friend.


You might choose to hang out with the two of them sometime to see what she is like. You can ask her questions about where she’s from, her family, hobbies, or goals. Doing this will show to your friend that you are making an attempt at getting to know her.
Remember you do not need to be her friend to support your friend feeling happy about the relationship. It’s your job as a friend to want the best for your friend, but you don’t get to choose what is best for him.

, You are there to be a friend, not a parent, therapist, protector or anything else. In a true friendship, you should want your friend to be happy. If he is happy, share in the joy. If he is not happy, that’s really for him to figure out.Be honest with yourself. Does your friend seem to genuinely like the new girlfriend? Can you spot any clear indicators that she's a bad person? If you answered ""yes"" and ""no"", then she's probably a decent choice for him right now. Show your happiness by asking him about the relationship, inviting them as a couple to social events, and spending time with them together.

, He or she just might shoot the messenger and you end up on the bad side.


Be aware that any negative feelings you have towards her may be tied to you not liking the time you are missing with him instead of a real problem with her. Don’t let your feelings cloud any advice you feel like you need to give to your friend.

, It should be about quality and not focus on getting “equal” time. The best part of the friendship is loving and cherishing the moments you have with your best friend. Your relationship should not change too much simply because he's in a new relationship.

In all reality, you are not the girlfriend. You will not win the battle to get equal time and could end up without a friend at all if you force the issue.
Make sure your friend knows you enjoy the time and it is important to you. At the same time, keep good boundaries about him not committing to spend time with you and later backing out to see his girlfriend. Be realistic about how he will balance your friendship and the new girlfriend.

, Instead of fighting for time, see if it is possible for at least part of the time you are together to include your partners. That way you get the opportunity to spend time with your best friend and get a front-row seat to how happy she makes him. The more you spend time with them together, the more secure you might feel about his new relationship.Even if you are not sure about this new girl, your friend will appreciate the effort you put out to get to know her. At the very least you get to spend time with your friend you wouldn’t otherwise get to since he would be with her.

, If you have any reservations about your pal's new gal, you can alleviate your concerns by spending some one-on-one time with her. Tell your friend that you were hoping to get to know her better and see if he thinks it's a good idea for you two to plan an outing together.


Go somewhere you would go with your friend--maybe the park, the arcade, or to a sporting event. You're not dating her, of course, but going somewhere alone might help you get to know her better, and, thus, ease your worries.

, A big part of being a good friend is being supportive.It may be hard to hear about the great parts of his relationship so you may find yourself focusing on the worst of the worst. Do not fall into the trap of talking bad about her—listen and let him lead the conversation.

, Part of this might be tied to the lack of structure of your friendship since both family and romantic relationships come with structure and future expectations.Realize that changes in your friendships are a part of growing up and getting older. As each of you finds love and start your own families, the time you have for friends may lessen. However, it doesn’t change the value of that time.
It may be tough at first to see how you fit into his life if the romantic relationship is new and they are really focused on the future “we”.

, If you are now the only one who is single, you may be tempted to get in a relationship. You are not in competition with him for his time or for some level of happiness tied to being in “love.”Feeling jealous is normal, so be aware that you may not really be looking for a new romance as much as you are hoping to fight the jealous feelings. You don’t have to be in a relationship just because your best friend is.

, If your best friend's new girlfriend caused you to feel jealous, you may want to examine whether you were interested in your friend romantically. It's quite common to feel something for a friend, and then have those feelings challenged when a date enters the picture. You may have reached an impasse in your relationship in which you cannot turn back.


You will have to decide if you want to tell your friend about your feelings. This can be a risk since it could seem like you are only trying to break up his new relationship. Keep in mind, also, that feelings are fleeting. You may not want to tell your friend if you think there's a chance your feelings are temporary.Telling a friend that you have a crush can drastically change your relationship. On the other hand, it may be hard for you to stand by and watch as he dates another person. Talk to someone you trust and ask this person for advice on what to do. Do not act irrationally--think over your options before you take any action.

, There are still only 24 hours in a day and now there are more people trying to split those hours. Anticipate a change and you will less likely be thrown off your feet when suddenly he doesn’t have as much time to hang out with you.It is estimated that a new romantic relationship costs you two friendships. This happens due to the fact that you suddenly have less time for friends. If your guy friend is important to you, you need to be prepared for less time with him, if you want to continue being friends.

, You serve a different role in his life than the new girlfriend and neither is in direct competition. Try to be secure with the knowledge that the two of you were friends before, and you will probably continue to be friends—whether she stays or goes.

, You and your best friend may have always spent every second of every day together. Now, he has to share his time. Be cool about this and merely schedule in social activities with other friends or family members who also value your presence. Doing this can help you feel less rejected by your friend’s new relationship.Chances are, you may have neglected some other relationships in favor of spending time with your bestie. Take your newly discovered free time and use it to reconnect with those you have been neglecting. They'll surely appreciate the extra time and attention.

Measure the time and attention you want to give.,
Figure out how much attention you want to get.,
Talk to a friend or family member.,
Reflect on your feelings.,
Write in a journal.",How to Differentiate Between Love and Friendship2," You can tell the difference between love and friendship by thinking about the amount of attention you give someone. If you love someone, you’ll likely think about them often and want to stay in regular communication with them. You probably won’t think of a friend as much throughout the day and won’t have the same longing to talk to them.


You might think of your friend when something reminds you of them during your day—maybe a song you both like or a story that reminds you of an experience with them. W
When you love someone, they’ll likely be on your mind throughout the day, whether you’re reminded of them or not., You can determine if you have feelings of love by reflecting on how comfortable you are with the attention they give you. You may want someone you love to contact you more or hope that they think about you often throughout the day. Not hearing from a friend throughout the day won’t be as disappointing as not hearing from someone you love.


If you are excited to hear from one of your friends frequently throughout the day or get butterflies in your stomach when their name pops up on your phone, this could indicate that you want to move the relationship in a new direction., It can be difficult to be objective about your own life. It might helpful to talk to someone you trust. This person can give you an outside perspective on how the person acts toward you and whether or not they believe it is just friendship or whether it could be love.


For example, a friend may notice that the person you love looks at you when you’re not paying attention. They might also notice that the person talks about you a lot when you’re not there—another indication they think of you as more than a friend.

, It can be difficult to truly understand what you’re feeling for another person. Doing so often takes a great deal of self-reflection. In order to figure out if you have friendly feelings or loving feelings for someone, be honest with yourself about how they make you feel.


Make a list to keep track of your feelings throughout the week. Write down how you feel when you talk to this person or when you think about them. For example, you might write that you felt excited when this person called you or nervous when you were hanging out with them.

, Take a few minutes every day to write about your interactions with the people around you. This might help you see if you are acting differently toward this person than you are toward your other friends. It could also help you uncover whether or not they are treating you like a friend or lover.


Try to reflect on specific situations. For example, think about a time you saw this person talking to another girl or guy and reflect on how it made you feel. Did you feel sad? Did it not affect you at all?"
"
Be confident.,
Act flirtatious.,
Alter your language.,
Ask them out.,
Accept that the other person might not share your feelings.",How to Differentiate Between Love and Friendship3," You might be really nervous to try to change your relationship. That’s normal! However, try to act confident. Confidence can help you find the right words to say and figure out how to make your case.Give yourself a pep talk. Try saying something like, “I’m a fun, caring person. Bob would be lucky to be with me.”

, You can test the waters by casually flirting with your love interest. Start by holding eye contact for a second longer than you normally would. You can also pay more attention to them. If you’re in a group setting, focus on having a conversation with them.Try some casual touching. Lay your hand on theirs while you are laughing at a joke.

, Friends tend to speak to each other very casually. This can mean casual nicknames, such as “buddy”, “friend”, or “kid”. When you catch yourself using terms like this, check yourself. Those types of names are mainly used between people who are just friends. Try referring to them by their name instead., Be direct and ask them on a date. You will never know if you two will work as an item if you don’t try to date. Be direct and open. Make it clear that you are proposing some one on one time.


You can say, “I’d really like to spend some one on one time with you. Would you like to have dinner with me Friday night?”, If the person you love doesn’t feel the same way towards you, this can hurt. You might feel rejected and be upset with the other person. Try to understand that this person is probably not trying to hurt your feelings, but they feel it is important to be honest with you. Don’t try to make the other person feel bad for not sharing your feelings. If you’re not sure what to say, try some of the following:


“Thank you for being honest with me. I was hoping you’d feel differently, but I understand you can’t change how you feel.”
“I appreciate your honesty. I’d still like to be friends, but I hope you’ll understand that I may need some time to deal with my feelings.”"

Know who she's especially compatible with.",How to Date an Aquarius Woman," Aquarius women are variously described as bohemian, eccentric, unusual or even a little quirky. Use this knowledge to your advantage. Aquarius women want love, but not the cookie-cutter version you find in Hollywood movies.

Do the unpredictable. Stay loose. Sometimes, consciously do something acceptable, but out of the ordinary, encouraging her to join you. Make sure your dates aren't too conventional, or she might lose interest.



 


Don't waste your time with too many compliments. Aquarius women have more a devil-may-care mentality, and generally aren't looking for approval from the rest of society. Give her one unusual compliment and leave it at that — your interest in her should already be apparent.





;
, Aquarius women want all their senses to be stimulated, although not at the same time, of course. She wants to do things out of the ordinary, and she wants her senses to be tickled at every step of the way. Here are some ideas for dates:


Take her to a museum with contemporary art — the more outre, the better. Going glass blowing might be a good idea as well. These will stimulate her visual sense.
Take her to a Szechuan restaurant, or maybe for some Israeli street food, or perhaps for some Caribbean jerk chicken. These should stimulate her sense of smell and taste.
Take her to a concert that features some unusual music. Maybe look for some traditional Vietnamese folk music, or some salt-of-the-earth underground rock. A classical concert will probably not be her thing.

, Aquarius women love their freedom. She doesn't want to be tied to home or family, especially early on in the dating, so don't mention your desire your kids and a blissful domestic life, just quite yet. Concentrate on improvising and staying loose for the time being.


Take the relationship slower in the beginning. Coming on too strong, too fast, could scare her away. Remember not to be clingy. Don't let her know that you're pinning your hopes and dreams on her, even if you are. She won't want you to control her.

, It's not so much that she'll say one thing one day, and do something else the next; it's that she's constantly exploring, experimenting, and building up information about novel things. Be prepared for this. Although Aquarians are very well-rounded, they can be social butterflies and flit about without appearing to have a ""direction.""


Aquarius women are very social and love to be around people. Meeting new and interesting people is one of their favorite pastimes, so let them feel like they have that option.
Don't be surprised if she's off with other guy friends, too. She can be emotionally detached until they fall in love, and so in some instances it may seem like she's paying undue attention to other guys. Shake that feeling off: jealousy will not augur well for your relationship.

, Although Aquarians are air signs, they are by no means a whirlwind date. This means that you need to take the courtship slow in the beginning. She can be committed to someone but needs to be sure. Don't expect to woo her in a week. It takes time for her to let you into her inner circle, but once she does, you'll have the key for quite some time.

, Since Aquarius women are naturally intelligent, they love hearing about new opinions and having opportunities to test out their logic. That being said, Aquarians are also very stubborn people. They do not make changes in their opinions or viewpoints very frequently, so be prepared to back down from an argument, even if you know that you're right.

, As someone with lofty ideas, she probably seeks position and power. In this way, she is unlike other signs. Remember to let her cradle and nurse her ambition; for a while, it will be her baby.


Aquarius women tend not to see women on an unequal footing with men. When in a relationship with an Aquarius, try not to suggest that women's role is subsidiary to man's — it will make her mad beyond a doubt.
Don't expect her to fit into the stereotypical housewife mold, either. If you do, you're in for a sore surprise. Although Aquarius women are very loving and loyal, they don't necessarily feel challenged by domestic duties, and tend to look down on that expectation.
Aquarius women have big ideas and can generally make things happen, but sometimes they appreciate some help with the details. Though their ideals are lofty, they aren't always concerned with the practical details. That, perhaps, is where you come in if she lets you.

, For the Aquarius woman, love is a sort of ideal quality, to be enjoyed and celebrated, not something that turns possessive or jealous. She will talk about her exes and other guy friends, and she expects you to treat them with the same respect that she does, even if they pose ""risks"" to you. Learn to trust that her love for you is unconditional, even if she doesn't show it in the way you'd hope.


She probably won't marry unless you become her best friend first. In her book, friends are held in very high esteem, almost equal with her lover. She may think: Friends are forever and lovers can come and go. So really concentrate on being her friend in order to enhance your love.

, An Aquarian will leave the relationship if she becomes bored with it. If you fall into the same routine day in and day out, it doesn't feel right to her. Therefore, learn to spice things up a bit. Let her feel like you're on the cutting edge of something so she'll always want to stick around for the ride.

She is not afraid to try new things in bed. She likes to push the envelope, which means everything from positions and scenarios to locations — a little romp in the hay somewhere public (but still secluded) might be exactly what she wants.

, Aquarians are very sympathetic with Libras, Geminis, Sagittariuses, and Arieses.


With Libras: This partnership is lively and fun-loving. Great intellectual relationships, low in intensity, but great long-term.
With Geminis: This partnership is one in which the Aquarius is completely stimulated one second and frustrated the next, albeit in a good way. Aquarius finds Gemini completely irresistible, making way for unconditional love.
With ""Leos"": This partnership is rewarding and once they care it is unbreakable. When they meet there is magic in the air and after some disagreements they discover how loyal (in the deep sense) they are. These two opposites can make a long life entertaining partnership.
With Sagittariuses: A very passionate relationship. Sagittarius needs even more space than Aquarius, which gives her the freedom she most desires. Unusual but usually deeply successful.
With Arieses: A very physical relationship. Though the possibility of burnout is high, Aquarius loves Aries' independence, and he stimulates her intellectual with his directness.

Understand his hesitancy to act.,
Know he's more practical than poetic.",How to Date a Virgo Man," Virgos are not passionate, ready-to-jump-into-bed creatures. They like to know exactly what they're getting into. The will not get caught up in a whirlwind of romance. So be friends first! Show him that you're the real deal and his interest will spark.;
, The traditional Virgo man needs a woman who is classy. She's smart, can hold her own, and is very mature for her age. She has her act together. She's not one for gossip or trivial small talk just to hear her own voice. Don't try to get him to lust after you (the Virgo man knows that's a dime a dozen); get him to see you as a person worthy of his respect.


Don't show him pretty lip gloss, well-timed hair flips, and batting eyelashes. Show him you. Show him a person that's awesome and that knows she's awesome. Be real with him. That's the only way you can truly gain his respect and loyalty.







, The Virgo man isn't the most direct, gutsy sign there is, to say the least. You may need to give him some not-so-subtle hints that you're into him. He may need to know it's a sure thing before he takes any action. Can you blame him? No one likes rejection!


Virgo is just as responsive to looks as he is to touch. So instead of touching him on the arm like every girl does, give him that look that screams, ""Kiss me."" You'll have him melting in no time flat.







, If there's one thing this guy is, it's a perfectionist. He notices every little detail and expects it. He makes sure his linen closet is arranged by color, size, date purchased, and thread count. He can tell when picture frames aren't exactly centered, when a curry is missing the right amount of spice. This has its ups and downs -- so concentrate on the ups!


He's the type of person that will notice if you've gained half a pound. He's the type that will look at your hair and tell you when one strand is out of place. Give him the benefit of the doubt -- he's just trying to make everything perfect. He's also the type of guy who will make sure your time together is just how you want it. That makes up for those nitpicky comments, doesn't it?







, You know that thing about perfection? How can things be perfect if they aren't the best? This Virgo also expects things to be nice. Not necessarily the most expensive (actually quite the opposite -- more on that later), but definitely well-put together and thought out. He can take a simple t-shirt and jeans and make it look classy because of the thought behind it. That's how the relationship will go!


Since he thinks everything out, your dates together will be planned and extravagant in their own way. He'll take you to a restaurant that he knows is good and knows exactly what to order and what to say to the staff to get the best table. He'll plan a night with the details so perfected that you wonder how he makes it look so effortless.







, Wear simple hairstyles, clothes, makeup, and jewelry -- stay away from ALL excesses, because Virgo men like natural beauty. You know that practical side of them? That's coming out here. They're not into ""showy"" or ""artificial."" What a breath of fresh air!


Virgo wants his partner to be real. Who wouldn't? While they like nice things, brands don't mean anything to them. Simple and chic resonate with them much more than accessorized and expensive. You should be the thing that shines strongest, not that shiny bracelet you're wearing.

, Keep your personal hygiene and grooming as clean and neat as possible. And as much as your body should be clean, your living situation should be too! If Virgo walks into your house and finds piles and piles of unsorted garbage, he will not be coming back anytime soon. Have a clean mantra when it comes to your entire life.


If you're not, you risk walking in on this guy organizing your bedroom floor. Suggesting a new soap for you try to get rid of that smell. Throwing out all the expired ranch dressing in your fridge. These are conversations that are better off being avoided!

, Back to that dang practicality. Virgo knows exactly what he needs and exactly that he doesn't need anything more. Just the same as he doesn't do showy displays of affection, he's really not all that showy himself -- and wants his partner to have a similar mentality. Things needn't be complex and unnecessary. That's just more for him to worry about and sift through in his mind!


If Virgo is cooking you dinner in your kitchen and runs across 6 jars of paprika, 5 of which are unopened, he'll wonder if you were too lazy to look through your cabinets before you went to the store and know that you're wasteful with your money. So do yourself and your budget a favor (and the environment!) and take a leaf out of his book.







, Virgo being an Earth sign and all, he expects his partner to be stable, too. Being capricious and prone to anger or mood swings is not his cup of tea. He likes life to be simple, remember? Dramatics don't have a place in his world. Emotions are fine when in appropriate dosages. Freak outs, gossip, and drama are not!


This isn't to say don't tell him how you feel, if you're feeling particularly moody. Just try to be rational and logical about it. Instead of calling him, crying because your best friend is prettier than you are today, take a step back. Hang out with him that night and talk about your struggle with your image. He'll see that you're calm and receptive -- instead of flighty and incomprehensible.







, While you shouldn't be expecting grand shows or intense theatrics in this relationship, you should expect to be pleased. Virgo loves everything being perfect and will therefore make sure you're happy. He doesn't know how to operate if you're not! If you give him something to do, he will do it to a T and then go a step further. That's one hell of a partner!


He may not make a big deal of your relationship turning serious, but know that he's probably thinking about it. When he's opening up to you easily, trusting you, allowing you to be his rock, know that you're in. You may not get your name up in lights, but you'll get a constant love that is eternal.







, Virgo (along with Taurus and Capricorn) are Earth signs. This means, generally, that they're very stable and resistant to change. Like the Earth! They are sturdy in their ways and know what they want and need. They're usually slow to open -- but once they do, it's permanent.


Virgo is a mutable sign, meaning that these characteristics aren't tried-and-true. But if you want to place 'em all in one category, you'll find that they're generally solid people -- grounded, have a foundation upon which they build everything (thought or planning), and at their best when they're balanced.

, Virgos are often caught up in their heads. Because of this, they can get a little out of touch with reality, resulting in an unconscious tendency toward insecurity. When this time pops up, he may need reassurance. When he's acting inhibited with you, let him know that that's unneeded (not with your words, necessarily). Be overly welcoming. He may need that extra push.


Take this and value it. Instead of wishing he were more open and confident, realize that this quality makes him down-to-earth, modest, loyal, and way less of a showy megalomaniac than the sign that precedes him, Leo. This sense of insecurity that flares up on occasion can be a relief!

, Because he notices every little detail, many people can think of him as a know-it-all. He takes one look at your pie charts and tells you they're 1% off. Not only does he notice it, but he says something about it too. This can be irksome if you don't realize he's just trying to make everything the best it can be. And why shouldn't it be?


The good thing about Virgo is that if you know your stuff too, he can take it! He is open to debate and loves talking about things he's learned and experienced. So the next time your Virgo corrects you on something, don't hesitate to say, ""No! I did it this way on purpose!"" and explain why.

, Virgo, as described earlier, doesn't jump to anything -- from relationships to conclusions. He needs to plan everything out -- how else would he know if it's perfect and, above all, acceptable? So when he doesn't give you that grand display of love right off the bat, don't get your heart all a-flutter. He needs time. Allow him that.


Your relationship may be slow-to-start. This is fine! It's just how Virgo rolls. It's not an indicator of a lack of passion or anything negative. He'll open up in time if you can be patient. Good things are worth waiting for, after all.

, When it comes to romantic gestures, your Virgo man won't be into writing you songs about your left pinky toe. That's just not useful. Why would he waste his time doing that? But he will offer you his sweatshirt when you're cold; he will open the door for you; he will give you the perfect gift on your anniversary because those things actually are meaningful. That's the good stuff, anyway. Who wants a poem about their toe?


This can be frustrating when you're looking for affection and you're feeling particularly feely. They won't reciprocate and don't seem to get it. If that's the case, you'll need to relax. Take a step back and realize that's just not how they operate. They'll show you their feelings in other ways soon enough.

They are intellectually oriented by nature, and tend to prefer a partner they can learn from. When first attempting to woo an aquarius, showcase your intelligence.When you strike up a conversation, mention something cultural. Ask about a current event or a recent film you just saw.
Try to notice something about an aquarius and make a comment. For example, maybe you saw them reading a particular book earlier in the day. If you've read that book as well, that may be a good means to strike up a conversation.;
, An aquarius is unlikely to be seduced by flattery or charm. They long for partners who can match them intellectually, and do not want to be simply fawned over up by a partner. When wooing an aquarius, share your opinion. This will make you stand out from potential suitors.During a discussion of, say, a current event, unabashedly share your thoughts. Even if an aquarius disagrees, they will be thrilled at the opportunity to have a rich intellectual discussion.
Never agree with an aquarius to please them. They will see through this and are not interested in partners that are not intellectually challenging.

, An aquarius needs a lot of stimulation to be entertained. However, they also have a tendency to dislike plans. Independent thinkers by nature, plans can be seen as a form of control. When planning dates, keep things flexible.Light plans work best. You can agree to meet somewhere around a given time and then see where things go.
Do not be surprised if an aquarius suddenly has a whim they wish to follow. The mention of a movie involving horseback riding, for example, may cause an aquarius to propose an impromptu trip to a nearby ranch.
Be willing to follow along in these endeavors. An aquarius needs someone willing to go along for the ride.

, Consider going to internet cafes, readings, intellectual events, book stores, new restaurants. An aquarius will love these types of places. An aquarius loves intellectual pursuits, so a date involving all things cultural will be vastly more appealing than the traditional dinner and a movie., As an aquarius values culture and class, strive to dress up rather than down. You do not have to show up wearing a full suit or an evening dress, but think twice before throwing on jeans and a t-shirt.Strive for slightly nicer clothing when beginning the relationship. Throw on something you'd wear to a more formal event. This is bound to show off your classy side, which will be appealing to an aquarius.

, An aquarius will want to know what makes you tick. They have an intellectual interest in others over an emotional one, which can come off as somewhat removed at first. However, if an aquarius seems to be analyzing you, this is a good sign. It means they're interested.Feel free to share your personal ideals, opinions, and future plans with an aquarius. This is how they feel close to a person. Talking about personal feelings may bore or confuse an aquarius, at least at first.
While an aquarius can be quite charming and witty, they can be rather closed off emotionally. If an aquarius seems hesitant to reveal their emotional side, this is not a bad sign. They simply find intimacy through different means.

, In a relationship with an aquarius, you will have to be the warmer party. An aquarius will want to learn from their partner, and one thing you can teach an aquarius is the importance of intimacy. As you bond intellectually, gently nudge an aquarius to open up emotionally. You will usually have to be the one to initiate moments of emotional intimacy, but with time your aquarius partner will appreciate this.Encourage an aquarius to share their feelings. Begin to share yours in small increments. An Aquarius may approach your feelings on an intellectual level, at least at first, but they are loyal and kindhearted partners. An aquarius is more than willing to eventually form an emotional bond.
While an aquarius may seem unmoved by romantic gestures, they do need a lot of emotional gratification. Do not be afraid to put your heart on your sleeve. Your gestures are not unappreciated, even if it seems that way at times., An aquarius will not give up their independence for anyone. Do not push your aquarius partner to do so, as this will only backfire. Respect the fact an aquarius needs a higher than average amount of alone time, and may not always consult with you on decisions. If you try to stifle an aquarius's individuality, they're likely to lose patience with you.Never try to tell an aquarius what to do. If an aquarius asks you for advice, or expresses uncertainty about something, offer guidance without making specific suggestions.
Avoid pressing an aquarius to give up independence. If you want to be with an aquarius, you need to accept the fact they will always have a strong sense of individuality. Do not be surprised if an aquarius retains their own interests, tastes, and friend circle throughout the course of a relationship.

, It can take an aquarius a long time to open up emotionally. Establishing intimacy with an aquarius may prove more challenging than doing so with other signs of the Zodiac. However, an aquarius has a strong sense of loyalty and a kind heart. If you are patient and understanding, an aquarius will eventually prove to be a kind and loyal partner., If there's one thing an aquarius values as much as intellect, it's loyalty. When dating an aquarius, you can expect a loyal partner. You will have to show loyalty in return, or an aquarius is unlikely to be interested in your longterm companionship.Once an aquarius shows vulnerability, you have their loyalty. Do not betray this loyalty at any cost.
Stay true to your aquarius partner. Do not harbor secrets or resentments. When necessary, rise to the defense of your partner. An aquarius will not waste time with someone incapable of loyalty in a relationship.

, Longterm, you'll need to keep up with an aquarius. An aquarius wants to learn over the course of a lifetime, and longs for a partner they can learn from each day. Work on cultivating your intellectual interests. Read a lot, keep up with current events, and get involved in cultural activities in your community. If you're not intellectually interesting, an aquarius will move on to a new partner., Most people need some alone time in a romantic relationship. An aquarius needs more alone time than average. Do not be surprised or offended if your aquarius partner needs a few nights a week alone. This is normal, and should be respected.Avoid bothering an aquarius when they're caught up in alone time. If you interrupt an aquarius while reading, for example, you're likely to be met with hostility.
Understand an aquarius is not rebuffing you when they need alone time. This is merely how an aquarius recharges and re-energizes.

, If you try to force an aquarius to choose between you and their dreams, they will not choose you. An aquarius is a passionate and ambitious individual, who needs a partner willing to support their various endeavors. They want someone willing to share their adventure, and meet new challenges with curiosity. When dating an aquarius, be open to any new pursuits."

Find a support system.",How to Deal With Your Dad's Girlfriend1," If you live with your dad, his dating life can really impact your everyday life. Even if you only live with him part time, a new person in your environment takes some getting used to. If it seems like your dad's girlfriend is always around, you might want to alter your routine.Maybe it seems like she is always watching tv when your favorite shows are on. Ask her politely if she would mind hanging out in another room while you relax with your show. Or watch it later on DVR.
You could also change your routine. For example, if you feel like she is always in the kitchen whenever you are trying to make a snack, start changing your habits. Grab something on your way out the door instead of sitting down to eat.
Changing your routine is probably not the best long term solution. But in the early days of getting to know someone, it can be helpful.
When you are getting used to your dad's girlfriend being around, feel free to take a time out if necessary. Go to your room or for a walk if you find yourself needing some room to breathe.;
, When someone new enters your household, it is sometimes necessary to identify boundaries. One way that you can do this is to define what counts as your space. You can have physical space (such as your room) and also emotional space.If you have your own room at your dad's house, ask that his girlfriend respect your privacy. Tell her if your door is closed, that means you are having alone time.
Your emotional space is also important. If she is trying to discipline you, speak up for yourself.
For example, if your curfew is 11 p.m., but she tells you to be home by 10, address the situation calmly. Try saying, ""Actually, my dad requires me to be home by 11. I'll stick to his rules, thanks.""

, It can be confusing when your dad starts dating. Don't be afraid to let him know how his romantic life impacts you. Ask that he please not introduce you to every new woman that he dates.If your dad is in a serious relationship, it makes sense that you will be around his girlfriend. But you don't need to meet everyone he takes to dinner.
Try saying, ""Dad, I understand you need to socialize. But it makes me uncomfortable to make small talk with women I don't know. Please only introduce me to a serious girlfriend.""

Try saying, ""Dad, Mary has been teasing me about liking boys. This is not a topic I want to discuss with her. Please ask her to stop.""
When you are voicing your concerns, explain your feelings. Say, ""It makes me angry when Mary interrupts me while I'm talking.""
Follow that by offering an idea for a solution. Try, ""Dad, it would be great if you could explain to her that we don't talk to each other like that in our house.""

Make it clear that this situation in a big problem for you and you will not continue to be ignored.Schedule a time to talk. You want to have your dad's full attention. Say, ""Dad, I need to talk to you about my conflicts with Tina. When is a good time for you?""
Give him a chance to think. Don't demand a solution immediately.
Say, ""Dad, I know you're in a difficult spot. But I really need your help, so please get back to me with a plan within a couple of days.""

Whether this is a new relationship or one that has been going on for a while, it is important to accept that she is now in your life.
Accepting reality doesn't mean you can't improve the situation. It simply means that you are acknowledging that things have changed.

Make a list of the good things in your life. When you feel upset about your dad's girlfriend, look at the list and choose an item to focus on.

, It can be challenging to deal with your dad's girlfriend. Maybe she chats nervously and doesn't let you get a word in edgewise. Or maybe she has no interest in you at all. Whatever your situation is, it's important that you have other people to rely on.Remember that your individual situation is different from other people's experience. But that doesn't mean that they can't support you.

Don't take it personally if they criticize you, but let them know if they hurt you.",How to Date a Virgo," Virgos are known for being perfectionists. They want everything to be just right, down to the very last, tiniest detail. This can be frustrating, especially to those who don't think the details are that important. The best thing to do would be to allow the Virgo express his or her creativity.If the Virgo you are dating is getting stressed out over the details for something, ask if you can help.
Virgos can also be self-conscious and self-critical. Try to reassure him or her that everything is great. Don't try to make it seem like whatever they are fretting over is unimportant, however.;
, Virgos tend to be sensitive. They also tend to be very critical of themselves. Try to avoid teasing Virgos, even if it is in a friendly manner—they will likely take it seriously, and end up feeling very hurt. Also, if you hear a Virgo criticizing him or herself, don't assume that he/she is seeking compliments. More often than not, the Virgo really means it. The best thing you could do is to compliment the Virgo and show your support., Virgos can be workaholics, and once they get started on a project, it can be hard for them to stop.There is nothing wrong with this—to a certain extent. Give the Virgo enough privacy to focus on their work, but also make sure that they aren't overworking themselves. A good way to do this is to express your concern for their health—or simply telling them that you miss them. This will help the Virgo realize how much you care, and he or she might take a break from whatever they are working on.


Don't try to make it seem like you are more important than the Virgo's work. He or she most certainly thinks you are more important, but sometimes he/she will get lost in a certain project.Sometimes, a Virgo will be trying to focus on too many things at once. All they need is a kind reminder to take things one step at a time, and to finish one project before starting another.

, If you are thinking of giving any gift to them, choose something that they can use for a while. Flowers and chocolates might earn you a smile, but a more practical gift, such as a notebook, would be even better. At the same time, you might want to avoid lavish, expensive gifts at first. Not only may this make a modest Virgo feel uncomfortable, but he or she might see the gift as an unnecessary waste of money.Consider the gift of learning. If your date has always wanted to learn pottery, see if your local community center offers such classes that the two of you can take together. This will allow your date to learn something new while spending time with you.

, Virgos take relationships and loyalty very seriously. They also tend to be romantics by nature. Don't hesitate to take a Virgo out on a nice, romantic date. Keep in mind that Virgos tend to be picky, and they don't always like surprises. To ensure that your surprise goes well, ask what sort of food he/she likes to eat. You may also want to keep the first surprise simple, inexpensive, and quiet. An expensive party with lots of people might not go well.


If you're dating a Virgo woman, don't be surprised if she offers to help pay for the dinner.If you like to flirt openly with other people, a Virgo might not be the ideal match for you. Your open behavior may leave the Virgo feeling unloved.

, Virgos tend to be introverted by nature, and you should respect this. Your Virgo boyfriend or girlfriend may love you very much, but sometimes, he or she needs some alone time. If the Virgo you are dating doesn't want to go out, try suggesting staying home, eating dinner, and watching a movie.Sometimes, a Virgo will need to be completely alone. Do not get upset if a Virgo does not wish to spend time with you. Use this as an opportunity to run errands or catch up with your friends and family.

, Virgos like to be straightforward and upfront. If you have an issue with them, they'd appreciate it if you told them. Don't try to send hints and have the Virgo guess what's wrong. This will only frustrate the Virgo. He or she will not want to waste time on any guessing games.Be honest when confronting a Virgo. Virgos are intuitive, and can usually tell when something is not right., Virgos are perfectionists by nature. They like everything to be in order, and will likely have a spot for everything. They probably won't walk around disinfecting everything, but they may get irritated if you leave things laying around.


If you decide to move in with a Virgo, you will need to respect this. Just remember to pick up after yourself, and not to ""mess"" with their order., When Virgos fall in love, they fall hard and true. Due to their analytical nature, however, Virgos need time to open up. If a Virgo is not opening up to you, don't assume that he or she is not interested in it. Instead, give him or her some more time.If you are already in a relationship with a Virgo, don't be upset if they seem aloof or disinterested at times. They do care about you, they just aren't always the best at expressing it.
Virgos tend to display their affection in other ways, such as helping their boyfriend or girlfriend out., Most likely, he or she is not trying to be mean. Virgos are logical and straightforward. They say things how they are. If this really bothers you, try telling the Virgo that their criticism can be hurtful. If the Virgo does not stop the criticism, he or she will at least try to phrase things in a kinder, more sensitive way next time."

Notice if she has typical Virgo qualities.,
Put your best foot forward.,
Dress carefully.,
Groom yourself.,
Be punctual.If this woman has a Virgo's judgmental streak, she may have difficulty overcoming first impressions.Avoid creating one of unreliability on your very first date.,
Keep her at ease.,
Keep yourself at ease, too.,
Talk about a wide array of topics.,
Be patient.",How to Date a Virgo Woman1," Before you make assumptions about what this woman wants based on her sign, try to figure out if she has the common traits of a Virgo. You can do this by asking her questions about her interests, her likes and dislikes, and so on. You can also do a little investigating and talk to mutual friends or check her out on social media to get a better sense of her interests and personality.


Virgos are thought to be hard workers, straightforward, loyal, critical, analytical, practical, and kind.Ask yourself if this woman has these qualities.;
, A typical Virgo is less likely to be easily charmed or swayed by passion. Anticipate a woman who is far more practical about whom she dates.If she is a true Virgo, expect her to apply a critical eye toward you right from the get-go. Don’t be offended by this, since she is considering you as a potential partner. This means she might still think highly of you as a person even if she doesn’t initially believe you to be right for her romantically.

, Notice if appearance seems to be important to this woman. Is her clothing immaculately tailored? Are her friends similarly well-dressed? If so, you may want to put extra effort into dressing yourself. Choose them with precision to make a clear statement about who you are, right from the start. Take her own fashion sense as a cue. Match her level of casual versus elegant wear, within your own tastes, to meet her own personal expectations.Bear in mind that Virgos are more often interested in long-term relationships than one-time hookups. Consequently, this may be a long courtship.Be sure to dress to please while staying true to who you are to avoid wasting either of your time.

, Further ensure that you make a positive visual impression by taking care of your body’s appearance. Shower beforehand, comb your hair, and apply deodorant. Brush your teeth, floss, and rinse with mouthwash. Cut and clean your nails. Clip any nose or ear hairs that are poking out. Exfoliate and moisturize your skin to get rid of any dry flakes., If you are held up for whatever reason, make every effort to contact her and let her know. Replace the negative impression of being late with the positive one of being communicative.

, Expect her to apply the same critical eye to herself.Obviously, ask about her life (work, school, friends, family, dreams, etc.) when appropriate to indicate your interest in her. Pay attention, however, to how comfortable she seems in answering. Back off when she becomes awkward, nervous, or edgy about certain topics.


Because of their self-critical nature, Virgos may often feel uncomfortable when they are the center of attention.
If she is reluctant to share too much information about herself right away, stick to more general topics, such as world news or movies or music.
Keep the conversation light and organic to prevent it from resembling a formal interrogation., Resist the urge to appear flawless in her eyes. It can be hard to resist the urge to present yourself as the perfect person, or to try and change yourself to appeal to what you think she wants, but this rarely works out. Be yourself and see if you match up. Although Virgos hope to find a perfect fit romantically, remember that they expect the fit to be perfect, not you personally. Keep in mind that she may be looking for a partner whose strengths make up for her weaknesses, and so she may not be too concerned if your strengths don’t match all of hers.Focus on creating a strong honest first impression, rather than an idealized one that would be impossible to live up to. Aim to show her exactly who you are instead of what you think she wants you to be.

, Remember that Virgos are very pragmatic in their assessment of potential partners. Expect her to not only wonder how well the two of you will get along, but how well you could integrate into her larger life. Unless she seems bored or irritated, don’t be shy of steering the conversation toward interests that she doesn’t share. Even if she personally dislikes, say, punk rock, trust that she will view your passion for it as a plus., Although Virgos may harbor inner passions, expect them to act reserved around new people. Don’t be discouraged by a lack of immediate sparks.For now, simply aim to win a second date with her. Accept that as a victory in and of itself while allowing her plenty of time to grow more comfortable with you.

Avoid dating “just because.” There’s no need to find a stand-in date just to keep up appearances for your ex.",How to Deal With an Ex in Social Situations Without Losing Friends," Before you enter into a social situation where you may be asked about your ex, you should have a few short answers prepared. If you were together for a long while, you can expect a few unwitting folks to question your mate’s absence. If you just recently broke up, some people may ask about your well-being. Remember, it isn't the break up that matters, it's how you deal with it that will determine how you get on with your friends afterwards.


Make sure your answers are short, polite, and to the point.
Be prepared to segue the answer into another topic.
Stay positive.
For example, you might say ""No, we're not together anymore. It was for the best. But I've started this new (school, job, etc.) and that’s going really well."" Or, you can say casual and polite like ""_____ is a great guy, but it was just the wrong time for me. I wish him the best."";
, Talking about a situation is often helpful to overcoming it. Still, talking to the wrong people can get you shunned and avoided. Avoid talking about your breakup and your ex with people in your ex's social circles, co-workers or mutual friends. There are plenty of others you can effectively vent to.


Talk to a long-term friend you knew before the relationship, but don't allow venting to consume your time togetherTalk to your family members, such as a parent or sibling
Talk to a therapist, especially if you’re having a particularly hard time adjusting to being single

, Chances are you have a lot more in common than just your ex. If you don't, explain you really enjoy their company and hope you can still get together. However, don’t be surprised if you hear from these people less and less over time.Don't speak negatively about your ex, particularly in front of friends that were his/her’s first.
Try to stay positive about your ex in a way that is polite but not suggesting that you want to be together.
Don’t take it personally if these people seem less interested in you after the breakup. Sure, it’s hard on you, but it’s hard for them to navigate this awkward phase, too. They may choose to keep things simple and maintain the relationship with your ex rather than you.

, It may be one of the hardest things you will ever do. Resist being sucked into negative conversations about your ex. If you've been doing it you should stop.


Remember, if you want to vent, do so with people who only have a relationship with you to minimize the backlash. There’s a high chance mutual contacts will carry gossip back to your ex.

, Chances are, if you and your ex were together for a prolonged span of time, you two probably share common hobbies, hangouts, and interests. Unless either of you moves away, you are bound to run into one another, especially if you share a social circle. If the breakup was fairly recent, steer clear of your ex to prevent a social catastrophe.Fresh breakups have baggage. You may have unanswered questions as to why the relationship ended. You may have second thoughts and secretly dream of getting back together with your ex. You might just be hoping for one last hookup before you “move on.” You might want to scream a long list of expletives in your ex’s face. None of these are appropriate to hash out in a social setting.If you haven’t completely dealt with your emotions surrounding the breakup, decline an invite to a gathering you think he or she may attend. Or, at the very least, keep a wide distance from your ex to avoid any contact.

, Know that when you and your ex bump into one another, your mutual or separate friends will all be holding their breaths to see whether the interaction is peaceful or explosive. A social gathering is not the time to rehash old news or to have a conversation with a few drinks under your belt.Do your best to behave accordingly in order to maintain the respect of your social network


If you bump into your ex, be polite. Smile and say “Hi, there, ____. Good to see you. I was just heading to top off my drink. Hope you have a nice night.”.
If your ex tries to corner you into a more personal conversation, insist that the two of your talk another time. If he or she is pushy, be more firm. Say, “It was nice seeing you, but I really didn’t come here for this. If you would like to talk to me alone, you can give me a call or we can choose a time to meet. Have a nice night.” Afterwards, find the host and thank him or her for the invitation and a lovely time. Leave without any further exchange with your ex.

, If you’re both now single, you have to be prepared for the possibility that you will run into your ex with a new person. If you don’t think you can handle seeing your ex with a new person, it may be best to bow out of social engagements where you think he or she will be present.At least, until you have come to terms with the end of the relationships and are no longer as emotionally attached.


Never purposely be rude to your ex’s new date. Such behavior is unnecessary and childish. This person has nothing to do with what happened during the relationship and doesn’t deserve to be mistreated or gossiped about.

, It’s an insult to the host or the people you came with to spend your outing sulking because your ex is there. Doing this completely undermines your reasoning for going out in the first place.


Your friends have been great since the breakup, listening to you vent and consoling you. Pay them back in kind by having a good time without your past relationship putting a damper on the night., No matter how hard you try, it’s likely some of your friendships will suffer after your breakup. An online survey showed that people lose as many as 8 friends after a breakup.It seems friends often get caught in the crossfire of a couple gone badly. Plus, even if your breakup ends amicably, it’s possible that your ex’s friends may choose to sever their relationship with you. There are many reasons why this happens.You talk about the breakup too much. Consider that your friends will likely tire of hearing a play-by-play of your relationship woes. Aim to spend quality time with them engaging in fun activities, not just venting.You ask for advice and then do the opposite. It’s slightly offensive to ask your friends for their heartfelt advice and constantly not follow it. Ask yourself if you truly want advice. Or, would you rather just have a sounding board, or even better, someone to take your mind off your breakup.

, If your mutual friends want to remain neutral during the breakup, respect their wishes. You don't want your doomed relationship to forecast your friendships, too. Never put your friends in a situation where they have to choose one person over the other. Just be happy that these people are still interested in maintaining the friendship after your relationship ended.

, Make your friendships a priority.Just because you have recently gone through a breakup, you shouldn’t get a free pass to be a poor friend. If your friend has something important coming up, such as a graduation or birthday party, be sure to attend—even if you are confident your ex will be there.


Never let your relationship status keep you away from making plans with your friends or just being social, in general. Remember, they are inviting you because they want to share the experience with you. Never determine if you will attend a function based on your ex's attendance.

, Almost everyone realizes the person on your arm is merely there to give people the impression you are taken and not at all phased by the break up. You lose major friend brownie points with this move.


Instead have a good friend (or several friends) accompany you to social gatherings. Make sure they know what’s going on so they can steer you away from your ex if you’re not ready to face him/her. Also, they can help you redirect conversations when the topic turns to your relationship status.

Set boundaries.,
Be flexible.,
Have an open conversation.,
Plan fun activities.,
Get to know her better.,
Be prepared to compromise.",How to Deal With Your Dad's Girlfriend2," Your dad's girlfriend may be an important part of his life. But if she is a new addition to your family unit, it may be necessary to set boundaries. Family holidays, vacations, and events such as weddings are particularly important to manage. Remember that everyone's situation is different. Maybe you don't mind if your dad's long time girlfriend comes along on the family vacation. But if you do, speak up.
Make your feelings clear. Be firm but kind.
Try saying something like, ""Dad, our time at the cabin is really special to me. If you want to bring Susan for the last two days, that's fine. But I'd appreciate it if you devote most of the week to just spending time with our family.""
Holidays can be especially emotional. If your dad has a new girlfriend, don't feel like you have to include her in every event.
If you have an annual cocktail party that includes friends and extended family, by all means, she should be invited. But that doesn't mean she has to attend gift opening with your kids on Christmas morning.

, Being an adult doesn't always mean that you will feel comfortable dealing with your dad's girlfriend. However, it does mean that you are probably emotionally mature enough to find ways to compromise. Talk to your dad about the situation and try to find solutions that work for everyone.Weddings can be a difficult social occasion to navigate, even under the best of circumstances. If there is a family wedding coming up, talk to your dad about the proper role for his girlfriend.
If it is your wedding, you should be able to decide who you want there. However, unless you have a good reason, it's probably not fair to completely exclude the girlfriend.
Be flexible by inviting her to the wedding. But you don't have to include her in the intimate details of the day, such as helping you get ready.
Family pictures can also be tricky. Try to pick a standard to stick to.
For example, someone who hasn't been part of the family dynamic for at least several months might not need to be in the picture. Talk to your dad about what feels right for everyone.
Consider the duration of the relationship. It's understandable if you don't feel comfortable having your dad's new girlfriend involved in intimate family events.
The longer the relationship lasts, the more flexible you should be. If the couple has been together for a year or more, it's probably time to start allowing her to be more active in the family.

, Once you have figured out your emotions, you can move forward on trying to build a relationship. Hopefully, you have had some time to consider what you want that relationship to be. Are you looking for her to be your friend? Or to take on more of a friendly aunt role?Start spending time together. It is perfectly appropriate for you to initiate a conversation about what role you will play in each others lives.
Schedule a time to talk. Try saying, ""Hey, Tracy, I was wondering if you have some time to sit down and have a conversation with me this week.""
Let her know what you need from her. It's ok to say, ""I already have a mother. But I am open to having a different kind of relationship with you.""
Be open and honest. Remember to also be respectful.

, Having a good time can be a great way to bond. Ask your dad's girlfriend to join you in an activity that you enjoy. You can either plan something in advance or offer a spontaneous invitation.Next time you are heading to the gym, ask her to come along. You can say, ""Hey, Tracy, I love my kickboxing class. Do you want to come?""
If you need to take things slow, go see a movie together. You'll be hanging out together, but you won't feel pressure to make conversation the entire time.
Do some everyday activities together. It can be fun to have someone to make dinner with or to watch your favorite tv shows with.

, In order to build a relationship with someone, it is important that you get to know them. Try thinking of her as an individual, rather than just your dad's girlfriend. Start by learning more about her.Getting to know someone can be as simple as learning her likes and dislikes. It might turn out that you have something in common.
For example, you could ask her to go out for ice cream. If it turns out you both have the same favorite flavor, that's a really simple thing to bond over.
After you feel a little more certain of your new relationship, you can delve a little deeper. Try asking her about her job or her family.
Maybe your dad has been dating this woman for a long time and you think you already know her. Spend time with her anyway. It's always possible to learn something new about a person.

, Compromise is important in any relationship. Maybe you are upset because when your dad spends time with her, it takes away from time he could spend with you. Propose a compromise by asking if he can take a day off of work to spend with you.If you find yourself arguing with your dad's girlfriend, take a step back and consider the situation. There is likely a situation that could be workable for both of you.
For example, maybe you disagree on where to go for dinner. Try coming up with an alternative restaurant that sounds good to everyone.
If the conflict is more serious, take a time out. Once you have calmed down, ask if you can talk about a way to compromise.

This will help you figure out how to communicate your feelings.Examining your feelings can help you figure out what you need. For example, are you feeling jealous? Maybe spending more time with your dad would help.
Perhaps you are feeling confused. Sometimes you might actually enjoy being around your dad's girlfriend, but that makes you feel like you are betraying your mom.
Try keeping a journal. Each day, write down the events of the day and how they made you feel.
Take some time each week to flip through your journal and review your thoughts. This can help you figure out what your major concerns are.

, Your feelings about dealing with your dad's girlfriend are very important. Your emotions are valid, whatever they are. But remember that the other people involved have feelings, too.When you are figuring out how to handle this situation, it's a good idea to consider other viewpoints. For example, how does your dad feel?
Maybe your dad has explained to you that is girlfriend is an important part of his life. If that's the case, you might want to spend some time thinking about how he feels.
Your dad probably has some good reasons for liking this woman. Try to look at her from a new point of view.
You could also take the girlfriend's feelings into account. It's possible that she is nervous around you.
Try to imagine how she feels. It could be difficult for her to try to fit in with you and your dad.

, One of the keys to dealing with this complex situation is to have an open line of communication. It's important to let your dad know how you are feeling about his girlfriend. Take some time to talk to him about your emotions.Make your feelings clear. Use statements such as, ""Dad, it makes me feel left out when you spend so much time with Tracy.""
Try writing down what you want to say ahead of time. It can be difficult to have an open conversation. It can relieve your stress if you plan ahead.
Remember that your emotions are valid. Just try to explain them in a constructive way.
Instead of saying, ""I hate her!"", be more specific. Say, ""It makes me sad when she ignores me or talks down to me.

, Give your dad a chance to respond. Chances are, this is a difficult situation for him, too. Let him know that you respect his feelings.If you don't understand his point of view, ask questions. You have a right to understand the situation.
For example, try saying, ""Dad, I don't understand why you go on vacations with just your girlfriend. Would it be possible to include me and my sister some time?""
Demonstrate that you are listening by using positive body language. Nod your head and maintain eye contact.

, Remember that having a relationship with your father is a priority. If it wasn't, it wouldn't matter that he has a girlfriend. Make a point to keep your bond strong.Schedule time to hang out with just your dad. Ask him if the two of you can go on a hike or go to a ball game together.
If you don't get to see your dad very often, find other ways to communicate. Keep in touch via text, e-mail, or video chat.

Challenge her false impressions.,
Engage her brain.,
Have a thick skin.,
Be sensitive to her feelings.,
Share her with her other commitments.,
Judge her by her actions, not words.,
Be ready to plan ahead.",How to Date a Virgo Woman2," Give your Virgo the benefit of the doubt and assume that she is aware of her tendency to judge people too quickly. Trust that she is open to reconsidering them when proven wrong.If you feel like she has misunderstood a statement of yours, reopen the conversation and clarify your meaning. If she has misinterpreted your actions, explain exactly why you acted as you did.


For example, say she has concluded that you have poor manners because you didn’t hold the door open for her. Joke about how you are unsure of what is still considered chivalrous and what is now thought to be outmoded and belittling in the modern world of dating.

, Understand that Virgos tend to be very knowledgeable. Stimulate her mind by always keeping the conversation alive. Embrace discussions on any number of subjects. Challenge her points of view when you disagree.Don’t worry about being an expert on each and every topic. Your openness to discuss topics that you never pondered before should impress her just as much as your thorough knowledge on a subject, if not more so.

, Resist the urge to feel offended by her blunt statements. Appreciate that her practical mind often compels her to speak directly, without mincing words. Regard her criticisms, opinions, and advice as simple statements of what she thinks, rather than a personal attack.Past instances of offending people have probably clued her into this tendency of hers, so trust that all you have to do is softly point out that you would appreciate a different choice of words in the future.

, Remember that no one receives the brunt of her critical eye as much as she does. Expect her to over-analyze your relationship and worry over her own faults, whether or not you even consider them to be a problem. Anticipate that her expectations of herself may lead to pronounced mood swings at times, depending on how well she thinks she’s living up to her standards.Encourage her to talk openly about her feelings, which she may hide in the beginning.
Assure her when her worries are baseless or resolvable.
Couch your own criticisms gently, since she may take them too much to heart.

, Expect your Virgo to strive to be perfect in other areas of her life, too. Accept that she will divide her time between you and other obligations, such as work, friends, and family. Understand that this balancing act may in fact appear quite imbalanced at times.When it appears to be against you, trust that her pragmatic mind has made a logical decision about what needs more attention this minute, rather than take it as a personal slight.

, Appreciate that your Virgo’s passions will rarely erupt into fiery pronouncements of undying devotion. Remember that she is more likely to think in terms of practicality rather than poetry. Expect her to demonstrate her love with small, consistent acts of caring. Rest assured that her gestures, however moderate, indicate a sincere love and desire for stability.For example, though you might be feeling neglected after her fifth night of working late in a row, appreciate her effort to, say, fix you breakfast or a cup of coffee before she leaves in the morning.

, Don’t be surprised if your meticulous Virgo likes to map out the next several years in advance. Expect her to have ambitions as well as clear strategies of how to achieve them. Either share your own early on so that you can formulate a plan together for shared success, or be very, very flexible in where you’d like to see yourself in the future.Remember that she may not necessarily be looking for a partner with the exact same qualities as her. So don’t be overwhelmed if you are more of a spontaneous type who prefers seizing the moment. This may be a trait that she envies!"
"
Tread cautiously at first.,
Consider making the first move.,
Plan ahead.,
Be supportive.,
Vocalize your desires.",How to Date a Virgo Woman3," No matter what the person's sign, never make assumptions about what she wants based on that alone. Instead of trying to guess what she is comfortable with, have a candid conversation about sexual preferences. If the woman is a reserved Virgo, you may not be getting physical until later in the relationship, but once that is on the table, it is important you have this talk, even if she is shy. Avoid ruining your chances by forcing a physical relationship before she is ready.


Bear in mind that Virgos are typically more interested in your potential as a long-term partner, rather than a quick fling., If you are both open to it, you may want to initiate physical intimacy with a Virgo. Improve your chances by waiting for a private moment, since Virgos may be reluctant to display too much affection in front of others.

, Take a page from your Virgo and be meticulous in your planning. Make an event of it with plenty of build-up, such as: a fine bottle of wine; a bouquet of flowers or rose petals on the bed or couch; dimmed lights and lighted candles.Take some of the uncertainty out of the equation by announcing your intentions without backing her into a corner. At the same time, demonstrate your confidence to her by setting the stage for your hoped-for outcome.


If she chooses not to be physical, respect that and back off. Don't try to talk her into it or convince her otherwise.

, Remember that Virgos criticize themselves more than anyone. If she does something that turns you off, resist the urge to chastise her for it, which might cause her to lose confidence and retreat. Instead of telling her to not do something, encourage her to do something else. Continue to show your enthusiasm in order to assure her that you’re into it. Be patient and trust her inherent desire to perfect her skills in all areas of life., To take things to the next level or spice things up, tell her what you’re thinking. Don’t mistake her hesitancy for a lack of desire or adventure. Instead, appreciate that it takes Virgos some time to grow completely comfortable with a partner. Share your fantasies to probe her own. Chances are that if she shares them, she will be more than willing to raise your game!"

Be aware that Leos come in all shapes and sizes.,
Flirt.,
Woo your Leo.,
Try to keep up.,
Compliment your crush.,
Get your Leo to open up.,
Understand that Leos tend to be natural leaders.,
Never stop wooing your Leo.,
Be attentive.,
Be secure.,
Be loyal and true.,
Communicate.",How to Date a Leo," Ultimately, the key to courtship is to get to know your particular Leo--to calibrate your courtship to his or her specific needs and quirks. Astrology describes certain personality archetypes, but archetypes will only take you so far.


Take anything you read with a grain of salt. Astrology is no hard, fast science, and interpretations may vary widely depending on who happens to be writing a horoscope.
Use horoscopes as a touch-point for your relationship with a person--not as the only resource. There are many other personality type indices that may give you insight into a lover's mind, including the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, and the Five Love Languages.;
, Leos can be passionate, physical creatures, and the quickest way to build their desire is to flirt with their attention.


Catch your crush's eye from the room, and give him a quick, seductive smile. Look away, wait a while, and catch his eye again. Eye contact can signal that you are interested, and your Leo may take it as a wordless invitation to come strike up a conversation.
Find excuses to touch your crush. Brush her arm when you're helping her with something; touch her shoulder, gently, when you get her attention; shake her hand warmly but firmly when the two of you meet. Build physical intimacy with your Leo, and her desire for you may grow.
Don't overdo it. Subtlety is king, where flirting is concerned. Don't make anyone feel uncomfortable; if your crush doesn't return your advances, don't force it.

, Leos are known for being passionate, romantic lovers, and they may long to be swept up in a passionate romance.


Leos often appreciate romantic gestures. Do something sweet and considerate that you know your crush will appreciate. Buy her flowers; buy him tickets to see his favorite sports team. Something as simple as a handwritten note may show your crush that you care.
Don't be afraid to be forward. If your Leo takes the lead, then let it happen and play along. If your Leo does not take the lead at first, he or she may be impressed by your courage if you make a move.
Consider simply telling a Leo how she makes you feel. Tell her that she is beautiful and radiant; that she makes your heart beat faster; that you want to take her out this Friday. Love favors the bold.

, Leos often lead active, exciting lives, and active people tend to look for mates that can keep up with their pace.If your Leo is into physical activities or sports, show him or her your own athletic prowess. If you go for a hike or a run with your Leo, it is important that you can keep up.
Consider letting your Leo win. Don't be afraid to get competitive, but consider playing to your crush's pride by letting him or her take first place. Make it a close race, however, and you'll earn the Leo's respect and attention.

, Leos love attention, and they love to be appreciated for what for they do. Be genuine, but don't be afraid to dial up the flattery.


If your crush is creative, compliment him on the things that he creates: songs, paintings, poems, crafts. Make him feel appreciated. For example: ""I love your new song! I've had it stuck in my head since the show last Saturday.""

If your crush is an athlete, compliment her on her athletic feats: tell her how impressed you were to see her win that race or to score that goal. Play to her prideful side. For example: ""Great job at the game on Friday. Those three goals you scored carried the team!""

If your crush is well-dressed or otherwise good-looking, compliment her on her appearance. Leos like to feel attractive, and verbal validation is one of the best ways to make a Leo feel appreciated. For example: ""I like your new hair. Blue really brings out your eyes!""


, Leos may present a confident, self-assured public face, but they often harbor secret doubts.If you can establish trust between your crush and yourself, he or she may begin to share these doubts with you--and this intimacy may lead to something more.


Do not pry. Be respectful of your crush and her inner world. Remember that trust begets trust: if you begin to share your inner thoughts with your crush, then they are much more likely to reciprocate.
Take it slow. Emotional intimacy takes time to build, and you don't want to overwhelm your crush too early in the relationship. Leos can be wary of commitment, and they may not be so quick to dive into a serious relationship., Stand up for yourself, but be prepared to handle a strong personality.


Leos often like to be needed. Don't let yourself become completely dependent upon your Leo, but give him or her opportunities to help out. For example: ""I can't decide what to order--this all looks so good! Can you recommend anything?""

Ask your crush for help with something--help with homework or a project, help carrying something heavy, help deciding something. This will give you an excuse to spend time with your Leo, and it will give him or her a chance to lead.

, Leos are often driven by passion and a zest for life. Don't grow complacent in your relationship, and don't stop making romantic gestures.


Consider giving your Leo flowers, a favorite food item, or a handwritten note to show that you are thinking of them. It's important to show that you care, and frequent romantic gestures will help keep the Leo's ""attention tank"" full.
Be spontaneous, and keep trying new things with your Leo. You may be more likely to keep him or her if you can keep the relationship exciting.
Grow together. Keep the relationship going by making it a constant process of improvement. If you become complacent, your Leo may get bored and begin to dream of new horizons.

, Leos like to be the center of attention, although they may be happy to let you stand in the spotlight with them. Make sure that your Leo knows that you are listening to what he or she says.


Consider putting away the cell phone or closing your laptop screen when you're talking with your Leo. If you are present, engaged, and listening to what she has to say, you will demonstrate that there is worth to her words.
Offer feedback. Leos may like to lead, but they also like to play and interact with their partners. If you can keep up with your Leo, you will be more likely to earn her respect.

, Leos can be very attractive, sociable people, and they will often divide their attention into many different projects. If you want to keep your Leo, you will need to be secure enough in your relationship to let him or her explore.


Be empathetic, but do not let anyone take advantage of you. It is one thing to accept that your mate keeps a wide range of friends from both sexes, but it is another thing to overlook a cheating partner when you've agreed upon a monogamous relationship.

, Leos respond well to loyalty and honesty. Continually show your Leo that they are the object of your desire.


Be clear about your intentions when it comes to friends and acquaintances. Leos may become jealous if they sense that another person is taking their attention away.

, Be clear about your expectations, but be willing to compromise. Leos may be straightforward communicators, but they can also be prideful and headstrong. Stand up for what really matters to you.


If you aren't comfortable with something, speak up as soon as possible. Address the issue and do not let it fester.
Be tactful. A Leo's prideful nature may lead him or her to flare up with rash emotion during an argument. Leos may not handle criticism well.
Empathize. Temper criticism with empathy; show your Leo that you understand where they're coming from, and make them feel validated. For example: ""You make a really good point--I wouldn't have thought of that approach. I'll definitely give it a shot.""

Deepen your relationship.",How to Date a Sagittarius," Sagittarius people are all about exploring, wandering, learning, and seeking adventure. This part of their personality doesn't go away in relationships! If they feel confined in your relationship, they will hightail it outta there faster than you even realize what's going on. This isn't necessarily a bad thing so long as you can comfortably accommodate them!


Some people will not be okay with a lover they can't attach themselves at the hip to. If this is you, you'll probably be better off dating a different sign! This is a factor that the quintessential Sagittarius person will not budge on.;
, If you have your eye on a Sagittarius person, you've probably noticed that they're not ones much for a monotonous routine. This can be from food to hobbies to people. It doesn't mean they're cheaters, but it does mean they're usually not ones much for serious relationships. They're all about the chase! However, relationships are far from boring -- if your relationship is multidimensional, your Sagittarius will be kept content.


Getting a Sagittarius to be fully and openly devoted to you may be difficult. They generally don't wear their hearts on their sleeves. But if you two are very compatible, they'll know it. And you will too -- they'll be sticking around for the long haul.

, Some of the more sensitive signs may see the logoff penchant for telling it like it is to be rude and lacking tact. That's not what the Sagittarius is intending to do! They simply don't see the value in not being open and truthful.


They're not being malicious. It's simply a symptom of their individualized character that they need to express. So the next time your Sagittarius says your perfume or cologne is too strong, don't take it personally. They're just saying what's on their mind -- once they've said it, they're onto the next. It doesn't phase them, so don't let it phase you.

, In general, Sagittarius people love the outdoors. If this is part of your personality, too, great! You can both go exploring the wonderful world together. Get them outside and they'll feel in their element.

, Sagittarius people are usually viewed as quite stoic and unemotional. It doesn't mean they don't have them, they're just not keen on expressing them. They prefer to stay optimistic and energized about life -- being bogged down by worry or fear isn't how they roll; they don't see the reason to waste their energy. Quite frankly, we could all learn a bit from Sagittarius!


This can be very, very intimidating at times, especially when you're falling in love with them. You'll have all these emotions swirling around that you're dying to express and you're getting a blank stare in return. Don't take it too personally. If they didn't care about you, they wouldn't be sticking around.

, Sagittarians are all about the thrill of the chase. If you can keep up the chase even once they've nabbed your heart, they'll be yours forever. Don't be a completely open book. Let them pry a little. They love it.


This is not to say to avoid answering their texts and to be purposefully vague -- that stuff is just annoying. But do operate on your own wavelength. Make sure you have a part of your life that is very much so your own. Having your own self is super sexy to the traditional Sagittarius.

, You risk losing your Sagittarius person when it becomes all hearts, flowers, and candy. There's no more exploration and adventure in the relationship when it hits this stage. So take it slow. Don't jump in with two feet on the third date. Explore every inch of each other in personality and body over time. The flame burns longer the slower the wax melts.


The Sagittarius will not be meeting your parents in the first couple of months. They will not be moving in anytime soon. So don't ask. They may run for the hills, thinking you're on a bullet train to Chapel Town.

, When you're talking to your Sagittarius, remember that they love the thrill of the chase. Just because you're already dating doesn't mean that the chase has gone away! Keep on flirting with them so they remember that rush. It'll help you remember it, too!


The Sagittarius appreciates openness and honesty. You're obviously digging' on your Sagittarius, so it's appropriate to act how you feel! When you're yourself and you two are communicating, it will go a lot smoother for the both of you, Sagittarius or not!

, That's what they're looking for in a relationship after all! Do little things that keep life entertaining. Check out an independent film, go sing a karaoke duet at the top of your lungs, paint pottery, play laser tag, do things that get you together and laughing. The Sagittarius person believes that life should be fun and is optimistic about this pursuit. Hopefully it'll rub off!


A stereotypical Sagittarius will not be the type that wants to sit and stare into your eyes, reciting you love poems. They'd much rather hold your hand as you pass through a waterfall. When you first start dating, keep it light and fun. They'll love you all the more for it.

, Though this won't go for 100% of Sagittarius people, generally they prefer their significant other to be well-groomed, smelling great, and looking like they dressed with the lights on. So when it's date time, nix the yoga pants and ponytail and throw on the boots and perfume/cologne. You don't need to look like you walked off the runway, but do look like you took a minute to think about your wardrobe!


Generally speaking once more, most Sagittarius prefer their females feminine and their males masculine. So if you're a girl, don't hesitate to don that dress and heels; men, date night means dress shoes and a blazer (and you'll probably pick up the bill).

, Sagittarians love to travel. That's probably pretty clear by this point! After you and your Sag have established a firm connection (and only after), plan a trip. It could just be a day at the beach or it could be a getaway to exotic ville. Whatever it is, your Sagittarius will probably be down.


Make sure it matches the level of your relationship. If you've been dating for two weeks, don't book a week-long stay at a bed and breakfast in the countryside of northern France. Small trips -- amusement park? Biking or hiking trip? -- are exciting, too.

, Bimbos and dunces need not apply to date the Sagittarius. You have to be clever in order to keep up with them! Keeping things exciting and coming up with ideas will be the main challenge in dating them, so put on your specs and get to romancing. Sagittarius is a sign that definitely appreciates the mind.


Stay up-to-date about current events and pop culture. The Sagittarius loves to laugh and think. Ideally, you'll both be doing that for each other.

, Sagittarius is his or her own person. This is a fact that will not go away. If you're dating them and thinking, ""They'll be more open and emotional in the future,"" you're probably wrong. They have no problem with how they are and will be resistant to any molding of them you want to do. If you don't like them as they are now, get out! This is who they are, like it or not.


Again, it's important to view these qualities as good. How great to be the person you're comfortable with! So many of us wish we could change -- it takes a great deal of confidence to be so sure of yourself you never want to be any different. Admire this quality in your Sag -- don't resent it.

, Just like the Sag wants to be his/her own person, they want to date someone that's like that too! If you're following them around wherever they go, taking on their hobbies and interests, your mysteriousness and self go away. They'll get bored. So whatever got you them in the first place, keep it. They're not interested in another version of themselves.


It's really easy to lose yourself in another person, especially when you're beyond infatuated. Resist! Don't compromise your values and belief system for them -- they won't do you the favor, so why should you?!

, They love adventure and trying new things. To avoid their penchant for boredom, keep the little surprises coming. Whether it's a home-cooked meal or two tickets to their favorite show, get thoughtful and clever. They'll be amazed at your ability to keep them happy.


Make sure to surprise them in different ways. Sending a bouquet of flowers five days in a row isn't exactly surprising. One day send flowers and take the next day off. There's something to be said for mixing it up, too!

, Remember how we talked about Sagittarians needing to be free? Yep. Even when your relationship is solidified it's important not to be too clingy. So the next time you're at a party, wander to the other side of the room. This isn't a display of your relationship hitting the skids -- it's a sign that your relationship is strong enough to be apart for an hour!


Your Sag won't be clinging onto you too tightly, either. Again, this is fine. This is to be expected. It's not a lack of a display of affection -- it's just a display of their personality. Rest assured that if your Sag is thinking something (positive or negative), they'll let you know!

, This is important in your relationship and just for you. The Sagittarius loves dating someone who's just as open to exploring as they are. So take a wine tasting class, a DJing course -- even if it's by yourself! Adding facets to your personality (even if they're facets you don't share) will make you more interesting.


There is no limit to adventure here. S/He is just as likely to try a new coffee flavor as they are to book an impromptu trip to the Siberian Desert. Seek it with them and you'll be a match made in heaven.

, The fact that Sagittarians are adventure-seekers who seem to thwart emotion may make you throw up your hands in the air like you wish you didn't care. Obviously they can and have been pinned down thousands of times over, so there's no need to worry! Connections can't be ignored -- if you and your Sag feel that spark, your Sag won't be denying it, commitment issues or not!


Look for hints that your Sag is ready to commit. Are they depending on you more than anyone else? Do they go out of their way to make sure you're happy? Do the surprises and adventure just keep on coming? If so, then you might be ready to take it to the next level. Who's the archer now?

Play the game on their terms.,
Get their attention.,
Make them chase you.,
Nix the small talk.,
Keep flattery to an absolute minimum.,
Argue your points.,
Create an air of intimacy.,
Create a private bubble around yourselves.,
Communicate physically.,
Anticipate their needs.,
Refrain from comparing them to anybody else.,
Resist prying.,
Keep negative comments to yourself.",How to Date a Scorpio1," Since Scorpios love to be in control, maintain your own control of the situation by playing to their expectations. As hunters, they love the thrill of the chase, so think of yourself as prey for them to hunt. Present yourself as a prize who is truly worth hunting., Scorpios love to hunt, but they need something to go after. Initiate contact. Flirt a little to taunt them into chasing you, or let them catching you sneaking peeks at them from across the room. Keep it subtle. Spark their interest by indicating your own without throwing yourself at them., Once they go for the bait, pull back a little and make them work for it. Act a little aloof, but no so much that you come across as cold, bored, or distant. Engage in conversation to show you’re interested in them, but hold your best bits back at first to maintain a sense of mystery about yourself., Even if you have a million things to say about the weather, use the less-is-more tactic. Whether or not they’re right, Scorpios might view your nonstop small talk as the sum total of all you have to say.If and when you do have to resort to small talk, keep steady eye contact and lean in close to indicate that the topic at hand is really just an excuse for you to talk to them.

, Avoid coming across as easy prey. Even if you already think the world of them, keep that to yourself for now. Scorpios love challenges, so make them think they have a way to go in order to impress you., If you happen to disagree with something they say, say so. Be provocative by challenging what they believe.Keep it friendly, though. Frame your arguments by saying, “Well, I believe …” or “I just think …” instead of stoking their competitive streak too much by flat-out declaring, “You’re wrong.”, Scorpios crave real connections and strong chemistry, so improve your chances by making each moment about the two of you and no one else. Either plan ahead to have a one-on-one encounter, or draw them into a private corner if you find yourselves at larger gatherings. Prove yourself to be secure enough to forego the safety net of other people’s company. Stroke their ego by showing them that you would rather be alone with them., Scorpios value privacy, so speak in low tones that no one else can overhear. When you decide it’s time to make a move, whether it’s simply holding hands or something more intense, do so furtively and out of view of other people. If you want to be their love interest, that means you want to be part of their private inner life, so keep the public displays of affection tasteful and to a minimum., Let your body do the talking, especially whenever you have to fall back on small talk to flirt with them in the beginning. Lock eyes with them and don’t let go.Stand a step closer to them than you would with anybody else. Touch their hand to draw their attention or emphasize a point that you're making.

, Show how tuned you are to them by helping them out before they even think to ask.If you’re sharing a pitcher and you see that they’ve almost finished their glass, pour them another drink. If you notice that they seem to feel too hot or too cold, ask them if they want to relocate to somewhere more comfortable. Scorpios respond to chemistry, and nothing says chemistry better than knowing what the other person wants before they do.

, If they strike you as being exactly like your best friend from school years ago, stay mum on the subject. If they make a comment that you heard someone else make just the other day, zip your lips. Maintain the air of intimacy by keeping the focus on the two of you without bringing anyone else into the conversation, even if the comparison is favorable., Scorpios have a tough time sharing their inner private lives, so don’t scare them off by coming across as someone who likes to snoop or blab.Since they love to be in control, simply follow their line of conversation. Steer clear of topics that they might consider taboo or otherwise find uncomfortable. If they receive a phone call or text, or if a friend of theirs walks up and whispers in their ear, leave it unmentioned., Avoid speaking ill of others, especially if they’re family or friends. Even if you have a valid complaint about your sister or a buddy, remember that your Scorpio will wonder why you shared it with them. Avoid leaving the impression that you're just as likely to speak negatively of them behind their back, too."

Maintain trust.,
Resist snooping.,
Be honest.,
Show your loyalty.,
Avoid flirting with anyone else.,
Keep their sense of adventure alive.,
Conquer new challenges together.,
Explore intellectual pursuits as a couple.,
Spice up your love life.",How to Date a Scorpio2," Expect your Scorpio to want to dictate their own lives and, to an extent, yours. Adapt yourself as best as you can to their vision of how things should be. As you both share your wants, needs, and dreams, judge theirs versus your own to see if they’re compatible. The less compatible they are, the more likely that you should probably end things rather than waste time by asking them to change for you., Ask them what their goals in life are: where do they want to live; what do they want to do for a career; etc. Compare them with your own. If the two of you can each accomplish your respective five-year plans without any great sacrifice, you’re good to go. But if you want to open a bakery in your hometown while they want to jet all over the globe as an archaeologist, it’s probably best to walk away now, because they’re not going to settle.

, Scorpios like to dictate the nature of their relationships as well as everything else.Suss out what they expect out of you as a partner. If you fit their idea of an ideal mate, congrats. If the person they describe doesn’t sound a thing like you, call it quits, because they will probably expect you to be this person regardless.

, Although you’ll have to adapt a bit in order to make things work, don’t be afraid to draw lines. Adapt where you’re willing to, but stay true to yourself when their demands are too much. Earn their respect by refusing to be a pushover, while ensuring that they treat you how you wish to be treated., Scorpios have a lot of issues regarding trust, so make earning and keeping their trust a top priority. At the same time, accept that they will probably never share everything with you. Respect their right to keep some private matters to themselves, while proving to them that they’re safe in sharing everything else with you., Stay out of their sock drawer. Leave their cellphones and other devices alone unless they invite you to use them. Even then, refrain from checking their histories to see what your Scorpio’s been up to., Never lie to them. Scorpios resent being deceived, so if you’re uncomfortable with sharing something, it’s better to simply keep it to yourself rather than build a wall of lies to hide whatever it is.Consider yourself as equally entitled to a private inner life as your Scorpio considers their self to be.

, If a Scorpio decides to seriously date you, know that they’ll take your relationship very, very seriously. Expect them to judge you on how devoted you are to being their partner.Defend your partner when they're falsely accused or otherwise attacked by others. Take your partner’s side and consider the aggressor as an unwelcome person in your life, even if they used to be your friend.

, Even if you have zero interest in someone who decides to hit on you, don’t engage or otherwise humor them. Your Scorpio might misinterpret ""being polite"" with ""being interested.""Also, say goodbye to your exes. If you’re still on good terms with them, wish them the best in life, but let them know it’s time for you to move on for good., Remember: Scorpios love the thrill of the chase, so now that they’ve caught you, they need something new to chase after. Avoid falling into predictable routines. Stimulate their love of life and pursuit., Propose new activities for the both of you to do. Go wall- or rock-climbing. Find a local polar-bear swim and take a midwinter dive into icy waters. Try skydiving. Whatever you choose, it doesn’t need to be death-defying or a lifelong pursuit–just something new and exciting., Join an art program and learn how to paint or sculpt together. Take a walking tour to learn about local history. Go to lectures and museums or even a murder-mystery dinner. Put your brains together and expand your knowledge., If you’re going to share your fantasies with anyone, a Scorpio is an ideal partner. Any way you can think of to switch things up, they’ll probably be game for. However, ease into this, rather than daring them right from the get-go. Coming on too strong too fast may turn them off if they still haven’t come to trust you yet."
"
Define your relationship in clear terms.,
Find out why they ""turn off."",
Weather the storm.,
Pursue their silences.,
Keep calm.,
Know when to call it quits.",How to Date a Scorpio3," Whether you’re interested in a serious romance or a more casual fling, let them know what you want in no uncertain terms. Although Scorpios are eager to meet their soulmate, they will often accept chemistry as they find it, whether it be with a longterm partner or a friend with benefits. Avoid confusion and hurt feelings by asking them exactly what they’re seeking from you and by stating your own expectations., If they seem to lose interest after the first date or two (or fail to respond to your signals to begin with), they may have genuinely lost interest,or they may be so interested that they’ve backed off to rethink their strategy, especially if you’re already friends with a risk of losing you altogether if things don’t work out.If it’s the former, accept it, because there’s not much you can do to change their mind.If it’s the latter, assure them that you really do want to move forward.

, Scorpios are prone to mood swings, so brace yourself. When something’s wrong, expect them to fly off the handle one minute and freeze you out the next.Stay calm and collected, because what they need is someone who’s more grounded. Avoid mirroring their behavior and making things worse., When they shut you out, gently probe for the reason why. Scorpios expect such a strong connection between the two of you, they think you should be able to figure out what’s wrong on your own. If you have no idea what’s up, ask them what’s wrong. The longer you let silences grow, the more they might resent your inability to suss out what’s wrong on top of whatever was bothering them in the first place., When they rage out, bite your tongue. You don’t have to accept what they say or let them win the fight, but ensure that you’ll be heard by remaining calm. Avoid being drawn into a screaming match and escalating the situation. Let them get it all out, and then reply with calm, measured responses., Scorpios love to be in control and tend to be jealous and possessive.If this causes them to cross a line, call them out on it. The best ones may be conscious of their behavior and admit when they’re unreasonable. If not, walk away if these qualities are too much for you to handle, because your Scorpios isn’t likely to change any time soon.At their worst, Scorpios may become physically and/or verbally abusive in their quest for control. Pay attention to how they treat you when you fight or disagree. If they handle you roughly (beyond a playful manner), insult you, or ignore your hurt feelings, take it as a warning sign that they care more about control than about you.

Listen to them and engage them in conversation.,
Bring something new into the relationship to keep things interesting.,
Be patient when they get moody or indecisive.,
Embrace and encourage the Gemini's inner child.,
Be prepared for a social life, but expect some quiet moments too.,
Don't force a Gemini to make decisions when he or she becomes indecisive.,
Don't ever break a Gemini's trust.,
Don't hold a Gemini back, and don't control him or her.,
Don't get used to anything a Gemini says, does, or wants.,
Don't get upset if a Gemini changes his or her mind suddenly, and cancels or changes a plan.",How to Date a Gemini," Being natural chatterboxes, Geminis love to talk. If you don't listen, talk, or if you interrupt often, the Gemini might think you are not interested or don't care. Don't stress yourself out too much about finding something to talk about, however. Gemini are creative enough on their own, and will likely find something to talk about.


Geminis are curious and love to learn. If you are an expert on something, don't hesitate to share your knowledge. You'll impress your date.
Geminis love to debate. They are not arguing; they are simply trying to see things from a different perspective and sharpen their mind.Geminis are known for being good at communication. If you have an issue in your relationship, don't try to hide it. Instead, try to discuss it.;
, Geminis enjoy being active and trying new things. If you find yourself dating a Gemini, be prepared to experience new things. It might be a good idea to bring something new into the relationship as well. For example, if you are going out on a date, try to find some place new to go/dine/drink each time.If your date is really into something, you should not get used to it; he or she might want to try something completely different the next time you meet.

, Sometimes, dating a Gemini can feel like you are dating two different people. This should come as no surprise; Gemini are represented by twins. One moment, a Gemini can be happy and cheerful, and the next moment, he or she can be grumpy and moody.When a Gemini becomes moody, don't take it personally. Be patient, and let the mood swing pass. You can also try talking to him or her, and find out what is wrong.

, Gemini are more in touch with their inner child than other signs. They love to joke around and do pranks. Some of their jokes might be rather juvenile too, but that is part of their charm. Don't try to hold a Gemini back or force him/her to change. Even if you are serious by nature, either join in on their fun, or let them express themselves fully., Geminis are social butterflies by nature, but sometimes they like to stay at home too. Don't get used to them always wanting to party, and don't hold them back if they just want to stay at home and watch movies. If you are introverted or anti-social by nature, be up front about this. Try to figure out some sort of compromise.


An example of a compromise would be going to a smaller party, which would be less stressful to you, but still appeal to the Gemini.
Another example of a compromise would be going to a party one weekend, and staying in the next.
You can also try to slowly introduce yourself to the Gemini's social circle. For example, you can start off with smaller parties and less crowded situations, and build your way up to larger, wilder events.

, Duality is a major aspect of Geminis. Because of this, they often find themselves stuck between two choices. One part of them might want one thing, and another part of them might want something completely different.If you find yourself in such a situation, try making a suggestion. For example:


If your date can't decide between Italian or sushi for dinner, you could say something like: Well, we had pasta last week. Why don't we try sushi tonight? That new restaurant down the street looks good.""

, A Gemini can eventually forgive you, but he or she will never forget what happened.If you break a Gemini's trust, you may never get it back again. Also, note that Gemini are curious; they love to learn and find things out. If you are hiding something, the Gemini will become suspicious and eventually find out. It would be better to be up front and honest with him or her.Honesty is very important to a Gemini; he or she will appreciate the truth, even if it is not very nice.

, Gemini are very independent. They don't need someone to constantly hold their hand, and they most certainly don't like being controlled. Geminis need space to experience the world on their own. If you try to control a Gemini, you will end up with a very unhappy boyfriend or girlfriend.


At the same time, however, remember to offer support if a Gemini asks for it.

, Geminis are known for being full of contradictions. They are also known for being spontaneous and wanting to try new things. Their personalities are also multidimensional. Just because the Gemini you are dating likes the outdoors does not mean that he or she will always want to go hiking; there might be a time when he or she just wants to stay home. When the Gemini you are dating wants to try something different, go for it; don't try to force the ""old way"" upon them. Instead, embrace the change.At the same time, if the Gemini you are dating is suddenly upset or unhappy, it would always be a good idea to ask what is wrong instead of simply accepting it as the new ""norm.""

, Being represented by the twins, Geminis have fickle, ever-changing minds. They can change and cancel plans last minute. Do not take this the wrong way. It is likely not personal. Instead, try to accept it as part of the Gemini's ever-changing nature.


If this really bothers you, however, talk to the Gemini about it. Do not accuse him or her of ""always flaking."" Instead, explain that you take plans seriously, and that it hurts you when they are suddenly changed."

Up his ego.,
Be strong and show high-self esteem.,
Be feminine and social.,
Help them when they are hurt.,
Be exciting and surprising.,
Go out a lot together.,
Don't be overly jealous.",How to Date a Leo Man," Leos have really big egos that can hurt very easily. They need to know that you appreciate them and that they're loved. They don't like to show it, but they are very easily hurt. Even if you don't put them down, if you don't show you appreciate them, they won't feel secure and might then look for another suitor who does show appreciation.;
, Leos don't like to date anyone they can't respect. They like strong, confident, independent women. You can be sensitive and show emotion privately, because Leos will defend and protect you if they agree that you have been mistreated, but if you are consistently pushed around by others then a Leo probably won't respect you.

, Leo men love feminine women, so don't come off as too masculine and dominant. It's a turnoff to a Leo if a woman tries to be more manly than he is. Leos love to date women they can show off and be proud of. You don't have to be popular but you should be sociable because Leo guys respect well-liked women.

, Even though they hide it, Leos need to be nurtured when they are hurting. They don't like to be treated as helpless and pathetic but they do like to be comforted. When they say they don't want to talk about it with you, inside they do but they need to know you care enough to keep asking.

, Leo men get bored easily and need to be entertained in the relationship. Have a sense of humor and do things they wouldn't expect. Maybe buy some fun sexy lingerie and have an exciting night.

, Most Leos love social atmospheres that get them out of the house. They can be very romantic and love fancy restaurants and the high life. They love to have fun and try new things.

, Leos attract a lot of women, so naturally they tend to have some female friends. Leos surround themselves with people who admire them and there is almost never actual romance in those relationships. It is a turn-off to a Leo if his woman is regularly accusing him of acting inappropriately when in actuality he has done nothing wrong and would not disrespect anyone that way, or really in any way, and especially not his significant other.

Keep the fire alive.",How to Date a Leo Woman," This woman's element is fire – she is intense with a gracious heart. She makes one of the most romantic of all lovers and she is devoted and generous. Like the sun, she is bright and draws people to her like the warmth of summer and tends to be quite popular. She is known for a thick mane of shimmery hair and almost cat-like eyes. This woman is the royalty of all zodiacs, so if you want to meet her needs, you have to act accordingly. Here are some of the things you have to know if you want to know how to treat her right:


Leo women think of mates with the utmost respect and will place them on a very high pedestal; she expects you to do the same. You are ""Her Lion, leader.""
For a truly meaningful relationship, she likes individuals who are more unique than her usual suitors. Wow her with your originality.
Ruled by the 5th house, her sign rules the heart. She is an extrovert and a fixed sign. Be prepared to be compatible with an outgoing personality.;
, Leo women love to be admired and to get praised for their uniqueness and creativity. Compliments will get you far and will sometimes even make the woman blush. Leo women are known to be creative and dislike the status quo. Win her by loving what's unique about her style, and the way she lives. Treat her well and show up on time to show that you think she's really special, or be prepared for a reckoning!


Don't give her fake compliments just for the sake of admiration. Instead, take the time to truly admire something about her and to make her feel special. If you're not genuine, she'll be smart enough to tell from a mile away.
Leo women love to be the center of attention. If you take her to a party, make sure she has a great time and enjoys talking to everyone instead of being left in the shadows. Make sure everyone knows who she is and that she's worth knowing.
Get comfortable with dating a girl who is extremely social and who loves the limelight. You don't have to be a wallflower to compensate, but you should be the kind of guy who is okay with his girl getting more of the attention.

, Leos are known to love fine things. She has tastes that are extravagant and regal. She purrs when she's romanced with finer wine or chocolate. If you can afford it, you should take her to an elegant, upscale restaurant to show that you appreciate her taste. If you can't afford it, take her out to a classy picnic, a slow walk in the city at night, or even to a dinner at your home. She likes shining lights and deep romantic situations.


This doesn't mean you can win a Leo woman over just by showering her with gifts. You have to show her that there's meaning behind the fancy things you do for her.
Like her personality, her taste is extravagant. She likes jewelry, fine clothes, beautiful hair clips, and other ornaments that can accentuate her beautiful appearance.

, A Leo woman tiptoes around love. She knows that love is Kryptonite to her fragile ego and is very reluctant before giving someone the power to break her heart. In the beginning, when you're just getting to know each other, she will be very protective and watchful of herself. When a Leo woman topples into love, she tends to be very shy, so you may have to prompt her and make first advances and assure her during the relationship. She craves your affection but she is too self-conscious to ask you for it; she will enjoy your advances.


The words ""I love you"" mean vulnerability to a Leo woman. Make sure you mean it before you say it.

, If you neglect your kitten's ego for too long, she will become distant, destructive, and sulky. The Leo woman's pride is always at stake, and no matter how loudly she roars, her ego is delicate and fragile. She can begin to get needy if she feels like she's giving and not getting anything back. But if you give her the attention she needs and deserves, then she can be warm, demonstrative, and even theatrical in her love.


Leo women are proud and may not admit it if they feel they are not getting the love and attention they deserve. It's up to you to notice when your woman needs a little extra love and support. Leo women are very loyal and forgive but many do not forgive. If a Leo woman is betrayed she will not hesitate to follow through with the relationship. Betrayal may inspire the Leo woman to ignore you, possibly forever.

, Leo women are fun and observant, and they'll love poking fun of you in harmless ways, and teasing you to make you smile. They are as playful as kittens and will more than likely begin to tease you regularly once she's comfortable with you. You should be able to take a joke, and dish one out, as long as you don't harm her feelings. Start off slow with the jokes and wait for her to warm up to you before you take it too far.


Invite her to do something a little kid would do, like play a spontaneous game of tag, Connect Four, or Twister.
Take her to the circus or the zoo. This may sound completely silly, but she'll love it!
Leo women don't like to be confined indoors and love to roam outside. Take her to a park, a beach, on a hike, or somewhere else where she can enjoy the fresh air and beautiful scenery.

, A Leo will love anything that spurs the moment and is romantic. Leos are dreamers and random moments, like an unexpected love letter, will make her day. She may even try to romance you back. Your Leo will appreciate anything you put thought into -- a sudden drive to nowhere, red roses hidden in her drawer, or a homemade card under her doorway, for example. If a Leo woman likes you, she will go more than half the way to make it work and make things rosy.


Court her or she will seriously doubt whether you're her man. She loves grand romantic gestures and the process of courtship. Nothing is ever too much as long as it's genuine.

, The potential partner of a Leo woman should be sensitive and intelligent. Intelligence is a must: Leos are constant questioners, so their mates should be able to reason, articulate, and keep up with them. She is sharp, quick-witted, funny, and very social -- she wants a man who can keep her on her toes. If you seem insecure, unsure of yourself, or just generally average, then she'll quickly turn away from you. You don't have to show off to her, but let her know that you can play ball and are ready for what she throws at you.


Remember that Leo women love the spotlight. If she thinks you're trying to hog it by showing off how smart you are, she may back off.

, You should also be strong and assured in yourself to take the lead with this lioness. These qualities are very attractive to her and she will purr with pleasure and enjoy the ride. Leos don't always want to make decisions or to take charge. She's confident in who she is, and she wants a man who is also strong in his beliefs and ideas and who isn't afraid to make decisions or to say what's on his mind. If you want to truly get her to like you, then you can't have her reassuring you or telling you how great you are all the time.


If you're confident, she'll be naturally drawn toward you.

, Leo women are independent and they want to be with men who are just as independent as they are. They want their mates to guide them, but not to control them. If you want to date a Leo, then you have to be strong and independent yourself, or she'll dominate you too much and will lose respect for you. It's true: Leo women do love controlling their men and having people look up to them. You can give her what she wants without letting her have total control over you.


Don't try to impose your beliefs on a Leo woman or tell her how she should act or what she should do. Though you can give her advice or suggestions, she already has a strong sense of who she is and may feel offended if she thinks you are ordering her around.

, If angered, a Leo woman can be hot tempered and dramatic. The best thing to do if she gets angry is to let her have her proud space and to apologize and show you care, no matter how stand-offish and distant she behaves -- she will be thankful for how much you care. Leo women love traits of loyalty. Make sure you have a firm but gentle opinion when handling the Leo, or you may be in for a harsh surprise.


If she's upset, apologize, but give her space to calm down on her own. Get used to the fact that being with a Leo is all about embracing the highs and the lows, and that being with her will rarely be a boring, tame affair.

, Beneath that shiny exterior of lace and nail polish, a Leo woman may be curiously insecure. She has a fragile heart that may be hidden by smiles and laughter, so you must have a sensitive heart and look out for a chink in the armor. She will be very timid when starting the relationship if she really likes you. Don't just date her; become her friend and talk to her. A way to a Leo's heart is through friendship, which they cherish and trust with a passion.


Let her know that you really like her for the person she is, not for something superficial like her money or her looks.

, A mature Leo female will be extremely generous and will show a level of care and consideration so large and warm that she may even forget about herself entirely. If she wants to give to you or take care of you, let her do it (even if you don't let her do this all the time). Though you should give her love and kindness in return, you shouldn't think that she wants to treat you well for ulterior motives. Leo women love to give to people in need, whether they are friends, family, or strangers.


Just watch out for the immature Leo. While a mature Leo is generous, the immature Leo will be arrogant, vain, and flashy. If you really care for her, then you can hope that this passes when she grows up a bit.

, Your kitten needs a man that can make her purr. Yes, being dominant in bed (when you get there) is a must. Your kitten is a people pleaser; she will do anything in her power to please you. In bed, a Leo woman wants you to be her leader (lion). Take charge, and show her passion and romance, and she'll be only yours. The Leo's favorite zone is thought to be the lower back. Stroking her back and neck is very pleasurable for her.


Some Leo women can be quite kinky and like the play of seduction, feathers and blindfolds. Make sure she would be up for this kind of thing before you try it, though.

, A Leo's family is her pride and her life, so expect your Leo girlfriend to cry buckets during family weddings and reunions and gaze at family photos with longing. Leos adore large numbers; think of the lioness and her cubs. Even if you're not ready to have children of your own yet, you should be family-oriented and excited to spend time with your family or hers. This is very important to Leo ladies, so you should feel the same way for best results.


If she starts talking about having kids with you, take the time to listen to her seriously instead of brushing her off.

, Leos can be self-indulgent, stubborn, and prone to sulking if they don't get their own way. This doesn't mean that you have to give in to her every time, but that you should be prepared to have a conversation if you two can't reach an agreement. If you're the kind of person who always has to get his way, then you and your Leo lady may not make it in the long term. You should be equipped with a person who can be stubborn and set on what she wants.


Leo ladies do not like to be met with opposition. You can disagree with her if it's necessary, but make sure you state things as kindly and gingerly as possible, or her temper will flare up.

, There's no such thing as a calm night in when it comes to dating a Leo. Your relationship will be fiery, exciting, unpredictable, and always new and intriguing. You have to get ready to be spontaneous, to keep your Leo on her toes, to create new things to do together, such as unplanned road trips or dips in the ocean in the middle of the night. Sure, you'll have some fights, but you'll make up in impressive fashion. If you're up for the challenge, then your relationship with a Leo woman will never cease to amaze you.


If you're the kind of guy whose ideal date is ordering in food and watching TV, then the Leo woman may not be for you. Sure, you can have a calm night in once in a while, but you have to work on keeping things interesting.

Keep the PDA to a minimum.",How to Date a Capricorn Man," The first thing you should know about a Capricorn guy is that he is bound to be very driven. The best places to meet your perfect Capricorn guy include work functions, charity events, or career-boosting functions. Capricorn guys are dedicated to getting to the top of their industries, so putting on your game face and excelling at a career function is sure to help you capture your Capricorn’s eye., Capricorn men are pretty reserved. Because of this, they tend to be attractive towards partners who dress in a sophisticated but more conservative manner. Breaking out your flashing stilettos and cut-out dress is probably not the best way to attract your man. Go for a classy look with a touch of femininity., Capricorn guys are attracted to intellect above anything else. Regardless of the gorgeous outfit you’re wearing or your ridiculously gorgeous face, if you come across as ditzy or rather air-headed, your Capricorn may lose interest. Instead, show off your beautiful brain by engaging him in some stellar conversation. However, keep your cool and remain composed--don’t guffaw if he makes a joke.


Don’t be afraid to show off that witty humor either--Capricorns can often have a humorous streak that runs on the sarcastic side.

, Capricorns have a hard time opening up to others. Before he lets you in, he will have to know that he can trust you. Be honest and open with him but expect that it will take him a bit longer to share his inner workings with you. Your Capricorn guy will take his time, but with help from you--showing you are supportive, displaying ways you are trustworthy--he will eventually let you into his heart.Be cautious that you do not betray your Capricorn’s trust, even if unintentionally. Once a Capricorn guy feels betrayed, he generally is very slow to let you back in--if he does at all.

, One thing a Capricorn guy will not participate in is a relationship mind game. If you are into him, make it clear and then wait for him to meet you halfway. Do not try to make him jealous by parading another guy around in front of him, acting passive aggressively, or playing ‘hard to get’. With a Capricorn guy, this will have the opposite of the desired effect--he will move on speedily and without a glance back., The best way to get to know your Capricorn guy, and show him that you’re the real deal, is by taking the first leap. Invite him over for dinner, on a picnic, or to do something else just the two of you. Inviting him to a big party will generally make him uneasy, while inviting him for dinner will most likely make him open up. This is also your time to shine--bring up topics that you are passionate about and allow him to relaxing into a stimulating conversation.

, Capricorn men are known to become friends with a woman before actually considering dating her. Because of this, your patience will probably be tried. While courting the Capricorn, don’t rush him or push him into anything. He will come to his own conclusions as you spend more and more time with him. Keep his attention on you by showing him you support his endeavors. Attending a fundraiser he puts on, reading an article he has written, or giving him a sincere compliment will show him that you can be a supportive partner.

, Capricorn men are known to take their love lives--like their jobs--very seriously. As such, your Capricorn will probably not be the cheating type. Once he has fallen for you, he will work hard to keep your relationship going. Though it takes Capricorn guys a while to open up, once he has made his decision about you, know that you have a very devoted guy by your side.

, Capricorn is known as the workaholic of the zodiac signs. He takes his job very seriously and will be working overtime on occasion. Be prepared for this and know that it is not a sign of him losing interest in your relationship. He really does just take his job seriously and wants to do the best work he can.

, Capricorns seek stability--they want someone who is devoted and serious about the relationship. Hysterics or mind games will turn a Capricorn off a relationship. If he upsets you, tell him what he has done and why it upsets you. Your Capricorn wants to make you happy and when you tell him directly what you need or what you dislike, he will do everything in his power to make sure he does not upset you in that way again.

, A Capricorn’s idea of a perfect relationship is one that empowers both individuals. Support him in his endeavors just as he will support you in yours. Because he is bound to be driven, you should have your own independent goals and ideas that you are working on. The best relationship with a Capricorn man comes out of being both supportive and independent.

, While a Capricorn man might be reserved in his day to day life, he can be a surprisingly passionate lover in the bedroom. Capricorns have an excellent attention to detail that also makes them great lovers. Meet his passion with your own.However, keep in mind that Capricorns are rather traditional - he will most likely not be into role playing, or other things on the kinkier side of the bedroom spectrum.

, This means throwing him a surprise birthday party is probably not the best idea. As you learned when trying to capture his attention, Capricorns only up to a select group of close friends and family. They take their time before letting others into their circle of trust. Because of this, a night out at his favorite bar with a group of his close friends, or a night at home spent with you, is more his speed than dancing at a crowded club or going to a party where he doesn’t know many people.


Your Capricorn guy will be really appreciative if you can take the lead in social settings that make him uncomfortable. Having an ability to be sociable is a great asset to a Capricorn.

, Capricorn guys enjoy functional things that aren’t particularly flashy. Rather than getting him that $2,000 watch with all those rhinestones, think along the lines of a Swiss Army knife or a grill for those backyard barbecues he loves so much.

, PDA (public displays of affection) are not really the Capricorn’s cup of tea. While holding hands is probably fine (he might even prefer holding hands because of his protective nature) making out in the middle of a busy street will probably make him feel a bit uneasy. Capricorns don’t really like having their private lives become public knowledge, so you may want to think twice before grabbing him by the suit lapels and giving him a smooch in public.This also applies to gossiping about your Capricorns. These guys are really private. If word gets back to him that you have been exposing the secrets of your relationship to everyone who will listen, he might feel betrayed or lose trust in you. Only discuss your love life with the friends you know you can trust.

Work on being your friend's biggest fan. Applaud his or her achievements and try not to feel jealous.Jealousy can often make it difficult to celebrate another person's success, even someone you consider a friend. However, it's very important that you are able to cheer you friend on. People want to be around positive people who make them feel good about themselves. Even if you're feeling a twang of envy, try to push past that feeling and offer a sincere, ""Congratulations."" You'll feel better if you do. You'll find it's much less exhausting to be happy for another person than harboring jealousy.
Do not just congratulate your friend on big achievements or milestones. You should also compliment your friend on small things he or she does that you appreciate. Remind your friend of his or her good qualities. For example, say something like, ""I love how you're always smiling"" or ""I appreciate how you always remember everyone's birthday."";
, Listening is the foundation of a quality friendship. If you know your friend is having a bad day, offer to let your friend vent to you. You do not have to offer solutions or even advice. Simply allow your friend to express his or her feelings without judgment.


If you're unsure what to say when listening, try active listening. This will allow your friend to feel more open expressing his or herself to you. You can reiterate what your friend says after he or she finishes talking, encouraging your friend to elaborate if necessary. For example, say something like, ""You feel really stressed about the way your brother behaved when he came to visit?""
Keep in mind that, while listening is important, you do not want to end up in a one-sided friendship. If you feel like your friend is always asking you to listen, but is never there for you in return, you may want to reevaluate the friendship. Being a nice friend is important, but you do not want to end up in a situation where someone is taking advantage of your good nature. If you listen to your friend, expect him or her to listen to you when you're in need.

, The little things help build the foundation of a strong friendship. Make the effort to remember the important events in your friend's life, like birthdays, anniversaries, and more.Always remember your friend's birthday. It can help to write a reminder in your smart phone. You don't necessarily have to go overboard with a big present each year. However, your friend may appreciate a nice phone call or card.
Does your friend have any other big life events that are important? Even sad events are worth of remembrance. For example, if your friend has lost a loved one, the death anniversary can be difficult. Try to keep this in mind, and shoot your friend a text letting him or her know you're there if he or she needs to talk.

, Loyalty is a very important aspect of a strong friendship. Jealousy, envy, bitterness, and distrust are all negative emotions than can affect your ability to be loyal. Try to rise beyond these sentiments and strive for basic loyalty.Avoid talking about your friend behind his or her back. Even if you're angry or upset about something your friend did, avoid venting your frustrations to others. Instead, try writing it out and later, when you're more calm, talking to your friend directly about any problems.
It can be hard to cope with negative emotions that can adversely affect loyalty. However, try to keep in mind the benefits of working past these emotions. What's more important in the long term? Momentarily satiating feelings of jealousy by trashing talking your friend, or building a strong lifelong bond?
One caveat is that loyalty, like listening, has its limitations. While you should be loyal to your friend and support his or her decisions, you do not have to be blindly loyal to someone who is behaving poorly. If, for example, your friend hurt a mutual friend's feelings, do not immediately jump to your friend's defense. It's important that you tell you friend up front if his or her behavior has crossed a line for you or another person.

, The Golden Rule states you should treat others as you wish to be treated. When interacting with your friends, pause and think about your actions. If you feel as if you're not treating your friend well, consider how you would feel if you were being treated in this fashion. If you would not appreciate the kind of treatment you're dishing out, you should cease to treat your friend in that way., Often, friendships are built around common interests. If there's something that drew you and your friend together to begin with, going back to this shared interest can help strengthen your bond.For example, if you and your friend met at a book club, try agreeing to read the same book. You can meet up once a week to discuss the book. Your friend will love having you there to share this experience.
You can also pursue shared interests further together. For example, if you and your friend met in college in a Spanish class, consider attending a Spanish club together. You can help build on your language skills as a pair.

, As time goes by, friendship can sometimes fall to the wayside. School, work, romantic relationships, and other commitments can put a strain on a friendship. However, if you want to be a nice friend, work on prioritizing the friendships in your life.Realistically, as life gets busier and busier, you will not be able to see your friends every day or even every week. However, make an effort to get together regularly. It can help to have a regular meet up time. For example, you can agree to have dinner together the first Tuesday of every month.
One thing to keep in mind is that you should not prioritize someone who does not prioritize you. You do not want to end up in a one-sided friendship. If you are always the one reaching out and making plans with a particular person, you may be better off tapering off contact. You can work on being a good friend to someone who appreciates your presence.
Even if time is an issue, you can still find ways to reach out. Many people find they can stay in touch via social media when life gets hectic. You can also make a point of calling a friend to chat once in awhile if you're too busy to go out regularly.

, People tend to bond when they laugh together. Your friend will enjoy your company more if the two of you are always laughing. Try to make laughter a priority when you hangout.Watch funny movies together or go to comedy clubs.
Make each other laugh. Do not be afraid to be a little silly or ridiculous. A true friend won't judge you for bringing out your immature side.
While laughter is important, try not to laugh at the expense of others. You do not want to build a friendship on mutual scorn or animosity. A person willing to laugh and judge others with you will probably not be a nice friend to you in return.

, Unfortunately, distance can sometimes keep good friends apart. In this case, you should make an effort to keep up contact. If your friend moves away for school or work, call or Skype regularly. You can make a plan of calling every other Thursday, for example. You can also strive to stay in touch with your friend through various social media outlets, like Facebook and Twitter.

, You may feel that being nice means always telling your friend how to fix his or her problems. However, this can make the friendship feel unbalanced. You're always the one with the answers, while your friend is always the one with the problems. Not only this, when your friend opens up to you, he or she may not always be seeking advice. Sometimes, people just want to vent and do not want guidance.Simply let your friend talk. Show you're listening by giving non-verbal cues, like smiling and nodding, to convey you're paying attention. Reiterate what she's saying on occasion to make sure you understood fully.
You should also help your friend bounce ideas off of you. Ask questions like, ""What do you think you're going to do?"" or ""Do you have any idea how to proceed?""
In the event you're genuinely worried about a decision your friend is making, it's okay to voice your concern. If your friend is considering doing something dangerous or illegal, for example, it's not a bad idea to express concern.

, A nice friend does not make people feel a debt. You should not hold onto things like who gave the best birthday present or who did the last favor. You should do nice things for your friend because you appreciate this person, not as a way to get favors in return.People often create petty barriers to friendship. For example, you may feel like you shouldn't invite your friend out on a Saturday night because you did so last week. In your mind, it's your friend's turn. However, some people just aren't great at making plans and prefer to simply go along with what others are doing. Your friend does not owe you an invitation because you extended one to him or her.
Try to keep in mind you and your friend have different strengths. You may feel like you're always the one hosting events, for example, but maybe your friend is always the one willing to bring over cookies and help with the clean-up.

, Being a good friend means you sometimes have to dish out harsh truths. You're not being nice by allowing a friend to repeat the same mistakes. When you see your friend is in the wrong or about to make a mistake, say so. While you may feel bad about this in the moment, in the long run your friend will appreciate your honesty.You do not have to be mean when you're telling your friend he or she is in the wrong. In fact, you should come into the situation from a place of love. Say something like, ""I'm worried about the way you talk about other people. I know you're a better person than this, and I wish you would be less negative about those who aren't around.""
Reiterate that you care about a friend after telling that person he or she is in the wrong. Say something like, ""I'm only saying something because I care about you and this behavior concerns me.""

, Conflict is inevitable in a friendship. If the two of you are close, you're going to get on one another's nerves. In the event of conflict, try to work things out maturely.If you hurt a friend's feelings, apologize. Even if you did not mean something the way your friend took it, if your friend was genuinely hurt, he or she deserves an ""I'm sorry.""
If you're upset by something your friend said, tell him or her directly. Do not talk about your friend behind his or her back. This will not resolve the issue and could create further tension.

Be creative.",How to Be a Life Coach," Fifty years ago you could get away with only having a high school diploma or GED, but the times they are a-changin'. Par for the course is at least an undergraduate degree from a four year university. While you don't necessarily need one to become a life coach, you'll be running up against people who have a Master's degree or even a doctorate, so it's best to go to college.


While ""life coaching"" isn't quite yet a major in itself, counseling and psychology very much so are. What's more, just because it isn't a major, doesn't mean there aren't classes available in it -- Harvard, Yale, Duke, NYU, Georgetown, UC Berkeley, Penn State, the University of Texas at Dallas and George Washington, to name a few, have all started coaching programs.;
, If you're already out of college and not looking to go back, the other route is taking life coach classes through an accredited school or program. The ICF and IAC (International Coaching Federationand the International Association of Coaching, respectively), have partnered up with certain schools and deemed the coaches they spit out worthy of their certification.


Those two organizations are about as legit as the field of life coaching gets. Make sure whatever school you go to works through one of these organizations. If not, it's either a scam, a waste of your money and time, or both.

, Once you have completed your school's coaching program, you are eligible for certification (either through the ICF or the IAC, depending on which your school is associated with). With that certification, you're basically good to go. Instead of telling people you're a life coach and hoping they don't ask about the details, you've got the cred to back it up.


This will be your bread and butter. No life coach can really succeed without it. If you have education on top of it, you'll be even better off. Just remember to include it on your business card!

, Because there's no life coaching equivalent to med school, seminars are a super common thing. To stay viable in the field, get familiar with all the big names, and to network, coaches are attending seminars left, right, and center. Your school should be able to get you started on when and where to find them in your area.


Use these to your advantage. Not only should you go home and try to really take in what was addressed (each seminar should have a different topic), but you should also talk to the people there. Having mentors (or at least friendly faces in the field) will be infinitely useful to you when bumps come up in the road. Someone's gotta show you the ropes!

, Let's just get this out there right outta the gate: while there aren't a ton of fees associated with becoming a life coach (in comparison to paying for a decade of medical school, say), there's a definite delay in income. Not only do you need something to keep the lights on while you're getting trained, but you'll need that savings while you get started, too. After four months of classes, people won't exactly be knocking down your door to pay you for advice. These things take time.


It could take years to build up a steady, sturdy clientele base. This is not a get-rich-quick scheme. While some life coaches can charge exorbitant amounts of money for just a quick phone call, most aren't so lucky. With less experience, you'll have to charge less money (in addition to having fewer clients). And you'll probably have to start out doing work for free -- so don't go flipping your boss the bird yet.

, While a few life coaches get hired by corporations and those businesses looking to improve their employee retention rates, most life coaches are self-employed.This means you'll handle your own paperwork and have to get bogged down by the business side of it all, but it also means you set your own schedule.


You'll need to pay self-employment tax along with invoicing all your clients yourself and establishing methods and schedules of payment (just to name a few). If you're unsure of all the bases you need to cover, talk to someone else who is self-employed -- or other life coaches! What a nice set-up for the next step.

, Just as therapists receive hours of counseling during their training, new life coaches need to get mentored by experienced coaches to supplement their training. Mentoring may occur in group sessions or with individual coaches over the phone if your school provides one for you -- or you may have to seek one out yourself. You've been networking, right?


The other side to this equation is that you need to see what a life coach actually does. You may think it's all, ""You're ruining your life -- do this instead,"" when it's really anything but that (if you're a good life coach, at least!). To get a better grip on what you'll actually be doing, you should have a life coach yourself.
If your school doesn't provide one for you (or at the very least give you a few names to hit up), find one either through your friends/school buddies/teachers or through a directory -- much like your future clients will find you.

, There are several online directories in which you can list yourself so that Internet wanderers may find you if they decide they'd like a little life assistance. There are tons of people out there you'll never reach by word of mouth -- putting yourself out there on the web is the only way to find them.


Most websites will charge a fee to put your image and information up. Make sure it's not a complete hoax/waste of time before you hand anyone your credit card information or money. There are plenty of scams out there, so step lightly.

, Some life coaches specialize in coaching people on defining visions for their lives and seeking ways to improve overall. Some coaches focus on helping clients choose and train for careers, while others coach executives in how to run their businesses; and still others coach clients in managing their interpersonal relationships. Decide on what area of life coaching you wish to specialize in (hint: it should be something you know personally). Here's a list of possibilities to start you off:Business coaching
Carbon coaching (helping others reduce their carbon footprint)
Career coaching
Corporate coaching
Executive coaching
Relationship coaching
Retirement coaching
Spiritual and Christian coaching
Time management coaching
Weight and body image coaching
Work/life balance coaching

, Now that you have the title ""Certified Life Coach"" behind your name, it's time to start handing out business cards, getting ads online, in newspapers, in community pages and journals, setting up a Facebook page, tweeting, heck, even plastering your name on the side of your car. The more name recognition you have, the better. People can't come to you if they don't know you exist!


Consider marketing yourself as a specialist. You've got your niche, right? What might your prospective clients be reading, viewing, or listening to? If you want to reach executives, you wouldn't post an ad at the local daycare -- but you might want to do that if you want to reach new moms or women balancing career and family life.
Studies have shown that coaching is just as great for employees as it is for employers. Companies that spend $1 on their employees (be it through coaching, personal wellness, etc.) make $3 in savings for decreased turnover and the processes that go with it.If you're considering walking up to a business and suggesting they provide you as a coach (and if you weren't, you are now), arm yourself with these facts.

, After you're fresh off the certification boat, you'll need some clients. However, with zero experience under your belt, they're going to be pretty hard to come by. In an exchange to be able to say you have experience working with living, breathing people, ask your friends and family members if you can work with them for free. You'll get your hours in and they'll get some much needed me-time (and hopefully some great pointers and a dose of reality).


How many and for how long you do this is up to you. The correct answer is ""until you feel comfortable charging for your services and confident that you can truly help others enrich their lives."" It could be weeks, it could be months. Luckily, there's no wrong way to go about it. However, waiting until you feel completely ""ready"" will delay the work of truly helping people, especially if you're a perfectionist. At some point, you're going to need to jump in and make the decision that you are running a real business.

, After a few months of working with your sister's coworker and your friend's friend's pizza delivery guy, eventually word of mouth will do its job. You'll get that first phone call that makes you jump through the roof. Congratulations! It's money making time.*Word of mouth is NOT something to depend on. You need to learn to market your business and set up a plan, not wait for others to talk about you. Get a business coach if you really want to run a business and not have a part-time hobby that barely brings in any money.


...But how much? Quite frankly, that's up to you. Do you want to charge a daily rate? A monthly rate? And what is that rate? Consider how steep the challenges are for this individual -- both for you and for them. What can they afford? What can you afford? What demographic do the majority of your potential clients fall into? When in doubt -- ask around about the competition! * You need to learn to charge for results, not by the hour or day. Worrying about what the competition charges and trying to undercut them is why very few coaches make money. You'll need to hire a business coach to learn the correct way to set up your services and price them so that you can make a good living and eventually quit your day job. It's also important to set up longer-term programs, and not just meet with a client one time or let them hire you monthly.

, When it comes to life coaching, there is no judging books by their covers. When a client comes to you, have the first session be an in-depth, cover-all-your-bases interview. What do they want from you? What part of their lives are they looking to change? What are their goals?


Most people will come in with an idea -- a very specific idea (hence the reason most life coaches have specialties) of what they want to accomplish. Whether it's weight loss, wrapping their minds around their blooming business, or tackling their relationship issues, they know. Let them guide you initially and listen.

, Once you set up a base of clients, it's gonna be easy to refer to one in your head as that-one-guy-who-drinks-coffee-addiction-who-still-has-narcolepsy. Don't do that. He won't like it. Keep portfolios of all your clients, get the details down, and keep them straight. If you don't stay organized, you'll end up missing a call with client number #14 who abandons you the next day.


It's also important to make them feel like they are your most important client. Every little detail they've told you needs to be something you remember and take into account when you're working with them. Not only will they be impressed and trust you more, but you'll be able to make more accurate decisions on what would help them if you keep your facts straight.

, You'll soon find what works best for you, but most coaches say they work with each client around 3 times a month.Some clients will require more work and some less, but three times a month is average. The length of time for each session is up to you and the client.


You don't necessarily have to do the sessions in person, though those are obviously the most personal. You could also do them over the phone or even via programs like Skype. If you're corporate or executive, you may find that your clients are traveling a lot and session over the phone are the only option. If you want to really be successful, you'll want to open up your business to clients all over the World. Skype is a poor option in many countries and areas as it drops frequently. Learn to use other systems such as Google Hangouts where you can meet face-to-face without the frustration of poor technology as with Skype.

, Life coaches aren't just expensive advice givers. That'd be terrible. It's about helping others explore their choices and figuring out what's best for them. It's only the bad life coaches that dispense advice and hang up. You're really working at changing the behavior -- which is about a million more times valuable than simply telling a client what to do.


No one else needs another person (much less a virtual stranger) telling them what to do with our lives -- we all get that from our in-laws, our siblings, and the occasional high school friend who thinks they know everything. You're answering the ""how,"" not the what. You can give them the process.

, To a certain extent, you're a teacher or guide. When you hang up the phone with a client, your job doesn't just end there. You have to make sure they're putting into action what you two have discussed. You need to give them homework. Whether it's exploring different business plans or talking to their ex-husband, you have to give them actions that lead to change. What would be best for them? And how do you make sure they do it?


You will have clients that don't cooperate. You'll have clients that don't agree with you. You'll have clients that think you're wasting their precious time. These will happen. You have to take the good with the bad and know when to cut your losses. If a client doesn't like your style, then it could be resistance and fear coming up. Don't take on a client you don't get along with, and you won't have these problems. As you work with more clients, you'll be able to discover in your discovery session whether or not you will be a good fit. If you don't know how to do a discovery session (it is NOT a coaching session), then you need to learn how to do one right away. See your business coach or group for help.

, In the end, that's ultimately what it is about. We all struggle with this thing called life and a life coach is there to shine the light for us down that dark, scary tunnel we're all wandering. If you've done your best to hit all their goals and have shown them the options, you've done your part. They'll be better for having worked with you.

, Much of the work a life coach does is helping people set goals and encouraging them to achieve them. This requires being someone who likes being in touch with people in a friendly manner. If you're a negative Nancy or a Debbie Downer or a Sad, Sad Sally, your clients will be running for the hills in no time at all.


Face-to-face contact is not always necessary to be a life coach, as many coaches work with clients over the telephone. However, it has many advantages: it is less inhibiting and therefore easier to build trust. It's convenient as it is global and flexible.

, Some of us (read: 99% of us) aren't always nice and understanding. Even if we think of ourselves as possessing these qualities, we still have the occasional slip-up. And sometimes it happens with a certain type more than another. That really pretty coworker may make us feel envious or that really dumb friend of Joe's just irritates us so much we become cold and aloof. Whether it's intellect, appearance, or just obnoxious laughs that get to you, you have to put that all aside and be willing and eager to help everyone.


You're probably going to have clients that you wouldn't walk across the street to have a 5 minute cup of coffee with in the next life. That's fine. We can't all mesh with everyone. But that's fine -- you don't have to have coffee with these people. All you have to do is help them. Help them and want them to succeed. Even if you find their personalities akin to fingernails on a chalkboard, still have their best interests at heart.

, Just like the previous step got at, you're not having coffee dates with these people. You are not grabbing drinks during happy hour before the game starts. You are there to push them, not to enable them like friends often do. It's important to keep this line clear to maintain a professional relationship. When you become their friend, they stop paying you.


When you cross the line from coach to friend, your clients will feel less of a push to do what you're suggesting they do. You'll also feel less inclined to be real with them -- one day you'll need to be harsh with them and they'll get personally offended if you're friends. It's just general good, logical practice to keep the boundaries clear.

, Our lives often take unexpected turns. You're likely to get a call at 9 on a Friday night from a client who would love to schedule a session the following day. If you can, work with them! They're not being disrespectful -- they're practically as surprised as you are. You won't have the most constant work schedule, but it definitely won't be your standard behind-a-desk 9 to 5 gig. * You need to set up appointments with your clients in advance, not let them wait until the last minute like this. Only by helping them plan longer term will they begin to organize their lives better and start making lasting changes. Allowing them to make last-minute changes or appointments is only enabling their bad behaviors and is not conducive to achieving positive results. Emergencies are one thing, but otherwise a good coach will have 2-4 weeks of calls scheduled in advance for each client.


In addition to being flexible with hours, be flexible in terms of an open mind. What you see working for this person may not be something that actually does. In the end, everything is relative. If they're not keen on something, you may have to respect their wishes. You are always working with a unique individual. Cater your program to them as specifically as you can, but leave a little wiggle room for improvement.

, In order to help people reach their potential, you've gotta be able to think outside the box. Odds are they've considered routes A and B and they haven't been good enough (for one reason or another) -- you have to present them with routes C, D, and E. They won't always be so obvious (or your client would have thought of them!); in order to be a successful life coach, you gotta be resourceful, creative, and imaginative.


That's not to say you shouldn't be logical. Nope -- you gotta be both. All in all, you gotta be zeroed in on the path to success. A healthy balance of reality mixed in with a have-you-thought-about-it-this-way attitude will get you far in the eyes of your clients. And when they're happy, you're happy -- and they might tell their friends, too!

"
Take action early.,
Tell your friend not to drive anywhere.,
Be firm.,
Remember who you’re talking to.,
Lay your feelings on the line.,
Get support from others.",How to Keep Your Friend from Driving Drunk1," Don’t wait until the end of the night when your friend might be tired and belligerent enough not to listen to you.If you can tell that your friend is well on his way to drunkenness and characteristically fails to see that he needs to relinquish his keys, act early on so that you don't make a scene or cause unnecessary conflict.


The worst thing that could happen is that you were a bit too cautious and end up returning the keys with a laugh to your now-sober buddy.;
, You may need to be more assertive than you're used to, and even handle accusations that you're spoiling the fun or trying to be controlling. Be prepared to be talked back to, and don't take rude charges personally. Remembering that it's the alcohol talking, stay polite and calm. Tell your friend that you care about him and that this is why you must try to prevent him from creating a situation where he or others are in harm's way.


Always refuse to get in the car with your friend. This can be another gesture to show him that you are serious about not trusting his ability to operate a vehicle.If the situation allows for it, pepper your talk with some jokes or light comments. While firmly maintaining that he not drive, you can still say things like ""Man, we'll be talking about this night for a long time!"" or ""Good thing I'm just as stubborn about this as you are!"" This will make you sound a little less insistent and parental.
If there is someone else around who is a closer friend to your buddy than you are, inform them of the possible danger. Your friend might listen better to someone who he is more comfortable with or has known for a longer time.

, You may not be sure whether or not you are getting through to your friend, but it is important to stick by your warning. Ask your friend to repeat back to you what you said to make sure that they have a minimal grasp on what's going on. For example, ""I am asking that you not get in the car right now, and we are willing to help you make other transportation arrangements. Do you understand?"" If your friend tries to shrug off your concern, don't let up--keep giving any arguments or reasons you can come up with to convince him not to get in the car.


Speak softly and calmly to punctuate to give your firm warning a smooth, clear delivery.
Steer clear from saying anything embarrassing or belittling to avoid drama and possible physical conflict. For example, don't say ""it's such a drag that you can never hold your liquor"". Instead try something like ""we all want to see you leaving this party safely"".
Resist your friend’s alternative suggestions, like drinking some coffee or taking a cold shower first. These methods don’t work to get alcohol out of your system.

If these options are discussed, remind you friend that even if these make him feel confident enough to drive, he could still get a DUI just because of the amount of alcohol still in his system.



, Because the friend you’re trying to convince is in fact inebriated, make sure that you speak slowly and explain things very clearly. Try to do this while also avoiding sounding too condescending. If he feels talked down to, he may feel too proud to take your advice.Don't get swept up trying to make sure that your friend listens to and heeds everything you're saying. The point is not to be right or to get your way, but to prevent drunk driving by any means, with as little conflict as possible.
Instead of making assumptions, as in the argument, ""Come on, man, you know the law..."" say something like ""You know, driving when you've had so much to drink is illegal and could get you in serious trouble. Even if it seems like you're driving fine, the cops set up road blocks on heavy party nights. The cops could give you a breathalyzer test when they see your eyes or smell your breath. You could get a DUI, get your car towed away, and lose your license. Then you're looking at penalties and jail time even for the first offense. It's not worth it, man."", Sometimes the best way to get through to someone who's very drunk is simply to have one of those soul-bearing talks. Sit your friend down and show that you intend to say something very important. Tell him as sincerely as possible how much you care about him and how special he is to you.


Let him know that it would destroy you to know that you could have prevented a major accident, and this is your best shot. Express your love and concern, pulling from a real place of worry for your friend.
Say something sincere, like ""Look, buddy, we've been friends for a long time and I've grown to care about you too much to see you hurt yourself.""

, Sometimes convincing your friend alone just isn't going to happen, and providing a strong coalition of sober people might help persuade him not to drive. This way, even if you can't get your friend to see reason, there will be enough people committed to the cause to make sure that he is restrained somehow. However, force should only be used as a last-ditch measure.


Be polite and honest when seeking the help of others. To avoid drama and embarrassing your inebriated friend, make sure to give a clear, unbiased account of what's going on. Explain that you are concerned for his safety and would like help making sure that he doesn't injure himself or others by trying to drive home.
Stay calm, but let whoever you ask for help know that you will see that drunk driving does not happen with or without the help that you are asking for.

Choose a designated driver.A designated driver takes the pressure off everyone for the night and introduces certainty as to who can and cannot drink.,
Take away the keys.,
Call a cab.,
Use public transit.,
Initiate a slumber party.,
Drive your friend and his car back home.",How to Keep Your Friend from Driving Drunk2," Try to work out a designated driver before all drinking starts, if possible. By accepting responsibility in advance, you do your friend a huge favor and, in turn, your friend can take on the burden another time.

, Hiding your friends keys may be a solid route to take if you are unable to convince him not to drive by talking it out. This can be done a few different ways. You can try to make an excuse to your friend directly, by saying that you need to get something from the car or use it to run a quick errand. Consider the following tricks, too:


Tell your friend that you need their car to go to the liquor store. Depending on how drunk your friend is, he will likely forget soon after. Even if you tell your friend that you changed your mind and won't go, avoid bringing up the keys that are now in your possession.
Or, simply be patient until your friend is distracted talking to someone else and find his keys. Hide them, but don't forget to keep track of where they are!
If you do get the keys, consider moving the car to a spot that is not easily visible. This way, even if you cannot convince your friend not to drive, he will get frustrated from not being able to find the car and hopefully give up his search until the next morning.

, If it doesn't seem like a good option to keep your friend around or keep matters in your own hands, it may be in everybody's best interest to call a cab. Always pay for the cab in advance to avoid further complication, and make sure that the driver has explicit directions.


It's even better if you have the time to accompany your friend home to make sure they get back okay. Promising to accompany him before he leaves may even make him give in and accept the ride more easily.
Remember that even thought paying for cab fare may be expensive, it will always be cheaper than the cost of getting a DUI or dealing with the fallout of a car wreck., If you know that your friend's house is accessible by public transportation, map the route there. Avoid routes with lots of walking, as it may be difficult to keep your friend moving. The more help you have, the better, so bring other willing friends on the journey to take your drunk friend home. If enough people come, he may even have fun along the way and any tension about not driving will dissipate quickly.

, In many cases, the easiest thing to do is simply to entice your friend into staying the night at the house. If you're the host, this is no problem, but if you're elsewhere always make sure to get the necessary approval. Alternatively, you can invite your friend to come crash at your place when you leave instead of driving back home. For either possibility, use a good incentive like homemade breakfast burritos in the morning or the guarantee of a warm bed.


If there is a comfortable place to sleep, show your friend where it is. He may become totally convinced not to drive when faced with the reality of diving into that sweet, soft sleep spot.

, If you drove to the party as well, get a sober friend to follow you in your car. This way you can return safely to the party. Your drunk friend gets to sleep in his own bed, with the car parked conveniently outside of his home. As a bonus, you'll spare him the potential embarrassment of having to show up at the scene of last night's party to retrieve his car.


If worse comes to worst, you can always call your parents, or even law enforcement, for a ride.While you may get flack from other party-goers for doing this, it is still better if the party is remembered for getting broken up rather than for a tragic drunk driving incident.

,How to Date a Capricorn Woman1,
"
If you want to sweep someone off their feet, know that this is the sign for you.,
Get to know them.,
Go for it.,
Don't bother with games.,
Make them feel at home.,
Accept that your Cancer is old-fashioned, traditional, and loyal.,
Know that they may have trust issues.,
Realize that Cancer needs to be needed.,
Get ready to be supremely cared for.,
Always be reassuring.,
Mean what you say.,
Be direct.,
Sort through their bundle of complexities.",How to Date a Cancer," Cancer women are the definition of the woman waiting for her knight in shining armor. She loves romance, intimacy, and being openly cared for. Cancer men will be romantic and courtly, lavishing you with gifts and coy praise. Though they move slowly, romance is in their hearts.


Cancer needs to be shown that you are the real deal. In order to get the ball rolling, you'll need to give it a push first. So grab your white horse and get to trotting. Cancer, in all its dynamic glory, is worth it.;
, Because Cancer is such a cautious sign, it will serve your relationship best to get to know them before you demand any higher level of romance or intimacy. Becoming friends first will allow them to slowly fall for you.


Cancer is a very physically affectionate sign. Complement your relationship with small touches, hugs, and subtle -- yet significant -- displays of affection. Warm them up to your touch. They'll love to reciprocate.

, If you're a girl, you might need to make the first move instead of waiting for him to do it. If you're a guy, be aware that she might have to take more time than normal before she is ready to kiss you. This doesn't mean they're not into you, it just means they need to be drawn out of their shell!


Never ask them out in public, as this will make them feel nervous. Ask them out in private. Invite them on a casual, yet fun, date. Nothing with too much pressure or too many stigmas.

Just because someone is a Cancer doesn't mean they can't have fun. Try taking them to the beach or swimming pool, since this is a water sign.



, Cancers are super intuitive when it comes to people and their motivations, so don't waste your time playing hard to get, cat and mouse, or any other variety of mind game. They'll see right through you and know you're not being genuine.


Cancers, if they feel comfortable, will be direct with you. They need you to be direct with them, too! If you're presenting an image around them or trying to be mysterious, they will not be having it. They're super good at reading people, so don't even think about hiding your emotions!

, Cancers are huge on family and feeling at home. Generally, they prefer staying at their home, but if you can make them feel comfortable anywhere, you're in. Let them know they are a part of your home and have free reign over the territory, too.


Talk to them about your family. Let him or her know that you value yours and are a family man/woman. They'll take solace in knowing that you two are of like minds. Family is very important to them and nothing will ever change that.

, These aren't bad things! In fact, they can be quite positive. When you nab a Cancer, they will be loyal to you to the moon and back. They expect you to be the definition of romance: loving, kind, maybe a bit conservation, and just as loyal as they are. Nothing wrong with that!


When it comes to getting them in bed, they may be a bit vanilla. More romantic and sensual than spicy and exotic. But if you get them to trust you, they will be willing to open up their world. As long as you show them it's safe!

, Though trust issues are really a human thing, Cancers usually come with them right outta the gate. They want to trust others, they just find it hard. Especially with their great memories and their ability to hold grudges because of it. However, they love to love others, so it's very much so a give and take.


This is probably Cancer's main drawback. It can be hard to crack their shell. But if you're willing to put in the work, it can be totally worth it. You'll find a soft, sensitive core that will put you above everyone and everything else.

, If this sign were given one label, it would be ""nurturer."" This is their default -- the only way they know how to operate. So be willing to lean on them! They love it. They thrive on it. Be open with your needs and they'll seek to fulfill them. It makes them happy!


Let them take care of you when you're sick. Talk to them about a problem when one pops up. Ask them their advice for an issue at work or with your friends. Heck, let them cook you dinner! Pretty good trade, huh?

, Cancers are the most nurturing of all the signs. If you want a relationship that's more of the anxious and avoidant type, Cancer is not for you. They will love showing you romance and affection. Hopefully you can reciprocate!


This isn't to say that they're clingy. While they can be, it's so genuine it's hard to hold it against them. They just want to be around you and show you how much they care. It's almost admirable. If only everyone loved like a Cancer can!

, Don't play hard to get -- Cancer will probably think you're not interested and don't care about them. If they seem to be feeling a bit insecure about themselves or the relationship, don't hesitate to comfort them. They'd do the same for you!


They will not tolerate a temper on your behalf. If you get angry or upset at the little things, they'll think you're not being rational and seeing the big picture. If you get too angry at them, they'll think you don't care. They can be quite sensitive when they feel vulnerable.

, Cancers put a lot of weight in words. If you offer them a declaration of love, they'll take it as a declaration of love. So mean what you say. If you want to get a Cancer in bed, don't tell them you love them. Don't sugarcoat. It won't get you anywhere!


If you don't mean what you say, they'll probably see through it anyway and deem you a liar. While you may not view it as lying, they will. So choose your words wisely. Cancer will remember what you say!

, Cancer may not be open with you initially, but once you get under the shell, they'll expose their inner selves to you and expect honesty that rivals their own. So be direct! Let them know how you feel. You'd appreciate the same behavior back, wouldn't you?

, Cancer is the crab. They have a hard exterior that's very difficult to crack through, but underneath is a person that's sensitive and emotional. They can at times come off very weak, but also be strong and independent. In short, they're a very dynamic, unpredictable sign. Can you keep up?


They are very complex and can be quite fragile. Upset a Cancer and they'll be upset for days. When they feel safe and loved they are incredibly successful, wonderful human beings. When they feel vulnerable, they shut down and clam up. It's up to you to draw out the greatness inside them.

Advocate for change.",How to Be an Ally," One of the most important parts of being an ally is practicing acceptance. To truly support your friends, work on being non-judgmental. Being open minded requires you to examine your own opinions and focus on being accepting. Push aside any preconceived notions or worries you might have.Maybe you have a good friend who comes out as gay. It is not your job to question anything about this.
Instead, try saying, “I’m really glad you shared this with me. Please let me know how I can support you.”
Avoid saying things like “Why?” or “Are you sure?”;
, If your friend is feeling oppressed, they likely need some support. Show them that you care by actively listening. When your friend talks, demonstrate that you are listening by maintaining eye contact and making gestures such as nodding your head.You can also show your support by asking questions and acknowledging what you’ve heard.
If your friend says, “I’m getting made fun of at school because I’m Jewish.”, you can say, “That must be hard for you.”

, When you are an ally, you need to make an effort not to isolate anyone. When you plan social activities, make sure not to purposefully exclude people. Work on being kind to everyone.If one of your friends says, “I don’t want to come to your party if you’re inviting gay people”, you can respond by saying, “That’s too bad that you feel that way. Jane and Tom are my friends, and they are welcome in my home, just like you. I will not uninvite them.”

, The words that you use are really important. Take care to use the terms that your friend wants you to use. If you’re not sure what to say, it’s best to ask instead of accidentally offending someone.Maybe you have a transgender friend and you are not sure what pronouns to use. You can just say, “I want to make sure I use the pronoun of your choice. Should I use he, she, or they?""
Don’t be nosy. You might want to know details, but think before you ask. You can think “Do I need to know this information in order to treat them with respect?”

, Remember that your perspective might be different from your friend's. Or maybe you didn’t actually witness the situation that upset them. The best way to be an ally in this situation is to let your friend know that you believe them.Maybe your friend was a victim of sexual assault. They might be afraid of reporting the crime because they don’t have proof. You can say, “I’ll stand by you. I believe what you have told me.”
Allow your friend to guide the conversation and just be willing to listen to them. Having someone who is listening to them non-judgmentally may be all they need.

, These days, there are a lot of opinions being shared on social media. People also post a lot of information from a wide variety of sources. It’s not your job to patrol the entire internet, but you can do your part to stop negativity on your social media accounts.For example, maybe a friend posts an anti-Muslim joke on your wall. You should delete the post, and send your friend a message saying that those types of comments are not funny or welcome. It is important to let people know your beliefs or they may keep saying or doing things that are offensive to you.

, You might be wondering about what it means to be oppressed. Take some time to learn about groups that are typically oppressed. These include non-Christians, people of color, members of the LGBT community, and sometimes women. Learning more about these groups can help you better understand what is offensive.Read reputable sources. This way you can be informed when it comes to what your friends post.
Being informed will help you recognize obviously biased or intolerant information.

, You get to decide who can comment or post on your accounts. Whether it is Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, or Twitter, you have the right to decide who you interact with. You should block people who repeatedly post offensive things.You can also report them to the site administrator. If blocking doesn’t work, for example, report the user to Facebook.

, It’s important to look for negative posts by others. It is equally important to be aware of what you write yourself. Before you hit “Post” or “Send,” take a minute to read over your words. What seems funny to you might be offensive to someone else. If what you have written is controversial, then it might be best not to post it at all.


Make sure that you haven’t inadvertently been judgmental towards an individual or group of people.
Don’t post information unless you know that it is accurate.

, Social media can be a great way to show your support for your friends. Try making supportive comments. For example, if your friend posts that they went to the Women’s March, you could write something like, “Good for you! I’d love to hear about your experience.”


You can also make positive posts of your own. For example, share a link for an article about how to be an ally., What you say and do is important. It is important to stand up for what you believe, even if it is in a small way. But you can also help encourage others to say and do the right thing. If you see or hear something that is oppressive or offensive, you should speak up. Use your words to show that you are an ally. Most simply, you can just say, ""Stop.""Maybe you are in the break room at work and you overhear someone make an offensive joke about women. You could say, “Please don’t say those kinds of things around me. They are offensive and inappropriate.”

, Sometimes you might need support in order to be an effective ally. If you’re a kid or a teen, turn to a trusted adult for support. If the other kids on your basketball team are using racial slurs, don’t be afraid to tell your coach.Even adults might need help with this. If necessary, report offensive comments by your coworkers to your boss or to HR.

, It’s great to want to be an ally for your friends. It’s also important that you stick up for other people, too, even if you don’t know them personally. Try to find ways that you can use your voice and actions positively.Maybe you don’t personally know any immigrants. You can still be an ally by donating clothing or household items to an organization that helps immigrants get settled in their new homes.

, Use your voice to help provide information for others. By helping to educate people about oppressed groups, you are fulfilling a key function of being an ally. The first step is to make sure that you are fully informed. Maybe you want to learn more about the rights of the LGBT community. Try contacting the local community center and asking what resources they recommend. Once you are informed, you can begin passing that knowledge along to others. If someone at a party makes an uninformed comment, you can say, “Actually, gay marriage has a higher success rate than marriage between two straight people.”
You can also educate your kids. Try saying, “Even though Abby used the word ‘homo’, we don’t do that in our house. It might hurt someone’s feelings.”
It is especially important to educate children early on and correct them as needed so that they do not grow up with faulty beliefs.

, Allies are really important in helping secure rights for others. There are several ways you can use your voice for good. Contact your representatives and tell them you don’t support immigration bans that target certain religions.You could also signs petitions, help make phone calls, or post flyers about important legislation.
Make sure to vote as well! This is the best way to make your opinions count.

Ask them what's up.,
Ask your friend what sort of help they might want from you.,
Start working on getting your friend active.,
Choose an activity that you think will work as a starting step.,
Offer to spend some quality time with your friend.,
Keep building up the motivational activities.,
Keep in touch.",How to Motivate a Friend Who Has the Blues," If you're not already aware of their problem (such as the death of a loved one, loss of a job, etc.), it's important to understand what is demotivating them first. If you are aware, you'll be ready to offer advice and help that is aimed at successfully helping them through their distress.


Some people might be reluctant to talk about what's bothering is. Reassure your friend that whatever it is, they can tell you whenever they're ready.;
, That way, you can be of real assistance should they come up with exact needs. This won't always happen, of course, but it is worth asking so as to not appear to be running roughshod over their own wants and ignoring their feelings.

, Once you're aware of the underlying reasons and whether or not they have any concrete needs in mind, it's time to turn into ""helper motivational mode"". Write down a list of things that you know they used to enjoy doing. Assess this list against:


Likelihood of your friend's current interest in former activities (for example, if they loved motorcycling but a buddy died while out motorcycling together, your friend may not want to try it again for a while)
Cost (maybe you can shout an unemployed friend or remind them of free activity opportunities)
Availability of activity (is it close, far away, convenient or otherwise?)
Your ability to be involved (e.g., going to the event/activity with your friend, dropping off and picking up your friend, taking others as well, etc.)
Need for regular dedication (e.g., joining a club, sports team, etc.) and the likelihood of your friend sticking with this
Other factors that you can think of that might impinge on the success or otherwise of your helper plan.

, The activity needs to be doable in a short period of time to begin with; you can build up to more active, lengthy activities as your friend's motivation begins to return. Choose whatever will not make your friend feel exhausted, worried, or afraid to do.

, It might be a movie night-in together, a dinner together at your house, a walk down the beach together, a shopping trip, etc. It is most important that you make yourself available for your friend so that they can be with someone that they trust and can rely upon.

, One time a week, two times a week, three times a week, etc. As you see your friend becoming more motivated again and feeling safe and comfortable in getting out and about, gradually curtail some of your involvement. You might, for instance, offer to drive them to their Pilates class but not to join in with it anymore.

, As well as activities, stay in touch by phone, texting, email, and small, short notes that praise your friend's good points. Let your friend know that you care, that you're available when needed, and that there is always light at the end of a bad period of life. And mostly, that friends are there for the long haul.

Provide feedback upon request.,
Make your friend’s resolution your resolution.,
Consider trading resolution duty.,
Offer to provide educational resources to assist your friend with his or her resolution.,
Get support from loved ones and friends.,
Continue being your friend's cheer squad.",How to Help Your Friend Stay Real About Their New Year's Resolutions," Although your friend has asked you to keep him or her on track, don’t nitpick or provide unsolicited advice at every turn. Being on your friend’s resolution team means that you are supportive when your friend reaches certain goals and provide a shoulder to cry on when he or she misses the mark. It also means being ready with encouragement to get back on track, to help your friend see that erring is part of the overall progress toward the goal.


Offer positive feedback when he or she least expects it. If the resolution was to lose weight and your friend looks extra good, tell him or her, especially if they don’t ask.
Be constructive with negative feedback. If you see your friend going off track, take a gentle approach to pulling him or her back from the edge. For example, instead of telling your friend that he or she is eating too much or smacking the food from his or her hand (if the resolution is to lose weight), ask your friend how many “points” or calories are in the food he or she is currently eating. Gently leading your friend to draw their own conclusions will be the most effective method for encouraging their commitment.
Avoid making your friend’s resolution the main topic of conversation. If your friend wants your support, provide it but don’t make it the main attraction. Discuss the resolution when prompted by your friend, but don’t bring it up on your own.;
, Put your money where you mouth is and join the crusade if it's applicable to your life. Studies have shown that we influence our friends just by being a certain way or through what we do.In particular, our weight can influence the weight of our friends; if we're overweight, this provides ""permission"" or ""social acceptance"" for our friend to be the same way. The same might be said for working too hard, being slothful, cursing, drinking too much, taking drugs, etc.; we can imitate the company we keep. If you're doing something that your friend is trying to overcome, it may also be in your own interests to change too, thereby helping both of you. For example, if both you and your friend have wanted to quit smoking for years, bond together and make it a joint effort. Motivating each other has real power. Before making the resolution:


Lay down the goals and rules for your resolution. Establish what you hope to achieve, when you want to achieve your goal and how you plan to get there––together.
Agree to call each other out if you fall off the horse. Determine language you can use to alert one another that you’ve regressed on your resolution. For example, you could tell your friend, “I think we’re going down the wrong path with this resolution” or “Did you smoke?” Also, identify times and places that are off limits to discuss resolution shortcomings. Events packed with mutual friends or family functions may be off limits.
Avoid comparing progress, especially if you are sticking to your resolution and your friend is not. Don’t regress on purpose to make your friend feel better, but find a private place to ask your friend if he or she is having trouble keeping the resolution and why. Seek a solution together that will help your friend get back on track.

, One way to help each other and not just place all of the focus on one of you is to monitor each other's resolution. Each of you choose a resolution you want to achieve and share it with the other. Ask each other to be the mentor, support team, cheer squad, etc. for each other's resolution. This way, you both have stories to share, slippages on both sides to correct and joint celebrations when you reach your goals. Sharing the resolution can take off the pressure of one friend seeming to be overly scrutinizing the other; instead, both of you have a reason to be watching out for the other!

, In addition to your support, provide your friend with the tools and resources to help him or her succeed. Ideas include:


Signing up for webinars or online classes that will aid in your friend’s progress. For example, if it’s weight loss or reducing spending habits, identify a comprehensive webinar or live seminar your friend could watch or participate in, in order to glean insightful information that will help with goal attainment.
Research methods or techniques that have worked for other people. For instance some people respond to hypnosis to shape behavior. Offer to pay for your friend to visit a hypnotist or purchase hypnosis CDs.
Find apps, videos and other resources that your friend can download to their phone or electronic device and carry with them to give them motivation.
Seek friends or experts who can commiserate with your friend. If a mutual close friend achieved the goal that your friend is trying to reach, offer to arrange a meeting so your friend or expert can share insights and tips with your friend.

, With your friend’s approval, invite other friends and family members to help keep your friend on track with resolutions. Never ask others to help without your friend’s approval and also:


Ask your friend which friends or family members he or she would trust to help keep track of resolution progress.
What kind of support would be most helpful from additional friends and family. Some examples include asking friends and family to not sabotage your friend’s efforts (like not eating fattening foods around a friend who is dieting or smoking around a friend who is trying to quit smoking), providing positive comments when witnessing progress and celebrating small victories with friends.
Consider group support as another option. For example, if your friend is trying to exercise more regularly, suggest that your friend join a group that does exercise your friend likes. You might even join too if it's something that fits into your schedule and interest.
Sometimes you may be called on to defend your friend's choices if someone picks on them. For example, another friend might be insistent that your weight-losing friend have another portion or some food your friend can't eat on the diet. Help your friend by voicing your own preference not to eat too much or to prefer the healthy food too. Keep it civil and don't stress the reason as being your friend's resolution.

, Notice the milestones and celebrate them with enthusiasm. Leave gentle reminders that you care about their well-being and that you're always there for your friend. Most of all, connect by listening unconditionally. When your friend gets the blues or feels worn out by the actions needed to achieve the goal, simply listen and show that you are aware of their difficulties and struggle. Knowing that they have a receptive listener any time will make a lot of difference to their willpower.

Engage her about her work or personal projects.,
Subtly bring up your own professional achievements.,
Play to her sense of competition — gently.,
Give her thoughtful gifts that she's likely to use.,
Occasionally treat her to high-status outings.",How to Date a Capricorn Woman2," Capricorns are naturally ambitious, hard-working people. Most will enjoy discussing their professional goals and the progress they've made toward them. Try talking to her about whatever she's doing to get ahead in life — whether this includes a nine-to-five job or personal projects like art, writing, etc. — and don't be surprised if she's ready to talk about these things at great length.


Work may be a topic that you find boring, but don't have to sound like you're asking her robotic questions at a job interview when you talk to her about hers. In fact, with some creativity (and an air of gentle mischief), you can add a little flirty zest to these normally dry questions. Here are just a few examples:

Bland questions: ""Where do you work?"" ""What do you do?"" ""Do you enjoy that?"" ""Where do you see yourself in five years?""

Zesty questions: ""So, what's your plan for making your first million?"" ""What's your next step in life?"" ""Are you more of a Gordon Gekko person or a Lorenzo Anello person?"";
, Because they value ambition and determination, most Capricorns respect someone who's worked hard and achieved big successes. However, Capricorns are modest and conservative at heart, so they're unlikely to respond well to extravagant boasting.Instead, try dropping subtle hints about your accomplishments by working them into the conversation naturally. See below for a few examples:



Blunt brags: ""You see these shoes? These are real alligator skin."" ""We should go cruising in my new Bugatti this weekend."" ""I just won employee of the month at my dad's real estate business for the fifth time in a row!""

Subtle sweet-talking: ""I'm hoping to use my signing bonus to do something nice for us."" ""I only wear this watch on special occasions — I bought it for myself when I got my Master's."" ""I don't usually do this, but I like to enjoy something nice after things go well at work.""

, Capricorns aren't generally people who will shy from a little friendly sparring. Planning dates that involve some degree of competition can lead to great fun and some serious romantic sparks. However, intense, heated competition is a no-no. Too much competition can lead to resentment and, in addition, Capricorns aren't likely to enjoy the embarrassment of losing at a high-stakes game.



Good date ideas: Bowling, cards, mini golf, shooting/archery, arcade games, board games with drinks.

Bad date ideas: Street racing, one-on-one street rules basketball, high-stakes poker.
If you're dominating at your competition, it may be a good idea to let your date win at least once at whatever you're doing to prevent embarrassment. Try not to make it too obvious that you're letting her win — this can be more embarrassing than losing in the first place.

, Most Capricorns are practical people that are likely to appreciate a gift a little more for its value and usefulness than for its symbolic meaning. While a piece of jewelry or a bouquet of some fragrant flowers is almost always a sweet gesture, you'll want some of your gifts to be a little more down-to-earth. Try to get her things she'll get continued, long lasting use and enjoyment out of, rather than one-time thrills.


The ideal practical gift for a Capricorn woman depends on her personal hobbies and interests. For instance, if she enjoys drawing, try getting her a high-quality sketch pad and a set of professional pencils. If she's a natural-born athlete, get her a membership to an exclusive gym with the finest exercise equipment. There's no ""right"" answer here — it all depends on the woman.

, While Capricorns are unlikely to appreciate gaudy, ostentatious displays of wealth, they are naturally status-conscious and will enjoy sampling the finer things in life every once in a while.To celebrate special occasions (and sometimes ""just because""), make an effort to treat your Capricorn lover to a fancy time out.



Good date ideas: Museums, operas, fancy restaurants, film festivals, art shows, weekend getaways, wineries, etc.
Short on cash? It's possible to enjoy the finer things in life on the cheap if you're creative. For instance, try checking a local university's ""events"" website — it will usually be possible to see traveling speakers, attend book signings, and more for very cheap or even free.

Agree about your long-term goals early on.,
Give her the freedom to have some say in your plans.,
Let her determine the pace of the relationship.,
Treat her with respect.",How to Date a Capricorn Woman3," One of the biggest hazards to a successful relationship with a Capricorn woman is that, if your goals don't seem compatible, she'll probably simply move on. Save yourself the pain of having this difficult conversation after a years-long relationship by double-checking your long-term goals for compatibility within the first six months of your relationship or so. Questions that you'll want to be able to answer include:


Do either of you plan on getting married in your lifetime?
Do either of you want kids?
Do either of you want pets?
When do you want to settle down?
How much would you like to save and how much would you like to spend?
What major purchases would you like to make?
How do you plan on living your life?

, No couple's long-term plans align perfectly — some amount of compromise is necessary for a long-term relationship to work. When the time comes to start talking about which specific compromises you intend to make, be sure to make her an equal partner in the decision-making. Not only is this common courtesy — it's also a smart move for long-term happiness. Your partner is much more likely to respect your desires if you're willing to sacrifice things so that she can achieve hers.

, Unless you're a Capricorn yourself (or you have a temperament like one), there's a very good chance that your female Capricorn lover will take a longer time to warm up to additional commitments in your relationship than you will. Let her take her time. An initial reluctance to dive head-first into a new relationship isn't likely a reflection of her feelings toward you personally — it's a result of her naturally cautious, deliberate approach to life's decisions. Give her time to open up to you and you'll be glad you waited.

, This may seem like a no-brainer, but it's worth mentioning because this tends to be more important for a Capricorn woman than it does for the average woman. As noted above, Capricorn women are somewhat status-conscious. This means that they tend to notice when they're treated in ways that diminish their status and that they may get embarrassed about certain breaches of etiquette that other women might not even notice. Be respectful to your Capricorn lover — this doesn't mean that you have to be deathly serious around her, but it does mean that you'll want to act differently around her than you would around your closest friends. Things to consider include:


The language you use around her (especially with regards to crude words, etc.)
The way you speak about her in public
The way you talk to your friends about her
The minor courtesies you show her (holding her hand to help her up a step, giving her your coat when it's cold, etc.)

"
"
Don't be put off by her guardedness.,
Avoid coming across as needy or desperate.,
Avoid coming across as lazy or unmotivated.,
Conversely, avoid showy displays of dominance.,
Don't expect her to ""fix"" any deep-rooted problems you have.",How to Date a Capricorn Woman4," As noted above, Capricorns tend to be traditional, business-minded, somewhat conservative people. This can lead them to seem standoffish or even cold at first. Understand that, at the heart of every Capricorn, there's a person who's capable of deep emotion and compassion. While the average Capricorn may not be as open about her emotions as, for instance, the average Leo, she is still plenty capable of forming strong emotional bonds, given enough time.

, Capricorns pride themselves on not relying very heavily on others to achieve their goals. Since your Capricorn partner is likely to be an independent, driven soul, don't drag her down by constantly bombarding her with pleas for attention and affection. Instead, cherish the tender moments you do share, as these are sure to be genuine and unforced. In addition, be ready and willing to periodically entertain yourself — Capricorns won't die if they don't get to see you for a single day, so you shouldn't either.



Behaviors you'll want to avoid: Calling or texting many times per day, frequently asking for confirmations of her affection, acting jealously, attempting to alter her schedule.

, Few things are less attractive to a Capricorn than someone who refuses to at least try to solve their own problems. Don't let your Capricorn lover ever start to see you as a bum. Try to maintain ambitious professional goals, even if you can't achieve all of them. Similarly, don't take your relationship for granted — always show your partner that she's important to you. Make a sincere effort to put in hard work in your professional and personal life and she will value you for your efforts.


Sometimes, life deals difficult hands that force us to become less active than we previously were. For instance, illnesses, family problems, and unexpected layoffs may temporarily force you to take a less active role in achieving your goals. In these cases, don't give in to feelings of inadequacy — a smart Capricorn woman will be able to tell the difference between someone who won't work hard for their goals and someone who is temporarily prevented from doing so.


, With their independent-minded personalities, Capricorns do not like being controlled by their significant other or having this sort of one-sided relationship implied in any way. Take a hands-off approach to your partner's life — she should be free to make her own decisions and form her own opinions. Above all, she is not someone to be possessed, controlled, or otherwise trifled with. Be prepared to respect your Capricorn lover's independence or risk losing her.



Behaviors you'll want to avoid: Speaking for your partner at social events, apologizing for her opinions when they differ from yours, violating her privacy or personal space, trying to control her behaviors, etc.

, For better or for worse, Capricorns focus most of all on their own problems — not their partner's. While a good Capricorn woman will always be willing to offer compassionate words of support and a loving shoulder to cry on during difficult times, they generally won't be satisfied in a relationship where they're expected to spend all of their excess energies helping you. Capricorns expect their partners to be self-reliant and to get the help they need when they are truly in trouble so that it doesn't begin to affect the relationship.



Problems you won't want to unload on your partner: Depression, substance abuse issues, stress from family conflicts, workplace stress, mental health issues, risky behaviors, poor self control, difficulties from previous relationships, etc.

Reach out to them repeatedly even if they push you away.,
Be the calm one as they are already upset enough.,
Listen a lot, but do speak up now and then.,
Recognize different techniques for different hardship.,
Offer physical touch to your friend through a comforting hug.",How to Help and Support a Friend Through Any Hardship1," You can’t help a friend if you retreat when problems arise. To be a good friend, you need to be there for late night talks or tears. For some people, a friend’s hardship is an annoyance. That’s not really friendship.


Even if they say they want to be alone, at least make the offer. However, you should not force them to talk when they are not ready to do so. Give them the space they ask for, then reach out again. Several times. Don’t run away. Sometimes people aren’t sure what to say when a friend is going through a hardship, so they say nothing or distance. This could hurt your friend more.
The number one goal should be to offer support. Just knowing someone is willing to listen or offer advice or cares can make all of the difference to a friend going through hardship. Call, text or write and just ask, “How are you? Is there anything you need or that I can to do?”
Part of reaching out is just being available. Keep your cell phone on, and talk to them at 2 a.m. if they are in a crisis. Answer their texts. Don’t always be too busy to listen. Don’t feel you have to act differently. Pick the right setting, and avoid ambushing them if they aren't ready to talk. ;
, Be the rock in the storm they can cling to, and think of yourself as offering them an anchor. If you are also upset about the hardship, try not to let it show.


Do not freak out. This will only make the friend feel like the problem is bigger or unsolvable, so it will make them more upset. Recognize that some people just need to feel badly for awhile, and that’s okay.
Although you should show empathy, showing them that you pity them excessively might make them feel worse.
Don’t take impulse actions that might make the problem worse for the friend. After all, you don’t understand your friend’s problem as much as they do. Ask your friend before you do anything to help them rectify the situation. See how they feel about it (unless they are in danger or being abused, then you have to tell someone immediately).

, You should be a good listener, but it can also be helpful to a friend going through hardship if you talk. Part of good listening is showing empathetic eye contact.Tell them positive stories about others’ experiences and outcomes and your own if you think it will make things better. But pause, too, and make sure you listen. Sometimes people just need to let it out and vent.
Remember your friend is already hurting enough. Stay positive, positive, positive. It’s why they turned to you in the first place: For help. Let them ramble on for a while. Maybe they just need to get it all out. Even a sympathetic nod of understanding or a comment like, “I will help you get through this. You’re a strong person” can go a long way.

, You may need a very different response for someone grieving a death of a loved one compared to someone going through financial hardship, for example. So spend some time researching their particular situation.


If they are hurting financially, you could help them plan a budget, offer to look at their expenses with an objective eye, and suggest a financial counselor. Be very careful about loaning money to family or friends. It can ruin relationships.If they are grieving a death or any other loss, recognize that experts believe there are different stages of grief. The stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and, finally, acceptance. Connect your friend to credible, outside resources where they can get more help from someone who is an expert or trained in the area of their hardship. , Or gently touch their shoulder. Conveying empathy through physical touch is bound to make them feel a little better or at least cared for.


Sometimes all they need is a hug. No need to say anything - just open your arms and they'll hug you. Hold on for as long as possible as this will show them that you are there for them. Make them laugh.
Do a song or dance or tell a joke. Once they have started laughing it will be more easy for them to recover and think about what they should do.

Keep it about them, not you.,
Watch clichés that sound trite and don’t really help.,
Stay positive at all times, and can the negativity.,
Offer solutions to them so they can improve their problems.,
Accept that the friend might not listen.",How to Help and Support a Friend Through Any Hardship2," Although it’s okay to share your own experiences if you think they will convey empathy or help your friend, you should keep the focus squarely on the friend, not you. So resist the urge to regale them with stories about how you went through something worse.



Don't try to one up them on their problems by throwing in your own problem. Maybe you are being stalked at night by a killer clown wearing sunglasses. But this is the time to be focusing on your friend's problem like their spouse or career or whatever they are going through..
That doesn’t mean you can’t find common ground by reminding them of a personal experience you had that was somewhat similar and that you overcame. But resist the urge to imply you know exactly how they feel because every situation is unique, and keep your own stories to a minimum.

, We’ve all heard such clichés: “I understand how you feel” (even though you really don’t) or “it could be worse” when they feel absolutely awful. Instead of clichés, speak from the heart in a way that is individual to their experience.



Friendship is all about knowing how to use honesty effectively. When a friend is going through a hard time, you have to evaluate the situation and process through your own personal view. Put yourself in your friend’s place, and feel the emotions they are going through.
Say you are sorry for them, and let them express their feelings wholly. Avoid clichéd advice for situations, as they might think you don’t really care and might become sadder. Be realistic. Don’t say “it’s okay” if it’s really not. Instead, offer inspiration.

, Reprimanding friends by saying things like “I told you you should have done this sooner” or “how many times did I tell you that?” is going to make them hurt more. By the time the conversation is over, you would be sorry you said anything.


If a friend is repeating a negative pattern, you can quietly point this out by offering positive suggestions for how they can make a change rather than framing the point in blaming, negative language. Don’t be judgmental. That’s the bottom line. It won’t help, and it’s not the time.
Save the deep talk about how they did x, y, or z wrong for after they are out of the crisis moment. They need to be consoled when things have gone terribly wrong, not be made to feel worse. Do not say mean things to them like “I told you so” or “this is your fault.”
Picture this. You are ""Lindsay's"" best friend, and her parents are getting a divorce. You should be there to let her sob on your shoulder, spill her problems, or make her happy. But... She might also want some alone time. Make her a little care package, with movies, sweets, and things to make her laugh. Be a good friend, and help her through this hardship as you would want her to do for you

, Provide ways your friend can get through the hardship, as well as emotional encouragement. Help them see the positives that still remain in their life. Remind the friend that they don’t deserve whatever happened to them.


Try to do something, if possible, that would actually change the hardship your friend is facing. If you can’t find anything to do, try putting effort in and do something else helpful for your friend. For example, maybe they’re too distraught to make dinner. Bring them over a plate of food. Offer to babysit their kids – things like that.
Although you should offer constructive solutions, ultimately they need to make their own decisions about what to do. Let them draw their own conclusions and make their own decisions. Showing your genuine support will be the key here. Talk practical, never guide them if you aren't sure. Your overarching goal should be to listen, while occasionally providing constructive and positive solutions, advice or suggestions. You could provide all three if you are a particularly close friend.

, A good friend offers guidance and suggestions, while recognizing that the friend, even though they are close to you, may not be ready to accept your support. Ultimately people need to work through things – bad relationships, financial worry, a death, you name it – on their own time.


Understand and accept that your actions might not yield your expected results always. As a supporter, you should not be disappointed or discouraged by this.
Do help them try to identify the causes of their problems and pinpoint possible remedies for them. Use your experience, instincts, and other peoples’ advice. Say ""this is your life and you should do what you decide is best. But don't you think that ____ will lead to ___? Maybe you can ___? It's up to you though"" instead of ""that's an awful idea, you should ___"".

"
"
Report abuse or any issue that could affect your friend’s safety.,
Let them be sad for awhile, but not forever.,
Understand when this is getting out of your league.,
Distract them by doing something fun.,
Keep their problems private so you don’t make it worse if they are not in danger.",How to Help and Support a Friend Through Any Hardship3," Not all hardships are the same. If the hardship your friend is experiencing is a threat to his or her safety – say a physically abusive relationship or threats of self-harm – you must act.


Encourage your friend to tell someone in a position of authority more equipped to know what to do, such as a law enforcement officer or a therapist or religious leader or parent. If the friend refuses, and there is abuse occurring, talk to a person in authority on your own.
If the friend is underage, you need to tell their parent if they are suffering from abuse, including bullying. Bullying is emotional abuse, and you shouldn’t try to handle something like that on your own. Don’t try confronting the abuser, as that could put you in danger too. Tell an adult.

, Don’t force them to cheer up or get angry if they can’t break out of their doldrums. They’re hurting. Sometimes they just need to wallow in it for a bit. But if the wallowing is going on for an excessive amount of time, you should try other responses.


There comes a time when you might need a little tough love or you become an enabler. When is that point? When a significant amount of time has passed, and their continued sadness, grief, or depression is starting to have negative ramifications in other areas of their life, like work or school.
At first wallowing is natural. Later on, not so much, although how much time that means is individual. At some point, direct them toward considering solutions.

, If you need space from the issue at a certain point because they aren’t healing and every conversation is about wallowing in sadness month after month, you might need to suggest a tougher intervention.


Learn the signs of clinical depression , and if your friend has it, suggest getting help from a professional, such as a therapist or doctor.
Remind them that you are not trained to be their therapist. Nor can you carry their problems on your shoulder forever. At a certain point, a little tough love in the form of a constructive solution or an honest reckoning of what you observe can help them more.

, Try to find ways to distract them from the issue for awhile. Maybe ask them to go to a movie with you. It will get them out of the house, and they will forget about their troubles for a few hours at least.


Distractions help a person gain perspective. Balance the wallowing and the distraction, though. Understand, at least in the beginning, that they might want to sit in their livingroom in a pair of pajamas instead.
Get them some comfort food like ice cream or chocolate or their favorite foods. Bring it over to their house, and keep them company. Remind them of their achievements. Share a positive quote. To some degree carrying on with life as usual at a certain point can be healing for people. So don’t vary routines too much.

, When a friend confides in you about a hardship, they are conveying a sense of trust in you. If you violate that trust by sharing their business elsewhere, you aren’t a good friend.


The exception – and this really important – is for situations involving abuse, bullying, or any circumstance in which your friend is in danger, including emotionally. In those cases, you must tell someone in authority – a parent, a cop, or a therapist, for example.
In other situations, don’t be a gossip. Don’t allude to their problems on social media or tell other people in your circle of friends, even if it’s under the guise of trying to get them more help.

Set up a time and place to meet in person.",How to Become Friends with Someone You Don't Know," This is often the first step in starting a conversation with someone you don’t know. By giving them your name, and asking theirs, you create the opportunity for more conversation. If you are at a formal event, this can be done in a more professional manner such as, “Hi, I’m Mike with AT&T,” or if the occasion is less formal you can simply say something like “Hi, I’m Mike.” Once you introduce yourself, the other person will likely be compelled to do the same.;
, Keep it simple, but ask a question that requires more than a one word answer. If this is your first time meeting someone, don’t lead with “So, how many kids do you plan to have?” You should act comfortable with the person, but being overly personal might cause them to become defensive. Try something a little more shallow, like “Have you seen the new Star Wars movie,” instead.It can also be a good idea to compliment them.

, Now that you’ve learned something about your soon-to-be friend, it is your turn to share. Opening up to someone will make them feel like they know you better and they will be more willing to open up to you. Be sure to keep your sharing on about the same level that they are sharing. You should maybe mention what you thought about the new Star Wars movie, rather than jumping right into your deepest secrets., For some reason, you have both ended up in the same place at the same time. This event could be a great conversation starter. Ask them what brought them there today (unless it’s something like a mandatory business meeting, then the answer is obvious). You can also reflect on the situation, saying something like “I came to see the exhibit today because I really enjoy the museum of natural history.”It’s a good rule of thumb to be positive. Saying something like “Man I really hate coming to these stupid meetings every month,” might make you seem pessimistic and cause the other person to have reservations about starting a friendship.

, Sometimes you will gain context clues through your conversation that will tell you a little bit about the person’s interests. You can also gain context clues from where the meeting has taken place, what they are wearing, and any piece of the environment around you. Use those to make a guess at something that the person has an opinion about (regardless of what the opinion is). Whatever common interest that is, it can be a great conversation starter.For example, if you are at business conference, you can assume that they do some kind of work in a similar field. Ask general questions about the field that you both work in.

, The more attentive you are to the person, the more opportunities you will see to offer help. This could be something large, like introducing them to a potential employer. You can also offer immediate help, like helping them clean up after an event. Whatever help you offer, the gesture will usually be well received.Do not be pushy about helping someone. If they insist that they do not need help, allow them to thank you for offering and simply tell them that the offer stands.

, This can be tricky no matter what situation you are in. If you are at a social event, asking for a phone number or other information too soon might make you seem clingy. In business events it can make you seem desperate and overzealous. You should only exchange information once you have had a conversation with the person and made a connection of some kind.Do not give them your information unless they ask. Instead, if you are interested in following up, ask them for their information. This way, you are in control of the follow up.

, All nice run-ins have to come to an end sometimes, but that doesn’t mean you have to go back to being strangers. Ask your new potential friend if they’d like to do something together sometime. This can be either social or business.You might ask them to join you for cookout if you are looking to make a social connection. If you are looking to make a business friend, you might invite them to a conference you are hosting or attending.

, Once you and your friend reunite, you will need to make that event memorable as well. Make an effort to connect with the person again, this time sharing and asking a little more than last time. This will allow you both to know each other a bit better and likely lead to another get together of some sort., You do not need to talk to your friends every day. You should talk often, though. There is no set rule for how many times per month or year you communicate, but if it feels like it has been too long since you talked, it probably has been. Texting, emailing, and social media are often much easier to manage than phone calls., Unless you work with your friend or live close to each other, you probably won’t see each other daily, or even weekly. You should make an effort to spend time together as often as you both can, though. This allows you more opportunities to bond and create a more personal connection.

, While there is no set rule for how much time you spend together, it is important to make that time be memorable. Put away any distractions that would prevent you from bonding with your friend (like a cell phone). Focus entirely on your friend and the time that you are spending together, and they will appreciate you even more., With social media, friends are just a click away ― sort of. Depending on the platform you are using (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) you can take different actions to befriend someone, if their privacy settings allow it. If you want to say something very specific, it might be best to message the person privately first. Otherwise, you can follow them or add them as a friend., If you are sending a message to a stranger, this should be the first thing you do. If you are adding someone as friend or following them on some social media platform, you should follow up with a message as soon as they accept or acknowledge that you reached out. They will likely want to know who is trying to be their friend and why., In some cases, such as celebrity profiles, this is obvious. Other times, the person might not be sure why you are trying to add them. Many people are suspicious of strangers on the internet, and if you want to avoid being shrugged off, you need to make an impression. Following your introduction, tell the person exactly why you added them and what you hope to share with or learn from them. This can help make the more receptive to your efforts., This will help put the person at ease about your intentions. If you added them and mentioned that you have the same profession and notice something they were doing well, the common interest and flattery is likely to get their attention. If you simply add someone and say “Hi, I want to be your friend because I saw your profile,” they have no idea what your motivation for reaching out to them is.Dating profiles can be a little different. Usually, reaching out to someone “because you liked their profile” is more acceptable in this sense.

, Once the person is comfortable responding to you and having a conversation, keep them engaged with questions. Make sure that your questions stay pretty on topic with your reason for adding them in the beginning, but you can start to explore other topics once you both get comfortable talking. Do not reference too much of their profile or try to comment on everything that they do. This may make people uncomfortable., If you have been talking online and mutually agree that you should meet in person, then set a time and place! Now, you and your new friend will have the chance to share things with each other face to face and create an even deeper connection. Keep in mind that things might still be a little strange the first time you meet in person. When all else fails, go back to a successful conversation that you had online."

, Most people will answer back.

, You don't want to make the person feel like you are befriending them only out of pity. They may be quiet, but most likely they aren't stupid. Pretending to be nice will only embarrass them, and make them harder to talk to.

, Most likely this will be essential.


When asking questions, be sure not to get too personal, as this will cause the shy person to feel uncomfortable, and may make you seem nosy. A good question would be ""Did you hear it was supposed to rain today"" or ""Did you understand the math homework?""
When talking, be sure to not make eye contact. This can seem intimidating to most shy people. Unless they make eye contact with you, don't do it back.

, This will help you to avoid creating tension and helps the person feel safe. Talk in a light voice, but make sure to talk loudly enough so that you can be heard clearly.


When talking to a shy person, make sure to never draw attention to their shyness. Most people would take this as an insult, especially if they don't know you well. Questions like 'Why are you so shy?"" or ""Speak up!"" will only make them draw farther away from you.

, After a couple of weeks, or whenever you feel they are ready, you can ask for their phone number.

, This can be a good way to bond. Be careful to make sure that the name is not offensive though. A name such as ""Em"" for a girl named Emily, would be suitable. Do not overuse the nickname; that could begin to be annoying, especially if they aren't as fond of it as you are.

, Bonding with a shy person could take from just a few days, to even a few months, depending on how shy the person is. Never rush anything, and never make it seem like a ""Project."" If the person finds out, most likely they will be hurt

, Find ways to help your shy friend meet other people or get out and do things together.


Once you feel you have a good relationship with the person, try introducing some of your close friends. Only do this when you are both good friends though, for if this is done too soon, the person will likely feel very uncomfortable.
Asking to do things outside of the place you met in, whether it be work, school, art class etc is a big step. This could either strengthen your bond or break it. Make sure that your relationship is strong enough. Asking the person before they are ready could make them feel helpless and uncomfortable

Create a better look for yourself.,
Bring out your talent.,
Try to get closer to his friend circle.,
Ask a random casual question.,
Accidentally bump into each other.",How to Become Friends with a Guy That Doesn't Know You Exist," A solid personality never goes unnoticed! Concentrate on yourself first, dress better, and create a look that suits you best. For example, if you have pretty eyes, use an eyeshadow/eyeliner/mascara to highlight your eyes. Wear proper fitted clothes, use make up that enhances your features, accessories that compliment your attire. The look you carry speaks even before you actually speak. Make sure your skin looks nice and fresh. Also it is important to have a good haircut & hairstyle that suits your face. Once you look good, people will start noticing you and by people, that special guy too.;
, Every person is blessed with some talent or skills. Participate in competitions and events that highlight your talent. For example, if you like to sketch or paint or take pictures, take part in art festivals. Once you bring out what's stored inside you people will start noticing and thereby appreciating you. You'll draw attention towards yourself and that will not just help you in getting spotted but it will also make you look appealing.

, There are more chances of not just getting noticed but also getting acquainted when you have common friends. Find out who his friends are (that does not mean stalking him!) and try to reach his friend circle somehow so that whenever there is a party or any event, he can come across you. This will create more opportunities for you to be seen by him. There's also a chance that someone introduces the two of you and then you can proceed getting to know each other.

, Whether you are in college or you work with him or he's your neighbour or you take just take a class together, you can cross ways and ask a random question like 'do you know where Prof. XYZ is taking the Arts class today?' or 'which way is the conference room?' or 'is there a shopping arcade nearby where I could get good carpets?' or 'what time is it?' etc. etc.. Just make sure that you don’t look or sound as if you had planned for this. Make sure you look your best on that day, make eye contact when you talk to him, look pleasant and seem like you had to ask it to someone and he just seemed to be around…that’s it! Move ahead once he answers (don’t keep smiling looking at his face) and if he recognises you from somewhere and starts talking to you about something, rather anything... Voila! You have his attention now!!

, Well, accidentally for him but planned for you!! Try to notice the places he visits, his likes and dislikes and try to be there. For example, if there is a new movie and you know that he's going to go to watch it on Thursday with his friends, you go for the same show with your friends and try to bump into each other. Now he hopefully remembers you from your last meet so he may begin a conversation. Make sure you don’t give out too much information about yourself and rather point out the likes you two have in common (indirectly). This will create interest and if all works out well, he will himself want to be friends with you then!

Find common interests and do them together.,
Have genuine and vulnerable conversations.,
Compliment her in a non-sexual way.",How to Be Good Friends With a Girl (Guys)1," Sharing activities with the girl will improve your relationship with her.When you have a good time with a girl, she is more likely to remember the experience. Friendships are typically started because two people share a common interest, so it's important that you both share one before becoming better friends.


One way to avoid sending mixed signals is to tell the girl how much the activity costs. By doing this you are setting the tempo for a friendly hang-out and not a date.
You can go to a restaurant to eat, travel to an amusement park, attend another friend’s birthday party, go surfing, join an art class, or do anything else that you both like.
Hanging out inside and watching movies is always an option if there isn’t anything to do.;
, As humans we bond over conversation, especially if the topic of conversation is something that we hold emotionally dear.The more you have conversations about each other’s lives, the more connected you will feel. Being vulnerable means listening to her fears and emotions and being open to talk about yours.


Don’t be critical of her if she comes to you with a problem. The last thing a girl wants to hear is how she did wrong when she already knows she messed up.
Always listen for the girl’s perspective and see where she is coming from before giving your advice.
Asking a girl for advice will open up trust, and she will become more likely to seek you out for her own advice.

, Getting compliments makes us feel good and motivates us to do things.You should always compliment a girl when you admire something she has accomplished or achieved. However, you shouldn't compliment a girl when it comes to her looks, because it can put her in an uncomfortable place if you're just friends. Instead, take cues from the compliments that she gives to you. If she never mentions your physical appearance, it's best to not mention her looks.


Refrain from saying things like “you’re so beautiful,” or other general things about her appearance.

Keep in contact with her.,
Go out with her if she invites you to something.,
Be the emotional support she needs.,
Refrain from being sexual or romantic unless that’s what she wants.",How to Be Good Friends With a Girl (Guys)2," As time goes on it can be harder to maintain strong relationships with a girl, so you might have to put in a more concerted effort to text or call her. If you still live close to one another, make sure you keep her in mind for social events and gatherings. Remembering a friend’s birthday is also another great reason to reach out to her or give her a visit.


If your friend moves to another state, try staying active with her on social media.
If your friend is busy, go to her. Make it convenient for her if you have the extra time. She will appreciate it down the road.

, The more you accept social invitations, the more likely girls will invite you to future events. This is especially important if the girl is attending an event she doesn’t want to go to, and needs a friend to support her.


If you are busy or have something else to do and can't attend, make sure to tell your friend far enough in advance so she can find someone else to go with.
If you don’t want to go to something, don’t go. Your negative energy will probably make interactions between you and her worse than she would normally be.

, Many people go through different ups and downs, and most people need friends to act as emotional support during the rough times.Being a good friend also means knowing when to back off and allow someone to grieve. Make sure not to be overbearing.
Emotional support is also necessary for stressful but happy times, like before a performance or sporting event.

, One of the easiest ways to destroy a friendship with the opposite sex is to be overtly sexual or romantic when it is not wanted. Not only does it make the girl feel uncomfortable, it might actually also make her sad because she cares about you as a friend, but not in a romantic way. A friendship can eventually blossom into a romantic relationship, but it only occurs when both people want it.


If you develop romantic feelings for your friend, you should tell her. Be wary however, it may hurt your friendship in the long run.
If your friend wants to be romantic with you, and you are okay with that, go for it. The best relationships are built off friendships.

Attend social gatherings that girls are going to.,
Introduce yourself to girls who you'd want to be friends with.,
Determine what you share in common and talk about it.,
Get her contact information.,
Text her to hang out.",How to Be Good Friends With a Girl (Guys)3," Try to attend social gatherings where there are girls that you’d want to be friends with. Be on the lookout for popular events going on in your city or town, and be ready to go to her. If you can, try taking a course that interests you like a community art class, or join an intramural sports club. Meeting new people is easy, you just need to put yourself in a situation that allows you to be around them.


If there is a limited opportunity to be social, try to get creative. You can meet girls at the grocery store, your place of worship, the gym, or at a shopping mall.
If you are in school you have the perfect opportunity to meet new girls from your class. Go up to her before or after the class starts.

, Tell the girl your name, and ask her what her name is. Start small-talk by talking about what you are both doing, or where you both are at the time.


If you are anxious about approaching new people, the only way to feel less nervous is to just do it. The worst thing that can happen is that she might not want to talk to you.
Good questions include, “this place is really fun, do you like it?” or “that lecture was really boring, what do you think of the class?”
Try coming off as confident but not pushy. Just talk to the girl as if you were talking to a good male friend, but more polite.

, There’s a good chance that the girl you want to be friends with shares something in common with you, because you are both at the same social gathering. For instance, if you are meeting girls at a sports club, you’ll most likely share an interest in sports or if you’re at an art class an interest in art, etc. Try to find a common bond, and something you are knowledgeable about and that you like to talk about.


Try to be funny and lighthearted when you are talking to a girl. If you can make her laugh, it'll be more likely she will want to be your friend.Be a good listener and let her talk. The more you ask questions, the more she will open up and feel comfortable. You should be responding and stating your opinion, but you should also be concentrated on being a good listener.

, Once you feel like you and the girl you’ve met have had a good conversation, make sure to get her cell-phone number. Don't be afraid of asking her for it, especially if the conversation went well. Tell her that you had fun talking, and ask her if she wants to talk again. If she does, then get her information.


If the conversation went poorly, there’s a good chance she won’t want to give you her number.
If you're unsure of when you are leaving, you can even ask before the conversation ends.

, Determine something that you can both do, and ask her if she wants to meet up with you. This could be lunch, rock climbing, or going to see a band. If you’re having problems about thinking of something to do, try to remember what you’ve talked about previously, and choose something that interests you both. Don't make the hang out romantic and don't flirt in your texts or you might send off the wrong signals. You can even go as far as to tell her that you're not looking to date right now.


Don’t text her too many times if she isn't responding. She may be busy or may just not want to talk. You don’t want to look desperate for friends, and you also don’t want to make her angry or annoyed.
Funny or interesting images are also good things you can share via text.
Try to be as nice as possible in your texts. Since she can’t hear your voice intonation, you don’t want to be sarcastic because she may take it literally.If the girl is texting you a lot, then you should text back. Try to figure out how much she likes texting, and then try to match that energy.

Say hello.,
Be ready to listen.,
Keep a positive attitude.,
Talk to strangers daily.",How to Become Friends With a Stranger1," The quickest and surest way to befriend someone you don’t know is to simply say hello. Approach a stranger that has caught your attention and say something along the lines of, “Hey, how’s the day going so far?” This alone can get a friendly conversation going. It will likely work best in a environments where social interaction is commonly expected.Most public places are usually fair game to approach someone and say hello. That said, be respectful. Avoid interrupting what looks to be a family meal, and don't bother someone who seems to be focused on work at the library.
In some contexts, it may be best to first increase your proximity to those you’re interested. For instance, join a group conversation and listen in on an ongoing conversation. This will give you the opportunity to jump in and introduce yourself.
Be sure to introduce yourself and ask for names. A quick, “Hey, I’m Derek, what’s your name?” is usually sufficient. Save your elevator pitch for networking events. You’re not going to make friends by telling everyone your business aspirations before allowing them to speak.;
, Often, people reach out to one another because they assume or hope that there will be a particular outcome. It can be challenging to keep our assumptions about someone from affecting how you interact with them. To help, focus on listening closely to people you’ve just met, as this will help you get an accurate perspective on who they are quickly.You’re more likely to find yourself in a budding friendship if you spend more time listening to someone than waiting for them to fulfill your assumptions about them.

, If you run into someone that does not warmly receive a friendly “Hello,” don’t let this wreck your day. Remind yourself that most people are excited when someone breaks the ice. In short, don’t get jaded by someone who is terminally antisocial.


When someone turns a cold shoulder to your attempts to start a conversation, note that whatever reason they have for doing so has nothing to do with you. They don’t know you, and they may have just missed their chance. Reach out to someone else instead., Plenty of people are hesitant, if not fearful, of introducing themselves to strangers. The best way to get over this shyness is to ignore it. While it may feel awkward, fight through your resistance and make a point of introducing yourself to someone you don’t know every day.This may be easier in places where you are comfortable. For instance, introduce yourself to someone in your apartment building or at the gym you go to. You already have something to ask about, such as, “Hey, which floor do you live on?” or “What routine did you start with to build biceps like that!?”
Worst case scenario: someone isn’t interested in talking, and you leave them alone. You can handle that.

"
"
Say something about your surroundings.,
Ask good questions.,
Do your research.,
Find common ground.,
Get them laughing.",How to Become Friends With a Stranger2," A great way to start a conversation with someone while you are out in public is to note something interesting about your surroundings. For example, if you are sitting outside at a coffee shop, then you might mention the nice weather. Or, you could comment on how much you like the place and ask the person if he or she comes here often.


You might also try complimenting the person. For example, you could mention that you like the person’s outfit and ask where they got it.
If the person has a child or a dog, then this is also a great built-in conversation starter. For example, you might say something like, “Aww, she’s so cute! How old is she?”

, Get someone to start opening up by asking a question that lets them talk about how they see the world. For instance, ask about how they wound up doing whatever caught your eye. When you see someone doing something interesting, ask “Where’d you get that idea?” Similarly, if someone says something interesting, ask them, “How’d you arrive at that perspective?”People enjoy feeling as though they are interesting or insightful. Ask questions that imply that you feel this way about the, and you’ll readily have their attention.
Feel free to ask general questions as well. Perhaps the best question of all: “What do you care most about?” They’ll be able to respond with something about a topic you know they’re interested in speaking about.
Another great option: “What’s the next thing you’re looking forward to?” This will get someone thinking positively about something they enjoy, which is a great way to start a conversation, let alone a friendship.

, Maybe you have a particular stranger or partial-stranger in mind. This makes it even easier to reach out and offer your friendship. Think about what you know about this person, including what they’re interested in. Read up on anything in the news with relevance to their interests or profession, and ask them about it next time you see them.For instance, “Hey, Jerry, you’re the new guy from corporate, right? Did you see that great Breitbart piece on staff restructuring?” Knowing a bit about a stranger may help you get your foot in the doorway to friendship.

, Mention the things you're especially interested in, as well as other conversational topics that might interest both of you. One easy way to do this is by casually mentioning where you're from, or somewhere you visited. For instance, ""Yeah! Back when I lived in Michigan, I used to really enjoy that sort of thing."" Or ask, ""Have you ever been to Bermuda? That seems to be catching on down there.""


Include references to places you've been or people and ideas that appeal to you in the course of the conversation. This gives your conversation partner plenty of options in terms of their response.

, Crack a joke. It doesn’t have to be a good joke. In fact, a bad joke may make an even better conversation starter, and will often remove awkwardness very quickly. Puns are great go-to type of joke. For instance, if you and a stranger are near a Mexican restaurant, break the social barriers between you with something like “Have you been there? Their food is spec-taco-ular.” You’re one smirk away from a friendship.Seriously, don’t stress about the quality of your jokes. If someone doesn’t respond positively to a friendly attempt at humor, do you really want to befriend them after all?

Get contact info.,
Treat them like your friend right off the bat.,
State what you believe.,
Take a photo together.,
Forget your phone.",How to Become Friends With a Stranger3," If you are having fun talking with someone, then it might be a good idea to exchange contact information. This will allow you to text or call the person so that you can meet up again sometime.


Try saying something like, “I have to go, but I have had so much fun chatting with you. Would you like to exchange cell numbers so we can get together again sometime?”

, People tend to open up only with their close friends. Amp up your familiarity with another by being the first to broach personal conversational topics. Open, honest communication is an indication of affection, admiration, trust, and respect. In fact, when you speak with someone about how you really feel you’re indicating that you value their advice and companionship.Do so naturally, by asking questions like “How do you feel about that?” or offering your personal thoughts on something that comes up.

, Be willing to talk about things that are meaningful to you. This includes your “feelings” as well as your opinions, including your perspectives on controversial issues. Don’t clam up because others may not agree.You may wind up finding that another feels similarly and can supplement your perspective. Alternatively, you may wind up in a spirited but mutually beneficial debate. How else will we begin to change one another’s’ minds aside from speaking with them about what we may see differently?

, It’s great to have a reason to reach back out to someone you’ve just met. Photos are some of the best ways to do this. They help break down a barrier between you by offering a chance to pause and record a moment together, even if only on the street or in passing. Further, taking the photo on your phone offers the perfect excuse to ask for someone’s information.Say something along the lines of, “Hey, where can I send this photo?” Either do so immediately so they have your information too, or wait a few days and send it along with a message such as, “Great to meet you the other day! Hope to run into you again soon.”

, Aside from a particular reason, such as taking a photo or watching a video together, leave your phone out of sight. There’s nothing quite as antisocial as working your thumbs nonstop and staring at your phone while having a conversation with someone. Too much phone action sends a message that you’re not that interested, and can readily prevent a budding friendship from blossoming."
"
Include your friend’s kids in outings with your friend.,
Be willing to talk about kids.,
Talk about other things.,
Schedule adult time.,
Be flexible and understanding.,
Don't criticize your friend's parenting.,
Be positive about your decision not to have kids.",How to Be Friends with Someone Who Has Kids when You Don't1," It can sometimes be difficult for people with kids to find someone to watch their kids. If this often happens with your friend, then you might suggest meeting up somewhere that is child-friendly.


For example, you could suggest meeting up at a local park. The kids can play while you and your friend can catch up. Or, find a kid-friendly event, such as a concert or festival, and ask your friend if they would like to come with you and bring along the kids.
Even picking a restaurant that has activities for kids can be helpful. For example, you could arrange to meet your friend at a restaurant that has a playground or that provides coloring books and crayons for kids.;
, From the outset, it will be important for you to understand that for most parents, parenting will be their primary non-work activity. So, it is only natural that your friend will want to talk to you about their children.This may not always be interesting to you, especially if you don't particularly like kids. The details of finding a daycare or the cute thing the kids did last week may not be too exciting. If this person is a good friend though, you'll need to try to take an interest.
Even if you don't find children interesting, hopefully you care enough about your friend to take an interest in his or her life, with all its new challenges and experiences.

, While it is understandable that your friend will want to talk about his or her children, don't allow this to dominate every conversation. Talk about other interests and happenings in both your lives.Focusing entirely on the kids doesn't allow you to share much in the conversation. Discuss other topics you can talk more about and that are important to you.
Parents can become so focused on their kids that they forget to talk about other topics, but the do have other interests as well, even if they don't have as much time to purse them as they did before having children. Give your friend an opportunity to talk about other topics.
Many parents will be grateful for an opportunity to have a conversation with another adult that doesn't revolve around their kids.There's no need to tell your friend you want to talk about something else. Just look for a natural place to bring up a different topic. If your friend likes baseball, for example, and has just told you about his or her son's recent soccer game, you could say, ""speaking of sports, have had any time to follow the Cardinals this season? They're really doing well!""

, Find time to hang out with your friend without the kids present, doing grownup things. Invite your friend out of for a drink or a grownup movie, or to some other activity you both enjoy.Recognize that you may need to schedule kid-free time weeks or even months in advance, and that it will probably be limited. Even so, to have a healthy friendship, you'll need to find some time together when you can have real conversations and do things you both enjoy
Even if you don't think he or she will be able to attend, continue inviting your friend to adult social functions. It will help him or her keep in touch with who they are outside of parenting., Children often make it difficult to connect with other people. They get sick, or babysitters don't show up, leading to canceled plans. Kids need naps at specific times, making it harder to make plans in the first place. Be understanding of these difficulties, and do your best to be accommodating.Try not to be hurt or offended if you friend isn't available for social functions he or she used to participate in, or if your friend has to cancel plans abruptly.
Find out when your friend's children take naps. These can be good times to give them a call on the phone to catch up.

, As a rule of thumb, unless your friend asks for your opinion on a parenting situation, offering criticism isn't a good idea. Your friend is under enough stress as it is, and there's a good chance you don't fully understand the situation anyway.Many parents will be offended when people criticize their parenting decisions. Unless you see something happening that creates a genuine danger for the child, you're probably best to keep any criticisms to yourself.

, Although their intentions may be good, many parents say things to their childless friends that make them feel guilty about not having kids (yet) themselves. Remember that you have to make the choice that is best for yourself. You get to decide when you are ready to have kids, or if you want to at all.Comments like ""you'll change your mind someday"" or ""you don't know what real love is until you have children"" can be hurtful and insulting. If your friend says things like this often, it is ok to tell him or her that it bothers you.
No one gets to tell you when (or if) it's the right time for you to have kids. By waiting until you are ready (or not having kids at all, if you don't want them), you are making a responsible, adult decision, whatever anyone else might say.

Ask your friend about her discipline preferences.,
Spend time with your friend's children.,
Don't talk down to them.,
Don't try too hard to be cool.",How to Be Friends with Someone Who Has Kids when You Don't2," Some people prefer to discipline their children themselves, while others might be okay with a close friend or relative correcting their children now and then. Ask your friend what they prefer.


For example, you might say something like, “Your kids are really well-behaved, but I just want to ask you about something. If any disciplinary issues arise when you and your kids come to visit, would you prefer to handle it on your own or do you want me to say something when I feel that it is warranted?”
Keep in mind that even correcting your friend’s kids in minor ways may rub them the wrong way, so if you are unsure or uncomfortable asking, then it is best to leave the disciplining to your friend.

, When your friends have children, those children become a central part of their lives. If you want to have a deep connection with this friend, it will help for you to be involved in this part of his or her life.


Accept invitations to events with the child, like birthday parties or trips to the amusement park. You don't need to accept these every time, but take part sometimes. Let your friend know you want to be invited to these types of activities.If you feel comfortable doing so, offer to babysit from time to time.This will give you a chance to connect with your friend's children, and will also give your friends some freedom to do other things the kids can't be involved in.
If your friend tells you about something he or she had hoped to do, but is unable because of a lack of childcare, just let him or her know you'd be willing to give it a try!

, Childless people often make the mistake of talking down to children or ignoring them when they try to contribute to adult conversations.This is frustrating to both the child and the parent.


Acknowledge your friend's kids and respect their efforts to contribute to conversations, even if they seem silly.
Remember that kids learn by asking questions. These interjections into adult conversation can be trying at times, but they are a part of how children develop an understanding of the world.

, Don't try too hard to get the attention of your friend's kids or be the ""cool uncle/aunt."" While you don't want to ignore the children, it's often a good idea to let them come to you.Some children are anxious or fearful of people they don't know well. Your attempts at cuddling or playing with them may have the opposite affect to what you intended.

Take the child's perspective.,
Put valuables away.,
Minimize safety hazards.,
Communicate about your concerns and house rules.,
Have activities on hand.",How to Be Friends with Someone Who Has Kids when You Don't3," If you have a good friend who has children, chances are good that at some point they will bring their children to your home. Before they arrive, go through your home and imagine you are a child of that size and age. What would interest you? What would be in reach?Get your eye level down to where the kid's will be. Get on your hands and knees if you have to, so you can see what objects will be most obvious in the child's field of vision and what his or her little arms will be able to reach. Any time it's something you don't want a kid playing with, move it somewhere else.

, ANYTHING in your home that is valuable to you, whether monetary, sentimental, or just functional should be moved out of sight and out of reach.Hide TV remotes, or the kids will. Make sure you collection of priceless records/comic books/souvenir plates/antique toys is nowhere in sight.
Understand that anything you leave out may be played with, drooled on, or worse.

, In a childless adult's home, there can be many dangers for a small child. Do what you can to make your home safe for visiting kids. Depending on the age of the child, this could include:Covering electrical sockets.
Putting up baby gates.
Securing cupboards or moving potentially hazardous items to higher storage.
Locking doors to certain rooms.
Covering sharp furniture corners.
Most importantly: if you own firearms, make sure they are out of reach, secured and unloaded., Let your friend know before the kids arrive if there are specific concerns you have or specific rules in your home. Especially if the kids are older, this gives your friend a chance to talk to them in advance, and lets him or her know what to keep an eye out for.For example, if you have a pet that is skittish or fearful of kids, let the parent know. If there are areas of your home that will be off limits to the visiting child, pass this information along as well.

, Often, a busy child is a happy one. Hopefully, your friend will bring toys and other activities to keep his or her kid busy and content, but it can't hurt to have some options on-hand yourself.Before the child arrives, consider buying some kid-friendly movies, games, or music.
Especially if the child will be visiting often, purchasing a few toys or children's book to have on hand is a good idea too.
Make sure that you have some outdoor activities available too, such as hula hoops, jump ropes, soccer balls, or other kid-friendly outdoor toys and games.

Play with them.,
Keep in mind that provision is based on needs, not wants.,
Meet in groups.,
Say what you mean and mean what you say.,
Avoid using violence as a control method.,
Be genuine.,
Know what type of punishment to deal out.,
Appreciate the children when they do well just like you punish them when they go wrong.",How to Be a Friend to Children," Start with regular play, such as building Lego cities or playing with blocks- anything you are certain they will enjoy. They will learn to appreciate you and a connection will start to form if you interact with them on their level. No matter how little time you have at home, try as much as possible to find time for these activities.;
, Provide what you can afford and let them know your limits. It is always good to provide things like clothing and food for a child or children that you see daily. Being kind teaches them that humanity is about kindness and helping each other.


Make known to the child(ren) that you work hard to provide these things. Discuss this during outings, jogging or strolls. Let them know why you provide for them and attach some to the fact that they, in turn, need to give you compensation for it in the form of good behavior or performance in school. Discuss this openly and give them what is necessary in terms of their field of study or talents, their specific needs and the like.
Don’t be a harsh and demanding person. You will scare them away and you become a person who is feared but not respected. A person who provides and guides kids gain lot of respect and love. You also may help an orphan and showed them love that they wish in their lives.

, Conduct meetings where every child is allowed to state what they want to be in life. In response, give them some form of guide or advice. Allow each child to say what hurts them and engage them in basic discussions based on age and sense of reasoning. Let them provide important things that will contribute to their dreams and future career. Be a guide and not a ruler. It is at this time that you can even shape their dreams and make them see and value team work and team ties.

, As a role model, try to be just and right. Make the child(ren) know the difference between ""yes"" and ""no"". Try to be fair, open and clear whenever you make a decision. Be calm but straightforward.


When you make a decision and you want to change your mind later, there should be a sound reason that is seen and considered as valid. Do not say what you cannot do or what seem impossible. Try to be just and clear in your decisions. Speak as genuinely as you can. Remember that children see more than they can hear.

, It is not a good practice to argue with a spouse or partner in front of any child(ren). Try to be a gentle as you can. Utilize calm conflict-resolution skills. Whenever you feel yourself getting worked up, count to ten and take deep breaths as to not lose your temper. This does not mean you cannot get vexed or annoyed, but try to control your anger. Be a community role model.

, Don’t be a hypocritical person. False promises and unnecessary engagements are not good for children to witness. Children will distrust a father who knows how to promise but does not know how to fulfill. It is good to surprise your kids with necessary gifts and things that can contribute to their growth and development. Don’t use these ties to molest, exploit or abuse the kids. They trust you and at this stage whatever you do will impact their lives greatly.

, Knowing the type of punishment is as important as knowing when to deal it out where and why. Kids should be punished appropriately and justly.


During gatherings and play times, try to lay down rules and punishments to teach them that every society needs law and order. Try to counsel them after the punishment and it should not be more dangerous than the crime committed.
Be a loving and caring person with discipline and tactfulness; even when you punish try to be the same good man or woman. Punishment should be known and make the kid to be part of the rules. Assure them that you love them and you want them to be good in their adult age.

, Tell them those things that are good and those things that seem wrong. Use your culture, the societal values and make them as welcoming as you can. Make them value others and make them know that no person is independent no matter you status. Make them tolerant to other people’s culture and make sure you are not telling them what you are not practicing. Be a role model.
